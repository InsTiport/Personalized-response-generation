D. EVANS/J. Nieminen
  6‑4, 6‑7, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Monday was good.   That was even better, wasn't it?
DANIEL EVANS:   Yeah, definitely.   A bit longer than Monday, eh?   Yeah, that was a good one to come through.

Q.   There were times in that second set where you would have got a break down where you had to dig pretty deep to hang in there. 
DANIEL EVANS:   Yeah, I would say that was probably one of my better points of my game, stick in there and make it difficult even when I'm down.
You know, it was never a thought of packing it in.   I was always going to be there or thereabouts.

Q.   How are the effects from the knock on Monday?
DANIEL EVANS:   Yeah, my knee is sore but only on certain shots.   I mean, I got a bit of strapping on it, as you probably saw.
It was pretty sore, but I'm fine. 

Q.   What's with all the allezes, what the French use? 
DANIEL EVANS:   I used to be coached by a French guy, a Belgian guy.   Just habit now, stuck with me. 

Q.   Do you ever get any sort of a funny reaction from players when you play against them?
DANIEL EVANS:   I think quite a lot of people say different "Come ons" in different languages.   If they're worrying about that, that's pretty sad, isn't it? 

Q.   It was 40 minutes of rain delay for you.   What did you do during that time?
DANIEL EVANS:   Well, I didn't think it was that long actually.   It went quite quick.   It was pretty good.   I didn't know it was 40 minutes. 
I warmed up again.   Well, I took a shower and warmed up again.   Change of clothes.
Spoke a bit with Andy and those guys, and that was it. 

Q.   No sort of tactic... 
DANIEL EVANS:   Just to carry on doing what I was doing.   That was pretty much it.

Q.   You got a qualifying wildcard from Wimbledon.   As you understand it, there's no chance for sort of an airline‑style upgrade?
DANIEL EVANS:   No, that's it.   You know, I'm grateful that I got a wildcard into quallies, to be honest.   All the other guys have to sign in tonight and play quallies, of prequalifying. 
That happened to me last year, so I wasn't expecting a main draw, anyway.   I wasn't inside the criteria, and I think it's good that they're being strong with it, because then there's no gray area.   You're either inside 250 or you're not, especially for the older ones. 
I don't know who got the main draw ones, anyway.   So I think it's good that we have to play quallies to get a chance to earn our way in, you know. 

Q.   The only exception is Kyle got one. 
DANIEL EVANS:   Well, he's on a bit of a different path to me and Wardy, and I'd say it was justified that he got a wildcard.

Q.   Playing Del Potro, now.   He's obviously sort of a height differential?
DANIEL EVANS:   Is there?   (Laughter.)
Q.   What are the dynamics of that for you on the grass court?
DANIEL EVANS:   He's going to have to go down from pretty high to low, isn't he, if I slice that much.   He probably won't play as much slice as much as me. 
I have my own goals tomorrow.   I don't think I need to share them with everybody.   I'm pretty happy with the way I'm playing.   I will just go out there and do what I have to do. 

Q.   You clearly settle in very quickly into playing, doing the Davis Cup and here playing against the top guys.   Do you go into a match with a different sort of mentality when you're playing a top 100 guy to somebody you might be playing in a futures tournament?
DANIEL EVANS:   Not really, because I thought on Monday that I was probably the favorite to win.   You know, I was pretty confident that I was going to win on Monday, so if anything, the pressure is on me. 
I'd say a lot of people thought I was going to win.   He's never stepped on a grass court before.   I'd say the pressure is on me.   I started pretty nervy on Monday. 
Not really.   I mean, I prefer to play someone better where they all hit the ball back than a guy who's playing futures, and then that helps me.   It's just more ‑‑it's a bit more intense, and I don't struggle to lose concentration when I'm playing here.   That's the main thing is I'm not losing concentration.

Q.   The one‑handed backhand is pretty unusual among the younger players these days.   Can you talk about how you developed that and what assets or maybe any drawbacks you see from having one, how it affects your game?
DANIEL EVANS:   Well, I had a two‑handed backhand till I was 13.   It just didn't work, so that was it.   I couldn't hit a left‑handed forehand, so it was single‑handed backhand, wasn't it?   (Laughter.) 
I like the slice, so it worked out.   But obviously ‑‑it is tough when they're going to your backhand all the time.   It's different.   On grass you get away with it.   On clay it's up high and pretty tough. 
I'm sort of telling you how to beat me.   (Laughter.)
Q.   What's the support out there like for you?
DANIEL EVANS:   It was good.   It's not like ‑‑it's really good to play, like I have only played obviously Davis Cup and stuff.   I have never had an away, so in England I have played Wimbledon.
I mean, I think it is good, but I think that's how it should be when a British player plays.   And I think the crowd did real good today.   It does put a little bit of pressure on the other players.   When the British guys play at Wimbledon, I think it's good if the crowd get behind rather than just sit there and just enjoy the match.   You know, they're there to help the British guy at the end of the day. 

Q.   During the rain delay you were talking to Andy and one or two others?
DANIEL EVANS:   It was where we were situated in the locker room.   He was there.   Ivan was there.   Yeah, just talked a bit about the golf, U.S. Open, and back out. 

Q.   Being sort of around those guys like Lendl, does that kind of help you up a bit?
DANIEL EVANS:   Yeah.   It's pretty intimidating, I have to say.   Like I don't know him from ‑‑obviously I know he was an unbelievable tennis player, so I just keep quiet and don't say anything.   (Laughter.) He didn't like my pick much of Sergio Garcia much to win it.

Q.   Who does he go for?
DANIEL EVANS:   He said Stricker was a dark horse and he can't see past Tiger Woods, so I wasn't going to comment on that.
