4-6, 6-3, 6-7, 7-6, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What were your emotions about that match now having had time to reflect?  
DANIEL EVANS: Just a bit of a heartbreaker really, yeah.  I don't really know what to say.  It was a tough one to take.  Probably hurt a bit for a while.  Disappointing how it sort of played out, yeah.   
 Q.  It got away from you a little bit at the start of the fifth.  I was wondering whether you were feeling physically okay or was there a bit of a mental grievance about not having gotten that match point?  How were you feeling?  
DANIEL EVANS: I was physically pretty tired.  Subconsciously, mentally as well I was hurt a bit.  Yeah, just one of those things.  In the fifth set, he's obviously a class opponent.  I sort of knew that was the chance in the fourth set, yeah.   
Yeah, it's just a difficult one really to sort of take.   
 Q.  Could you take us through the apparent disagreement.  Was it with the physio or the umpire?  
DANIEL EVANS: The physio said I had cramp, which I didn't have.  My foot is sore.  I actually asked for the trainer in the middle of the game, and he just wouldn't treat me.  He said he was just going to treat me for the normal timeout.  I didn't want to be treated by him because he was wrong.   
 Q.  At one point in the match I think I heard him say he wasn't happy you shouting, C'mon, with his errors, and at one point, That's your fault.  
DANIEL EVANS: I didn't say anything to him.  I didn't say anything to him.  I didn't know he was unhappy with anything.   
He was unhappy with the people in my box saying, C'mon, a bit too much too closely.  I just told them not to say anything.   
There was nothing between me and him anyway.  I wouldn't get involved with him.  He's obviously won -- I've got much more respect for him to get involved with him personally.   
 Q.  You've had big highs and big lows before.  Obviously it's a low now.  When you look back on this whole week, how good are you at taking those positives and using it to move on?  
DANIEL EVANS: Yeah, a bit difficult.  Listen, I'm thinking about that smash at 8-All to put it away, or 9-All to put it away.   
I don't really know.  I've never been in that situation before, especially against someone as good as him.  Yeah, it's just not easy, is it?  I mean, being that close, I was thinking about winning the match.  Whoever says you don't think about winning the match at that point is full of it, yeah.   
 Q.  Double Grand Slam winner, you obviously had him on the ropes.  That must be encouraging that you can be on par with a guy like that.  
DANIEL EVANS: Not right now it's not.  If I lost that match against any other guy, I'd be saying exactly the same.  You have to take your chances.   
 Q.  You mentioned that smash.  Would that be the one moment in the match that you feel you'll regret?  
DANIEL EVANS: Yeah, I just hit it to the wrong side.  Actually hit it down the middle.  The small things in those matches make big differences.  Why I hit it down the middle -- I never hit the smash ever down the middle.  Is beyond me, so...  Such is life.   
 Q.  I know you have doubles tomorrow.  Are you still planning this holiday in Spain?  
DANIEL EVANS: Yeah, there probably won't be doubles tomorrow.  I'm pretty badly hurt.  I'd say that's squashed probably.   
 Q.  I think you tweeted about losing your passport.  
DANIEL EVANS: I found my passport.   
 Q.  Tell us the nature of the injury.  
DANIEL EVANS: Yeah, it's underneath my foot.  You've probably seen me stamping my foot quite a bit in between games.  I don't know what it is right now.  It's pretty sore.   
So, yeah, it's been like that now for a few weeks.  Yeah, it's been good fun.  Hopefully Nick wins.  It will be a bit easier to tell him.   
 Q.  Is there any question, or are you down for the Davis Cup, do you think?  
DANIEL EVANS: I'm a doubt to get in the squad, yeah.  I'll be at Davis Cup.  I just need some time off, I think.  That's it.  I've had it before.  It's pretty sore in the mornings and in the evenings, sort of later on in the day, it gets pretty sore.   
Yeah, I think taking a bit of time off now would be good physically and mentally.  Yeah, it was difficult to walk off the court tonight without winning.   
 Q.  Whenever Andy suffers a tough five-set loss like this, he invariably comes in and says to us, I've got to physically work harder, up the amount of work I do in the gym, track, wherever.  Are you that sort of bloke?  Do you subscribe to that point of view?  
DANIEL EVANS: I missed the subscription.  No, I didn't lose that match because I wasn't -- I lost that match because I made the wrong decision on the smash.  Obviously in the fifth set against him, yeah, I was tired, but I wouldn't say I was physically tired.  I was more mentally tired in having to go again after all four of the sets being so tight.   
I've never been away this long either.  To come off again losing that, after being in that position, is just something I need to get out of my head pretty quick, you know, get away for a bit.  I think it's a good idea.   
 Q.  What did he say to you at the end?  
DANIEL EVANS: He just said, Good fight, sorry you lost.  That was it.  He's a class act.  That's why he's won so many tournaments and Grand Slams.  I doubt he was that sorry, but...   
 Q.  You said you're looking forward to getting home.  What are you most looking forward to getting back to?  
DANIEL EVANS: Just seeing everyone.  It's been nice to see a few of my friends come.  I missed home.  Yeah, sort of just come to a head tonight if I'm being deadly honest.  When you miss that last ball, I'm ready to go now.
