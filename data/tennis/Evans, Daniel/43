P. MATHIEU/D. Evans   
7-6, 6-7, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  The break points were where it was kind of won and lost, do you think?  
DANIEL EVANS: Yeah, definitely.  I had a lot of chances in all the sets, really.  Just missed opportunity, I think.   
 Q.  How pleased were you with the level of your game?  
DANIEL EVANS: I thought it was a good match.  I think he played pretty well, considering.  I didn't think he played that well on the grass, to be honest.   
Yeah, it was a good match.  I was pleased with how I played, how I competed.  That's pretty much it, really.  It was a tight match and I come on the wrong side.   
 Q.  How frustrating has it been the last couple of days?  You have been on the schedule and not been able to get on.  
DANIEL EVANS: It's more frustrating losing.  I knew I wasn't going to play yesterday.  The weather was just terrible.   
But, no, it's just part of the job, I guess.   
 Q.  Are you in good shape for Wimbledon?  Where do you take it from here between now and then?  
DANIEL EVANS: I'm playing Nottingham next week and, yeah, then Wimbledon.   
 Q.  Do you feel good?  
DANIEL EVANS: Yeah, I feel good.  Obviously I haven't won that many matches, which is why I'm going out every tournament trying hard.   
Yeah, so it would be nice to win some matches next week, but obviously big ones to win some matches at Wimbledon, hopefully.   
 Q.  That's a bit of difficulty when you're in this position now where you're always performing really well in challengers but it's that kind of transition, isn't it?  
DANIEL EVANS: Well, I lost first round, second round of the two challengers in Britain, so not performing that well.   
I don't feel the level was above me today, so I don't -- your question sort of, I'm stepping up, I didn't feel like I was stepping up today.  It was just a 50/50 match I lost.   
 Q.  What's happening after Wimbledon?  You obviously haven't set foot on the clay I don't think this year.  I'm guessing that Davis Cup is a bit of a long shot at this point, isn't it?  
DANIEL EVANS: I haven't even spoke to Leon about that.  Hopefully Andy plays and Kyle plays and then I can go and do my schedule.   
But if I'm asked to play, I'll definitely play.   
 Q.  What is your schedule?  
DANIEL EVANS: I don't really know yet.  I'm entered in Washington, but I don't know the dates and I don't know -- I don't know where that falls with Davis Cup and et cetera, et cetera.  I just know I'm playing there.   
 Q.  How fun was it to win your spot at Wimbledon on ranking?  
DANIEL EVANS: Yeah, it's good.  It's good for the other Brits, I guess.  I mean, an extra wildcard opens up.  I think everyone behind me is doing just as well.   
I think British tennis is on -- everyone is doing well, winning matches in better tournaments than we are used to seeing.  Like Alex Ward, those guys are doing well.  Broads.  It's going to be good, I think.  Sooner or later we'll have more players competing in these tournaments.   
 Q.  Do you feel more confident being inside of the top 100?  Does it make much difference to you one way or the other?  
DANIEL EVANS: No.  It's a good achievement, but still, you know, it's pretty tough to feel confident when you're not winning matches.  (Smiling.)   
You've just got to keep going.  It's been difficult so far on the grass, but, you know, hopefully next week will go a bit better and then just Wimbledon, yeah.   
 Q.  You have obviously been around the challenger level a lot, futures, got yourself up.  Do you really think there are other British players out there capable of doing what you have done?  
DANIEL EVANS: Yeah.  I mean...   
 Q.  I mean, some of the guys we perhaps don't see very often down below 200.  
DANIEL EVANS: Yeah, I mean, Alex Ward is winning matches, beat a fellow in Manchester.  And then Barro (phonetic), they have both been top 100 even, pretty high in top 100.  So two good wins, competes well.  Has got a good game.  You'll see him at Wimbledon.  You know, I think they have definitely got a good chance.   
I think in Britain it was a bit of, you know, when Ketters made it, it sort of opened everyone's eyes a bit that there was a chance.  And then hopefully when I went in everyone else thought, well, there is more of a chance then, hopefully.   
I mean, I think those guys believed I can do it.  So, yeah, win the right match in the right place it can go pretty quick.
