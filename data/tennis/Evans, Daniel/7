D. EVANS/A. Rublev
7-5, 3-6, 6-2
THE MODERATOR:   We have Dan Evans.  Talk about the win today.
DANIEL EVANS:   Yeah, it was a tough match.  Obviously it was very hot.  Didn't serve great.  Just happy to come through.  It was a long bit of a struggle at times.  I'm just happy to have got through.  I played some good tennis in the end.
Q. Can you just talk about what it's been like for you in the bubble.  And were there any considerations that you not come over for this series of tournaments?
DANIEL EVANS:   No, I mean, I was happy with the bubble and am still happy with the bubble.  I think it's been pretty successful so far.  Obviously it's pretty early days.  I think I have been here a week now.  So it's been good for me.
I think, you know, all the players have adhered to what they have had to do.  Obviously a few have been a little unfortunate, but, you know, there was always going to be that side to it, bad luck, as well, and I think everybody is doing a great job in the bubble here and back at the hotel.
Q. You never considered not playing these tournaments?  A lot of guys have stayed in Europe just to concentrate on the French.  Are you worried about the back-to-back of both of those tournaments?
DANIEL EVANS:   No, I was always going to come as long as I felt like it was safe.  And I do feel it's safe.  Yeah, I must say the testing has been very organized.  You know, it's come through via text, e-mail when we must be tested.
I think it's been great.  Hats off to the people who have been organizing it.
Q. Obviously your last ATP tournament you beat Rublev and then you beat him today.  In a way, is it sort of strangely satisfying that that sort of assures your level is the same, you have beaten the same player?
DANIEL EVANS:   I mean, you have reminded me that, yeah, obviously I beat him in Dubai.  I didn't think about it, to be honest.  I knew it was a tough match.  You know, he's very good.  He's aggressive.  I knew what I had to do today.
It was a little strange obviously getting back out on the court to play.  It's obviously been a long time since we all got back to our jobs and played.
It was a little strange at times, but it was nice to be out there and get the feeling back a bit, you know, back on the tour.
Q. And what do you think of playing Milos Raonic next?
DANIEL EVANS:   Yeah, it's going to be a difficult match.  You know, obviously he serves great.  He's aggressive.  Probably serve/volley a lot.
It's a difficult match.  None of the matches here are easy, are they?  You just need to look down the draw.  There are so many good matches.
I'm happy to have come through today and then get ready for tomorrow.
Q. How would you describe the level of tennis that you're playing at the moment?  How advantageous was those Battle of Brits events?  Gave you quite a high level of competitive action before flying to the United States.
DANIEL EVANS:   Yeah, I mean, I just didn't serve very well today.  That was the only thing I can criticize myself on, really.  Everything else pretty good.
Get another chance tomorrow to go after it and hopefully serve better.  I'll need to serve better.
And, yeah, obviously the Battle of the Brits was a great event.  You know, I loved it.  It was such a well-organized event, such a competitive event.
And, yeah, it's obviously stood the Brits in good stead.  Obviously we have had a few losses this week, but I think everyone is playing well, match-fit, and hopefully we can get a good run in the slam next week.
Q. You had an incredible rise in 2019 before lockdown started.  How do you assess your form?  Do you think you're getting back to that same level?  Do you think with matches and more practice you can get back to the Dan Evans we saw of 2019?
DANIEL EVANS:   I mean, I think -- I just think I'm playing pretty good tennis, you know.  I don't think I need to get to any sort of form or not.
I mean, I think I'm playing as good I have played.  You know, I'm hitting the ball great, moving great, I feel strong.  So I don't think I need to be looking to go back to any sort of form.
I think, you know, the form, it is what it is, isn't it?  I mean, should be happy with how I did today.  I think that's one of the best matches I have probably played, and to come through with not really a serve and just my second serve getting me out of trouble, I thought I deserve to be proud of that.  That's probably one of the better wins I have had on the tour.
Q. That was your sixth top 20 win this year.  Do you think that's where you're at now, that you can push on to be a top-10 player?
DANIEL EVANS:   I mean, you guys know me well enough that I'm not going to sit here and say I've got a chance of doing that.
Listen, if you keep beating those players, you give yourself a good chance.  I don't look at the rankings to be going up them.  You know, I look week by week, match by match.
You know, it's an incredibly hard match today.  I don't even look at his ranking.  I just know Rublev is a tough match, and so is Raonic.  I don't think, If I win this match, I've got another big chance.
The tour is very difficult.  And listen, obviously I'd love to get further up the rankings, but there are so many obstacles in the way daily you don't have time to look at that stuff.
