S. STEPHENS/B. Zahlavova Strycova
  7‑5, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   What did you think about your performance today?
SLOANE STEPHENS:   I thought it was good.   I played pretty solid so I was happy to get the win.

Q.   Looked like the wind was blowing a little bit.   Did that affect you in any way?
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Yeah, I mean, yesterday it was a lot windier, but today was fine.   It was okay.   Obviously it's windy for both of us.   Obviously you have to go with it and just play your best. 

Q.   You have played well here in recent years.   What do you seem to like about playing here?
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Just obviously the US Open Series is, you know, really good for an American.   There's really good support at these tournaments. 
So Cincinnati has always been good to me and I have always had a lot of fun here, so I always like coming back here.

Q.   Do you feel you're playing good with Thomas so far?
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Just trying to get better and improve my game.

Q.   What are some of the things he's been telling you to work on or practice?
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Play my game (smiling). 

Q.   If you had a ticket to watch today on the grounds, like as a fan, what match or matches would you want to watch?
SLOANE STEPHENS:   I would want to see Serena and Stosur.   I heard that was a battle.   But I obviously missed the match.   I haven't really seen the schedule, but I heard that was a good match.

Q.   I know Kim Clijsters was your idol growing up, but did the Williams sisters have any influence on you coming up as a junior player?
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Yeah, of course.   The Williams sisters influence everyone.   They are two of the greatest players to ever play the game of tennis.   So obviously, of course.   They are both great players.   It's great that they are still playing.

Q.   When did you remember first seeing them or being conscious of them?
SLOANE STEPHENS:   I don't remember the first time I ever saw them. 

Q.   Don't remember a first match on TV or anything like that?
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Venus was playing Lindsay Davenport in the finals of Wimbledon.   What year, I have no idea.

Q.   2005?
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Beats me.   That was the first time I ever saw Venus, I think. 

Q.   Who do you look up to as far as being a role model?   Somebody else who is a great role model, as opposed to a famous player?   Who do you follow?
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Everyone wants to be like Roger Federer.   I mean, I think he's a great role model.   If I say there is one guy that's perfect, I'd say that Roger is probably it. 

Q.   What's the best practical advice you've ever gotten as a tennis player?
SLOANE STEPHENS:   I don't know.   Ask me tomorrow.   I'll tweet you something.   I don't know.

Q.   Are you more inclined to watch women's or men's matches?   Just leisure.   Doesn't matter. 
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Just whatever is on TV.   I mean, obviously at a tournament you're pretty much watching tennis on TV all the time.   It's pretty much whatever is on. 
Depends on whatever country you're in, because if you're in Italy they are only playing Italians; if you're in the U.S., they're only playing Americas. 
It just depends.
