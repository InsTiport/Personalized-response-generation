THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Have you ever saved that many set points in a set?  Seemed like 10 or 11 or 12 set points.
SLOANE STEPHENS: I don't know.  I don't think so.  Super happy to be through.  Obviously was a tough match against a tough opponent.
Q. You must feel good about the way you bounced back from the first set, toughed it out.
SLOANE STEPHENS: Yeah, definitely.  It was quite devastating.  It was good to be able to fight back, keep playing, be able to keep myself going.
Q. Quite a bit jump in conditions from Wuhan to here.  Much colder.
SLOANE STEPHENS: It's a bit cold.
Q. Any impact on you?
SLOANE STEPHENS: Yeah, because it doesn't quite often happen for back-to-back tournaments.  During the day, it's been nice.  Yeah, it's kind of strange, but everyone has the same conditions, so it's fine.
Q. Hope this isn't an annoying question.  Obviously at this stage of the season, every match counts in terms of WTA Finals.  Something on your mind at all?
SLOANE STEPHENS: Yeah, but one at a time though.  Too stressful to think about it.  Take it one at a time and see what happens.
