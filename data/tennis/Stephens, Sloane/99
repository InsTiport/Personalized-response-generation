THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How was it out there today?  
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Good.   It was fun.   Obviously it was tough, I was playing an American.   But it was good.   It was fun.  
   
 Q.   Are you feeling comfortable on the grass?  
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Yeah.   It's been good.   
I have been playing well.   Like I started off well last week and I got a pretty good groove.   Yeah, I'm feeling good.   My shots are going in, so that's good.  
   
 Q.   How much more comfortable do you feel like on this surface versus like the clay?  
SLOANE STEPHENS:   I mean, grass is always tough, but it's tough for everybody.   I mean, you kind of just gotta get out there and do the best you can.  
   
 Q.   How are you feeling?   Everything seem to be going this way this year (Pointing upward)?  
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Yeah, definitely.   Just having fun out there.   
I mean, my coaching situation is good, and I'm just happy to be out on the court and playing and competing.  
   
 Q.   Talk about that a bit.   It's like going home almost?  
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Yeah, definitely.   It's where I grew up playing.   It's always nice to go back to where you first started.   I think for Nick and I, it's been really nice to be together again and we have a good relationship.   It's worked out well so far.  
   
 Q.   How has it changed?   You're not a child anymore, so...   
SLOANE STEPHENS:   It hasn't changed at all.   He still treats me like I'm his child.   I wish you could see some of the times (smiling).   
Nothing's changed a bit.   
   
 Q.   Bethanie and Coco had big upsets today.   I don't know if you're following at all.   
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Yeah, I saw that they both played really well today.   It's good for American tennis.
