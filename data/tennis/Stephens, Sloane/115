S. STEPHENS/A. Riske
  7‑6, 2‑6, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   So, good match.   Good grass match for you.   You played very well out there.   What were your thoughts after three sets?
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Yeah, I thought I played a pretty solid match.   Obviously Ali is a great grass court player, so it was tough.
But I was happy that I was able to pull through the third set and play a really solid one.

Q.   I think in the past you've always gone home between the French and Wimbledon, right?   You didn't play the full season. 
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Uh‑huh. 

Q.   So talk about the decision to stay overseas for such a long time.
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Well, I mean, it was kind of‑‑ I'd have to do it sometime, so I guess now is as good a time as ever.
It hasn't been bad.   I mean, it's not that brutal.   It's okay.   And obviously being somewhere where they speak English fully everywhere, that's a great thing.
So it's not bad at all. 

Q.   After your first match you said that you felt you were moving okay.   Has the grass dried out now?   Are you moving a lot better?
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Yeah, I think this morning the grass was still a little bit wet when we got on, so it was ‑‑ I don't know what happened.   It just seemed like it was a little wet and it was really slick like in the back.
So it was tough to kind of move around, but in the end ‑‑ I mean, obviously the sun was out and we played for an hour and a half and it was fine.

Q.   Yeah, because at times you looked a little more careful towards the back of the court. 
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Yeah, it was really wet in the back. 

Q.   You seem really sleepy. 
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Right now I am sleepy.   I need a nap.   I've been going to bed so late for some reason.   I don't know why.   Like at 5:00 I'm exhausted, and I like push through, and get my second wind at 11:30.   I'm like, Why?   Like it's horrible.
But I don't know.   They have ‑‑ like at the hotel NCIS marathons all day long.   So that's like all I'm ‑‑ and it's episodes I've seen five times.   I'm just like, Why is this so interesting right now?   Like, it's weird. 

Q.   Who is your favorite NCIS character? 
SLOANE STEPHENS:   I don't know, the one that died Ziva?   Not, Ziva, the one that was before her.   Was her name Catherine? 

Q.   Caitlin. 
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Yeah, I really like her, but I really liked Ziva.   I like that character.   She was will replacement for her, right? 

Q.   Yeah. 
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Yeah.   So I like Ziva. 

Q.   You're the youngest person I've ever met that watches that show.   It's all people over 60. 
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Really?   They watch NCIS? 

Q.   Yeah, like my parents watch it. 
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Well they have NCIS L.A.   That's for young people, because like LL Cool J is in it and that other hot young blond guy.   I don't know his name. 
It's a good show.   It's good to watch‑‑ like especially when you're here, it's good to watch something that you know will keep going so you can watch 25 episodes of it on your computer and it's still going. 

Q.   It's been an NCIS education.   Thank you.   We are all waiting for you to reach a final.   Could it be here?
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Keep waiting.   Could be.   Who knows.   Who knows.

Q.   Do you feel you're playing well enough it's a possibility?
SLOANE STEPHENS:   I mean, I've never been in a final so I don't know what have to do to get to a final.   I mean, I couldn't tell you.

Q.   Can't be so different to the juniors. 
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Yeah, I mean, it shouldn't be that difficult, but it's obviously clearly been very hard for me.   I'm working on it.   I'm trying my best.
Yeah, I'll let you know when I get there. 

Q.   I'm afraid I need to ask you about the World Cup.   Will you be following the USA?
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Yeah, of course.   They play on Monday.   One of my friends is on the team.   That's probably the on reason I'll be watching. 
I don't know anything about the other teams.

Q.   Who is your friend?
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Jozy Altidore.   Yeah, he'll probably be the only reason I'm watching.   And then the other times it's just ‑‑ I don't know why people like it so much.   It's just so much running, and like it's aggressive.   I don't know. 
Like red card, yellow card, all that stuff.   It's too much.   But I have a question.   In the World Cup, if get a red card, do you have to skip the next game? 

Q.   Yeah, or next two games. 
SLOANE STEPHENS:   How many games do you have to win to win the World Cup, like how many matches?   Like seven matches? 

Q.   Yeah, seven.
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Yeah, so it's like real tournament, like semifinals, like that.   So if you get a red card in the first game then you could play in the quarterfinals potentially? 

Q.   Yes. 
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Okay, I got it.   That makes sense. 

Q.   I don't think the USA need to worry about that. 
SLOANE STEPHENS:   I mean, hopefully they get our of their group, but, hey, you shouldn't be talking because your guys' team is not that great.   And especially when it comes down to penalties.   You guy will be in trouble. 

Q.   Hey, I'm Scottish.   We're not even...
SLOANE STEPHENS:   (Laughing.)
Q.I saw you tweeting back and forth with Fabio about your nails.   I didn't know you knew him at all. 
SLOANE STEPHENS:   I just know him because I see him every single week.   Yeah, he's funny.   He's teaching like me Italian words kind of.

Q.   The good ones, or the ones he says on court? 
SLOANE STEPHENS:   No, like good ones.   Because you know how you like see an Italian person, like the first instinct is like, Ciao, Bella.   Like that's the only thing people say because they don't know anything else.
Flavia is always says that to me and she's a girl, so I'm like, Oh, you know.   So that's like the one thing I know.   Then when I saw him I was like, What do you say to a guy?   Is it Ciao, Bello?   And like he was trying to explain it, and I was like, It's too complicated.   I'll just be like, Hey. 

Q.   Your hitting partner is English. 
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Uh‑huh.

Q.   For someone that doesn't know that much about soccer you knew the English thing. 
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Yeah, he told me that.

Q.   So are you guys going to be betting throughout the...
SLOANE STEPHENS:   No.   Betting is useless.   You just lose your money.   Like that's a bad way to lose your money.   Money that you work hard for that you lose.   That doesn't make any sense.

Q.   Ernests Gulbis says he lost a lot of his... 
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Oh, my God.   Yes, I read that.   That's so ridiculous.   Like why?   You could have given all that money to an orphanage in Africa.   That makes no since.
I don't agree with that that at all.

Q.   What do you think of Andy Murray hiring AmÃ©lie Mauresmo? 
SLOANE STEPHENS:   I think it'll be great.   I mean, obviously ‑‑ his mom coached him for a long time, so obviously he works well with women. 
I think he likes her, they like each other, I think it'll be great.

Q.   You ever thought about having a female coach?
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Yeah, why not?   I mean, the opportunity hasn't presented itself yet.   Maybe Judy will be open now that her son has another lady in his life. 

Q.   Can I just ask how much sleep you're getting a night? 
SLOANE STEPHENS:   I probably get like eight hours.   Yeah.   I guess, yeah.   That's not bad.   Optimally you need like eight to ten, right?
