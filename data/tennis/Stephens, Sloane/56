S. STEPHENS/K. Kanepi   
6-0, 5-7, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Let's just start.   
 Q.  First of all, how does it feel to come to a press conference and see that there's only one person waiting for you?  
SLOANE STEPHENS: I'm happy because that means that it's going to go very quickly.   
 Q.  Okay.  So I'll try to be quick, as well.  At a certain point of the match it looked like you could have been like 6-love, 6-1 or something.  Then something clicked.  She started maybe hitting harder.  You probably thought it was going to be easier, and then what happened? Something changed at a certain point.  
SLOANE STEPHENS: Yeah, she started playing better.  Obviously, when you play someone and they beat you 6-love they, most of the time, are going to start playing better in the second set.  And that's what she did.   
There was a couple loose points that I played and I could have done some things different.   
But I regrouped nicely for the third set, so I was happy with that.   
 Q.  Maybe you prefer to be on court less time than you  actually did.  Maybe do you think it helps to play more balls since you probably want to go further in tournaments, it probably helps you tackle different situations than just one match?  
SLOANE STEPHENS: Um, yeah.  I mean, obviously, I haven't played that much on clay.  So it's just - - I don't mind that I'm on the court that long.   
But I'm playing well and getting confidence with every match, so I'm happy with that.
