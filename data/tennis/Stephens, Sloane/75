C. McHALE/S. Stephens
6-3, 6-0
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Another tough loss.  Can you talk a bit about the match, what happened.
SLOANE STEPHENS: Tough day.  Not really much to say.
Q. It was a bit of the same kind of match in Wuhan.  Do you see a common point?  How do you explain you can't pick up your best level right now?
SLOANE STEPHENS: Like I said, just a tough day.  There's not much to say about it.  Obviously not a great match.  So just forget about it and move on, try to have a better level for the next tournament.
Q. Where do you go from here?  What is your next tournament going to be?
SLOANE STEPHENS: Hong Kong.
Q. Did the rain affect your rhythm, and you just never quite going after that?
SLOANE STEPHENS: Yeah, I mean, but it affects both players, so...
I mean, she obviously just handled it a little bit better.  It's unfortunate, but it happens.
