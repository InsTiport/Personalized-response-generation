C. GARCIA/S. Stephens
6-3, 7-6
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Why don't you talk about the match and maybe what was the deciding factor of that match.
SLOANE STEPHENS:   Yeah, a tough match against a good player.  Had some chances, some good opportunities there, but just wasn't able to convert.
Obviously not having played that many matches this year, it's a little tough.  Yeah, still got another week to try and improve on it and get better.
