THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   You looked a lot more confident and ready out there today than you did yesterday.   First set you were playing extremely well.   How much of that was having more time to prepare for today than yesterday?  
ANASTASIA YAKIMOVA:   Yeah, it was a big difference.   I knew probably I would play Serena.   It's always one of the toughest opponents you can get.   
I was actually just trying to put the most effort I could.   It was the last match, so it's kind of the last match.   If I would lose, it's over.   If I win, we could still stay in the tie.   
Yeah, I was trying to prepare mentally better than yesterday.  
   
 Q.   When she was angry and smashing racquets, how much confidence did that give you?  
ANASTASIA YAKIMOVA:   I actually didn't see it (indiscernible) she broke the racquets.   Yeah, you try to be concentrated with yourself, with your things, not paying attention too much to what she is doing.   
Of course, it's giving you a bit of a boost, confirmation that you're doing the right thing.   You just have to keep up doing the same thing.  
   
 Q.   You were playing well, good defense.   What did Serena start doing that made things much more difficult for you?  
ANASTASIA YAKIMOVA:   I think she became just more calm.   Let's say I think she said to herself just to relax and take step by step, point by point.   When she gets concentrated, doing the things well, you know, it's very difficult to keep the level because she's really a good player.   
She has a powerful, good serve.   She changed that a lot in the second and third set.   She was really serving well.   It was putting a lot of pressure on me.   
I think she didn't change maybe the way she played, but she maybe became a little bit more consistent and stable and more powerful with everything she was doing.   
   
 Q.   How disappointing is it not to have Victoria playing this weekend?   
ANASTASIA YAKIMOVA:   Yeah, well, I mean, it's always disappointment.   But we have to try to do our best from what we have for the day.   
I can only answer for my things and for what I'm doing.   So I'm trying to do the best I can.   Everyone in our team is trying to do the same.   So obviously it's a big lose for us that she couldn't play.   But if she's injured, yeah, it's tough.   It can happen to everyone, so...   That's life.   
   
 Q.   Any loss is a tough loss to take.   Are there any positives you take home from a match like this?  
ANASTASIA YAKIMOVA:   Yeah, definitely.   That was the first tie for me since 2007, I believe.   I have never played in a World Group as well.   I've never played Serena.   I was really looking forward for this match.   I knew before I was going on court that, well, I would just try to give my best and try to enjoy it.   So it was a really good experience for me.   I could see that I could keep up the level with her, even if she was starting to play better, still a lot of good points.   
Yeah, I'm going positive back home.   I have some things to work on.   In general, I'm happy with the performance.   
   
 Q.   The other day you talked about the difficulty with the lights.   On your serve you had some double‑faults today.   Can you talk about the difficulty with that.   
ANASTASIA YAKIMOVA:   Yeah, I'm not going to make excuses or something for that.   My serve wasn't really working well today.   I don't say it was the reason or whatever, it just didn't work out that good today.
