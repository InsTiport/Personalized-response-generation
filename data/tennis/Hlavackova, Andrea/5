 HLAVACKOVA‑HRADECKA/Huber‑Raymond
  7‑6, 6‑1 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Obviously it was very close first set.   They had set points at 6‑5 and double faulted twice and you took advantage on the long set point.   Is it just that three‑point swing that changed the whole match?  
ANDREA HLAVACKOVA:   Well, maybe.   We started the tiebreak very well and we took the lead, and then I made two unforced errors on my serve which I was really mad about.   I didn't like that because I thought I'm playing very well and then I made those two mistakes, which you shouldn't.  
So at that point, 5‑6, I was like, really, you know, down.   I think if we would lose this point and lose the set that way it might have brought us down, even though we will be fighting anyway to comeback.   
It's a close match with no ads and supertiebreak in the end, so you have to keep your focus the whole time.   Even if you're up 5‑1 in the second, you have to keep playing and close it.   
At the end when we made that long point and made it all close for us in the first set, we were happy.   
   
 Q.   Talk about each of the other teams you might play in the final, Vinci‑Errani or Petrova‑Kirilenko.   Thoughts on each of them.   
LUCIE HRADECKA:   Yeah, both it's very great players.   I don't know which one we wish more, so I don't know.   It's really very tough.   We play against Vinci‑Errani last match in US Open final.   We know how beat them and what we have to do better than we did in the US Open.  
Against Petrova‑Kirilenko we play just one time, so we don't have enough experience like the Vinci‑Errani.   So we will see.  
   
 Q.   Lucie, I saw you switched to Nike recently.   
LUCIE HRADECKA:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Is that so you two match better?  
LUCIE HRADECKA:   Yeah, I switch for the Nike from 1st October, and I so happy for that.   I think now we can make more double, you know, like double player on the court, like visible.  
   
 Q.   Was that part of the reason you switched?  
ANDREA HLAVACKOVA:   One of these.   (Smiling.)
