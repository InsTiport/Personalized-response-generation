Q. What a show. Were you a little nervous that last game, that first serve you hit didn't look like it might hit the fence? 
 
 LEILA MESKHI: That is true.  
 
Q. What did you have to do to pull -- you did win after all, so you did pull yourself together; were you a little bit nervous? 
 
 LEILA MESKHI: I start to see my best chance because -- it was my last chance to beat her, you know, because it was my service game and I tried my best, you know, because-- and then after 5-3, it will be for me very tough to start again, you know, 5-4, something like that.  
 
Q. Are there a few things about her game you that you'd like to tell us about? 
 
 LEILA MESKHI: She is very tough. She always play very good, but I want to say-- first to say that I play really bad, you know, but I was surprised because -- first set she played unbelievable. I don't have a chance to win one point. But second set she start to make a lot of mistakes. She played well, really good.  
 
Q. Did you feel like as long as you kept the ball in play she was going to make an error? 
 
 LEILA MESKHI: Yes.  
 
Q. When did you realize that in the match? 
 
 LEILA MESKHI: After the second set.  
 
Q. Leila, did you sense that her footspeed was slowing down in the third set? 
 
 LEILA MESKHI: Yeah.  
 
Q. She wasn't running as well? 
 
 LEILA MESKHI: Yeah, I think she was tired in the third set and she -- when she start -- when I start to play, you know, longer points she was really tired.  
 
Q. When you go into a match against her because you have beaten her before, do you feel like you just have to be able to hang in there with the pace? Do you think -- has she ever changed strategy against you in a match? 
 
 LEILA MESKHI: I don't know because I played just once against her. Before the match I just think to play well.
