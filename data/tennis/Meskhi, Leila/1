Q. I wonder if the wind was most difficult on serving, on services tosses or not
necessarily? 

LEILA MESKHI: No, it's very difficult to play today. You just play against the wind. 

Q. Did you have to do anything differently with your toss today because of that? 

LEILA MESKHI: Yeah, because you have to, I don't know, more concentrate, because
usually you just toss and hit a ball. Now you have to -- 

Q. How much did that take away from your game, the wind? 

LEILA MESKHI: It is like 50%. 

Q. You have been able to stage some pretty good upsets here in resent years. Why do you
play so well here? 

LEILA MESKHI: I don't know. I like it. 

Q. What does she do that she is No. 5 or 6 in the world? 

LEILA MESKHI: I mean, she is very tough player, but you know, she is usual, like
everybody. Nothing real special, but she is very tough. 

Q. How, then, if she is very tough-- she doesn't do anything special; how does she win
matches; how did she win this match? 

LEILA MESKHI: Because it was my mistake. 

Q. How does she win other matches? 

LEILA MESKHI: Because she is tough, I said. 

Q. It looks like particularly on her backhand that she kind of disguises where the shot
is going; is that true or can you pretty much read -- 

LEILA MESKHI: I don't understand. 

Q. It looked like on her backhand that she would send the ball-- 

LEILA MESKHI: To my backhand? 

Q. Yeah, to a surprise place sometimes. She sometimes looked like she fooled you? 

LEILA MESKHI: Yeah, that is right. She has very good, you know, she put for the hit,
she is like a little bit, you know, stop and then hit a ball. She do it very great.
