THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Talk about the Olympics.   How disappointed are you that you won't be featured there this year?
TOMMY HAAS:   Yeah.   It's, I mean, I guess a pill you have to swallow for not being nominated by the German Sport Committee, which I think if they would have just nominated me, I think the chances of getting a wildcard would have been quite high, but therefore the German people didn't nominate their player. 
It's frustrating, but, you know, you have to accept the fact that they didn't do it, and they have rules they follow and the criteria, and I didn't match those.
So there you go. 

Q.   Your memories of winning the silver medal in 2000, are they strong?   How do you remember that?
TOMMY HAAS:   Oh, yeah.   It's one of the best highlights I had in my career.   At that time I was still young, and it was my first Olympics, great time, staying at the Village, meeting new, different athletes, seeing how they train and everything. 
You know, the more wiser you get, you realize what it actually meant for you or what it means for you to actually have a medal.   So it means a lot to me.

Q.   Do you rate it above your Grand Slam performances, reaching three, four semifinals?
TOMMY HAAS:   Well, I have never reached a Grand Slam final, which was my ultimate goal as a kid, or winning one.   I have reached a couple of semis.
Maybe looking back once I'm completely done with my career, it's definitely going to be ranked as one of my biggest moments.
