 MODERATOR: Ladies and Gentlemen, Tommy Haas.  
 
Q. What is it like to face a countryman out there in your first round?
 
 TOMMY HAAS: It's always a little difficult, I think. Played a lot against countrymens
this year. It's just another match. Like against everyone else, you try to go out there,
do your best, try to win. 
 
Q. I know there's been a mixed history between all of you and Boris Becker. Does it
seem at all funny to know that he's out there watching Philippoussis and not the two
Germans?
 
 TOMMY HAAS: I'm sure he has his reasons why he's watching Philippoussiss. Maybe he
didn't want to show up and watch the match. I didn't even know he was here watching the
match from Philippoussis. That's interesting to know. You know, whichever match he wants
to watch, that's his decision.  
 
Q. How is your ankle?
 
 TOMMY HAAS: It was a little bit sore after that. 5-4 in the first set, I slipped a
little bit on it. I did have ankle surgery.
