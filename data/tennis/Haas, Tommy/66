THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Tommy.  
 
 
Q.  You had a 204 kilometer an hour serve today.  Is your arm feeling good?  High serves are back?
 
TOMMY HAAS:  Yeah, you can say that for sure.  
    
 
Q.  How did you feel serving went today?  How key was it to your victory?
 
TOMMY HAAS:  Yeah, it was pretty good.  I think I only got broken once in the beginning of the third set.  Throughout the whole match, I think I served pretty well.  As you just said, I think it was 11 aces, something.  Very few double-faults, if any.  You know, serve's in pretty good position right now.  
    
 
Q.  What do you think was the key turning point in that match for you? 
 
TOMMY HAAS:  Well, you know, it's best-of-five so it's always tough to say when is the key turning point.  After dominating the first two sets, he came off pretty strong in the beginning of the third.  Then I had a few chances at 3-All, couldn't convert those break chances.  Obviously, getting the break at 5-All was very important for me.
