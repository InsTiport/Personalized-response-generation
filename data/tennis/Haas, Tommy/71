THE MODERATOR:  With his win today, Tommy improves to 9-5 here at Indian Wells.  He will face Juan Chela in the next round.  Questions.  
 
 
Q.  Pretty pleased with your progress?
 
TOMMY HAAS:  Yeah, definitely.  Anytime you win a match, you know, like today, you know, you're always pretty happy.  It was a two and a half hour match, and it could have gone either way, I thought.  You know, getting the early break in the third kind of gave me a little bit of an edge, just trying to hold my serve and then to break him for the match, felt pretty confident. 
 
Q.  Whenever there's a new top player, the game always changes a little bit.  How is the game different today from when you had to leave it with the injury?  What's changed in that intervening year?
 
TOMMY HAAS:  I don't know.  I haven't really played too many guys yet, so I can't really talk about that too much.  From what I've seen on TV, I don't really think that much has changed.  I think, you know, everybody's trying to improve as much as they can every time they go out there on the court.  You know, it seems to me everybody's continuing to improve and trying to get better, playing some good tennis out there.  
 
Q.  Did you surprise yourself to be so strong physically in the third, stamina?
 
TOMMY HAAS:  Yeah, a little bit.  You know, to be honest, for me, every match that I play is a bonus, like I said at the beginning, as well.  Didn't start off the way I wanted to at the first.  San Jose and Memphis, it was nice to be back, see where I was.  I was doing a lot of training off the court.  I'm feeling pretty fit, so that's a good thing.
