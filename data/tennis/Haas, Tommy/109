ATP:  Questions, please. 
 
Q.  How can you explain that you lost?
 
TOMMY HAAS:  Well, I don't feel so well right now.  Obviously I didn't play my best match today.  I didn't perform really well.  I wasn't there mentally.  Sometimes have you these days.  You've just got to try to make the best of it.  
 

Q.  What bothered you most in your opponent? 
 
TOMMY HAAS:  Nothing really.  I mean, he doesn't really have a shot that you have to be afraid of.  He's just a solid player.  He runs pretty good.  But like I said, I can't tell what  -- I didn't play one of my best matches today.  It was probably one of the worst of the year.  Things like this happen.  Other than that, he's a good competitor, he runs and fights really well.  That's his strengths.
