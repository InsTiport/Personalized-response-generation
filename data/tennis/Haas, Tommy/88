MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  Asked Pete Sampras about the Hamlet Cup.  He really implied that he wasn't giving 100%.  Was that the impression you had playing him?

TOMMY HAAS:  Well, it doesn't really matter to me too much what people say afterwards or what he said.  I think he had some good quotes in there.  The main thing is that I won the title and that I beat one of the greatest players ever to win the title.  That's great for me.  No matter how much he tried or how much he wanted to win a title, I'm the one that had the big trophy at the end.  I told him afterwards in the speech I'm very thankful to beat one of the greatest in the game to win a title.  It was just a great week for me.  No matter what, I was very pleased.

Q.  I remember you endorsing goods by Nike.  Was that a new business deal?

TOMMY HAAS:  Might be something with Reebok in the future. 

Q.  Can you assess how you thought you played today?

TOMMY HAAS:  Well, I think I got off to a really good start.  I think the first two sets were over in like 43 minutes.  I knew that one of these games, one of these sets, he's going to try to get into it, really try to change his game.  He played awfully well, served better in the third set.  It was getting quite hot out there.  It was quite tough trying to finish him off in the tiebreak.  When I got the mini break, hit a double-fault, make him win the big points.  You know, just, yeah, went into the fourth.  Started to change my strategy a little bit, maybe attacking a bit more.  Felt pretty good about that, got the break at 3-2. 

Q.  You're overall happy with the way things went?

TOMMY HAAS:  Yeah, definitely.
