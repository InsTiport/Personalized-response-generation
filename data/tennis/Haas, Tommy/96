 ATP: Questions, please. 
 
Q. Was there anything difficult for you? What happened basically? Were you totally fit
or were you suffering a bit?
 
 TOMMY HAAS: I feel actually fine. That wasn't the problem I think today. Today I was
waiting quite a bit to get out on the court after Pete played. Took a little bit longer
than I think we expected. Hanging around the locker room. That shouldn't be a excuse. I
warmed up fine before the match. Just went out there and maybe was still a little bit
taking it too easy at the beginning, made too many unforced errors, didn't really have
that much confidence right away. I tried to go for too much. That was my mistake. Then you
have to tell also that I think he played tremendously well. He served really well the
first couple of games. Didn't give me much of a chance to get back into the first set. He
returned my first serves pretty good, nice and deep. It's tough against him. You know
you're going to have to be on top of your game to beat him. I certainly wasn't today. 
 
Q. Is his running a great factor, his ability to chase down everything? Does that put
pressure on you mentally?
 
 TOMMY HAAS: Yes, it does, obviously. That's one of his strengths. He's serving much
better I think now, although from the baseline he doesn't do too much. He just makes you
play. He plays most balls cross-court, doesn't make any unforced errors. He's a good
player. That's all you can say.
