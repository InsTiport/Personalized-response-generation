USTA: Questions for Tommy in English, first.

Q. There will be only one question in English. Just about your next opponent who will
be Cedric. 

TOMMY HAAS: Yeah.

Q. What do you think of his game and did you ever meet before? 

TOMMY HAAS: I think I played once in the Hopman Cup last -- maybe a year and a half
ago, I'm not sure. Obviously ,he's a very good player. This year's Open he's been showing
he's in good form, playing really well. I practiced with him here a couple of times. Yeah,
if he has a good day, he's going to be a very tough opponent and it's going to be a good
match. 

Q. What do you think is his main weapon?

TOMMY HAAS: He's an all-around player, I think. He has a good first serve, he comes
into the net. He has good volleys, good form, very nice backhand. His whole game is solid.
He's proven that a lot of times, I'm sure. As we have seen, he reached the Finals of US
Open, Wimbledon, semis of French. He's a tremendous player. If he has a good day, he's
going to be tough to beat. 

Q. Do you think experience is going to be a main factor in this match?

TOMMY HAAS: I think it has nothing to do with experience. I think it has to do with who
wants it more, who has a better day this day, what's the conditions, if it's windy, you
know, how we feel. Obviously, we're both tired, we both had to play until tonight -- I
think I finished three minutes before him so it's actually even. Obviously, he does have
more experience. He's been through it probably more times. I'm just going to have to try
to be tough.
