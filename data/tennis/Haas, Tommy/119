 Q. What makes the difference today? 
 
 TOMMY HAAS: Well, I think that the fitness made a little difference. I mean, in the
fifth set at the end, my body stopped working. I was there mentally. I wanted to win the
match a lot. The fifth set at 1-All, I had a breakpoint, couldn't convert it. He had a
good serve. I think mentally then I was a little frustrated. He start ready playing really
well on my big shots. Then all of a sudden I started feeling the cramping already in the
fourth set. I think fitness-wise I have to improve a little bit more when I play those
three to five sets in the Grand Slam. 
 
Q. You knew before Marcelo was not a hundred percent physically? He got the problem in
the ankle.
 
 TOMMY HAAS: Didn't seem to bother him too much today. He was running like an animal. If
you look at the match, at the tape, the shots I hit, he almost got every big ball that I
hit. So I don't think it was bothering him too much. You just focus anyway and try to play
solid in your match and try to win. You don't care if the other one is hurt, otherwise he
wouldn't be playing anyway.
