Q. Tommy, could you reflect on your first Grand Slam experience? What was it like out
there? Was it what you expected it would be?

TOMMY HAAS: I came here as a qualifier. I qualified. So it was my first goal to do.
Done pretty well, qualified. Playing against Michael Stich, a German player, very great,
terrific. I got out there and played my best tennis that I could play. Actually, I had a
chance in the fourth set to win the fourth set, three set points. I was cramping a little
bit in my legs, hurting a little bit. Everything else was great. The people here cheering
me on. First Grand Slam, it's very nice.

Q. Is it at all intimidating to play a guy who you've seen so much growing up and a
countryman of yours?

TOMMY HAAS: Yes. It was more like a good honor for me to play against Michael Stich.
Who knows when he's going to stop playing tennis. It was good to play him. It was a good
experience. I had fun out there. It was good.

Q. Michael said you didn't seem to have a game plan or a strategy.

TOMMY HAAS: I did have a strategy. 

Q. Could you tell us what it was?

TOMMY HAAS: You know, play my best tennis and, you know, just play and try to win.
That's all. Like I said, in the fourth set, I had chances to win the fourth set. I don't
know what other kind of strategy you need. If it's two sets to one for him, and you try to
win the fourth set, you have set points.
