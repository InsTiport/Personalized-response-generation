THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.


Q.  Can you talk a little bit about psychologically what you go through in preparing for a match that is delayed over several days, and how you deal with that. 

TOMMY HAAS:  Yeah, I mean, what do you do, you basically have to come here in the morning when you are first match on.  You kind of just wait and have to wait around the whole time, see if the rain stops.  And then you have to get ready in case you do play, so you kind of just hang around with your friends, your coach, your physical therapist.  Always trying to have some fun on the one side.  On the other side, you always try to stay focused as much as you can.  And, you know, have a good time.

Q.  Does it feel like a new match when you have that much time in between?

TOMMY HAAS:  Kind of.  You know it's going to be a little bit shorter, obviously, because you only had to play luckily another set and a half only.  But, yeah, I mean, it's not like the first time it happens so you kind of know how to deal with it now.  When you come to Wimbledon, you kind of expect it so you have to always be ready for it.

Q.  No special preparation that you actually go through?

TOMMY HAAS:  Pretty much same as regular matches.  You start from zero.  Doesn't matter.
