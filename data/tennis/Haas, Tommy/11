 T. HAAS/J. Wang
  6‑3, 6‑2, 7‑5 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Can we desperate U.S. journalists count you as the last American in the draw?  
TOMMY HAAS:   You can write that, sure.   That's fine with me (smiling).   
   
 Q.   Had you actually considered playing for the U.S.?   
TOMMY HAAS:   I have, yeah.  
   
 Q.   What led to the decision not to?  
TOMMY HAAS:   I mean, you know, it's probably not the right time to talk about it too much.   I considered it for a brief second.   I actually did change it when I was injured just for fun to sort of have a picture of that.   If you had a German/American flag, I would represent that flag but it doesn't exist.   
In the long run, you know, I played for Germany for too long.   I can't do that, so...   
   
 Q.   Could you talk about the conditions out there that have troubled so many of the other players?   
TOMMY HAAS:   You know, I really haven't read too much of the papers, haven't paid attention too much.   Some people slip.   It is grass, after all.   Sometimes you are going to slip, depending where you are on the court.   
Yeah, when it happens to you, you're going to be frustrated.   It is quite dangerous, as you know.   One slip, a lot of things can happen.   Luckily it hasn't happened to me.   I mean, I usually step on balls and retire after that.   
Ho, all joking aside, it's dangerous, it's tough when it's a little bit humid and wet.   Like today, even when we started playing, you know, we warmed up, it was drizzling a little bit.   There's no way you can play.   You can slip and lose the grip underneath your feet, and it's very dangerous.   It's really tough if you do get injured for quite a bit after an incident like that.   
You know, it's part of it, unfortunately, but...   
   
 Q.   Were they trying to get you to play before you felt it was safe?  
TOMMY HAAS:   No.   They were quite good about it.   We waited until it was the right time.  
   
 Q.   Did you know much about Jimmy Wang?  
TOMMY HAAS:   Not too much, to be honest.   I've seen him around before.   I heard he was injured for quite some time, on his way back.   He's been in the top 100 before, I believe, a couple years back.   
You can never underestimate any player out there.   He obviously qualified in Halle, lost there first round to a countryman, qualified here, won his first round.   He's been playing a lot of matches on grass, been successful.   Doesn't matter where you get your matches that you win, you get your confidence.   
I went out there, just tried to play my game.   Again, I felt like I served pretty well and played solid in the right moments.   
   
 Q.   How would you describe the emotional, mental effect of all the injuries over the years that you've suffered?   
TOMMY HAAS:   I'm so tired of talking about my injuries also, to be honest.   It's like I'm healthy right now.   I'm playing good tennis right now.   
Yes, I'm 35.   There's nothing I can do about it.   I'm later in my career.   These are all things that don't matter once you get out there.   I don't get 15‑Love or 30‑Love every game because I'm 35.   You have to win games, sets, and matches.   
I don't get a handout just because I've had five surgeries in my career.   It's not like that.   You have to earn everything, you know.   You can't buy ATP points to buy your ranking.   It's not possible; otherwise Gulbis would be No.1 in the world.   
But still, it's been a struggle at times.   You know, it's part of life.   There's more important things than tennis anyway.   But overall I'm healthy.   I'm competing.   I'm playing the sport I love to play.   Everything is good.  
   
 Q.   How has that affected your appreciation to compete now as you are?  
TOMMY HAAS:   Yeah, I appreciate it a lot.   That's why I'm happy to still be doing what I'm doing.   I hope I can continue as long as I can, as long as my body allows me to, as long as I'm mentally capable of giving it a lot of extra effort off the court, as well.   All the preparations, the hard work, as long as all that is there, I'll continue.   
   
 Q.   You have LÃ³pez next.   
TOMMY HAAS:   Yes.   Tough opponent.   He obviously is feeling pretty good, no question about it, winning in Eastbourne.   He's been having quite an interesting year in my eyes.   
You know, so, yeah, it's going to be tough.   Lefty.   He's been in the quarters here three times in his career.   He's had some great matches.   He's got a great grass court game, no question about it.   I'm going to have to play extremely well to have a chance to win that match, yeah.
