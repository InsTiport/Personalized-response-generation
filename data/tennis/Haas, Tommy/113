 TOMMY HAAS: It is a change here. I didn't have a lot of time after Lyon to prepare
myself. 
 The service here is different. It is more like a quick clay court. It is different to
Lyon, but I am satisfied. 
 No, mentally the change is not that difficult. I was satisfied with my week in Lyon. I
played very well. This is a new tournament, a new week. 
 Honestly it doesn't interest me that much that I could be No. 1 in Germany. If I play
well, then I deserve it. If I don't play well, I don't deserve it. 
 I feel a bit tired and I brought my fitness trainer as well as my masseur with me. I
play here, then Paris, and then Stockholm, then the year is over for me. I will try and
give my best to better my ranking. 
 I am content with my year. Maybe I will change some things with respect to the
tournament planning. It hasn't always been the best during this year. Next year I will try
to better some things. For instance, in Bremen, I played Davis Cup. The next day I flew to
Hong Kong. That wasn't of any use. I caught an intestinal virus and had to leave
immediately. This affected the whole season afterwards. 
 The match today wasn't that easy. Davide Nainkin is not that high in the ranking, but
he is a very good player. I hope that I will play well tomorrow; that more spectators are
in the hall and that they will support me.
