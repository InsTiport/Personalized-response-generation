GREG SHARKO:  A few questions in English first for Tommy. 


Q.  When did your back start bothering you today?

TOMMY HAAS:  It was right at the game at 5-4 for me, must have been one point that I didn't notice my back start to hurt, then I lost that game.  I start to serve the first point and all of a sudden I felt I couldn't lift up anymore, I couldn't breathe basically.  It wasn't really a pop or anything that bothered me at the beginning, but then all of a sudden just didn't leave me to serve the way I wanted to or even to move.  Right away I ask for the trainer.


Q.  Was it bothering you in Scottsdale?

TOMMY HAAS:  No, just occurred.  Didn't have anything before.


Q.  You ended the match at 5-All.  Are you disappointed you have to pull out?

TOMMY HAAS:  Sure.  This is a Super 9 tournament.  Obviously you want to try to play your best and finish the match as best as you are competing.  It's tough to pull out, but I just felt I couldn't go on like this to even hurt myself more.  So the best thing for me to do was to stop. 


Q.  Are you resting up for the Lipton?  Are you going to play the Lipton?

TOMMY HAAS:  Yeah.  Hopefully it will be better.  They say it's a strained muscle, so I'm going to try to relax, rest a little bit, get it better.
