MODERATOR:  Questions for Tommy. 


Q.  You seemed sort of determined to do this the hard way this week, coming from a set down again today. 

TOMMY HAAS:  Yeah.  I mean, if I could do that every time, I would be okay with it.  You know, obviously it's tough to jump into a good start for me, for some reason, this week.  I think Tim played extremely well the first couple of games  - served big, served and volleyed  - so I didn't get much of a rhythm at the beginning.  When you get broken in the first game of the set, things don't go that well already.  You kind of have like a negative mentality right away.  But I just hung in there.


Q.  Did you feel perhaps he had such a good first set, he couldn't possibly keep that up, something had to go your way?

TOMMY HAAS:  I've seen him play where he can keep it up.  What I was trying to do is just don't get broken early in the second set because it happened last year in Vienna that I think I got broken every set pretty early, so kind of tried to hold serve.  All I tried to do was hold his serve and tried to get him thinking by 15-30 or 15-40 on his serve.  That's exactly what happened at 4-3.  Plus I think the crowd jumped into it and got to him mentally a bit I think.


Q.  Were you pleased the way you held yourself together at Love-40 for the second set?

TOMMY HAAS:  Yeah, definitely.


Q.  Getting yourself pumped up at that stage. 

TOMMY HAAS:  You never really get a break until you hold serve afterwards, then you confirm that break.  It was important for me to win that 6-3, especially being down Love-40.  You know, you don't want to kind of like give it away, but make him work for it.  Somehow I managed to win that game and the set.  I think it was very important.


Q.  It could be quite a decisive victory for you in terms of qualification, as well?

TOMMY HAAS:  Maybe.
