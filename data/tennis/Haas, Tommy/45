   THE MODERATOR:  First question, please.   
  
  Q.  You've now won all three matches against Nalbandian.  Why do you think you have the advantage over him?   
 TOMMY HAAS:  Good question.  I think my game probably matches up pretty well against his.  Each time we've played, it's actually been close matches, but I seem to maybe use my chances a little bit better.   
 I think today he played really solid at the beginning of the first set, which started to worry me a little bit because he barely made any mistakes, especially on the backhand side.  He was playing extremely well.   
 As soon as I got that second set under my belt I felt pretty confident.  I liked what I was doing in the second set.  I was just trying to figure -- trying to continue doing that.  It seemed to work pretty well today.   
  
  Q.  What pleased you most about today's match?   
 TOMMY HAAS:  Just the way I was aggressive, kept focused pretty well.  I think I served really, really well at important times.  Yeah, just obviously very pleased of beating David, being in the quarterfinals here once again.
