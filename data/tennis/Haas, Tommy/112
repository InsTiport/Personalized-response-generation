Q. How did you feel today against Rios?

TOMMY HAAS: I think it was a pretty good match. We broke each other once. He broke me
right away in the first set. I broke him right back. He broke me again; he played some
fantastic tennis at the end of the first set. I didn't play so well 'til 3-Love, then I
decided to not give up and have another chance and see how we do. I came back real strong.
5-1, Love-30, if I could win that game I thought maybe I could have a good chance coming
into the third set. He won two very good points. He was better today than me.

Q. Do you think your serve was worse than last week, for example?

TOMMY HAAS: Well, a little bit. It is tough. Got a little tight playing doubles last
night. Finished late. No excuse, trying to fight, and it was a close match in the second
set, Rios was better.

Q. Do you think he was able to recover from last week from his injury?

TOMMY HAAS: Definitely. I don't think he was injured that bad anyway. I am sure he is
feeling good and hopefully he is going to go far in this tournament.
