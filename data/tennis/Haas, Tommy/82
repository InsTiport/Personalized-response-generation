MODERATOR:  Questions for Tommy. 


Q.  Do you remember where you were and how you heard about all the terror attacks last year?

TOMMY HAAS:  Yeah, I was at home.  I just came back from the US Open.

Q.  In Florida?

TOMMY HAAS:  Florida, yeah.  Actually, I was asleep when my coach called me up and said, "You should turn on TV, look at this, what's happening." 

Q.  Did you watch it all day?

TOMMY HAAS:  Pretty much.  I was just sitting on the couch for the rest of the day pretty much.  Time flew by.  You know, the first moment you saw it, you know, I think you thought it was not real.  But, yeah, it was a tough moment.

Q.  Do you think a lot of things have changed in the world, even in the tennis world, after all that?

TOMMY HAAS:  I don't know if it changed anything in the sports world.  I think in the real world out there, it makes you wonder what's going on.  Obviously, for us people, all the people that travel a lot, makes it much more difficult.  You wonder what can happen next.  But, you know, what are you supposed to say about this?  You know, it's something that is a big tragedy.  You know, we're reminded every day if you put it on CNN, what happened.  It just makes you realize how lucky some of us people are, to be able to do what we can do, to be healthy and alive and enjoy it every day.
