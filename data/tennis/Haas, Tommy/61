THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.


Q.  What do you think you missed today in the first set when you were down, and as a whole during the match?  Because you were in a positive position many times and then you couldn't finish the game.

TOMMY HAAS:  Yeah, I couldn't use my chances in the beginning.  He got off to a good start with a couple of risky shots that he made and broke me right away.  Then, you know, I had a chance to break him right back and I didn't.  It was kind of tough mentally. But I think overall it's not really smart for me to talk about this match today, but just to forget about it as soon as I can.


Q.  Did you notice that the crowd was sort of noisy and they would stand up and take pictures?  Did it bother you, or no?

TOMMY HAAS:  Not today, no, not really.  It's okay.
