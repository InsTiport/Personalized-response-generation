THE MODERATOR:  First question, please.
 

Q. How did that feel out there today?

TOMMY HAAS:  Yeah, not bad.  Was a pretty good match I think.  First set was pretty tight, some big points to break him first I think was the key to the first set.  Second set I had some chances again to break him, and I think it's important to use your, you know, your chances, your opportunities.  And I did that again, and then I think he freaked out I think when I got the second break in the second.  So he kind of let it slip away a little bit at the end for me.

Q.  How do you rate your chances at this tournament?

TOMMY HAAS: Yeah, well you never know.  I'm just going to take it match for match.  I'm in pretty good form  obviously winning Adelaide, even playing some good tennis in Sydney making the second round there.   I feel good.  I'm having fun.  Hopefully there will be the same kind of crowd out there to support me, then I'll just try to give my best.
