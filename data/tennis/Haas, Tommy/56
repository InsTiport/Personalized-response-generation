THE MODERATOR:  Questions.  
 
 
Q.  Are you playing as well now as you were when you made the semifinals of The Open?
 
TOMMY HAAS:  Maybe.  I don't know.  It's been a while.  You know, I like to think that I'm playing some good tennis right now at the very moment.  I don't look back and see how I played back then.  Just trying to compete with the guys right now, and that's about it.
