THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.  
 
 
Q.  Do you know anything about the Australian opponent you're facing next?
 
TOMMY HAAS:  Yeah, we played each other I think last year in the first round of the US Open.  He's a good player.  I watched a little bit today on TV.  He played against Rochus.  He's got lots of spin.  He's got the crowd behind him.  He looks like he's feeling good about his game, so it's going to be a tough match. 
 
Q.  Was it as easy for you as it looked today?
 
TOMMY HAAS:  Not really.  Every game, there were a few games that were pretty solid but overall I had to make sure I keep winning the big points and I just played a solid match today.
