S. QUERREY/T. Fabbiano
7-6, 7-5, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What sort of effect does the way Wimbledon went for you last year, if any, have this year?
SAM QUERREY: Maybe a little bit.  I always preferred playing here.  It's always been my favorite Grand Slam.  I always feel I have my best results here.  I already felt confident coming into this tournament, regardless of last year.  That maybe gives me a little extra boost, but not much.
Q. What went well for you today, would you say?
SAM QUERREY: Just kind of fought through some tough times.  Maybe didn't play my best.  You know, it was a little windy out there.  I was down a break first set and the second set.  But just kind of stuck with it and tried not to get too frustrated.  I knew if I kind of just stayed the course, I'd have some chances.
Q. Coming in, in general are you someone who comes to a place and says, This is what for me would be a successful tournament?
SAM QUERREY: No, not really.  I mean, definitely want to make the third round and anything past that is great.
