THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Talk about the match with Dudi.  What was it like for you out there today?  
SAM QUERREY: I thought I played well.  Everything felt great today.  I mean, Dudi is a tricky player.  He's got a fan club behind him.  They're loud.  They're cheering on their guy.   
I felt like I did a good job of just putting pressure on him, staying in front, coming to the net, serving big.  I feel like when I do that against anyone, I'm pretty tricky.   
 Q.  Did you get a feeling he couldn't get started against you today?  
SAM QUERREY: Definitely, yeah.  He had the one look where I broke him in the first set and he broke me right back, but then I was able to break him again to win that set.  Once I won the first set, I gained a little more confidence, started playing even more aggressive, swing more freely, just started to play better and better.   
 Q.  Did you ever feel after that second set that this is typical Dudi, he could come back and win the next three sets?  
SAM QUERREY: The third set was the toughest one.  We both held eight times in a row, he had a Love-40 on me that he didn't get.  You're never out of it at the Grand Slams.  Dudi, he's a fighter, makes you play till the end.   
 Q.  Are you usually aware of the fans, partisan fans?  
SAM QUERREY: I played him a handful of times.  I knew it was going to be like that.   
 Q.  Is this everywhere on the road or just New York?  
SAM QUERREY: It's everywhere.  Even a little more so in New York.  That was 80% Dudi Sela fans out there.
