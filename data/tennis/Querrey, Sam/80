S. QUERREY/K. Nishikori
  6-3, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. How did you feel about that?
 SAM QUERREY: Felt pretty good. I thought I served really well and moved, you know, moved well. I was pretty happy for my first grass court match of the season.

 Q. How about that third game of the match after you'd just broken him?
 SAM QUERREY: Yeah, that was a big game. He had, you know, six or seven break points, and fortunately I hit big serves on four or five of them and played the other ones tough.
 I think that was a huge game.

 Q. Are you feeling a bit better about yourself now that you're off the clay and on the grass?
 SAM QUERREY: Yeah. I mean, I like the clay. I felt like I had a decent clay court season and felt like I played well. 
 I definitely like the grass a little bit more. Today was a good start.

 Q. You don't often go to a tournament as defending champion. How does it feel?
 SAM QUERREY: It feels good. You feel extra pressure, few extra jitters when you're out there the first match. It's a nice feeling. Hopefully it will happen more often.

 Q. Who do you think is the big threat this week, Sam?
 SAM QUERREY: I mean, Nadal. Nadal and Roddick are probably two of the heavy favorites.
 I mean, I haven't looked at the -- Murray, assuming he's good and healthy and can play. You know, those are probably the three big ones. 
 But, you know, everyone -- there's a lot of good players.

 Q. Is that a nice feeling to come back here being the defending champion?
 SAM QUERREY: Yeah, definitely. I know today -- last year I didn't play on center court I think till my third round, so the court was a little more worn. 
 Today, you know, coming out the first day with the brand new grass was a little bit slippery, but it felt good.
