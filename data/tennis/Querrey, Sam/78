S. QUERREY/I. Dodig
  7‑5, 3‑6, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   What are your thoughts on that?
SAM QUERREY:   Tough match.   Both of us served really well.   I think I served at 70%, he served at 75%.
So just a matter of a couple points here and there, and it was tough out there.   It was pretty windy.   You know, I'm proud of myself for losing that second set and coming back strong in the third set and squeaking out a break.

Q.   Are you surprised you're playing really well?
SAM QUERREY:   No, I feel like I have been playing well lately.   You know, I lost a couple close matches in Indian Wells and Miami, and then I won a challenger, Sarasota.   Even though it was a challenger, it was still five wins.   Then won three rounds in Rome, played well at the French Open, lost to Tipsarevic. 
So I feel like I'm playing well.   Just lost a couple of close ones.   You know, this is the best I have felt this year, I guess.

Q.   Nice to be back in a tour semi again, isn't it?
SAM QUERREY:   Very nice, yeah.   Feels good to be back in the press room here.

Q.   Marin Cilic, next match. 
SAM QUERREY:   Yeah, Marin is tough.   Kind of a little bit similar game to what I have.   He might like his backhand a little more.   I might like my forehand a little more.   But both have good serves. 
We've played once on grass before at Wimbledon, and he beat me 6‑4 in the fifth.   You know, I'm hoping to get him back, but again, he's a tough player.   He's been playing well this week.   I don't think he's lost a set, so it's going to be tough.

Q.   This place is a little bit special for you because you won here two years ago?
SAM QUERREY:   Definitely, yeah.   I mean, this is one of the oldest, most prestigious tournaments in the world.   It's really special.   I love coming back.
