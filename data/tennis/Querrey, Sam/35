THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
   
 Q. What is the prevailing feeling right now after this big upset over Novak?  
SAM QUERREY: Really excited. It's an unbelievable win. To do it here at Wimbledon is really special.   
You know, I'm just looking forward to the next match. You know, there's another one after this. I have to get ready for that.   
   
 Q. What about last night? The match was suspended after you were leading two sets to love. Did you have a good night's sleep or was it tough to go to sleep?  
SAM QUERREY: No, I slept great. I'm a pretty relaxed guy. Had an easy dinner at the house. My parents are there, some friends, my girlfriend. We just kind of hung out. Nothing exciting.   
Got back here today and went to work.   
   
 Q. The four sets, so many ups and downs, how did you manage to get through that?  
SAM QUERREY: Just stayed the course, didn't do anything special. Can be tricky with all those rain delays. But fortunately just went out there, served well the whole time, played a great tiebreaker at the end to get the win.
