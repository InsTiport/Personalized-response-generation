T. FRITZ/S. Querrey
6-3, 6-4
Q. It's good to have you back on the tour.  You're back from injury, playing very well again on the grass.  How do you reflect on a good week in Eastbourne, making the final?
SAM QUERREY: Really happy with it.  It's my first tournament back in three months.  And to make a final, I probably would have signed up for that at the beginning of the week.
It's great for my confidence, good to have this momentum going into Wimbledon, and hopefully these matches will spill over next week and I can win some more matches in London.
Q. A word, if you could, on your opponent, Taylor.  You have obviously won 10 titles in your career.  This is his first one.  He's a friend of yours.  Any thoughts, any comments on Taylor?
SAM QUERREY: Yeah.  You know, he said it out there.  He made a final in 2017 or '16 in Memphis, and I know, you know, he's really wanted a title ever since then.  Every young player does.
So it's probably, you know, a little weight off his shoulders to kind of get that first title under his belt.  Hopefully he wins a lot more titles down the road.
He's a great player, he's got a dangerous game, and will hopefully just continue to rise in the rankings and have more results like this.
