THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
   
 Q.   How did it feel out there?  
SAM QUERREY:   Good.   I started out a little slow.   Broke me the first game, but then he served really well rest of the first set.   But after that I felt pretty good second and third sets.  
Served big, hit my forehand well.   I was pretty happy.  
   
 Q.   Not exactly California weather here.  
SAM QUERREY:   No, it's humid; it's sticky.   You know, it's very different from last week.   It's a tough turnaround.  
   
 Q.   Did you find it kind of hotter?  
SAM QUERREY:   Yeah, it's hotter.   I'm not sleeping well because of this Ultra Festival going on and I could hear the bass and strobe lights shining in my hotel so it's hard to sleep.  
Had to deal with that last week, but, you know, I have been here for a while now so I'm used to the conditions.  
   
 Q.   Is that on Brickell?  
SAM QUERREY:   Yeah.   I think every hotel on Brickell is facing the same problem.  
   
 Q.   You're not going out and rocking?  
SAM QUERREY:   I could do it right from my hotel room.   (Laughter.)  
  
 Q.   Is there any kind of different confidence feeling when you know you're the top American, or not really?  
SAM QUERREY:   Um, not really.   I mean, some days more than others.   I never thought about it out there today.   Haven't really thought about it much.  
You know, felt like another day out there to me.   Nothing new.  
   
 Q.   Could you describe what the feeling is like to step on the court to play Roger Federer, and also your most memorable match against Roger Federer.  
SAM QUERREY:   Um, the feeling ‑‑I mean, when I played him when I was younger, you know, still kind of in awe and it was just kind of fun to be out there.   I didn't think I was going to win.  
What was the other question?  
   
 Q.   Most memorable match you played with him.  
SAM QUERREY:   My most memorable match?   I have only played him twice.   It was probably my match here.   I lost to him in a night match here.   That was the first time I played him.  
It was just so fun, such an experience, something I'll always remember.  
   
 Q.   Were you pleased with your performance against him?  
SAM QUERREY:   Yeah, I think I lost like 6‑3, 6‑4.   I was pretty nervous.  
You know, I don't think I expected to win back then.   I was only like 18.   I guess I was happy with it.  
   
 Q.   How do you feel ‑ or if you do feel ‑ you have to compensate for your height?  
SAM QUERREY:   Um, I don't feel like I do anything too different.   I mean, I feel like I'm tall, but I feel like I can move around and have the game style of someone who is 6'2" or 6'3".   I don't really look to serve and volley or come in too much.   I like to stay back.  
So, I mean, I don't try to do anything differently because I'm tall.  
   
 Q.   Raonic or Rufin next.  
SAM QUERREY:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Any experience?  
SAM QUERREY:   Never played Rufin.   I have played Raonic three times.   Won two, lost one.   Lost the most recent one.  
So, you know, he's always a pain to play just with the serve, and, you know, plays big.  
Yeah, I have never played Rufin so I can't really speak for him.  
   
 Q.   Do you remember the first famous tennis player you ever met or encountered?  
SAM QUERREY:   Agassi when he played a challenger in Las Vegas in like 1998.   I lived there then.   And I got to, you know, go up to him and say hi and get an autograph.  
   
 Q.   You lived in Vegas?  
SAM QUERREY:   Yeah.   I lived there from like '95 to '99.   Then I moved back ‑‑I live there now, last like four years.  
   
 Q.   You live in Vegas now?  
SAM QUERREY:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   When you were living there in '95 to '99 did your family live there?  
SAM QUERREY:   My whole family lived there.   My dad got transferred there for work.   My dad has continued to work there for the last like 20 years there.   And California.   Both places.  
   
 Q.   So are you splitting your time now?  
SAM QUERREY:   I split my time now.   I live in Vegas, but I practice at the Home Depot Center in Carson.  
   
 Q.   Are you into the whole Vegas scene?  
SAM QUERREY:   No.  
   
 Q.   When you live there, you don't even know it exists.  
SAM QUERREY:   No, I mean, most of the time we stay ‑‑ you know, we will be on the outskirts in Henderson and stay up there and play tennis and play golf.   Literally Anthem is where Emily, her parents live, and we will just stay there usually.  
   
 Q.   Oh, your girlfriend is from there, or fiancÃ©e?  
SAM QUERREY:   Yeah.   She's from there, too.   Emily.  
   
 Q.   What does she do?   Does she work?  
SAM QUERREY:   She used to work for KPMG Auditing, but she hasn't worked there for eight months.  
   
 Q.   What's her last name?  
SAM QUERREY:   McPherson.  
   
 Q.   So you just got engaged like last week?  
SAM QUERREY:   A week ago.  
   
 Q.   Did you have a romantic engagement?  
SAM QUERREY:   Somewhat.   I mean, it was in California at our.   When we're in California we have a condo that we live at there, and we had like a balcony out there.   It was just out there before dinner.  
   
 Q.   Do you have any wedding plans?   Too soon?   Any idea?  
SAM QUERREY:   Not yet.   Everyone keeps asking when the date is, but...  
   
 Q.   They want to save the date.  
SAM QUERREY:   We don't even know where we're going to do it.   We need to go home and knock out the details.  
   
 Q.   When you were in Vegas between '95 and '99, where did you work with?  
SAM QUERREY:   I was like eight, and Jeff Foley.  
   
 Q.   Nothing with Agassi's people?  
SAM QUERREY:   No, not at all.  
   
 Q.   No Red Foo?  
SAM QUERREY:   No.  
   
 Q.   Isn't he in Vegas?  
SAM QUERREY:   I don't know.   If he was he was irrelevant.   I don't think he was even doing anything then.  
   
 Q.   He was rich and irrelevant.
