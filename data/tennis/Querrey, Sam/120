   THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Sam. 

 Q.  It looked like there in the second set, I think it is the fourth game, you came back down from Love-40, and you had that ball at your feet and won the point there for the game.  Maybe in a might have been a turning point.  Did you feel the momentum changing there? 
 SAM QUERREY:  Yeah, because that game I was down Love-40 and stepped up like five times, just clocked some returns.  He kind of started to maybe get a little tight on his serve. 
 Definitely after I won that game, I knew in my head I was going to win.  I knew I was kind of at the point where I felt like I was going to win. 

 Q.  Pleased with your performance overall? 
 SAM QUERREY:  Yeah.  I mean, I could have played a little better.  But, yeah, for the first round it's nice to get by that, and hopefully I'll play a little better than that in my next one against Berdych on Friday.
