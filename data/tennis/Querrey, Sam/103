 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. How frustrating was it not being able to get on court yesterday and having to come back this morning?  
 SAM QUERREY: Kind of a pain yesterday. We waited around all day. Really didn't do anything. We went indoors today.   
 I like playing indoors. So I think it helped me out a little bit.  
  
  Q. Got a break in the second game of the first set. That set you up for the match?  
 SAM QUERREY: Pretty much, yeah. Actually happened in all four matches so far, or three of the four. So starting off well here.  
  
  Q. How important is starting off a match well to you?  
 SAM QUERREY: It's huge. If I win the toss, I choose to serve first. I like going out there and trying to get off to a quick start if I can.   
  
  Q. What were you pleased about with that performance today?  
 SAM QUERREY: Thought I served great. I mean, I really wasn't in trouble with my serve too many times. I thought I played a smart match.   
  
  Q. Did you notice any difference between the outdoor and indoor courts in terms of speed?  
 SAM QUERREY: I think it was a little slower indoors. Kind of cold in there. So the balls were a little dead.  
  
  Q. What do you do you between now and waiting for the final?   
 SAM QUERREY: just going to have some food, pack up my stuff at the hotel.
