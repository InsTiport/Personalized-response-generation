  7‑6, 7‑5

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Congratulations.   Did you see that one coming? 
SOFIA ARVIDSSON:   Not really.   I was just really excited to play night match against Sam on this nice court.   I came in the first day and I got to practice in arena and I said, Oh, I was hoping to play here one match. 
Yes, it was nice.

Q.   You played a steady match.   Is that where you felt you were consistent enough to weather the ups and downs?
SOFIA ARVIDSSON:   Yeah, I felt I ran down a lot balls and I was serving good and I tried to be aggressive.   She's tough, so, yeah, I knew I had to play my best to be able to win.   I took my chances.

Q.   Were you aware of her foot surgery?
SOFIA ARVIDSSON:   I've heard about it, yeah.

Q.   Did that change your game plan at all? 
SOFIA ARVIDSSON:   Not really.   I mean, I don't want to be the one who is running against her so I try to make her run.   It's not so easy.

Q.   Did you feel she moved well? 
SOFIA ARVIDSSON:   I think she did.   I mean, she's a great athlete.   I don't know how she's feeling, but, yeah. 

Q.   When Maria was in here before, she said there is more depth in the women's tour now than ever. 
SOFIA ARVIDSSON:   Yeah.

Q.   Is that the way it feels to someone like you that's ranked in the 40s?   Do you feel there is not much of a gap?
SOFIA ARVIDSSON:   Yeah, I think so.   There are so many good tennis players, and end of last year I had beaten a few of the top 20 players and that made me feel more confidence.
Yeah, I think it's really tough to‑‑ I mean, there is a few that's better than the others, but it's fun.   Tough tournaments. 

Q.   You have a bit of an Australian connection with Lars.   Have you practiced much with him?
SOFIA ARVIDSSON:   My coach? 

Q.   Yeah. 
SOFIA ARVIDSSON:   Yeah, we actually said this year ‑‑ I mean, every year I am coming from Sweden down to Australia or New Zealand, and I feel so much after all the other people because it's so cold at home and so hot here. 
So this year we went before Christmas and we were staying in Melbourne few days practicing.   Yeah, it felt good.   Trying to get into the conditions.

Q.   At Melbourne Park you were practicing?
SOFIA ARVIDSSON:   Exactly, yes.

Q.   Looked like you really attacked Sam's second serve tonight.   Was that a deliberate thing? 
SOFIA ARVIDSSON:   Yeah, I mean the second serve is really tough.   It's a good kick serve, so you have to step in and take it early, otherwise it's not so good.   So I try to be aware of that, yeah. 

Q.   She made you work very hard to close it out, particularly in that first set. 
SOFIA ARVIDSSON:   Yeah, she's a great player.   Against those players you have to win.   They're not going to lose.
I just tried to fight every point, yeah. 

Q.   Is it hard for Sam in Australia, do you think?   This time last year it was a bit of a recurring thing with Sam that she might struggle here a bit more than overseas.   Do you sense that?
SOFIA ARVIDSSON:   I don't know.   I know when I'm playing at home it's a few more nerves playing.   You want to really do well.
But I think she's going to bounce back.   She's playing I think Sydney and Australian Open, and I hope she's going to do well.
