S. WILLIAMS/S. Arvidsson
  6‑2, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Sofia, how much of a factor was the sun out there today?   It looked hot. 
SOFIA ARVIDSSON:   Yeah, I think for both of us that side was very difficult to serve.   Kind of you don't see the ball.

Q.   On that last serve that Serena had, did you miss it entirely or were you able to get a piece of that?
SOFIA ARVIDSSON:   I think like the wind caught it a little bit.   I don't know. 
It was a good serve.   Yeah. 

Q.   If you could just talk a little bit about how she played, especially in the second set.   It seemed like she was really dominating. 
SOFIA ARVIDSSON:   Yeah, she was just too good.   She showed why she's No. 1.
Yeah, I couldn't really do anything. 

Q.   Overall, how would you assess your weekend here, the two matches together?   Are you more or less happy with what you were able to accomplish?
SOFIA ARVIDSSON:   Well, the match is not over yet so it's hard to say.   I still hope to play one more game here.
Of course I'm very happy with my win yesterday.   Today was also fun to play, even though I lost.

Q.   How difficult was it out there with the conditions, the heat, the humidity?   You've talked about the sun a little bit.   Must be tough to muster up the energy to take on the No. 1 player in the world?
SOFIA ARVIDSSON:   It's tough for both of us.   It's not only on my side. 
She was just too good today.
