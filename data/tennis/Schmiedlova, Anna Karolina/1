A. SCHMIEDLOVA/R. Vinci
  6‑1, 6‑0

THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.

Q. At least you got to play a match here. You got a win. How was it? Was it weird at all this entire week? What was it like being an alternate?
ANNA KAROLINA SCHMIEDLOVA: Yeah, never happened before so I didn't know what to expect. I know it's going to be tough because all of the best players going to come. 
So when I saw they are all here, I knew that probably I won't even play. So even this one match was great for me. All week was a great experience. 
I could practice at least with the top players, and now I play one match here. It was really great. Was good week. 

Q. Not a lot of players get to end their season with a win. 
ANNA KAROLINA SCHMIEDLOVA: That's true.

Q. You get to do that. What does your off‑season look like from here on out? Will you take some time off? Where will go? When do you think you'll get back to training?
ANNA KAROLINA SCHMIEDLOVA: I'm going home for a few days. I live in other city as I practice, so I will be home after four months or something, so I'm very happy.
Then maybe I go do for holiday with my family, brother and father probably somewhere. Maybe Dubai or something, I don't know, for a few days. 
Then we start with physical preparation. But I stay in Slovakia for that. 

Q. Expecting quite tough match, but seemed pretty quick today. What do you think of the performance of your opponent?
ANNA KAROLINA SCHMIEDLOVA: Well, I expected tough match as well. I think I played pretty well. I was happy with my game, so I don't know. Roberta is amazing player. I'm not sure. She's in semis already, right? Maybe when she know she's there‑ I don't want to say play worse ‑ but it's weird feeling for her as well.
