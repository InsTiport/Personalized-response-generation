J. CRAYBAS/B. Jozami
  6-2, 6-1

 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Betina. 

 Q. How did you feel going into the match today? Did you feel confident? What were your feelings going in? 
 BETINA JOZAMI: I don't know. I mean, I tried to do my best at the beginning of the first set. It was 2-All, then she started to play better than me. I started to hit too many balls out of the court. So it was 3-2, 4-2, 5-2. It goes not that quick, but I couldn't come back. 
 Then in the second set, the first of the second set, I tried again to do the same thing. She made so few mistakes. Not like me, I made so many. So there it is. One day you play good, the other day you play bad. Today was her day. 

 Q. In the first set, after she broke you, you broke her right back. I think it was deuce four times. What were your feelings at that point?
 BETINA JOZAMI: The one we went to the net? Which one? 

 Q. The first set. 
 BETINA JOZAMI: She won the point. I don't like when I lost those points. 
 But it was okay. Maybe that point was, you know, the key to keep winning the games. But she played very good the other game, so that's it. 

 Q. Now thinking about tomorrow, you're facing a player you've never played. How are your feelings for tomorrow? 
 BETINA JOZAMI: I think is gonna be a tough match also. I have to play much better than today so I can win. 
 But let's see how she is doing today and prepare for tomorrow. Maybe we practice in the afternoon. Today it wasn't good. But tomorrow is going to be a different day. Maybe I play better. I hope so. 

 Q. Did Gisela give you any advice on playing Jill? 
 BETINA JOZAMI: Yeah, she gave me. But obviously I can't pay attention to her. I don't know. I need to be more patient in the court. She has experience and I don't. Maybe that was a big mistake today. 
 But she's better than me. Just she's that.
