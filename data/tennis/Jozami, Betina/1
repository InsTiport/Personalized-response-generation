 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Can we have your overall feelings after that first set. What happened?   
 BETINA JOZAMI: I don't know. I mean, I play good the first set, and then she started to play obviously better than me. I couldn't come back like the first set. I lost.   
  
  Q. The other day in your other match you were saying that once you lose a little your concentration, it's difficult for you to come back to the game. Do you feel this happened today?  
 BETINA JOZAMI: Yeah, maybe that happened. I don't know. I don't know how to explain it. If I have a reason why I lose concentration, I couldn't tell you because I cannot come back when that's happen to me.   
 Well, we have the doubles. I don't know who is playing. Maybe I'm not playing. Maybe I play. I don't know. Going to talk with the coach and try to get the last point.
