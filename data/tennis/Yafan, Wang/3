MELICHAR-PESCHKE/Wang-Duan   
6-1, 4-6, 10-7   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in Chinese.   
 Q.  Talk about the match today.  This is the first time you played together.  Can you share any thoughts on working together?  
DUAN YINGYING: We were actually together many times in many tournaments.  From the end of last year, we've been working together.   
Well, today on court, especially in the first set, we lost the set very quickly.  When we were up 2-Love, we didn't take opportunities, which was a pity.  In the third set, we felt being doubles players, they are professional doubles players.  In a super tiebreak, their tactics, their plans are more versatile than ours.   
 Q.  For China's tennis, we see better players in doubles, actually encouraging more women to play in the singles.  Do you think it is still the case today?  
WANG YAFAN: Well, I see a higher level of play in singles, too.  Zheng Shuai is doing really well.  More people are interested in singles.
