Q.   How much did Nestor pay you to put him inside?
KARL HALE:   No, he actually didn't want to go inside.   He wanted to play outside.   No, Daniel is great for the sport.   Great guy.

Q.   So what's cooking? 
KARL HALE:   Yeah, today was a tough day, you know, with the rain and the players are all a little bit frustrated because they want to get out there and play.   We had some stops and starts today, but I think it was good to call it early tonight to let them get into their routines tonight, their eating schedule, their massages and get ready because they're playing twice tomorrow.
After this Olympics schedule, I think it's important that we protect the players as much as we can, and I think we've been doing that this week. 

Q.   If worse comes to worse tomorrow, what happens? 
KARL HALE:   Well, it's a discussion we're going to have tomorrow to see what happens, if we're going to do two on Saturday and two on Sunday.   But we haven't got to that point yet.   It's a possibility.   Have to wait and see until later tomorrow. 

Q.   What was the conversation like with Andy today?
KARL HALE:   It was very good.   You know, I think it was tremendous of him to come here after that gold medal victory, and very honorable of him.   He sent me a note on Saturday before the Olympics final saying he's coming for sure.   It's important to the tournament, so he'll be here. 
And our conversation he just said he tweaked his knee a little bit.   Happened in the finals of Wimbledon and aggravated even more in the match yesterday.   He can't risk hurting it even more, so he had to shut it down. 
I just thanked him for coming and thought it was great that he's here and just get better and we'll see him next year in MontrÃ©al. 

Q.   With all the matches that were pushed back, for tomorrow, if it is well enough for the weather to play, will there be an early start time or will it go at the same schedule?
KARL HALE:   Pretty much a normal day.   We don't start earlier than 11:00, just due to the fact that they have to play two matches ‑   with the exception of Milos who got the walkover today. 

Q.   Have you got a contingency in mind in case‑ heaven forbid ‑ it has to do an extra day?
KARL HALE:   Into Monday, you mean? 

Q.   Yeah.
KARL HALE:   Monday is a possibility, but we'll get there after probably tomorrow night and have that discussion.   As of right now, we're still on schedule to finish our 7:00 p.m. final on Sunday.
