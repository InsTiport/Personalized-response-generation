  6‑2, 6‑1 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Have you ever won a trophy that's too heavy to lift before?  
FLAVIA PENNETTA:   No.   I was try now to hold it, but it is heavy.  
   
 Q.   How does it feel?  
FLAVIA PENNETTA:   Happy.   Really happy.  
   
 Q.   Earlier this week you said you couldn't believe it if you were to make the final here, and now you're the champion.   
FLAVIA PENNETTA:   Yeah.   I couldn't believe it.  
   
 Q.   Did you think about that going in?  
FLAVIA PENNETTA:   I think I need few days to realize.   Right now I'm too calm, I think.   I'm supposed to be more...   
But I'm too calm.   I call my dad, and he was, like he couldn't breathe.   And I tell him, Papa, Respirare, breathe.   Okay.   
   
 Q.   Did you talk to anybody else or just your father?  
FLAVIA PENNETTA:   Papa and mama.  
   
 Q.   They're tired?  
FLAVIA PENNETTA:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   I know you're saying it's still very early and you're realizing that you've won this, but what can something like this really mean to you with the length of career that you've had, and last year where you came so close to retiring?  
FLAVIA PENNETTA:   I think this one is ‑‑ after so many years so much work and everything, this is the moment I always waiting for, no?   And it's coming when you doesn't expect and everything, because in the beginning of the week I never expect to be the champion or to be in the final or semifinal.  
I mean, I was here and tried to play my best tennis, but just be realize.   So for me it was something I was waiting since long time, and finally I have a good trophy in my hands.  
   
 Q.   How hard is that, I guess, psychologically?   Because the way tennis works, you play a lot of weeks in the year, and almost every week you have to end almost by losing.   
FLAVIA PENNETTA:   Well, this is tennis.   I mean, tennis gives you a good moment but really short.   I mean, you never enjoy a lot, because the day after you have to go back in the court and play another match.  
But now I have few days to enjoy and to starting to be focused again, because in four days I have to play in Miami.  
Of course tomorrow is going to be day off, and maybe have a good dinner with some friends in Miami because there are so many Italian players there.   The Fed Cup captain also coming, and maybe we can have a good dinner together.  
But after that, Tuesday I have to starting again.  
   
 Q.   Winning a million dollars, are you paying for the dinner?  
FLAVIA PENNETTA:   I have to.   (Winking.) (Laughing.)   
   
 Q.   Even before the injury you broke into the top 10.   Is this still a goal then or a dream then?   Did you think you could win a premier mandatory tournament?  
FLAVIA PENNETTA:   It was a dream, and every player has a dream to think, no?   Roland Garros, one Grand Slam, is always the first dream you have.  
But after that, this one is one of the best tournaments in the world.   It's mine today (smiling).   
   
 Q.   Physically over the course of two weeks and all those matches...   
FLAVIA PENNETTA:   Now I'm fine.   I'm perfect.   I'm good now.   Maybe tomorrow I start to have everything tight, so many pain.  
   
 Q.   What would you rate higher:   being the first Italian to be in the top 10 or winning this?  
FLAVIA PENNETTA:   I have to decide?   
   
 Q.   Well, just like having to decide on playing Aga the other night, yes.   
FLAVIA PENNETTA:   No, I can't (smiling).   I mean, it's so important.   Was so important for Italy to have someone in the top 10.   Also it's gonna be really important ‑‑I was talking with my dad, and he told me everyone is so exciting with this moment.   I mean, TV, radio, everyone talking about this moment.  
So I think it's important in the same way to be top 10.   So I don't want to decide.   
   
 Q.   How much sweeter do you think it is, given that you were thinking about going away exactly 12 months ago?  
FLAVIA PENNETTA:   I mean, it's incredible.   Something amazing.   Because I perfectly remember after the match with Francesca last year, the day after I was in the garden running and talking with my physio, Max, almost crying because the feeling and everything was so bad.  
And now, after one year, we have the trophy.   So he is happy also because we work so much for the injury and everything.   So I think without him, without my coach, my family, maybe I was not here.   I mean, I quit.  
   
 Q.   You're up to No. 12 now in the rankings.   
FLAVIA PENNETTA:   Yeah.   (Pumping fist.)  
   
 Q.   At some point this year it could happen that we have three players in the top 10 32 years old.   Why do you think that is?   With the success later in the career?   What's your thought on that?  
FLAVIA PENNETTA:   I hope so.   I think 32, okay, we are old, but we still good athletes.   I mean, we work physically.   We are strong.   We have one point more from the other one that we have so many years on the tour, and we know how to handle the emotion and everything.  
But there is no one like Francesca.   She is 34, and I think she is one of the most powerful players on the tour.  
If your body is good, I think you can do good things.  
   
 Q.   But just the maintaining of your body and being fit is the toughest part?  
FLAVIA PENNETTA:   Yeah, you have to.  
   
 Q.   Getting the trophy at this moment, does it feel to get more throughout the season according to how you feel right now, or is it just...   
FLAVIA PENNETTA:   Well, of course after this event everything‑‑ you feel better, no?   But I don't expect too many things.   I mean, I prefer to play every match in the same way, try to play my best tennis all the time when I go on the court.  
But I don't have any new goal after this tournament.   I mean, I still in the same focus on the same way.   Improve my game, improve the way I have to be in the court, believe more, and be aggressive, and go for the winner more times.  
This is the way I would like to improve my game.  
   
 Q.   So are you going to update your autobiography, your book?  
FLAVIA PENNETTA:   No.   No.   One is enough (smiling).   
   
 Q.   On that, though, Li Na put out her book in English and then she won a big tournament, the Australian Open, an English‑speaking country.   So when are we getting English version of your book?  
FLAVIA PENNETTA:   Oh, really?   I don't know.   I have to ask.  
   
 Q.   We hear good things about it.   
FLAVIA PENNETTA:   Nice.   It's not like a book.   It's more diary, how do you say, of my life.   There is everything.   There is tennis, but not too much.   There is more Flavia like a person and not like a player.   
Like a player, everybody know me.   But person it's so difficult for the fans to understand who you are.  
   
 Q.   What was it like for you to win the title, to go over to your box, and then Fabio dumps water all over you?  
FLAVIA PENNETTA:   No, nothing.   It was hot, so it was good (smiling).  
   
 Q.   Did you ask him to stay, or did he volunteer to stay?  
FLAVIA PENNETTA:   I ask him.   Was not too big deal for him to stay here because he supposed to leave today, so he just moved the flight to late and not to 2:00.  
   
 Q.   (Question regarding Jose Perlas.)  
FLAVIA PENNETTA:   No.   JosÃ© was‑‑ I know him since so many years.   I mean, is no big deal to get in Miami three or four hours before.   Nothing change.
