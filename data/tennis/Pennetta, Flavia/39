P. KVITOVA/F. Pennetta
  3-6, 6-3, 6-3

 THE MODERATOR: Questions.

 Q. You won the first set, then what happened after that?
 FLAVIA PENNETTA: She won the second and the third.

 Q. Did she improve or did your game drop away?
 FLAVIA PENNETTA: No. I think she's improve and I started to don't hit that hard the ball.
 But she play really good tennis, I think.

 Q. Where has she improved?
 FLAVIA PENNETTA: Well, she's starting to serve much better. The return was much better, so... A few things.

 Q. After the attention and the hype around her last match, a win over Stosur, did you think that could play into your hands, she might start slower?
 FLAVIA PENNETTA: Sorry, I don't understand the question.

 Q. After her game against Stosur Saturday night, lots of attention on it, considered a big loss from Australia's point of view. Did you think that might play into your hands, she might start slowly tonight?
 FLAVIA PENNETTA: No, I don't think so. I think I was starting really, really good. She make a lot of mistake, but a lot of winner, also.
 She play like this, she can play really good in the moment, sometimes really bad. But it's not easy to play against her because you never have like the chance to play three and four ball because the ball going in or out really quickly.
 I think she was ready for this match. She was really good today.
