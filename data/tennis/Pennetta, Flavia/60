  Q.  Maria said to us earlier that she didn't care if the noise she made upset her opponent.  How difficult was it for you to play against the noise she was making?  It seemed to get louder as the match went on.   
 FLAVIA PENNETTA:  (Through translation.)  I didn't pay attention to it.  She's always like that.  We know that she plays like that.   
 Is not a problem.  We are used to it.   
  
  Q.  Does it ever come to a point where it becomes unacceptable?   
 FLAVIA PENNETTA:  (Through translation.)  No, not in this match.  In other matches, yes.  But not in this one.
