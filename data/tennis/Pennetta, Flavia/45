  Q. Were you nervous?   
 FLAVIA PENNETTA: No. Normal. Just another match. You know, you have to play with another player. You get on the court and you try your best.   
 Normal. Nothing special.   
  
  Q. Did you have the same preparation you usually do on every other game?  
 FLAVIA PENNETTA: Everything the same, yes. Nothing different.   
  
  Q. Was the weather condition okay for you?  
 FLAVIA PENNETTA: Yes, the weather was normal. They said is going to come the storm today, but doesn't. So was good. Was the same for me, for her, for all the player.
