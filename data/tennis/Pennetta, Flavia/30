 F. PENNETTA/A. Cornet
  0‑6, 7‑6, 6‑2 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Congratulations.   
FLAVIA PENNETTA:   Thanks.  
   
 Q.   Can you explain the turnaround from 6‑Love?  
FLAVIA PENNETTA:   Not really.   Well, I think I start really tight in the beginning.   I didn't push her at all, like any ball from a good from the beginning.  
I don't know why.   I was trying to do that, but no chance.   She was really aggressive.   She was playing not really well, but really consistent from the beginning.  
After the first set I just tried to hit more and more, and then the ball starting to be a little bit of power and my serve starting to work a little bit also.  
So she get nervous also, I have to say.   Like in the first two or three games she starting to be a little bit nervous, because she saw my (through translation)   my reaction, my comeback.   
The tiebreak was crazy.   The second set I think I starting to just enjoy a little bit more and just play my tennis.   
I have to say I'm really happy about this match today.   I hope to starting better in the next round.   
   
 Q.   Next round against Flipkens again.   
FLAVIA PENNETTA:   Yeah, again.   
   
 Q.   Will it be a completely different match than in Paris?  
FLAVIA PENNETTA:   You never know.   I hope so, because in Paris I lose.   I would like to win this time.  
   
 Q.   Do you rate your chances higher on grass than on clay?  
FLAVIA PENNETTA:   No, I think she plays really good on these courts, so it's going to be a tough match.  
I would like just to play my game.   In the first set today I was feeling so bad because didn't do nothing with the ball.   Nothing at all.   It was not my game at all.  
So I would like to just play my game, enjoy, and we will see what happened.
