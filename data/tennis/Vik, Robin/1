THE MODERATOR:  First question, please. 


Q.  How would you describe your center court debut?  You went down in five sets, but you must have a wonderful feeling about yourself. 

ROBIN VIK:  When I came on the court in the first set I was a little bit nervous from the beginning.  I felt a little bit nervous.  Then in second set, I feel pretty good.  Third set also.  In the fifth set, when the sun go a little bit down, there was a little bit shadow going from the left side.  I have a little bit problem with the vision of the ball.  And then in the fifth set, I think he played better than me in the fifth set. 

Q.  Was it mental or physical tiredness that got you in the end?

ROBIN VIK:  I think I feel a little bit like at the finish.  I cannot serve as well as before.  So maybe that was the reason why I cannot move so good in the fifth set also. 

Q.  What have you learned from today's match?

ROBIN VIK:  So I learned that I can play with everybody now at the moment.  I hope I can do better in the other tournaments, and maybe I can beat him next time, or somebody from the top 10. 

Q.  You think the surface was a problem for you?  You made some shots that not every human being can make. 

ROBIN VIK:  I feel pretty good on the surface.  I have no problem with that.  I feel really good on this surface. 

Q.  What did you say to the umpire in the fifth set?

ROBIN VIK:  I just ask him if he isn't sure, he wasn't sure was out or not.  It doesn't matter if it is out or it is good.  I just want to be sure next time.  I ask him if he can be sure.  That's what I told him. 

Q.  Before the match, you were really confident that you could make it a match.  You were on the money.  Why was that?  What was it about the particular match that you gave yourself a lot of chance to cause a big upset? 

ROBIN VIK:  Yeah, I don't know.  I feel really, really good till the sun go a little bit down.  Then the shadow goes from the left side, I already feel like I'm not 100% concentrated because I was thinking about the shadow.  Maybe that's the reason why I didn't won today. 

Q.  Before the match you were very confident.  You played very well today.  What was it before the match that gave you this confidence going in?

ROBIN VIK:  Probably it was that I have confidence from the last season, yeah.  But anyway, I played two tournaments before.  I won two last matches probably, like I was match point down in Doha with Pavel, then three set points down against Feliciano López in Auckland.  So maybe that's the reason why I feel so good. 

Q.  What about Hewitt?  Did you feel he was more vulnerable than he was previously?

ROBIN VIK:  Yeah, I saw his results from the last two tournaments.  I think he's not feeling as good as he feeling normally.  I think I have really good chance to beat him today.  Maybe I don't have the chance like this anywhere in my life.  Yeah, that's it. 

Q.  Was part of your strategy to push Hewitt from side to side constantly and make him run as much as possible?

ROBIN VIK:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, because I saw his -- when he played first match I think in Adelaide, he feel really bad on the court.  I tried to move him as much as I can. 

Q.  Where will we see you next?

ROBIN VIK:  I'm going back to Europe.  I try to play some indoors tournament like in Zagreb, then Marseille and Rotterdam.
