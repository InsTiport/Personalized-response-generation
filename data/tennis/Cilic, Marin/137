  5-7, 5-7, 6-1, 7-6, 10-8

 THE MODERATOR: Questions. 

 Q. Were you very nervous this morning?
 MARIN CILIC: I was a little bit. I can't say that I wasn't. It's my first occasion like this to continue the match in the fifth set in that kind of tight situation. 
 I was feeling well before the match. But when I stepped inside, when we started to play points, I was a little bit nervous. I think he dealt with it a little bit better and got an edge in the end. 

 Q. What did you do last night in order to try and relax?
 MARIN CILIC: Nothing special. I was doing the same routine before. I slept well. I eat well. Everything was fine. 

 Q. Do you think that you've learnt a lot from this match for next year, and for the US Open you'll be more prepared if you get into these situations?
 MARIN CILIC: Yeah, I mean, I would say also coming back from two sets to love and having that advantage in the fifth set with two times a break, also those two matchpoints, it is little bit disappointing that I lost and that I didn't win that in the end. 
 But I got to also be positive with myself that I had a lot of physical strength there, and I think also courage to come back with that adrenaline. I was really playing well from the third set on. As I felt like that on the court, he was a little bit lost, and I maybe needed just one or two points more in the decision moments and it would be over. 
 But next time (smiling).
