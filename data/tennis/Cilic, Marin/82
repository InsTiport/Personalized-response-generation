A flash interview with:   
MARIN CILIC   
 Q.  Many congratulations.  That was a tough contest, wasn't it?  
MARIN CILIC: Yeah, very tough.  I think Steve was playing pretty good today.  He was serving really well.  He was giving me a lot of trouble with his serve.  Unfortunately I played a little bit bad in that first-set tiebreak and I had to dig out this match from the second and third set.   
It wasn't easy.  I was first game in the third set Love-40 down, next game on my serve Love-30.  So I had to dig few chances out.   
But generally I'm happy with the way I'm playing, and just hopefully I can continue with good form.   
 Q.  Have you ever played a match where perhaps the key turning point right towards the end of the game was a decision by an umpire about a player touching the net?  
MARIN CILIC: Well, I haven't -- actually, I had few times in my career where I was touching the net, and that wasn't obviously pretty good.  Obviously it can turn around the condition on the court.   
But it sometimes can happen and it's grass and you can't really stop really close to the net.  But I think it was pretty good match today.   
 Q.  Obviously you won here four years ago.  You got to the final the year after.  This must be one of your favorite events on the circuit.  
MARIN CILIC: Yeah, absolutely.  I really enjoy to play here.  Grass suits my game.  When I'm in good form I can always play really, really well.   
Now looking forward to tomorrow's match.  I'm going to play either Andy or Kyle, so it's going to be probably a little bit of a crowd against me.  But I'm going to enjoy that.  I always enjoy the atmosphere here, and really thanks to everybody for your support.
