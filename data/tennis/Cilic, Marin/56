A flash interview with:
MARIN CILIC
Q. A third Aegon Championships final.  It's pretty clear that that means a lot to you.
MARIN CILIC: Definitely, especially the way I'm playing.  It's just amazing to get to the final.  Also considering that today's match was extremely high level.  I was playing really, really good throughout all the match.  Gilles was just pushing me to the limits.
It was not easy to keep calm after not converting a lot of break points I had in that second set and then losing it.  And then also, beginning of the third I had Love-40, lost that game.  But eventually I got the break and really played a great match.
Q. Gilles did manage to do something today which no other man has done this week, and that's create a break point on your serve.  He only did it in one game.  Do you feel like Superman when you step up to serve?
MARIN CILIC: No.  No, I don't (smiling).  But just this week I was feeling really good on my serve, and especially on the shots afterwards I was playing really well.  And also against Gilles today I was mixing it up really good and just playing really well, really smart in some critical points.  It's just paying off nicely.
Q. Usually I would ask you what you're going to do now to prepare for the final, but you have a doubles semifinal coming up later on today.  Only one man has ever done the singles and doubles double here.  It was Pete Sampras in 1995.  How much would you like to be the second?
MARIN CILIC: Oh, that would mean a lot, for sure.  I don't have a title in doubles in my career, so that would be nice, absolutely.  But you're playing later probably the best team, one of the best teams in the world against Soares and Jamie Murray.
It's going to be definitely interesting match.  Going to enjoy that and hope that we're going to go through.
