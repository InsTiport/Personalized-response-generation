  M. CILIC/R. Haase  6-2, 6-4, 6-2    THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   Q.  First Grand Slam match since the US Open.  Does it feel any different at all?  MARIN CILIC: No.  No, doesn't feel any different.  (Smiling.) You know, it's still a new season, new tournament here, and I'm focused to do the things that I have to do on the court to play well. What's been last year, it's behind me.  So those are nice memories, but this is present now.  Just focused to do well here.   Q.  In terms of how well you were playing there and having the injury problems, how do you get back to where you were?  How do you regain what you might have lost from your time off?  MARIN CILIC: Just takes bit of time.  Takes some wins obviously.  That's most important in any sport, I would guess. I feel the game is there; I'm playing all right on the trainings.  It's matter to put it in the matches. Sometimes, and actually very often, things can be working very well, but when you don't have enough wins, just at the crucial moments you might be taking wrong decisions. So I think it's very important for me at the moment to win as many matches as I can.   Q.  Is that just in terms of confidence or getting experience back?  MARIN CILIC: I think just confidence on the court.  I'm feeling good otherwise, even on trainings.  When I'm at the court I'm feeling confident; I feel that I'm playing good. Just it's sometimes that things don't set up themselves like when you are confident. I mean, for example, like when you have a lot of matches, wins, things like that, you're going to bring the best shots on some crucial moments. I think that's what helps you the most.   Q.  That's what you're missing now?  MARIN CILIC: Yeah.
