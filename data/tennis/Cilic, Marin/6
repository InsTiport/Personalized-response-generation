M. CILIC/J. Isner   
7-5, 3-6, 7-6, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Isner had 40 aces. How do you recover and end up winning?  
MARIN CILIC: I don't know. You wait for your chances. Actually, either a half chance or a third of a chance, so...   
Call it either lucky, to be a little bit lucky in that third-set tiebreak or just John missing a couple of his first serves when he needed them. Just getting the return back on the 6-4 score. Just being in the rally, giving myself a shot to win the points. Just grinding it.   
You can't do much when he's serving like that. You have to just be positive and, you know, wait for your chance when it comes. Luckily it came at critical moment. I took it. That definitely influenced the match really a lot.   
 Q.  Having that mentality, wait for your chances, do you think that will help the next round?  
MARIN CILIC: Well, in the next round I'm going to have to create chances with Rafa. He's definitely having a great season and playing really well. Play in Montreal great tennis, definitely on a nice roll. We played quite a few times already. We know each other really well.   
Definitely it's going to be on me on my own side of the court to try to serve well, be a little bit aggressive, and try to impose my game as much as I can. Obviously it's going to be tough anyhow. I'm going to have to be ready for a tough battle. Hopefully I'm going to win that one.   
 Q.  Do you have a more special feeling when you come to play here since this was a big moment for you?  
MARIN CILIC: Yeah, I do. Definitely, I do. It's definitely the place where I have the best memories from. Just enjoy my time around here.   
Still it's down to do the stuff that I need to on the court, put my head down, just work on my game, look to get better day by day.
