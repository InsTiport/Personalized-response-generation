S. WAWRINKA/M. Cilic   
6-3, 6-3, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  How quickly will you get going on your first tournament in grass?  When will you start practices?  
MARIN CILIC: Probably day after tomorrow.  Probably just rest tomorrow and probably play next week in 's-Hertogenbosch in Netherlands.   
Things are going well, especially these last few months, so want to definitely focus to continue with this good form.  Obviously today was not the best match that I could produce, and plus Stan was playing really good today.   
You know, I have to take positives, really, out of the tournament, out of the clay season has been the best ever.  And really looking forward for next tournament, especially grass.
