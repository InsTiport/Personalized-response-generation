 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. How did it go from your point of view?  
 MARIN CILIC: It was tough match. He's pretty solid player, and he doesn't give any points away. So during the match, I had to earn all my points, and the thing was that I start to serve pretty good from second set, and that helped me a lot and gave me a lot of free points. And I started to put much more pressure on him.   
 Like, during the fourth set, I lost few games that I shouldn't have on my serve. I was 40-15 up, and on his -- to come back I had Love-40, and those went on his side. Eventually I got back, and so we had a little thriller in tiebreak, but I was feeling physically very well, and in the fifth set, I didn't have too many problems.  
  
  Q. Who is your coach now?  
 MARIN CILIC: Well, Bob Brett is helping me a lot. He can't travel every week with me. He was in Toronto and Cincinnati, and in Wimbledon before that. So he couldn't come here, but he's going to be in couple of weeks in Beijing and Tokyo after, but all the time talking with him.  
  
  Q. Who's here with you now?  
 MARIN CILIC: Just a brother.
