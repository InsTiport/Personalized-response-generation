7-6, 6-4, 7-5
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How do you feel today went?  How was your performance in your eyes?
MARIN CILIC: I think was really, really good match.  High level from I think both of us.  Florian had obviously some chances, serving for the first and third set.
But I would say that I was returning quite good throughout the match.  Even though he was up with the score in the first set, I felt that I was, you know, playing well, returning well, just applying pressure.
From my own side, I was serving really good today, hit a lot of aces.  Serving percentage was also quite good.  I think that first set tiebreak I played extremely good and just put pressure on him.
Well, even before the match, I knew that Florian is playing really well on grass.  Today I felt he was hitting and coming up with some great shots, great points.  So it was definitely a tough one.
Q. Looking ahead, you haven't had a chance to think about it, but Stevie Johnson.  You've played him before.  When you think about what he brings to the table, what do you know you're going to have to look out for, what are you going to have to bring?
MARIN CILIC: We played last year in Queen's.  That was on grass, as well.  I know he likes to play on grass.  He won even tournament last year in Nottingham.
Obviously his really big weapons are the serve, when he's hitting the spots well, and his forehand.  So I'm obviously going to try to put a little bit more pressure on him, that he doesn't have as many forehands to hit.
Also with my own game, I need to be consistent in my serving and continue to play like I played.
