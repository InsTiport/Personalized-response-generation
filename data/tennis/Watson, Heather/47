 H. WATSON/T. Pironkova
  3‑6, 7‑5, 6‑2 
   
 Q.   So just talk about the match.   Obviously a great comeback for you.   What did you do to bring that back?  
HEATHER WATSON:   For me, today was just kind of sticking in there and just fighting through, even if I wasn't playing as well as I wanted to and just to hold on and keep fighting, working on the right attitude.  
Because when I do that, I feel my tennis follows.   I think that's what happened today.   I started playing better and better, especially off the ground.  
   
 Q.   You have beaten her here last year, too, right?   
HEATHER WATSON:   Not last year.   Four years ago.  
   
 Q.   Four years ago.   So what is it about‑‑ she's a two‑time Wimbledon semifinalist.   How does your game match up against hers, especially on her favorite surface?  
HEATHER WATSON:   Yeah, I have played her a few times and one of them being here four years ago.   I think I just know I've got my tactics, and I'm sticking with them.   I have just got to keep playing.  
I have to play very well to beat her, because she's a very good player.  
   
 Q.   Obviously not a short match and not an early match.   How are you feeling going into tomorrow?  
HEATHER WATSON:   It never is a short match with her.   I think all of our matches have been three sets, very close.  
But it's late, and I will do everything I can now.   I'm stretching with my fitness coach and physio treatment after and eating and sleeping and just getting prepared for tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Looking forward to Pennetta, what do you have to do in order to win that one?  
HEATHER WATSON:   I have just come off court, so I'm not even thinking about that yet.   But I know she's a very good player, and she's been playing well, especially this year, I think.  
So it will be another tough one, but I look forward to playing her for the first time.
