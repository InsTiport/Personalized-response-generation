S. STEPHENS/H. Watson
  6‑2, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You must be feeling a bit disappointed after that. 
HEATHER WATSON:   Yeah.   I wasn't happy with my performance today.   I just felt that I never got going at all.   I felt quite slow to the ball and slow reacting and just slow with my mind.
Therefore, I ended up making quite a lot of unforced errors.   But I still felt I had chances to get in the match.   I had a lot of games, especially on my serve, where I was up and I had points to close the game and I just let it slip away. 
Sloane was very solid.   She played great.   She didn't allow me to get back in, and I felt from the first ball she was pushing me on the back foot.

Q.   Did you feel a bit flat before the match at all?
HEATHER WATSON:   No.   I felt ready to play, just like I have been all the other days.
But maybe that's because she never let me get into it.   She never gave me any rhythm.   I didn't feel we had many long points at all.   It was lots of errors and winners from both of us.

Q.   At the beginning of the week you said it was all about getting some time on the grass.   I appreciate it's a little too soon to ask, but how happy overall are you with the run you had here?
HEATHER WATSON:   I wouldn't call it too much of a run.   I won two matches.   But I'm glad I was able to play three matches on the grass here. 
Now, looking at it in a positive way, I just have lots of time to prepare for Wimbledon and get down there as soon as possible and play on the courts there and just get in the frame of mind for that tournament now.

Q.   What goes through your mind when, after about 10 or 15 minutes, suddenly you find yourself 3‑ or 4‑Love down and it seems like everything is going against you?
HEATHER WATSON:   I just try to stay positive, try and fight for every single point no matter what the score is. 
If I don't think like that, then there is no chance I will get back in any match.   I just have to try and stay positive and keep trying to find a way with what I have on that day.
