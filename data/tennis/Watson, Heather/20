E. VESNINA/H. Watson
6-2, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Not an easy day for you.
HEATHER WATSON: No, I definitely didn't play well today.  I felt really out of timing and slow to the ball.
But I'm not taking anything away from Elena.  She played very well.  And when I had my chances to come back and get into the match, she hit an ace or always made her first serve and played well.
But, yeah, I didn't play good today.  How could I say?  I'm a little bit like tired from waiting around.  From Birmingham, I have just literally been doing this for like over a week.  So I was just a bit over it.
But I was glad we played today, at least.  But it happens.  That's part of it.  But tennis-wise, today I didn't have a good day.  But all if all, I have been feeling the ball really well.  I feel really good heading into Wimbledon.
Q. Is it an issue regarding the number of matches you have been able to play on grass?
HEATHER WATSON: No, I feel really good on the grass.  I feel like my timing is there, not including today.  Yeah, I look forward to Wimbledon.
Q. With the weather do you feel that you haven't had as much time on the courts, not just in matches but practices as you would have liked?
HEATHER WATSON: Of course I would have liked more, but I don't think it's really affected me.  When I started in Birmingham and I played my first match, I felt great.  I felt like I was used to the grass.  But then I had to practice a few times indoors, had to play a match indoors, a doubles match.
So it wasn't ideal, but that's the way it was.  I still feel fine on the grass.
Q. How much will getting some doubles time again with Naomi help, you think?
HEATHER WATSON: Like I said, I feel good.  I just need to get some good practice days in, some full days.  It would still be good to do well in the doubles here with Naomi.  First of all, I really enjoy playing here on the court and we get along great.  We play well together.  But I also really enjoy it and find it fun.
Q. Who are you playing doubles with at Wimbledon?
HEATHER WATSON: With Naomi.  I'm hoping, if we do well, that maybe we can play longer term in the future.
Q. I know you always love it back here, but with this weather does it make you yearn for a little bit of Florida warmth?
HEATHER WATSON: I just want no rain.  I don't mind if it's cold.  I just want no rain.
