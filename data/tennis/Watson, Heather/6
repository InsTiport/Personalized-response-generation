K. FLIPKENS/H. Watson
6-4, 7-5
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Your immediate reaction?
HEATHER WATSON: Obviously I'm really disappointed.  I felt good out there.  I thought I played well.  It was a high-quality match.
I created a lot of chances for myself, but just wasn't able to execute on those points that could have made a big difference.
Q. It was a great fight back in the second set.  Right at the end there, what was it that just made that difference?
HEATHER WATSON: You know, it was just literally a point here, a point there, that can change so much.  And, yeah, I thought to serve it out, that was the best service game she had had the whole match.
You know, she's confident, she's won a lot of matches on the grass, and I knew it was going to be a tough match going in, but I thought I played quite well and I gave myself chances.
Q. You kind of have been on a roller coaster over the grass court season, some losses but some positives.  Also at Eastbourne you were sort of down on yourself.  How do you walk away from this one?  Proud or disappointed?  Bit of both?
HEATHER WATSON: Yeah, I mean, I can't beat myself up too much, because I tried my best.  Unfortunately, it just wasn't good enough today.
But, you know, you can fall down the rankings and lose matches here and there, but you can also climb up the rankings just as quick.  So I'm not worried about that.  I think a tennis career is full of ebbs and flows.  It's just part of it.
You don't win every single week.  I wouldn't say my grass court season has been up and down.  I'd say the whole year has been up and down (smiling).
Q. You obviously are still here in the doubles to look forward to.  In terms of long term, looking long term in singles, what could you do or is there anything that you are thinking of doing to try and reverse, you know, the rankings, you know, the slide?  Because you'll dip, I suppose, won't you, after this?
HEATHER WATSON: I think I have already dipped.
But, yeah, I'm just going to continue trying to improve myself, get myself in a good frame of mind.  I will, after Wimbledon, I will have a couple of weeks and I can get into great shape.  Just, you know, life isn't all about tennis and just make sure I'm just happy off the court first and foremost.
Q. Couple weeks break with light training, proper training?
HEATHER WATSON: Yeah, it's not, like, off.  Two weeks before my next tournament in San Jose.
Q. In terms of the doubles, it's like at least you get a chance to get more match confidence, I guess, is the best way of putting it?
HEATHER WATSON: Yeah, I think doubles is a very different game to singles.  I definitely want to do well.  I mean, it's Wimbledon.  I want to do well in everything.
But I'll definitely enjoy out there.  I always do.  I always enjoy playing doubles and mixed doubles, especially with my two partners that I have here.
Yeah, just continue to work hard on the practice court.
Q. You're mixed with?
HEATHER WATSON: Henri.
