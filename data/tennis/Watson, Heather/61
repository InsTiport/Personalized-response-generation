H. WATSON/I. Benesova
  6‑2, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Best win?   Best performance?
HEATHER WATSON:   I was very pleased with how I played today.   I prepared myself as best as I could. 
Today I was watching videos of my opponent playing, so I was going in confident.   I'd been practicing well.   I'd mentally prepared myself, as well. 
I just had so much fun out there today.   I was pleased that we got put on centre.   I've never played on centre before.   But it was tough hanging round all day and not knowing what court we were going to be on, but it worked out for the better.

Q.   Like graveyard watch?
HEATHER WATSON:   Yeah.   There was lots of hanging around.   I actually went back to my host family who live like just at the back of Aorangi, which is perfect.   Having a little nap in the day.

Q.   4 out of the 20 breakpoints you took. 
HEATHER WATSON:   In the first set it was the same game at 4‑1.   We had this really long game.   Well, I thought it was long at the time, not until we reached the second one.   But Iveta ended up winning that game at 4‑1 to go 4‑2. 
And then in the second set, again at 4‑1, we had I don't know how many deuces it was, but it was a lot.   I kept thinking, This is the one.   I'm going to win this one.   I went for it every time.   But she just ended up playing too good that point or I'd make a mistake. 
But, yeah, I kind of had a little smile of relief after that game was over.

Q.   How much do you think of things, you know, from the Lucie win?   You have beaten a much higher‑ranked player. 
HEATHER WATSON:   Well, it's a different day, a different surface, a different opponent.   I just try and get ready and prepare myself to try to play my best tennis on that day no matter who it is or who it's against.

Q.   How long before the match did you find out you were going on centre?
HEATHER WATSON:   Well, if Gulbis won in three then we were on centre.   If he didn't, I think we were going on to Court1.   We had to see how that match went.   So we didn't know till the last minute, when he actually won the match. 
But it's fine.   We're always put in different situations like that.   It's tough, but it's better than, say, when it's raining, coming on and off, on and off.

Q.   And it was good not to have too much time to think about being on centre. 
HEATHER WATSON:   Yeah, that was good actually.   But when I heard I was really excited because I hadn't played on that court before.

Q.   How did you find it on centre, the crowd?
HEATHER WATSON:   The crowd was awesome.   I kept getting the tingles.   Especially after I won I kind of got a bit lost and couldn't find my way off the court. 
But, yeah, I really enjoy playing on centre.   I've had a few challenges, and they were so close.   I couldn't believe that they weren't touching the line, both of them. 
But, yeah, it was good fun. 

Q.   How did it compare to the way you imagined it to be?
HEATHER WATSON:   You have to be out there to feel it.   It's just an unbelievable feeling.   I'm getting to the stage now, and this is why I've been playing tennis almost my whole life, for moments like those.   It's just my dream, and I love to be in that moment and experiencing all that.

Q.   But was it bigger?   Smaller?   Did something feel different? 
HEATHER WATSON:   Oh.   Yeah, it probably felt a bit bigger being out there than seeing it on TV. 

Q.   Is there a sense of relief to get through the first round?   You tend to attract attention.   Now it's a sense of refocusing. 
HEATHER WATSON:   I'm very pleased with my first‑round win, but I'm not satisfied with just a first round.   I'm looking forward to my next match.   I think it's against Jamie Hampton.   She had a good first‑round win. 
You know, I'm looking to go deep into the tournament and not settle for one win.

Q.   Have you played her before?
HEATHER WATSON:   I played her in Auckland about two years ago, so a while ago. 

Q.   Result?
HEATHER WATSON:   I won. 

Q.   Johanna Konta was 7‑All in the third set with McHale.
HEATHER WATSON:   Did they stop?

Q.   Yeah. 
HEATHER WATSON:   Oh, I didn't know how that match was going. 

Q.   How much contact have you had with Johanna?   Do you think it's good to have her in the mix amongst the British players now?
HEATHER WATSON:   Yeah, I get along very well with Johanna.   We actually a few weeks ago went to the movies.   She's lived here in England most of her life anyway. 
Yeah, it's brilliant.   I can't believe they've had to stop at 7‑All.   I'll be watching that tomorrow. 

Q.   In Roland Garros you had a very good win against Vesnina.   Does it give you more confidence when something like that happens?
HEATHER WATSON:   Yeah, Vesnina is a great player.   I actually thought she would give Venus some trouble. 
But it does.   Everybody in these slams, all these girls can play.   They can play great tennis.   It's just coming out there on the day and who's got the most heart and who's going to fight the longest and who's going to be out there. 
I think winning these matches in the slams is giving me more confidence, making me want to go deeper into the tournament, and I'm gaining a lot of experience and learning a lot from it.

Q.   Laura overtook you in the rankings recently.   Did she say anything to you when she had done that?   Is that a goal for you to overtake her?
HEATHER WATSON:   No, she didn't say anything.   I think we'll just be going up the rankings together.   Keep climbing the ladder.   Each week can be different gaining points, defending points. 
It goes up and down, everybody's rankings does.   We don't look at that.   She played well last week.   I'm excited to play doubles with her here.   Hopefully we get to play together in the Olympics, but we don't know anything about that yet. 

Q.   Did you speak to Tara Wallace about that?
HEATHER WATSON:   I didn't see any of her match in Birmingham.   Like I say, I did.   I watched some video analysis of her today.

Q.   You mentioned that you wanted to be more aggressive.   Is that a decision you made yourself or talking to the guys that help you?
HEATHER WATSON:   I think to take my game to the next level, we had to do that anyway.   And my coach said that to me.   I wanted to do that anyway.   I'll do anything to improve my game and keep climbing the ladder and getting better.   Everybody is doing everything they can to get better, so you're going to have to take risks. 
Actually, one of my favorite quotes is, The biggest risk is not taking any.   That's one of my favorites.   So, yeah, more aggressive.
