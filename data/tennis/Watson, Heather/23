6-1, 6-3   
An interview with:   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Give us your verdict on the match today.  
HEATHER WATSON: I thought my opponent played just a lot better than me today.  She played really well.  First set I thought she was pretty flawless.   
Second set I had a couple chances here and there to get even, get back in there.  But, yeah, she just played really well on the important points.   
I remember at 4-2, to win that game she hit a backhand behind the baseline on the run down the line.  Like there wasn't much I could do.   
I fought the whole way through and tried.  I think she also tactically played me smart.  I didn't get chances to run around and hit my forehand.  She was just keeping it on my backhand consistently.   
I tried different things:  dropshots and a few lobs.  Lobs definitely didn't work; dropshots did but I didn't get an opportunity to hit them.  A couple I hit were balls that I usually wouldn't.   
 Q.  I think this is the fifth time you've been in the second round.  What do you feel like you need to do to make it further?  
HEATHER WATSON: Well, I don't know.  Just take it match by match.  I was feeling really good going out there today with my game and everything, but there is a big factor.  That's the other person on the other side of the court.  I thought she just played very well today.   
 Q.  We've been through quite a few different organizational solutions this year with your mum being around and your dad being around.  Are you sort of going to continue to mix things up?  
HEATHER WATSON: Yeah, it will still be mixed up.  It'll be Diego some weeks; it will still be my mum some weeks.  I think my mum will be with me the next couple tournaments on the grass.   
Hopefully Pat Harrison also.  But those will be more on the stateside tournament.   
 Q.  Your dad has been ruled out, has he?  
HEATHER WATSON: Yeah.  Dad has been ruled out.   
 Q.  She's a very vocal player and also got called for time in the second set.  She seemed to be getting slower and slower.  Do you feel that perhaps that wasn't called soon enough, and also if you had managed to stay out there a bit longer, do you think she may have tired and given you a better chance or were you not aware of that?  
HEATHER WATSON: I genuinely didn't notice she was taking too long in between points.  It didn't bother me at all.  Because it was consistent, so I guess I didn't notice it.  She wasn't doing it on purpose.   
I feel in that second set definitely it became more physical, longer points, and I kind of wish it was five sets today.   
 Q.  What's your schedule now and how much do you or do you ever think about that Serena match from last year?  
HEATHER WATSON: No, I don't, and now I've got doubles.  I'm pretty sure we'll be scheduled tomorrow.  From there, it'll just be a bit of rest and straight onto the grass.   
 Q.  (Off microphone.)  
HEATHER WATSON: Yeah.   
 Q.  Is there any thought that -- I think you'll make the Olympic cutoff, but you could potentially play another tournament before the cutoff, couldn't you?  Isn't it June 6th?  
HEATHER WATSON: So if I played a tournament next week?   
 Q.  Yeah.  
HEATHER WATSON: I definitely wouldn't.   
 Q.  Do you feel safe or safe-ish?  
HEATHER WATSON: To be honest, I'm not thinking about it anymore.  I'm just accepting whatever happens.   
 Q.  Just back on the coaching situation, I know you get on great with Diego and love working with him.  The present arrangement, is that going to work long-term?  Will you start looking for someone who can travel with you more weeks of the year?  
HEATHER WATSON: Yeah, maybe having a second party come in.  I'm not really sure.  For right now I've been happy the way it is.  I do like some weeks away from the coaching and have to think of things for myself.   
My mum, we argue a lot, but she is really smart when it comes to tennis.  She's been with me my whole career.  I never listen to her, but when it's about tennis I do.  (Smiling.)   
 Q.  Do you feel winning in Monterrey proved how well that can work?  
HEATHER WATSON: Yeah, if.  My mum comes for a week it's not just because she had come there for a week.  I had been building and working before the tournament.   
Yeah, I do like having her around, but in small doses.   
 Q.  Do you think there is an over-dependance on coaching?  You hinted that it's good to have space to yourself.  Players are different and it suits you.  Do you think generally there is too much reliance on coaching and backup staff?  
HEATHER WATSON: I think there are players that are very dependant on coaches.  Just depends how they work.  Some people like to be told everything and take direction completely.  I like coming up with solutions on my own and thinking for myself.   
Yeah, just depends on what type of player you are, what you want.  Me personally, it works well for me to dip in and out.   
And also because he's based in Argentina it would be -- well, it wouldn't work for hem being on the road all that time.
