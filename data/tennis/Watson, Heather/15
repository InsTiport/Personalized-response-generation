C. WOZNIACKI/H. Watson   
6-2, 3-6, 7-5   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Does it feel like a missed opportunity or do you actually feel positive in the grand scheme of things?  
HEATHER WATSON: Right now I'm pretty disappointed that I lost.  As far as my performance goes, I'm pleased with how I fought back and got myself back into the match.   
I started a bit -- well, not including the first two games, but after that I was a bit slow and heavy to the ball, making a lot of mistakes.   
Yeah, I'm pleased.  It's been a good week.  I'm feeling ready for Wimbledon.   
 Q.  Were you feeling rushed with your strokes, especially in the first set?  Were you just pushing too hard?  
HEATHER WATSON: Well, I didn't finish dinner last night till 10:00 p.m. once I was done with my match, physio, stretching, all that, so I think I felt a bit sluggish from the long day yesterday.   
 Q.  You beat world No. 9, 17, 23 this week.  Ideal preparation for Wimbledon?  
HEATHER WATSON: Yeah, definitely.  Lots of court time.  I'm feeling great about my game and got some great match wins under my belt this week and just match wins.  I'm feeling confident going into next week.   
 Q.  Have you seen the draw yet?  
HEATHER WATSON: Yeah.  Can't get away from it, can you (smiling)?   
 Q.  Is it true the draw is plastered all over the locker rooms, as well, so when players say "I don't do it," you can't miss it?  
HEATHER WATSON: Oh, usually I don't look, but with a Grand Slam you have people messaging you, like social media notifications come up, and so, yeah, I have seen.   
 Q.  What are your thoughts of your opening round, especially given your week here?  
HEATHER WATSON: Well, I saw it but I didn't think about it because it was before my match.  But, yeah, I'm feeling optimistic, feeling great within myself going into next week.  Yeah, I'm looking forward to the challenge.   
 Q.  Have you spoken to Jo at all?  
HEATHER WATSON: No.  I haven't seen her.   
 Q.  What's your plan going forward now?  When will you head to Wimbledon?  
HEATHER WATSON: I'm going to go to the physios now and then go straight up.  Pack my bags and go.  Try and miss rush hour (smiling).
