  6‑3, 6‑4 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Good day for the Brits, isn't it?  
HEATHER WATSON:   Yeah, brilliant day.   Me and Laura both won.   I didn't see any of Laura's match, but she did really well to come through.   That's a tough first‑round win.   I'm also very pleased with myself to get through there.  
I was quite nervous, because I saw it as a good opportunity for me and to get through my first round.   I was pretty much nervous throughout the whole match.   I didn't really loosen up.   I got through it, and I thought I played quite well.  
   
 Q.   How are you finding Eastbourne?   Have you explored the town?  
HEATHER WATSON:   I haven't, but my fitness coach lives here, so he's cooking dinner for us tonight.   (Smiling.)  
That's good.   It's actually been really good weather so far.   I thought it's going to be really windy, because the last few days have been quite windy, but it's been good.  
   
 Q.   So what is he cooking for dinner?  
HEATHER WATSON:   Well, he's actually not cooking.   His girlfriend is cooking.   She's Thai, so she's cooking us some Thai food.  
   
 Q.   You said you were slightly nervous throughout that match.   Does that come from playing in front of the home crowd and a greater sense of expectation?  
HEATHER WATSON:   Well, for me, it's good to be a bit nervous.   I'm more focused, and, yeah, very motivated to win the match.  
So it's good.   I like feeling nervous.   Also, yeah, it's partly to do with being at home and wanting to do well for my country, as well.   
   
 Q.   How important is it to get more match practice on the grass this week ahead of Wimbledon?  
HEATHER WATSON:   It's very important.   There aren't many tournaments on grass.   There's only these few weeks.   
I find the more I play on this surface, the better I get and adapt my game.   Always towards the later tournaments of the season I start playing my best.   
   
 Q.   You had a big doubles win as well yesterday with Laura.   Talk about your partnership a little bit.   Is it just for the Olympics, or do you guys kind of want to continue playing together, you know, after that?  
HEATHER WATSON:   Yeah, I think me and Laura are a very good doubles team.   We compliment each other's games, and we get along really well.   So that's really good.   
I think also, for the future, I'd love to carry on playing with Laura and have a good doubles career with her, as well.
