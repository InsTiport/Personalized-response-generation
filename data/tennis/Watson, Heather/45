THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Disappointed?   
HEATHER WATSON:   It's a shame that Petra is obviously injured.   I hope that she gets well and better for Wimbledon, but obviously I'm glad to be through to my first semifinal here in Eastbourne and look forward to my next match.   
   
 Q.   The first British lady since Jo Durie making it to the semifinals.   
HEATHER WATSON:   Oh, okay.  
   
 Q.   In a way, is it nice to have a day not playing?  
HEATHER WATSON:   I still practiced.   Today   I had two practices.   My warmup, and then when I had the news after my warmup, I planned another hit for the afternoon just to make sure I'm ready for tomorrow.  
Still have to look after my body and do everything right to be ready for the next day.  
   
 Q.   Do you have a preference who you play next?  
HEATHER WATSON:   No preference.   I don't mind.   I have played Madison last year at Wimbledon, and I don't think I have ever played Lauren Davis before.   
But whoever I play, they're obviously both on good form and won some very good matches to get where they are, and I'll have a little look at them play later on.  
   
 Q.   Last year I think you said if you won you'd jump in the sea.   
HEATHER WATSON:   Huh?   
   
 Q.   I think you said you'd jump in the sea.   
HEATHER WATSON:   If I won the tournament?   Yeah, for sure.  
   
 Q.   Any plans if you win?  
HEATHER WATSON:   Just that one will be enough for me.   (Laughter.)  
Q.Last year I think we had the issue of the nail varnish, the gold nail varnish.   England colors for tonight?  
HEATHER WATSON:   I think I'm going French manicure for tonight.  
   
 Q.   Will you be watching tonight?  
HEATHER WATSON:   Yeah, I will.   I will be in bed watching the match and supporting England, of course.  
   
 Q.   Prediction?  
HEATHER WATSON:   I wouldn't like to say (smiling).   
   
 Q.   Your thought of reaching a final now that you have come this far?  
HEATHER WATSON:   No.   I'm just focused on my next match.   I didn't play today, so I want to make the most of my opportunity tomorrow.   I'll do everything I can to just keep focused and keep in the same routine that I have been keeping.  
   
 Q.   You must see it as quite a big opportunity playing against Keys or Davis who are both kind of experienced?  
HEATHER WATSON:   Absolutely.   I see it as a big opportunity.   But I think whoever I was playing I'd see it as a big opportunity.   You're in the semifinals now, everybody wants it badly, and I do too (smiling).   
   
 Q.   A semifinal place means obviously more prize money and more ranking points.   At this stage of your career, which matters more to you?  
HEATHER WATSON:   Hmm, that's an interesting question.   
You know, I'm just focused on now after my year last year and experiencing losing and, you know, falling down the rankings and losing confidence, I'm just so grateful to be healthy and confident again and just really enjoying my tennis.  
So while I'm playing good, I want to make the most of me playing good, because I know that it doesn't last every single week.  
So, you know, even after yesterday when I lost the first set, I was still positive because I thought I had a chance to come back because I'm still playing well.   That's what I want to do, make the most of playing well.  
   
 Q.   If you were queen of tennis for one day, is there any rule that you would change?  
HEATHER WATSON:   If I was queen of tennis?   
   
 Q.   If you were in charge of the whole professional game, are there any rules that you would change?  
HEATHER WATSON:   I'd say Hawk‑Eye on every court (smiling).   
   
 Q.   If you end up playing on Sunday, how does that affect your preparations for Wimbledon?  
HEATHER WATSON:   On Sunday?   
   
 Q.   Saturday, sorry.   
HEATHER WATSON:   Oh, well, I'm not thinking about Saturday yet.   I'm just thinking about tomorrow.   Because if I don't get past tomorrow, there is no Saturday.
