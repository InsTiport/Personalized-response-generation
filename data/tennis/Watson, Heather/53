E. VESNINA/H. Watson
  6‑1, 3‑6, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   I guess the first thing is was it a good day physically?
HEATHER WATSON:   Yeah, it was a good day physically, just not so much mentally.   I was finding I wasn't really ‑‑I was in and out of focus, and I thought the first three games I was playing well like I had been playing, and then I just suddenly switched off for the rest of that set.   It just went so quick. 
Then I managed to get it back in the second, and then once again, same thing happened in the third, just switched off, and before I knew it I was 5‑Love down.   It went so quickly. 
Yeah, just got to learn to stop doing that. 

Q.   Do you feel that's happening, or do you realize that's happening, the loss of focus?
HEATHER WATSON:   Yeah, I realize it once it's 5‑0 and it's too late. 

Q.   Obviously we have talked a lot about the glandular fever and the effects.   Is that still an effect of that or was that just... 
HEATHER WATSON:   Today that was just me.   I didn't have much focus, and I thought it was a good opportunity wasted, that I've just got to sweep that one under the rug, get back on the practice court, work hard and make sure it's a good week next week.

Q.   Was there a reason for the lack of focus?   Anything you can put your finger on?
HEATHER WATSON:   I don't know.   I guess it was just one of those days.   I feel like I can feel it in the morning.   I'm either on or kind of like half on.   Today was a half‑on day.

Q.   Are they getting less frequent?
HEATHER WATSON:   Yeah.   I need to make it less frequent I think by just how I practice, just making sure I practice like I think, like I think in a match, and put that into practice.

Q.   Do you do anything with a sports psychologist?   Ever talk to him about that?
HEATHER WATSON:   Yeah, I do.   I work with somebody when I'm in Florida.   It's basically just chatting and trying to think of different ways, ways that work with me.   I haven't seen him in a while, though, so I probably need to.

Q.   Do you have any sort of techniques you go through out on court or anything to... 
HEATHER WATSON:   One thing that works with me is talking to myself positively and going to get the towel and looking at my strings, just small things.

Q.   Do you think you have enough matches under your belt going into next week?
HEATHER WATSON:   I think with a win here it's definitely a step in the right direction.   I would have liked more, but that's not going to happen now.

Q.   What about the draw on Friday?   Will you be following that very closely?
HEATHER WATSON:   I didn't even know it was on Friday.   I'll probably just find out whenever, whenever I find out.

Q.   What's your schedule for the rest of the week now?   What will you be doing?
HEATHER WATSON:   I'll take tomorrow off, and then I will start training on Friday.

Q.   Are you going up to Wimbledon?
HEATHER WATSON:   I'm actually going to leave tonight, I think, so for my day off I don't have to use up a few hours driving.

Q.   Any players you want to avoid on the draw Friday?
HEATHER WATSON:   No, no players I want or want to avoid.   It's just whatever.
