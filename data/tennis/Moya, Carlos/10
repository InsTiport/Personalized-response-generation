   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.   
  
  Q.  Who suggested you to play doubles?   
 CARLOS MOYA:  Excuse me?   
  
  Q.  Who suggested you to play doubles?   
 CARLOS MOYA:  He wanted to win a tournament so he asked me if I can play with him.   
  
  Q.  That's a good answer, but which one is the serious answer?   
 CARLOS MOYA:  Well, we didn't play for a long time and I think it was in Barcelona I think when we spoke about this, no?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Yes.  We enjoy the doubles and playing doubles the last week in Barcelona.  So we speak in Barcelona and --  well, his coach, so finally we can play doubles.   
  
  Q.  So you would say it's just yourself, it was not the association, because they say you should play more doubles?   
 CARLOS MOYA:  No, no.   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Not at all.   
  
  Q.  You enjoyed the game?  I see sometimes that when the other double make some big point you smile.   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah, it was unbelievable point, no?  So it's better smile than cry.  So, yeah, it was -- doubles is not the same tension like the singles, so we enjoy playing doubles.  That's good practice too for the singles.   
 It's important, good start in the tournament.  And now try the best in the next round in doubles, but going to try the best in the singles, too.   
  
  Q.  Rafa, what does this have to do with the rivalry with you and Roger?  Does this mean anything today?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  About what?   
  
  Q.  About the rivalry.   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah.  We were on second round of doubles, that's it.   
  
  Q.  Did it surprise you to see so many people for the doubles?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  No.  It was not the surprise, no.  Normally for the tournament when Roger is playing doubles or when the top guys is playing doubles it's better, no?  And the court is very nice and much better today, so that's very good for us too.  It's better motivation for play the doubles and for the tournament, too.   
  
  Q.  So do you think that -- I mean, if you take part in the doubles that the big singles players, this can revive the doubles?  Because, I mean, doubles at this moment is not -- is a little bit below, and the tension and everything.   
 CARLOS MOYA:  Well, I think you just have to see how was the court.  How it look.  It was full of people, so I think players like them play doubles I think it's good have the things.  In tennis these days very hard the first rounds, and this is a big tournament and that's not easy to be playing singles and doubles.   
 But for sure it's good that top guys are playing doubles.   
  
  Q.  Rafa, does it influence you that there is like no ad anymore and champions tiebreak?  Does that make change for you to play more doubles?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  For me?  For sure not.  No, this is a new rule, so --   
CARLOS MOYA:  (In Spanish.)   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  No.  (In Spanish.)   
 CARLOS MOYA:  (In Spanish.)   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Well, sorry, I didn't understand the question.  Well, it's better for sure for play doubles.  The match is not -- is a little bit shorter so that's very, very good, no.   
  
  Q.  What happens if one of you is in final in single and gets to play the doubles Saturday?   
 CARLOS MOYA:  Well, he has much better chance than me.   
  
  Q.  To be fair I can give you a chance.   
 CARLOS MOYA:  If we get to that point we see how the matches have been going.  We'll see.   
  
  Q.  Carlos, do you know that for the Italian it was Rafa has a new girlfriend?   
 CARLOS MOYA:  I heard.  We had a chat last night.  Serious chat.  I ask him if he has something to tell me that I don't know.   
  
  Q.  He's not a real friend?   
 CARLOS MOYA:  Well, I need to spy to see what's going on, detective.   
  
  Q.  What was the strategy against these guys today?  Did you have a plan or no?  None at all?   
 CARLOS MOYA:  Just to enjoy.   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Enjoy and try to play better than last times.
