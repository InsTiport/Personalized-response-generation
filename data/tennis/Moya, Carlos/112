 Q. Was it too easy for Sampras? Did you play bad? What happened out there? 
 
 CARLOS MOYA: I didn't play too well today. He put a lot of pressure on me. Maybe it was
the key that at the beginning I didn't play well at all. He took advantage of that. Once
he's leading the match, it's really difficult to come back. He plays better and better.
This is what happened today. You know, I didn't feel comfortable at all. He took advantage
of that. 
 
Q. In the second set, you broke Sampras. Did you think you had a chance to turn back?
 
 CARLOS MOYA: Well, it was really difficult because I was two breaks down. I broke him
back, but it was still 3-2 for him with his serve. You know, when he's serving for the
match, it's really difficult to break him. I played really bad at the beginning of every
set, so when he's leading, he's really tough to beat him. 
 
Q. It's a round-robin, so you still have chances. 
 
 CARLOS MOYA: Yeah, I have chances. I have to win the last match. I will qualify for
semifinal, I'm going to have a tough one against Kafelnikov. But I still have chances. It
depends on my serve, so I'm going to do my best.
