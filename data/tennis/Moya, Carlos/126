Q.  Carlos, what's happened today?  You try to play like yesterday, but what you feel against Rafter? 
 
CARLOS MOYA:  No, was different than yesterday because I tried to put more first serve in and try not to let him to attack with his second serve, on my second serve to go to the net.  But all the times I played against him, his strategy work out.  I think he played really well.  He's No. 3 in the world.  He's a specialist here in this kind of court.  He served very well.  Maybe I didn't feel comfortable today with his serve.  After the first set, when he broke me 5-4, he broke me again at the beginning of the second, I was a little bit down because I saw it was very difficult to break him.  He was already a break up.  I could not play as I played yesterday. 
   

Q.  What do you think that your chances for reaching the semifinals? 
 
CARLOS MOYA:  Well, I think I still have chances to be in semifinal.  I won one match already.  I hope tomorrow I'm going to play well again.  Wait here and see what happen Friday.  But first I have to try to beat him. 
   

Q.  Carlos, what is your record like against Rusedski? Do you fear his big serve?
 
CARLOS MOYA:  We played twice, one each.  He beat me last year in Stuttgart indoor.  I beat him this year in Bournemouth.  Yeah, I think he's serving pretty well.  Maybe his volley is not as good as Rafter's volley.  But his serve I think is even better.  But I'll try to play my game.  I know he's going to put a lot of pressure on me with his serve.  I'll try to return good and play my best.
