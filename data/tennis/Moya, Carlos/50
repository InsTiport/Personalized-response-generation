THE MODERATOR:  Please go ahead for Carlos Moya. 


Q.  Very high percentage of first serves in.  Must be pleased with that?

CARLOS MOYA:  Well, I mean, I think that I played very well.  And my serve, it helped me a lot.  Last matches I won, my serve was really good.  That helps me to play more relaxed on the return games and, you know, I can take more risk.  So I think the key of these matches I won is most of the part is from the serve.

Q.  What are your thoughts about playing Lleyton in the final? 

CARLOS MOYA:  Is gonna be a very exciting match, I guess.  He's a great champion, great player.  We'll see what's gonna happen tomorrow.  But I'm playing well, and I just want to play my tennis and see how it goes. 

Q.  You have a great record against Lleyton.  What do you put that down to?  Where do you find wins against him? 

CARLOS MOYA:  Well, he's a very complete player.  The other times I beat him I played really well.  I think if I play well 100 percent, I can beat any player.  It just happen that against him I played very well all the time.  So I'm gonna try to play my game, as I said, hitting the ball hard.  I expect to have a very tough match tomorrow, but I'm playing well and I just want to be focused on my game.
