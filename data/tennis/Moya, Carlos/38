THE MODERATOR:  Questions in English, please.


Q.  It was close out there today.  You seemed to be very comfortable on the grass, especially on Centre Court.  Do you feel it was your best performance on grass?

CARLOS MOYA:  Well, indeed, it was a very good match.  Was a pity that I started to play really well, it was little bit late.  But I was fighting a lot.  And at the beginning, it was very tough for me to return his serve. But then I start to play really well.  And, you know, I think I had chances.  He had chances as well.  But it could go both sides.  It went his side.  I am disappointed to lose, but happy that the match was good and I proved to myself that I can play well here.


Q.  You feel much happier now about playing on grass?

CARLOS MOYA:  Well, I feel more comfortable.  And as I said before, I proved to myself that I can play well here.  Before I came here, it was -- I didn't know what was gonna happen.  Now I am happy the way I play the whole tournament but, again, disappointed to lose today.


Q.  Last time we were sitting here somebody asked you if you thought you could Wimbledon and you said, "No."  Did you go today thinking just to have fun, or did you go to really -- you wanted to win, you felt that you could win?

CARLOS MOYA:  Both.  I think I knew that I could have fun today and that I was gonna have my chances to win.  But I had a very, very tough draw if I wanted to win the tournament.  It was Hewitt today, Federer waiting for me, and I don't know who else but... (smiling).  Is not the best draw that I could have.  But, still, I played very good tennis.  I am happy that I came here.


Q.  Where are you going now?

CARLOS MOYA:  Home.


Q.  Tomorrow?  You leave today or you leave tomorrow?

CARLOS MOYA:  I don't know.  I have to see.  Rest a little bit.  Then I go Bastad, Sweden.
