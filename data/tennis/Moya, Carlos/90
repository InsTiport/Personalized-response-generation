THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Carlos, please. 


Q.  I was just wondering if you find yourself playing Lleyton Hewitt in the next round, what you think of that match?

CARLOS MOYA: Well, it will be interesting and pretty exciting I will say.  Because he's a great player.  He's playing very well.  First round was very tough for him, and you know, I'm very confident.  I think if I'm playing the same level I am playing right now, I am able to beat him.  Why not.  It will be a great match.  But he still has a tough opponent which is Haas, you never know what is going to happen.  But if Hewitt is the winner, I'm going to be ready for that match. 

Q.  There's been a lot written about the way he behaves on the court.  Do you find it at all distracting because he's so fairly loud, disputes calls and carries on a bit sometimes?

CARLOS MOYA: Well, it's not really, you know, he doesn't make you feel comfortable about that.  But I think he's not fake at all.  He does it because that helps him to increase his level, to play better, and I don't think he does it to bother his opponent.  But he does it because it pumps him up a lot.  And, you know, he's happy being like that and I have nothing to say about that because he's doing that for himself, not to bother the opponent. 

Q.  How far are you from your best tennis? Are you right back to where you were, do you think?

CARLOS MOYA: Well, I think my tennis right now is very close to my highest level.  I know my ranking is much worse than it was during those days, but the level I would say is the same.  I am very confident right now.  My fitness is great.  I am healthy and, you know, maybe if we wait few months, I'll be where I was.  But I don't want to hurry now.  I just want to go step by step and hopefully I'm gonna  -- is not going to take long to get back where I was.
