THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Carlos, please. 


Q.  Congratulations on the win. 

CARLOS MOYA:  Thank you.

Q.  How important was it to save those breakpoints early on?

CARLOS MOYA:  At the beginning? 

Q.  Yes. 

CARLOS MOYA:  It was very important because I wasn't feeling playing very well at the beginning.  And then I could hold my serve, and right after that I broke his serve.  Then I start to play better and better. I think today I served very well and my forehand was very good, so I think that that was an important moment, to save those breakpoints.

Q.  And now, with Federer ahead, I mean, it's a big ask for you, but do you feel confident going into that? 

CARLOS MOYA:  Well, is going to be an important match.  And I think if I win, I have chances to qualify.  So I have to forget who I'm playing with and just play my match and enjoy.  Is not very often that you get to play one of the best players ever, so I'll try to enjoy. 

Q.  Were you concerned at the end about the court being too wet to play?  Was that in the back of your mind?

CARLOS MOYA:  It was a little bit wet.  I think, well, to me, was better to continue. But they ask him if he wants to stop, and he say no.  So I think was better for him to stop the match because I just broke his serve and, you know, I was going up and he was little bit frustrated. He decided not to stop the match, and for me was better.  It was a little bit slippery at the end, but I was serving so, you know, for me was better to play that game and to close the match. 

Q.  Little bit different than sliding on clay, I guess? 

CARLOS MOYA:  Excuse me? 

Q.  No, I was just joking.  I said it's a little bit different than sliding on clay. 

CARLOS MOYA:  Yeah, yeah, is very different.  Is even dangerous.
