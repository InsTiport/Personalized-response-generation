THE MODERATOR:  First question, please. 


Q.  Can you talk about the match.?

CARLOS MOYA:  A very strange match.  The first set he was up.  It was a very strange match, very mixed up.  I started playing better and I took the right moment to get him. 

Q.  Do you think it was finished when it was the first set for you at 4-1? 

CARLOS MOYA:  I knew the serve would be very important.  The balls were very heavy.  The conditions also.  I knew I could reverse the trend.  I decided to hang in there and fight.  It was a matter of will power.

Q.  What was the key in the third set? 

CARLOS MOYA:  He lost his serve immediately at 40-15.  It was bad for his spirits. 

Q.  How is your adductor?

CARLOS MOYA:  It hurts a little bit.  It happened during Corretja's match.  But now it's better.  I'm still hoping I can win.

Q.  What do you think about a five-setter tomorrow?

CARLOS MOYA:  He also had a tough week.  We'll see what happens.  Anyway, it's going to be a very difficult match.

Q.  What do you think of the first entirely Spanish final here in 150 years?

CARLOS MOYA:  It's a triumph for Spain.  It happened in Barcelona also.  We'll see tomorrow.  Whatever happens, Spanish tennis will win.

Q.  You lost against Ferrero in Barcelona.  What was lacking in your game?

CARLOS MOYA:  I was up 3-1, 15-40 and I was not able to kill him after that.  Tomorrow will be the revenge, and I hope I will have more luck.
