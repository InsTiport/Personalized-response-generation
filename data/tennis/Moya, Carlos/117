 Q. Just a reaction, your assessment of tonight's match, you must be very happy to
advance to the next round. Just your comments on the game. 
 
 CARLOS MOYA: I'm pretty happy to win this match. It was very tough. Mentally very tough
because the weather conditions wasn't easy to play today. You know, I think I play a good
game. You know, now in quarters, I have to be careful with Larsson. He's playing pretty
well. But I hope I'm going to play even better and qualify for the semifinal. 
 
Q. Any special feelings about the fact that it was obviously a countryman and it was a
replay the final from France?
 
 CARLOS MOYA: Well, is always very difficult to play against a friend, as Corretja is,
Spanish, also because of the weather, you know, maybe the match was not really good for
people. But I'm telling you that I was on the court, it was not easy to play today. We did
our best. Finally I won. But, you know, he had chances to win. But today I did it. You
know, I'm very happy to be a winner. 
 
Q. Obviously a relief not to have to play five sets again. Your thoughts about winning
so quickly. Was there something in your game you improved, your groundstrokes?
 
 CARLOS MOYA: Well, I'm playing much better than I play first round. I'm much more
confident right now, you know. I do my best when the conditions are against me, you know.
When he has breakpoints or whatever happens that is against me, I play much better, you
know. Is because I'm very confident right now. You know, I hope I'm going to play even
better. I said after I beat Chang that I was going to get a lot of confidence, I was going
to play better. And it's been like that until now. You know, I hope I'm going to play even
better next round.
