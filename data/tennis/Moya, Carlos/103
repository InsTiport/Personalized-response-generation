GREG SHARKO:  Carlos advances into the Round of 16 where he'll take on Sebastien Grosjean from France.  Carlos won their only previous meeting.  
 

Q.  Three sets yesterday, three sets today?
 
CARLOS MOYA:  I like to get some rhythm.  Even though not playing my best, I won both matches.  This is the most important thing.  That means that I'm a lot of confidence.  Hopefully I'm going to play better tomorrow.  But I think I played a good match today.  The conditions were not easy for me.  I played early in the morning, which I don't like it.  It was pretty windy.  Stoltenberg played great, I think.  I've been a little bit lucky, but I have to be very happy with that match.
