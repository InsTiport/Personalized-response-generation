THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.


Q.  Carlos, you look like you're in a lot of pain at the moment.  It obviously looks serious.

CARLOS MOYA:  Yeah, I don't know how it's gonna be.  I hope it's not gonna be that bad, but it really hurts a lot.

Q.  Did you know when you went over on your ankle that you couldn't continue the match?

CARLOS MOYA:  Yeah, I was almost sure, but I wanted to try.  There was no way; I could not even walk. 

Q.  At this stage, what are you thinking about the Australian Open; that you're, I guess, just waiting for a diagnosis from the doctor?

CARLOS MOYA:  Yeah, I'm gonna get  X-rays now and I'll see how it goes.  I hope it's not gonna be nothing really, really bad.

Q.  To have such a wonderful streak of matches end this way, how do you feel? 

CARLOS MOYA:  Well, it's disappointing.  These things happen in tennis.  You know, I was playing very well, I was very confident, and I was playing pretty well today.  I was back down, but the match was pretty open.  But is a pity to end this way.
