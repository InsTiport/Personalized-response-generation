 Q.  Match points the other day against the local guy, then you play against your countryman, now you're going against a tiebreak.  You just love playing tennis that much.  Why? 
 CARLOS MOYA:  Well, I'm enjoying right now and I'm winning all the tiebreaks.  It's been an exciting match.  I'm happy with the way I played.  I don't like being very close to lose, but I think I played a great match when I had to do it, and I'm pretty happy. 

 Q.  Atmosphere keep you going, make you feel a little bit younger than you are?  It's been ten years since you were in the Australian Open final. 
 CARLOS MOYA:  Yeah, the matches that you work for and you travel for, it was a great atmosphere.  It was very noisy, but I think it's been a wonderful atmosphere. 

 Q.  Quick turnaround tomorrow to play one of the French guys.  Do you feel crunched to be ready for tomorrow? 
 CARLOS MOYA:  I don't know how I'm going to be feeling tomorrow, but hopefully I'm going to be fresh and will play a good match tomorrow.
