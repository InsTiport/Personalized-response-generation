THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Carlos, please. 


Q.  How is your form coming on before the Open?  How is it going?

CARLOS MOYA:  Well, I feel pretty well.  The year so far has been perfect for me  - seven matches, seven wins.  I won a title already.  So it's great.  I'm in great form, playing well, confident.  I think I'm gonna get to the Open in good form, so that's very important. 

Q.  You're the highest-ranked player left in the draw now.  There were upsets earlier in the tournament. 

CARLOS MOYA:  Well, I am the highest seed, but there are many good players such as Hewitt, Srichaphan, Philippoussis, so many good players still in the draw.  So I just want to be focused on my next match, which is going to be very difficult, and I'll see how it goes.  I hope I'm gonna keep playing at this level, and we're gonna see what's gonna happen. 

Q.  Are you surprised about Hewitt, or do you still think he's one of the biggest threats in the tournament and heading into the Australian Open?

CARLOS MOYA:  Yeah, I mean, he's No. 15 in the world.  He's gonna be one of the favorites for me.  He didn't have a very good year last year.  Last year he finished No. 16 or something like that, and he won the Davis Cup.  So he's a great champion.  For sure he plays the whole year, he's gonna be in the Top 10 for sure.
