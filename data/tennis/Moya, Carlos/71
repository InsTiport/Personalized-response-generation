Q.  What happened to you in the third set?

CARLOS MOYA:  The first point of the third set was a key point.  He hit a lob.  I lost that point.  Until that day, I made quite a lot of mistakes, and today not quite so many.  I was surprised to win the other day.  I think today I should have won. 

Q.  You missed a backhand which was very important, the match point. 

CARLOS MOYA:  Well, not only this backhand.  I was a bit conservative before that.  I should have attacked before.  Well, what can I do?  I gave 100%. 

Q.  Are you struggling to get to the Masters Cup?

CARLOS MOYA:  Well, I'm No.  5 now.  The other ones have to win a lot of matches to overtake my position.  I would have liked to have made sure in this tournament that I was going to be in Shanghai.  Today I lost.  I've made things complicated for myself too much. 

Q.  Are you going to go to Basel and Paris?

CARLOS MOYA:  No, I'm not going to go to Basel because I feel bad with my back after all those matches.  I will rest a little bit and get ready for Paris.

MODERATOR:  Any questions in English?


Q.  You will go to Paris, regardless of the back condition? 

CARLOS MOYA:  Yes, I'll be there.  It's the last tournament of the year.  It's a Masters Series.  It will be very important to make some points.  Yeah, I'll be there.  It hasn't been a good tournament for me in the past years because I didn't win many matches, but I'll try this year.
