  4‑6, 7‑5, 6‑1 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   It seemed to be going so well for you, and you got distracted by the weather.   Is that fair?  
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   Not distracted.   I think it was humid, the grass.   I think you don't have to play.   Maybe I mistake to don't take a decision to go out, but that's how it was.  
   
 Q.   Were you surprised that the umpire didn't stop it?  
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   Did you make that point to her?  
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   Do you think it was dangerous out there?  
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   Yes, of course.   When it's humid, the grass, you can't play.   Doesn't matter if it's important moment or another moment.  
But is not excuse, of course.   
   
 Q.   What did the umpire say back to you?   Did she just refuse or say, We have to wait for five minutes?  
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   She say, We have to wait, we have to wait.   
I say, Yeah, but we can keep going waiting like this for long, because today is like this.   So we have to take a decision.   She was saying, We try.   
It's yes or it's not.   
   
 Q.   The crowd seemed a bit unhappy.   Did you understand that?  
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   Doesn't matter, the crowd.   They can't understand.   
   
 Q.   But it must have showed the strength of your feeling, because it was a crucial time in the second set when you made the point, you know.   
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   Yeah, so what's the question?   
   
 Q.   Well, basically that you had nothing to gain by moaning, really, that you could have, you know...   
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   Yeah, exactly.   
   
 Q.   Did you, in the third set then, was it still on your mind, all those issues?   The weather hadn't really improved that much.   The third set was very different from the first two sets.   
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   Yeah, it was a mix of things.   Of course, this one I didn't take my attention and I didn't put in the right way anymore.   So is my responsibility.  
   
 Q.   You must be annoyed and disappointed, though.   
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   A lot.   
   
 Q.   I don't know the rules.   Are you able to complain to the referee to ask when you have a disagreement with the umpire in some of the conditions?  
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   No, for the moment I didn't ask her anything, but for sure I will ask to some supervisor how is working when it's like this.  
   
 Q.   Were you surprised that there didn't seem to be anything happening or changing, that nobody was making a decision in that regard, that the referee wasn't coming to make a final decision?  
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   Yeah, I was surprised.   But was my mistake, not her mistake.   When it's humid and you can't play, you should say just not stay there and waiting and blah, blah.   
   
 Q.   Do you know why you were sitting on the seats for so long and stayed on the side of the court?  
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   Yeah, shouldn't be.   Shouldn't be.   
   
 Q.   You should have left, you think?  
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   Of course.   
   
 Q.   Did you ask if you could leave?  
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   And you were told no?  
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   We have to wait.  
   
 Q.   Did that seem slightly silly sitting there waiting because there is no cover on the court and the rain is coming down?  
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Finally got the umbrellas.   
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   (Smiling.)  
   
 Q.   Did you hear the umpire call second set, as well, at one point?   She made a mistake?  
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   Si, si.   She made two times two mistakes, big, and another one.   Anyways, that's tennis.   
   
 Q.   Do you think without that problem you could have won the game because you were going well?  
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   I don't know.   I had the chance also in the third set to win.   You can't give to the rain just everything that you win or you lose.  
   
 Q.   What would you like to see done in future so that nobody else suffers like you did?  
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   That we have to decide you play or you don't play.   So you go away, and then in case you come back after 15 minutes, doesn't matter.   But decision has to make straightaway.     
   
 Q.   You either play or not play, not just sit there waiting to see if...   
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   No.   On the grass, there is no reason.   On the clay, of course.   
   
 Q.   Because it's not unusual rain in England, really.   
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   Yeah.
