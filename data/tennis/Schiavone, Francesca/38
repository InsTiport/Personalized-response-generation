 V. DUSHEVINA/F. Schiavone
  6-7, 7-5, 6-1 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Sport and tennis is a game of highs and lows. I guess you've gone from being incredibly high in Paris last month to being very disappointed today. What went wrong out there for you?   
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Was tough match. Was different surface, different feeling.   
 But she played very good and I didn't take my chance maybe in the second set. It's much more easy when you don't serve so good and when you don't catch your chance, particularly on the grass.   
  
  Q. How has the last month since Paris been for you? How have you celebrated? What have you done to get focused again?   
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: I work like every day I did in my life. Of course, you can enjoy. But at the end you have to come back to work.
