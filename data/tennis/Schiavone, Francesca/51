THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 
 
 
Q.  You looked like you had that one.  What happened? 
 
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  I don't know.  It was very tough and she played very well in the most important moment and I didn't push maybe sometimes when I had to push, and it's finish like this.  
 
Q.  Did you feel like you tightened up, you got a bit nervous when you were trying to close out the match?
 
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  Yes, a little bit.  But every points are tough with her, so... 
 
Q.  You've been in I think six finals now and you haven't won one.  Is this the most disappointing of them all?
 
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  Yes, it is.  
 
Q.  What do you take out of a match like this going into the Australian Open?  Your performance has been great all week.  Obviously there's a disappointment tonight.  But what do you take out of it?
 
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  I take the experience.  I take that I am doing a good job, I am in a right way, correct way.  Is very good to play against Justine, one of the best players.  And I was very near, very close to win.  So can be good for me and for my tennis and for myself.
