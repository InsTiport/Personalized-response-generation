   THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. What is your psychological condition for the fact that you are going to play in your own country?  
 FLAVIA PENNETTA: It is important, and it's surely an emotion to play in one's country. But we will do the best as we can.   
  
  Q. Can you please talk about the pressure of playing at home?   
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Well, we fear and have emotion, because otherwise we won't be human beings. But it's natural.   
  
  Q. If Flavia are Francesca and Corrado could address the situation of playing against an underdog team and you're decidedly the favorites ,how much pressure does that put to you?  
 CAPTAIN BARAZZUTTI: : Well, we know that -- we understand that this match is difficult because we are favorite in this match.   
 For this, we have to play with more attention. We must to be focus and play this match with really much, much aggression. There is nothing to do more.   
 So we have just to stay focus on this tie try to play better as possible. I don't think there is other way.   
  
  Q. Flavia?  
 FLAVIA PENNETTA: He answer already. It's the same.  
  
  Q. But talking about playing Melanie, they're underdogs and stuff.   
 FLAVIA PENNETTA: We already answer. We feel the pressure, gonna be tough tomorrow for everyone. I think we just have to be focus on our game, just do our best. Nothing more.   
  
  Q. During this year, you have already played against Glatch and you have lost.   
 FLAVIA PENNETTA: Yes, this happened, but this just represents a new challenge. I'll do my best.   
  
  Q. You have already played against Oudin and it was an easy game. Do you think she changed?   
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Yes, she probably changed because now she's more mature and she increased her game. I will do my best. I will do my play and I will focus on my experience.   
  
  Q. Is it a possible to have two more importance competitions during the same period?   
 FLAVIA PENNETTA: I think it's not fair, because we work all year and we want to participate to the best and to all.   
  
  Q. There are other two important events in the life, the professional life of Flavia. Has she decided to renounce one and to do the other?  
 FLAVIA PENNETTA: No, I don't.
