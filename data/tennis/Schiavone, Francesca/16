F. SCHIAVONE/E. Makarova
  6-1, 6-3

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Definitely your clay court is where -- I think it's safe to say it's your strongest court. This is your first hard court tournament since Wimbledon, your first tournament since Wimbledon. How do you feel heading into the US Open? Do you feel you're going to have enough time to get ready? Do you feel you will be a threat on a surface that is not your strongest?
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Yeah, the season is very long, so I think we really need to stop for some weeks and to come back working hard. 
 But is long to arrive the US Open, for sure, and now I need more matches, as much as I can, and to play particularly with the concentration that's the most important things, and then tactically and physically I can be good in some weeks.
