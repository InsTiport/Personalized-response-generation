  5-7, 6-3, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Such a hard-fought match. Were you very disappointed at the end of it? Did you guys say anything to each other at the end of the match when you shook hands?
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: No, I say, Good job. Good fight. Good luck. That's normal.
 I think she's good player. She played good, so... 

 Q. I have seen you lose before when you're very upset. You seem okay today. Do you feel like you gave it your best?
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: I show you what I want to show, but of course I am disappointed. Come on.
 It's a match where I played two points and I don't play eight points. It's normal that the other one win.

 Q. Overall, how would you assess your performance over the entire tournament?
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Not so good. You can save maybe one match or two match, but the average has to be much, much higher. I just say you can't play two points in eight points or ten points. That's the key.
 When I hit the ball and I play my tennis the other one is always on defense, so depends a lot of me against one girl like this.
