 V. WILLIAMS/F. Schiavone
  3-6, 6-2, 6-1 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. You haven't had much success against her in the past. Do you feel she wasn't playing to her normal level in the first set, or did you feel you were making her play differently?   
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: No, I think she played good from the start until the end.   
 I was better in the first set, and in some games of the second I think.   
  
  Q. Do you feel that she's more vulnerable now than she was in the past, that she's not quite up there with the very top?   
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: No.   
  
  Q. She's still capable of winning a tournament like this, do you think?  
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Can be.
