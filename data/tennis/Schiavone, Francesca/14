 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. What happened on that last service game?  
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Not good serve. Can't happen, better it happen now than maybe to be longer, three, four game, but it was just two games bad, really bad. Then when I went to return on 5-4, was a little bit better. It happen.  
  
  Q. How glad were you not to have to serve again by...   
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: No, no, absolutely. That game was really poor, really, I play not so good, really bad, but when she was serving I didn't say, I don't want serve anymore. No, come on.   
 I thought, that's okay. Now I have to think to return at the best, to push, to come back to push. Otherwise I can't win.
