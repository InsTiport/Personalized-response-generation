C. WOZNIACKI/F. Schiavone
  3-6, 6-3, 6-3

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Did your previous match have anything to do with your loss today? Were you a bit tired? 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: I don't know, really. But I had my chance anyway. Maybe in the third set I felt a little bit something physically, but it's not an excuse.
 I think I gave the best that I could do it. 

 Q. Can you compare the two atmospheres between the fourth round match and the quarterfinal today. Did you feel as up as you did... 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: No, no. Was good atmosphere today. I think the crowd, they enjoy. I think we fight a lot. No, positive both.
 Of course, if you arrive 11:00 the people are much more intense or excited. But that's all. 

 Q. You know what it takes to win slam. Do you think Caroline can do it here in Melbourne? 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: I think for the moment, I see Kim a little bit better than Caroline. But Caroline has really good quality mentally and physically.
 So I think will be tough, a great match. I see the final like this. 

 Q. With Kim and Caroline in the final?
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Si.

 Q. Is there anything she needs to do to try and elevate to take a title?
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: I don't tell you. It's not my job. 

 Q. Are you proud of what you've achieved here over the last ten days, or is it still a little bit disappointing at the moment?
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: A little bit disappointed. It's normal. I think I am a tennis player, and I want to have always something more, particularly when I have a chance. I want to catch it. Maybe today I didn't do it.
 But for the rest I am positive. I think I have good chance to keep going, improving, and take other really good results, I think. I don't know if you see. 

 Q. You were up 3-1 in the second set. Suddenly you lost six games in a row. Can you tell us what changed in that moment of the match?
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: I think in 3-1 I didn't play good the game for 3-2. I made too many mistakes I shouldn't.
 Then I think she played a little bit better. She tried to push much more. But after that chance, I had another chance in the third set. So I think she play good. She play her tennis.
 That's the quality of her. But I think I can take my chance, I should take my chance much more. Next time I want to do it.

 Q. What is her tennis? 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: That I have the chance to win. I have quality to do it. So it's hurt, but in the same times, it's good, because I have -- I don't die tomorrow, so I will have other chance. I hope. (Laughter.)

 Q. Can she win a major without getting more aggressive?
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Caroline? 

 Q. Yeah. 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Sorry. I don't know. (Smiling.)

 Q. Do you feel now that people will regard you as a threat on hardcourts much more than they did before? 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Si, si. I think the player feel the pressure because I keep going to change everything on the court, speed and angle.
 So they feel that I can do very well, and the people now start to know that I can play really good on hardcourt. I feel the same, so...
 Will be tough for everyone. 

 Q. Do you look at stats? You had three times more winners than Caroline, but you had three times more unforced errors than her. Do you look at the stats after a match?
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Si, si. I look at the statistics. I'm interesting after I go to check. But we are different player. She's more consist and she play much more in defense and keep going to do the same things.
 If I do like this, I can't win one match. So I have to push to play a different play. It's normal that I risk more and she risk less. Two type of player, different. So you can compare a little bit, but not too much.

 Q. Is that the Italian in you or just the way you were taught tennis just to go for your shots?
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: No, I think I am like this.

 Q. Do you think they should consider having tiebreakers in the third set at the Australian Open?
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: No. No. I think was a great match. I think we can do it -- not every day -- but, no. If this is the rule, it's okay. We are strong, the woman are strong (smiling.)

 Q. You're quickly gaining the reputation of being someone who plays matches and the fans tune in to see and get very excited about. Do you get a sense that you're fast becoming a fan favorite and the fans really like watching you play?
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: I'm happy for this. I wait for a life, so now I take. Last night I was walking and they say, Francesca, you give me a lot of motions. Thank you. I hope you win tomorrow. I think it's something fantastic inside of me or another player.
 So I have just to say thanks to them. 

 Q. Can you explain what happened on that last point? Looked like you called it out, the Hawk-Eye point. 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: No, the last point, the match point? 

 Q. Yeah. 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Was close and was out. What can I say about last point? 

 Q. 'Cause you were calling it out, I think. 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Ah, the serve.

 Q. No, when your last shot went out. 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: If it's out, it's out. No, no, no. For me, no chance if that one...

 Q. But it was an overrule by the umpire. 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Si, but I saw the ball out. Was no chance.

 Q. No.4 in the world after this; you're smiling. You're obviously pretty happy with that. 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Well, yes, I am happy. I worked hard to arrive here, so I'm very happy. I want to keep going. (Smiling.)

 Q. It's the highest ever for an Italian woman. How proud are you of that?
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: A lot. Yeah, I'm happy. I don't know, sometimes I'm poor of words, but it's not easy to arrive to you and -- it's fantastic. It's like for you maybe to interview an idol for you, so...
 Big emotion.

 Q. Next major is the French Open. Do you feel your emotions are already building towards that?
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Oh, yes, but it's far away. Yes. For sure with this match and with all the tournament, I can say that I'm building every day something good. 
 I am positive. I have to keep going to improve like this. This is a good way. I look forward to play a big tournament like Roland Garros. 
 I shake if I think about. But what can I do?

 Q. For the English-speaking world, your next goal is to become No. 3 or No. 1?
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Oh, step by step. I never fly, so one step. I have ten years more. 

 Q. You're thinking now you're a better player than the one who won the French? I think so, but I want to hear your opinion. 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: If you think so, I can say yes.
