  6‑0, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Congratulations.   Good win today.   How do you describe that performance?
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   I think it was a fantastic performance for me, particularly the first set and then at the end of the second.   So I'm happy to be here now and to keep going.

Q.   You have the record for consecutive Grand Slam appearances.   Is that something that you hope to keep going for some time yet, a number of Grand Slams?
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   How many?   120?   (Smiling.) 

Q.   I don't know the number exactly right now. 
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   Wow.   That's the age.   I mean, I am 32.   Is normal that I have so many possibility to play four Grand Slams every year.

Q.   And so you hope to be out there for a long time, then?
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   I don't know. 

Q.   You could come up against Petra next round.   Could you talk about that? 
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   She's the champion, so everybody want to beat her.   I think it would be a really, really tough match.   She has the character to play on grass, so I think I have to play really a great match to beat her.

Q.   Wimbledon, where does that rate for you?   How much do you enjoy being here?
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   Wimbledon is special.   Of course is not like another tournament.   Born here, the tennis.   It's much, much bigger than what we think. 
So for me is an honor to be here every year, have a possibility to play here, to enjoy the grass, because you don't find another grass like here.
