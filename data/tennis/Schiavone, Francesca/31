 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. You started so well. What do you think turned the match around?  
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: I think was close, but at the start I was really consistent and aggressive. Then I lost my serve on 4-0, I was 15-Love and I missed one ball with -- in front of the net like this, and I did a bad mistake.  
 But then she serve better. I think I lost my chance in the most important points, and then she grew up a lot and was not so easy.  
 But always really close match.   
  
  Q. I'm not sure if you were asked this, but up 4-0 in the first set and losing 6-4, what was going through your mind? What was the conversation you were having with your coach between sets?  
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: He say to me that I was close every game, and I should keep going, to be aggressive, and maybe to move her a little bit more, because I was playing on her backhand and I should play a little bit more over there, and then move to the other side.  
 But was just some points difference. I think was my responsibility in the first set, and maybe in the second set she played better in the most important points.   
  
  Q. Mentally was it hard losing the first set when you were up 4-0? Were you finding it hard to come back and get motivated in the second set? What was your thinking coming in?  
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Of course I ask him, What is going on, why I lost six game in a row for sure.   
 But then when I finished the first set, for me I start again like the first 15. Every points are very important here, and I had always the chance to win my points and to win the match.   
 At the end, she took her chance and I didn't.
