F. SCHIAVONE/M. Bartoli
  7-6, 6-0

 Q. Just how happy are you with your progress at Wimbledon this week?
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Yeah, I'm very happy. It's the first time that I arrive in the fourth round at Wimbledon. So I'm enjoying, from the first point that I played in the first round until now. So this is the best present for me that I can receive.

 Q. It's three magnificent wins for you. How do you really explain that progress?
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: I think to grow up and stay a little bit alone, you can think much more to yourself and stay more focused. So I think to be alone is a step that I need to do it. And now I did, and I feel good. 

 Q. How do you like your chances on Monday against Razzano?
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Virginie is a great player in this surface. We are 50/50. I can't say something more for her or for me. She's playing very good, very good from the start of the year. So I will fight and try to do my best. 

 Q. She will have had four days off because of her walkover today. 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Yeah.

 Q. Does that help you?
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Maybe. Maybe me, maybe her. It will be tough. I told you, it's 50/50, and we will see.
