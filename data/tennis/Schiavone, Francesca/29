  6-4, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Did you know before the match that it was the last? 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Everybody know; not me. You know, when you stay with the boy and at the end of history you understand that he was with another one, exactly the same. (Laughter.)

 Q. What is your feeling? 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: I think she was really big example for everybody. She leave the tour, but... 
 I don't know. I was friend with her. I am friend with her, so I think was a time she felt good time to leave the tour. 
 Is a part of the life. The tour is not the life. I wish the best really for her. She deserve it. 

 Q. Well done. You kept your standard high right to the end today. Could you say something? This is the best year of your career. Could you say something about that? 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Yeah, this year was fantastic to win a Grand Slam like Roland Garros. I came here really positive. I enjoy this tournament. I think I didn't catch my chance, because I had in every match. 
 But this mean that I have to improve more and more and more. That's a good goal for me. So this mean that I have more motivation to keep going to play tennis. 

 Q. Why did it happen for you this year? 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Why?

 Q. Why rather than previous years? 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Because I work a lot; because was a good moment and the right moment; because I found the people that work good on me; and because now I am 29, 30 years old, and I can understand much more things than before, that maybe I was not ready.

 Q. You can understand, did you say? Did you say you can understand more things?
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Si, understand. I live better, maybe good experience can make you stronger, believe in yourself. Many things. 
 I think you know what I am saying. 

 Q. For you, the year is not over. You have the Fed Cup final. Can you tell us what is your feeling about this competition, and this final especially? 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Si, I love to play for my country, so I'm always ready when the captain call me to play for my nation. Now I think I have to rest some days to find more energy to play the last singles of my year. I'm positive. 
 I spoke with the captain, with Flavia, Roberta, and Sara. They want to win this Fed Cup, and I will give the best to do it. I'm happy to do it.
