 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. What was the injury you were battling today? What happened?   
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: I think is a -- I don't know in English, but there is a muscle here (pointing.)  
  
  Q. Was it a cramp or is it an injury?  
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: No, no, no. It start two days ago and I'm following, and I hope it's gonna be better.  
  
  Q. Can you talk about how this win ranks in your career highlights?   
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: It's great. She's I think one of the best player in the world, so for me is great that I beat her and how I beat her. That's the key. It's for this reason that I'm happy.   
 We fight a lot, and I was sometimes more aggressive than her. So very good for me. Very good.  
  
  Q. Do you take inspiration from the way Flavia is playing?  
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: No, but is good to have good rival at this. I learn from her, she learn from me. That's good.  
  
  Q. Azarenka is the type of player who can hit through opponents. I thought you did a good job working angles, moving her around. What were your tactics for this match?  
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: My tactic was to push and to push her far away, because when she put the foot inside, is not easy to play against.  
 So I was trying to hit long and sometimes to open the angle and to be aggressive, to go to the net, to have a good serve. A lot of things. It's not big player. You have to play everything good.   
  
  Q. Can you just look ahead to the next match, if it's Li or Kirilenko?  
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Li is winning, no? I saw 3-Love. Li Na is Chinese. She play fast, and she win often big match. So I have to stay focused and try to play my tennis. So one up, one down. Pushing, running, and all the mix that can maybe give her some problems.  
  
  Q. Do you like the atmosphere on the Grand Slam court?  
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Yeah. It was great. I think everybody were for me, and that's good.  
  
  Q. There have been a lot of big upsets on that court over the years.   
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Yeah, I enjoy a lot.
