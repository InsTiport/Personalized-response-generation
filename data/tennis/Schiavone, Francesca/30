 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. You play a very beautiful first set; what happened after? You have a little bit less level?   
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Yeah, I think she was really consistent, and when I was often, for example in front of her, 30-15 or 40-30, she was playing regular and I couldn't finish every points.  
 I think was a little bit of the decision or the winning point that missed today.   
  
  Q. What's happened at the beginning of the third set when you have something in your hand?   
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: I sit on my energy gel and I was sticky everywhere, racquet and -- everywhere.   
  
  Q. You have a ball for 2-2 at the third set. Do you think it was the turning point of the last set?   
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: I think we were close in every set. I made the difference in the first because I play more winner and I went to the net and I took some more points to the net than in the other sets.  
 That one was the way to win against her. But I couldn't finish every points at the best.   
  
  Q. Tomorrow you have to play a special match because you are no more in the competition, but I suppose you want to win, so...  
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Oh, yes. Yes, I know that maybe Elena is not so happy because she is trying to qualify for the semifinal, but this is the sport.   
 So I will fight tomorrow like the first day. It's good experience also tomorrow.
