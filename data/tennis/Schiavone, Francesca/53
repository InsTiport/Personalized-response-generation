THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.


Q.  Longest day, huh?  Long day?

FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  Yeah.

Q.  How much was your physical condition affected by playing two matches in one day like that?

FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  A lot, a lot, yeah.  Because I try to do my best.  I was there.  But to prepare a match so important, so difficult against Jennifer, I need time, I need rest, I need tactic and everything.  Very big concentrate.  So today was very tough. 

Q.  You think it was fair you had to play the two matches in one day?

FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  Yes.

Q.  Why?  Why was it fair?

FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  It was fair because you don't have a lot of energy to came back, you know.  So you need to have time. 

Q.  I'm sorry.  So do you think you should have played? 

FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  I'm sorry. 

Q.  My fault. 

FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  No, my fault.  No.  I think that if there is a possibility to go  -- to don't finish the Sunday  -- or Saturday and go one day more, it could be better.  But I know the television, a lot of things I can't control.  But it's okay.  It's okay.  Next time, I will work to go to the semifinal (laughing).  I did two quarterfinal.  Now I have more experience.  Now I know how I feel during a match like this. 

Q.  So as the day finishes, are you more happy that you beat Sugiyama, or more sad that you lost to Capriati? 

FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  No, I am  -- I say that I am really full of energy and very happy.  I won a great match, really a great match with Sugiyama.  Now, I can say that I can do more with Jennifer.  I need to understand (smiling).  For now, I don't understand very well. 

Q.  What did you think when there was a delay from the umpire being injured? 

FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  Sorry? 

Q.  When the umpire was hurt during the match against Sugiyama. 

FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  Oh, yeah, I say already in the last interview.  I said everything.  Was very professional because she didn't stop, she try to continue the play.  It can happen.  It can happen, it can happen.
