F. SCHIAVONE/B. Strycova
  7-5, 6-3

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. How are you feeling today? 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: A little bit older (smiling). 
 No, about the match, was okay match. I didn't play so good. But was not easy because she doesn't give you two ball follow the same ball. So I had to mix it up, me too, to push with the serve and go to the net. 
 Was not easy. But at the end, I think in the most important moment, I played better than the rest. 

 Q. How do you like the new Court No. 3?
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: I like. It's big, but not too much. You can feel the crowd really close. Yeah, yeah, it's good. 
 I hope in Court No. 1 they can put the roof one day. Court No. 1, not 3, of course.
