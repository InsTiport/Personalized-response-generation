   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 

 Q.  So what happened? 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  It was pain in my ankle from some days after the match, the tough match.  So I didn't want to risk too much to run and feel too much pain.  After maybe be more complicated than now, so I chose to retire. 

 Q.  So when did it first get hurt? 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  No.  It's coming from last week, but it was not to say, no, I can't run.  No, absolutely.  But yesterday already in the doubles was too much pain, what I think about my ankle can be. 
 So I say I run until it's not hurt so much, but it's already came and after four, five, six games, so I didn't want to push too much. 

 Q.  How concerned are you about being ready for the US Open, or is that the reason? 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  No.  I prefer low risk, yes.  I prefer I take two days off, because when I run and I stop I feel pain.  Why I have to risk injury, bad injury for my ankle. 

 Q.  So are you hopeful you'll be ready? 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  Si, si.  Tomorrow I see my doctor and he will take MRI and it's okay, I hope so.  No, don't tell me, don't be too serious. 

 Q.  Is it the left one? 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  Si. 

 Q.  Are you disappointed?  Did you think you were playing well this week? 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  Si, si, si, because I like to play against Kuznetsova.  Could be a good match, tough match for both, so we going to enjoy and try to find a way to win. 
 So I'm upset, yes.  Yes, I'm not so happy.  It can happen. 

 Q.  This injury was different from the one you were calling the trainer for? 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  Si. 

 Q.  Did you say this was the left leg? 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  No, left ankle. 

 Q.  Okay.  Do you remember how you hurt it last week?  Did you turn it? 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  No.  I think when I stop and I play the backhand.  She hits strong and I play backhand I felt.  But usually for me the injury is not so important until I crash. 
 So somebody say, Listen, you don't have to crash every time.  It's better that you take it easy. 

 Q.  I'm not a doctor, but I don't understand.  When you're running you feel the pain? 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  Si.  Particularly when I stop.  When stop like this (indicating) I feel.
