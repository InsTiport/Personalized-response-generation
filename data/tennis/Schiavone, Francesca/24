 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Are you ready for the next round against Justine or Svetlana?
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Yes. I'm very curious to see what we'll do, yeah. 

 Q. What can you tell us about Justine?
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: About Justine? I don't know if she's winning. 

 Q. No, she's not. 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: I think both of them are good player. I have to play in high level to beat them. I know that. 
 So I'm working to be ready Sunday. 

 Q. Can you tell us a few words about Kim Clijsters. 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Yeah, but why Kim? 

 Q. Just in general, what can you tell us about her comeback? 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: You know who is Kim. I think I don't have to tell you who is. 
 But she's stronger and stronger physically. Mentally she's better because I think she's much more relaxed. But she has some goal that she want to take it. Is one of the best, I think, player. 

 Q. Did things change in Italy after winning the French Open? Did you receive more invitations for TV shows, for example? 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: You didn't read the newspaper? 

 Q. Yeah, I did. 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: I think they ask me 100 time. Okay. 
 Of course status has to change. Of course the people look at you maybe in the different way because you won a big trophy. That's fantastic not just for me, but also for all the Italian people. It's like Valentino Rossi win, I am happy. Federica Pellegrini win something, a challenge, everybody are happy. 
 I think is arrive in every Italian house this big champion. 

 Q. What is the craziest invitation you received?
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: I'm not so interesting about this. I prefer take glass of wine and go to my friend's. So it's okay like this. 

 Q. You have been to Belgium twice last year. 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Yes. 

 Q. To play exhibition games. 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Yes. 

 Q. What were your impressions of Belgium? What did you do? 
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: No, I think the people really love Justine and Kim. Everybody, they enjoy for them. They like to see them play. So is good because there is a culture about tennis. 
 And when you arrive in Belgium, you can feel the people want a good tennis. That's good for me and for all the player that go there. 

 Q. The first time you didn't play. You were just standing, I think. The second time you played. Was it a bit of a compensation for the first one?
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Yeah, I want to play that time in front of 30,000 people. Was a big emotion to see to over there. You can imagine to play. 
 I am happy to have every time the opportunity to play in this kind of competition and exhibition because I enjoy. That's the most important part for me. 

 Q. Did you advise Serena not to play there?
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: It's not my job. 

 Q. But you spoke to her in Brussels?
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Si, si, si. Everyone decide for themselves. Was not a great decision. But if she said, Yes, I can play, she could play. 

 Q. Have you ever had such an exhibition in Italy since you're famous now?
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: No, we don't have this kind of things. But we did some exhibition years ago. Was okay. But never like 30,000 people. Never. We don't have a big culture in Italy about tennis. 
 If you do an exhibition for soccer, yeah, you can have 50,000 or 60,000 persons. Step by step we can reach these numbers.
