THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Francesca, please.  
 
 
Q.  You had your chances out there today. 
 
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  Yes.  I had my chance first match -- first set.  Some in the second.  We were 2-All in the first set and we fight a lot and at the end she won that game.  3-All, the same.  4-1 in the tiebreaker.  Si.  Some chance. 
 
Q.  So what do you think was the key? 
 
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  To keep strong a little bit more.  That's all.  
 
Q.  Were you surprised by her intensity?  She struggled a bit with the injuries and after every game she was not sure how she'll go. 
 
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  I don't know about her injury.  After this running, running, running, I don't know.  I don't think that she is injured.  I believe in Kim because she is very correct.  But if you are injured, really injured, you can't run so much.  Me, too, I have some problem to my knee, but is not big problem to say, "Please, Press, I have problem."  I respect Kim, but she is very strong.  I don't think that that injured can -- don't let her play.  So no. 
 
Q.  What do you think of her chances in the tournament now? 
 
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  But Kim is very strong.  If is not too tired, she can win.
