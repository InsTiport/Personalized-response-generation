THE MODERATOR:  First question, please. 


Q.  Were you surprised, Francesca, that she played so much serve and volley?  We don't see that anymore.  It's supposed to be outlawed in women's tennis. 

FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  It's normal, because she is a good player.  She can play on the baseline and also at the net.  She use that tactic because with that one she can improve against me.  And it's good because I return in backhand is normal.  She has the time to play the volley, so is correct. 

Q.  So it was not surprising?

FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  No. 

Q.  In the important moments your backhand never let you down and your forehand does. 

FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  In the first set point, it was a right-hand mistake.  I was too nervous, and I rushed down.  I'll work on it. 

Q.  Are you more disappointed or angry? 

FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  No, I'm happy because each match gives me emotion and allows me to grow.  But I'm sad because I lost.  But it's fine. 

Q.  Did you expect more out of yourself? 

FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  I can't say I'm really happy with myself because there is always something more which you can do  - especially in the big moments.  But she's very experienced.  And although she didn't play at her best, she played well.  In the first set there was more of a balance, and then I just let her go.  But I have to see that through with my coach. 

Q.  In the first set when you were 5-3, you made three points out of three games. 

FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  That's an intelligent question, because it focuses on what I'll have to work on.  It's hard for me to know it now, but I'll watch the tape and I'll talk it through with my coach because that's what I have to work on to improve myself, my game. 

Q.  You said you knew how to play Henin.  Do you think you did it? 

FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  Yes, I think so.  I knew I had to stay in the match, and that's what I did.  But she made a difference in the big points. 

Q.  Do you think that if you had won the first set, things could have turned out differently? 

FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  Well, "if"...

Q.  What do you think about Venus Williams withdrawing? 

FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  It was tough, because she's a great player.  But I don't care very much.  She decided that because she had a problem.  If she had it or not, it's not my business, and it's like that. 

Q.  What will you do before Roland Garros? 

FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  I go home and practice. 

Q.  Is it a wait for you, that you have to defend a quarterfinals? 

FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  No, I don't care about the points.  This year I lost some points, but I had very important personal experiences and I'm happy about it.
