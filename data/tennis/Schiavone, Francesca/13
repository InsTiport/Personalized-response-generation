 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. You're so popular with the crowds everywhere you play because of the style of the game, I think. How do you find the atmosphere here with, say, Roland Garros?  
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Compare to Roland Garros? Well, I think really huge stadium. Is really big. 11:00 is not easy to play here because there are not so many persons. But at the end was better and they could enjoy my tennis, so that's good satisfaction.   
 Compare to Roland Garros? Totally different surface, totally different count of people, totally different atmosphere.  
  
  Q. Do you prefer one over the other?  
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: Ay, when I will win, I will tell you the difference and which one I prefer.  
  
  Q. But you wouldn't change your style of play to suit different court surface or speed?  
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: No, I think on the clay you have always the chance to come back in the point. So attack, attack, then defense, defense, attack.   
 Here, when you attack is really difficult. Then you go to the defense, or maybe one or two times in one point is really long, otherwise is attack and point, because it's faster.
