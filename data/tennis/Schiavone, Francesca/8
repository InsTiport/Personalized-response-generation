THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   It was a tough match at times, yeah?  
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   Yeah, it was tough.   I think she played really good, particularly in the first set, but I couldn't find the timing to return on her serve.   Then I found it, and I feel much more confidence and then a little bit of experience and a little bit of   personality and maybe some good shot from me.  
   
 Q.   I don't know how much you've seen of Laura before, but do you think she can be a good player one day, a big player?     She's already a good player.  
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   You have to say.   Any case, yeah, she played good.   She has good hands.   She has talent.  
Then you never know.   It's just come from inside.   She has, of course, the chance.  
   
 Q.   What was the injury problem you had at the end of the first set?  
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   The back.  
   
 Q.   It affected you, as well, a little bit later on, didn't it?  
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   Yeah.   Particularly in the first set, when I was already 4‑1, I felt really pain and for some games in the second set, and I keep the pain, but I could make the rotation.  
   
 Q.   Did you have the injury coming into the match?  
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.   It's arriving 3‑1.   At 3‑1, 4‑1, I felt pain.  
Then I say, It's okay.   It's just because tension and blah, blah.   But was not like this.   So I went out to treat.  
   
 Q.   What piece of advice would you give to young players like Laura, people like that, if you want to do what you have done and win a Grand Slam and be top, top?  
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   To be themself, to work a lot, to believe that there is always the chance to give everything, and particularly to enjoy it.   Because at the end you have to go to sleep and say, Okay, today I did good and I love what I do.  
   
 Q.   Do you think your experience was important in this match?  
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   I think so, yeah.   
   
 Q.   She said that she thought you took a long time between points.   
FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:   Yeah.   (Smiling.)  
She wanted to be fast, and sometimes you have to stop a little bit more.   But you have a lot of seconds, so sometimes we have to use.   We forget because we are in rush, but it's important to play at the best, the point, and not running and running.
