THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 


Q.  Have you ever double bageled anyone before?

FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  No.  Usually I eat bagel in the morning (smiling).  No, no.  Was been a very good match for me.  She couldn't play.  I hit like she doesn't like, so I won very good, very concentrate. 

Q.  That's a good tactic. 

FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  Si. 

Q.  Did you feel sorry for her?

FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  No, no, no, is normal.  This is tennis.  No.  Why sorry?  She couldn't play very good.  She couldn't play her tennis, and I did mine.  So sometimes happen to her, sometimes to me. 

Q.  Did it ever happen to you?

FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  6-Love, 6-Love? 

Q.  Yes. 

FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  For now, from when I was born, never in my life.  One game, yes, but not 0-0. 

Q.  Who was one game? 

FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  No.  Long time ago. 

Q.  You don't know who the player was?

FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE:  No.  I remember, but I don't say.  It was 12 years old.  Very long time.
