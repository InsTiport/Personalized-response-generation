MURRAY-SOARES/Cabal-Farah   
6-4, 6-3   
 Q.  Thoughts about the tournament.  
BRUNO SOARES: It feels great.  I think important week for us just before a Grand Slam.  It was very tough tournament from day one.  It was a very tough lineup, but I thought us, we had a very tough draw but managed to play some great tennis every match.  Very happy with that.   
Got four matches this week.  Now got the big one coming next week, and it's important for us to get the momentum back.  We finished the year strong last year, and it's nice to be back already playing some good tennis and looking forward to what's ahead in 2019.
