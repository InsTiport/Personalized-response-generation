MURRAY-SOARES/Daniell-Koolhof   
6-3, 6-7, 1-0   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Just to say formally, I think it helps before Wimbledon particularly to get into the rhythm of kind of carving out close matches?  Pretty priceless, isn't it?  
JAMIE MURRAY: Yeah, I mean, I think for us obviously we've lost a lot of close matches this year.  I'm sure other teams say that, as well.  But we have, and I think -- I mean, of course it shouldn't have got to that stage we got to today, but we did well to kind of stay calm and do what we needed to do at the end to get over the line.   
It's great we're in the semis.  We'll get a match tomorrow or Saturday.  And, yeah, I mean --   
BRUNO SOARES: No not tomorrow.   
JAMIE MURRAY: Just relieved to get through, obviously.   
 Q.  We here, we slightly feel we are in the shadow of the World Cup, but I guess for you, being Brazilian, I guess the World Cup is even sort of five times bigger than it is here?  
BRUNO SOARES: Well, yeah.  I mean, I joke but I'm not that huge of a football fan.  I mean, of course I enjoy the World Cup and supporting Brazil, but, I mean, I think I'm going to start getting stressed about the World Cup when it's the draw, round of 16, because right now, group stage, you can still make a few mistakes, and I think Brazil has got a fairly good group to qualify.  I would be surprised if they don't.  But I think from round of 16 on, then it gets more nervous.   
 Q.  Why don't you like football?  
BRUNO SOARES: No, I like it.  Don't get me wrong, I like it.  But I don't follow it that close like Jamie does, like they know the players that watch, like, league and everything.  I really enjoy watching but I don't pay close attention.   
 Q.  Do you have a team back in Brazil?  
BRUNO SOARES: Cruzeiro.  One of the best.  Right, Jamie?   
JAMIE MURRAY: Ever, yeah.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible.)  
BRUNO SOARES: Well, we don't have that much cash.  The best player ever came from there.  We all know who I'm talking about --   
 Q.  Garrincha?  
BRUNO SOARES: -- if you saw my tweet yesterday (smiling).
