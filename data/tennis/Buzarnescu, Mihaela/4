M. BUZARNESCU/R. Peterson   
6-1, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
 Q.  I just wanted to ask you, you played a player who herself likes to control the rallies perhaps with her forehand and move her opponent around, and you also like to do the same, but it seemed like you did everything a little bit better than her overall, and thus we have this 6-1, 6-2 type of score.  I was wondering what you thought about that, or if on the next match you play someone who perhaps does not play into your type of style, what kind of adjustments you would have to make?  
MIHAELA BUZARNESCU: If she was not playing my style?  Sorry.  Yeah, one more time.   
 Q.  The second part.  What I meant is if you play against a player who perhaps gets a lot of balls back and makes you hit a lot of balls rather than trying to go for her shots herself, what type of adjustments you would make.  
MIHAELA BUZARNESCU: Probably still I would have to get my own game and myself trying to attack her and not make her put more balls in the court.   
So it's always about my own game.  I need to adapt on the opponent's game, but most of the time I'm trying to make my own game.   
So I would have to change the tactic.
