 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. What do you think was the difference between today and last year?
 AMANDA ANISIMOVA:   Well, today of course I was playing really bad.  It's been one of the worst matches I have played in a while.  I was just making mistakes all over the place.
 You know, it's a great experience and I'll definitely learn from it.  I wish Simona the best for the rest of the tournament.
 Q. Have you got any thoughts as to why that was, why you were making so many mistakes?
 AMANDA ANISIMOVA:   I don't know.  I guess it was just one of those days.  I was trying to get into a good rhythm, and I thought that I was going to start making my shots soon, because that was my game plan.
 I don't know.  It was just a bad day for me.
 Q. Did you see anything different from Simona this year?  Looked like she attacked the second serve pretty well.  Was it a little bit tougher for you because the surface is not quite as quick, and maybe you were forced to go for a little bit more, play with less margin?  Was that maybe an issue?
 AMANDA ANISIMOVA:   No, I like playing on slow surfaces.  I enjoy playing here.  So I don't really know.  I just really couldn't get into my own game today, and that was my biggest issue.
 It's really disappointing, but I'm motivated to go back and practice, and I'm looking forward to next year.
 Q. Have you generally found it more difficult this year perhaps because last year people didn't know you but now maybe people know you're a really good player, and so they are prepared to play you?
 AMANDA ANISIMOVA:   I don't really know, because I have been on the tour for a couple of years, since Indian Wells when I played Petra, so I guess it's been kind of a while.
 This year has been very difficult for me, especially mentally.  I'm doing a lot better now, so I'm just happy.  Honestly, today I'm just looking at the positives.  This isn't the worst thing in the world for me.  My game is getting better overall, and I'm just looking forward to the preseason.  Also, I'm playing in Ostrava in a couple of weeks.
 Q. Where do you train now?  Where is your base?
 AMANDA ANISIMOVA:   I live in Miami and I train with Nick Saviano at his academy.
 Q. You will be going back there from here, will you?
 AMANDA ANISIMOVA:   No, I'm not going to go back because there are a lot of travel restrictions.  It's just easier for me to stay.  Maybe I will be training in France.  I'm still deciding.
 Q. You will do your preseason in Miami?
 AMANDA ANISIMOVA:   Yeah, in Miami, yeah.
