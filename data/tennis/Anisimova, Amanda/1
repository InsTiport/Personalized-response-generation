 6-3, 6-3
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Can you talk a little bit about the match?  It seemed pretty much in your court, but you did have a little wobble there in the second set.
 AMANDA ANISIMOVA:   Yeah, I was definitely feeling it a little bit physically in the second set.  But after that one game I was able to regroup myself and get back into the game.  So I'm happy that I was able to do that and play some good tennis today.
 Q. It's been kind of a rough year for you.  You were over in the UAE and you got COVID and couldn't go on to Australia.  How tough was that?  Do you feel you're getting momentum now?
 AMANDA ANISIMOVA:   Yeah, that was definitely really tough.  Then again, when I went to the Doha tournament also like I fell and rolled my ankle.  So it was definitely a couple tournaments in a row there were tough situations.
 But I'm just happy that I'm able to stay healthy now, and I'm just grateful for the opportunity that I have here, and just to be able to play I'm really happy.
 I have been training a lot the last couple of weeks, so I feel good mentally and physically.  Yeah.
 Q. Briefly about playing at home.  Does it make it a little bit more special, a little easier?
 AMANDA ANISIMOVA:   Yeah, I mean, I have been training here before I left for my tournaments this year, so it's kind of like the same to me that I have been kind of practicing.
 But it's weird, because normally my friends and everybody will come and the stands are packed.  You know, you can feel everybody cheering for you.  So it's definitely a different situation.
 Hopefully next year it will be a little bit more crazy and everybody will be able to come.  But still, a couple of people that I know are able to come to my matches, so it's still nice.
