K. EDMUND/R. Olivo   
7-5, 6-3, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  After the match you did with Tsonga, which was probably the most important upset so far, did this bring kind of like too much of weight on you, psychological effect?  Did it affect the way you handled the second match?  Was it too big a win that surprised you?  So did it affect your second match?  
RENZO OLIVO: Yeah, I mean, yesterday was a big match for me.  And I think there was a lot of expectation on me, and I knew it, and I knew I had to handle the best way.  And I think I got into it today and it didn't work out.   
And I think the first set, I think it was very important for me.  And losing that first set, I think Kyle, he start playing better, and I start playing very defensive and making some mistakes in important moments.  And, yeah, I think I didn't handle the best way.
