A. RADWANSKA/J. Goerges
  7‑5, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Where did you come up short tonight? 
JULIA GOERGES:   What do you mean, where did I come up short?   What does it mean? 

Q.   What do you do wrong tonight? 
JULIA GOERGES:   Well, I don't think that I did so many things wrong, because she's a tough player and I was in both sets close to win both sets. 
Well, they're always like a few balls which I didn't play the way or which I missed, but it was still the way I should play it. 
Yeah, well, she doesn't give you anything.   She doesn't do any mistakes at all.   When she does a few, it's at 15‑All or 15‑Love, but not on the important moments. 
You need to dictate the game by yourself, and that's what I did.   Unfortunately it was not enough today, but still it was the right direction to play my game.

Q.   So disappointing tonight, but you've had a great week. 
JULIA GOERGES:   Well, I'm not disappointed because it was a big step in the right direction for me.   I was leaving everything on the court, so I don't know why I should be disappointed about this week.
She's a top 5 player; she's been there for a long time.   So if you lose 5 and 4 in one hour 40, I think I shouldn't be disappointed at all.   It gives me a lot confidence to see, okay, those players are close to me, and, well, I can still beat those players. 
That's a good sign for me.   I gave everything what I still had in my tank tonight.   I think at the end we were both pretty tired.   It was about two or three points at the end.   Still, I can be pretty proud of to this week.
