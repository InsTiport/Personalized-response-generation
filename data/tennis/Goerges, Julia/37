   THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Julia. 

 Q.  Is it tough coming in there sort of as a last-minute substitute, having to come in against somebody who is a three-time slam champ? 
 JULIA GOERGES:  Of course.  Well, I tried to play my best, and it was my first Fed Cup match.  If you play your first Fed Cup match against such a great player as Lindsay, it's really tough to go out.  It's 1-All in the tie.  You just try to go for your best, just fight for every point. 
 But, okay, she played really, really well and she made a great match.  I was just trying to fight for every ball and made a lot of points.  But, okay, she made a great match. 

 Q.  Was it hard to find rhythm against her? 
 JULIA GOERGES:  At the beginning I was a little bit nervous because my first Fed Cup match.  But I managed it really well at the beginning because was 1-All, I have a breakpoint, if I make it, it's 2-1 up for me, 30-Love on my serve.  But I didn't make it, so I was going down like 6-1. 
 But, okay, I think I started really well, from my opinion. 

 Q.  Did you watch her match on Saturday and did you think she was significantly better today? 
 JULIA GOERGES:  Yeah, of course.  She played not really well on Saturday.  But Sabine, she was playing really well on Saturday. 
 I thought it will be good like this because she wants to show that she can play better, and she's doing it better because she won already such a lot of tournaments.  So it was really hard for me to go out and just play and try to do your best. 

 Q.  When did you find out you'd be playing singles?  Was it something you had an idea about last night or was it just this morning? 
 JULIA GOERGES:  No.  I got the information yesterday.  I knew it already and I was ready yesterday.  But now I knew that I'm playing today. 
 THE MODERATOR:  Thank you.
