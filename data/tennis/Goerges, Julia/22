J. GOERGES/E. Svitolina   
7-5, 6-4   
 Q.  Can you just talk about the match and how you think you played?  
JULIA GOERGES: Well, I think it was pretty tough conditions today.  It's pretty windy and it's swirling around.   
But I think it was, overall, a very good match.  We both served well, so we didn't have quite a few chances.  But when I had the chance, I managed to make the break at the end.   
In both sets, I served it out pretty well, then.  I'm very glad to be through to my first Premier 5 quarterfinal.  Oh, no.  Wait.  I was in the final, Dubai.  No, that was a smaller tournament.  That was the smaller one of the two.   
 Q.  That's still -- it's a premier now.  
JULIA GOERGES: They're changing.  But I was in the one where the smaller draw was, but the points were -- no, so it's my first one.  I'm confused.   
 Q.  Pretty soon you're going to play the winner of Sloane Stephens and Makarova.  I don't know if that one finished yet.  
JULIA GOERGES: No, 5-3 Stephens in the third, I think.   
 Q.  Can you talk about those two?  
JULIA GOERGES: Well, it's a tough match, anyhow.  It doesn't matter who I'm going to face.   
First of all, I'm very glad the way I'm playing this week and in the previous weeks.  I'm just looking forward to another match today.   
Doesn't matter who it's going to be.  It's going to be a really tough one.  Both are great players.  I just need to focus on myself, my game, and I'm going for it.
