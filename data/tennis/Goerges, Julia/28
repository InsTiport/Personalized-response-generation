 J. GOERGES/J. Zheng
  6‑3, 1‑6, 7‑5 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   What happened at the end, last three games?   She was serving for the match and you came back.   Do you think she trembled?  
JULIA GOERGES:   No, I think these last four games, I think they were pretty good of myself.   Well, overall it was a great match.   I think we had tough rallies, good shots and good winners.  
Well, I stayed there the whole match.   I knew I always have a chance to break her because her serve is not so huge.   There is always a chance to fight back.  
I did it pretty well today.  
   
 Q.   Did the rain bother you?  
JULIA GOERGES:   No, not really.   It was just a little slippery at the very end, but that's all right.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about how do you think she played today, and also about your next match to play against Li Na?  
JULIA GOERGES:   As I said, I think it was a great match from both of us.   It could have gone either way.   I had the lucky end at the end, but, well, the next one is the same as today.   It's a tough one.   She's a Grand Slam champion, and I have to be there from the first second on.  
Well, you always have a chance to beat those players.   I have done it before.   Hopefully I can keep going like this.
