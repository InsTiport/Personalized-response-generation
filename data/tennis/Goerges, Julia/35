 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. What did you feel went wrong for you today? You seemed in control at a lot of points in the game. 
 JULIA GOERGES: Um, well, I just let it slip away in the beginning also. I was break up in the first set and I played really aggressive. It was everything the right way. 
 When I was up, I was always stopping my game. That's what I have to learn to get better. 

 Q. And in the final set?
 JULIA GOERGES: Well, it was actually the same almost. I fired up in the second set, and came strong to the third with a 40-15 lead in the first game. 
 Yeah, gave it back to her a little bit. Well, I tried everything, but, yeah, when I was leading I just gave it away.

 Q. So you need more killer instinct, is that the bottom line?
 JULIA GOERGES: Well, when I'm down -- I'm always playing my game, being aggressive and to go for my shots, and yeah, when I'm down, I stop playing my game. This is what I have to learn and get better on. 

 Q. Calmer mentally this time, though. No arguments with umpires about anything today?
 JULIA GOERGES: No. Why? I think I'm right when he should pronounce my name in the same way. I'm feeling good. I mean, you can ask me before how you should pronounce my name.

 Q. And he did it well today, right?
 JULIA GOERGES: He did it well, so...
