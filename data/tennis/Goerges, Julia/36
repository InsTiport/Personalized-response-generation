  6-3, 6-0 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions.   
  
  Q. You looked fairly comfortable. Did you feel in control from the start?  
 JULIA GOERGES: It's always strange waiting that long and then you go on court. The first three games were a bit shaky.   
 I didn't feel that well in the first games. But then as the match goes on, I felt pretty well then.   
  
  Q. What do you know about your potential opponents in the next round?   
 JULIA GOERGES: Actually, Johansson I played first round in Paris, so I know her from the match. Heather I haven't played yet. I have no idea how the score is right now with them, so...   
  
  Q. I think it's finished. It's Johansson.   
 JULIA GOERGES: So I know Johansson from French Open.
