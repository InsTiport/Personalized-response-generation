 A. RADWANSKA/J. Goerges
  6‑1, 6‑1 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
   
 Q.   What happened out there?   Seemed like you were a little bit out of sorts.   
JULIA GOERGES:   Well, I think nothing happened.   Well, yeah, it was one of those days where really nothing worked.   No balls went in.   She made I think two unforced errors in two sets.   
So it's pretty tough when you go for your shots and miss them most of the time‑ almost all.  
   
 Q.   Did you feel well or have any problems?   I know you had a virus last week.   
JULIA GOERGES:   No, I felt Okay.   I mean, it's warm, but it's not an problem or anything.   No, not really.  
   
 Q.   Just couldn't find your momentum?  
JULIA GOERGES:   Yeah, well I've never played her.   Yeah, it's kind of a strange game or not usual game what you normally get from players.   That's what makes her strong.  
It was tough for me to find my rhythm at all, and then when get lot of the balls back all the time it makes it even tougher for you.
