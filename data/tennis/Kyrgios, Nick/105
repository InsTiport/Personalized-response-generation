6-4, 6-4, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How did you fell about that overall?
NICK KYRGIOS: I'm really pleased with that one.  He's a good competitor.  He makes a lot of balls.  He's not going to give it to you.
Yeah, I was nursing a little bit of an injury, and I how I responded was really well.  I'm really happy.  I thought I played solid, returned well, served well, hit the ball well.  That was a pretty good all-around performance.
Q. What's the nature of the injury?
NICK KYRGIOS: It's my hip.  It's fine at the moment, which is really good.
Q. Is that just after Cincinnati you felt it?
NICK KYRGIOS: I actually upped my training a little bit.  Went to Miami, Boca, did a lot of training.  Obviously with the US Open I wanted to find my form, and I don't know, just a bit of a load but it's okay.  It's nothing to worry about.
Q. How did you find the court compared to last year?
NICK KYRGIOS: I didn't play on that court last year.
Q. The speed of the courts this year compared to last year?
NICK KYRGIOS: I played on Arthur Ashe last year against Murray, so I don't think it was the speed of the court, really.  I thought the conditions were -- you know, I thought they were great serving conditions on that particular court.  I like how sort of the barriers are close.  Big servers get a lot of confidence.
I thought I had a lot of rhythm, as well.  Slow, medium, fast.  I don't know.  I'm the worst person to ask that stuff, to be honest.
Q. Do you like when the fans are that close?  Bernie was having trouble with a spectator in the crowd.  Do you like having a crowd close to you?
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, I think the courts are really good.  I had my first title in Marseilles, and that was sort of the same sort of setup and I had some good results.  Even Atlanta was like that.
I think those courts favor big servers and guys who play big, the court seems a bit slower, for some reason.  Have a lot of confidence with the game.
Q. When you hear what people are saying, how much do you have to zone that out?
NICK KYRGIOS: I don't really zone it out, to be honest.  Some guy was like, Change your clothes, that's an awful outfit.
I was trying to come up with a comeback.  I didn't want to say anything.  He was an old man.  He got me this time.
Q. Next opponent.  Have you had a chance to check your record when you played him before?
NICK KYRGIOS: Who won?  Zeballos?
I haven't.  You know, he obviously beat Florian Mayer, who isn't an easy player to beat.  The guy has been around for a long time, obviously had a couple of injuries or illnesses.  I'm not too sure.
He missed a couple years or year or something.  Before that he was a guy who was dangerous.  He won a title this year, so he can definitely play.  I'm guessing it was a hell of a match.  I'm not going to do anything different.
Q. If you play on your terms, you think you'll probably get through?
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah.
Q. You mentioned playing Murray on Ashe.  Conditions didn't matter.  Do you feel like you have more of a draw to work with your seeding?  You should be able to make your way into...
NICK KYRGIOS: My head space last year wasn't the greatest.  I was obviously going through a lot of stuff last year through that whole Montreal thing.
I'm seeded 14 here, so I won't meet Murray until I'm a hell of a lot further through the draw.  I feel comfortable in general on the tennis court.  I feel more comfortable in my game against whoever I play.  I know what I can do on the tennis court.  I have beaten quality players.  I'm not afraid of these guys, but I'm aware they all can play some really good tennis.
Q. A random question:  Have you ever gotten your haircut at the tournament salon?  If not, where do you get it cut?
NICK KYRGIOS: I have.  I think the year where I qualified maybe I got it cut there.  I can't remember.  I'm sure they do a great job.
I just typed in "barbers" this year.  It was like old-school barber shops, indoors and upstairs and stuff.  Really good barbers here.  I think my hair is important, too.
Q. Have you been impressed with the Manhattan PokÃ©mon landscape?
NICK KYRGIOS: It's actually pretty solid.  I found one that I'm using.  It's good.  Real good.
Q. Radar?
NICK KYRGIOS: I'm not telling you.
