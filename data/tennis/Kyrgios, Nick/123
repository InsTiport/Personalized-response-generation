THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How do you sum that one up?  
NICK KYRGIOS: It was tough straight from the get-go.  I had pretty much won the easy service game, and that was the first game.   
He's just playing such good tennis.  I know his game plan.  You know, when he plays me, he plays so aggressive.  Doesn't let me dictate points.   
I felt washed out there.  I felt I just -- I was really looking for answers.  I was trying to serve and volley a couple times.  But he's playing great tennis.   
I gave everything I had.  I didn't serve well at all.  I've been struggling with my serve all week.  To come this far without having my best weapon there is a pretty good effort.  It's going to be a good final but he was too good today.   
 Q.  I was going to say I imagine you felt your serve let you down in key moments.  Backhand to backhand, that's a tough match with you with Kei, isn't it?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, it's going to be a tough match with anyone.  Backhand is one of my best shots.  His backhand is probably one of the best in the world.  Obviously Djokovic and then guys like Murray and stuff.   
My serve just let me down.  It didn't let me down, but I know there are going to be days where that happens.  I'm not going to be too caught up about it.  It's tough out there.  My hands are sweaty.  Tough to hold on to a racquet.  A couple of things that aren't always going to be like that.  For instance, in Marseilles or Dubai, I'm serving fine.  But here is just different conditions.   
I competed well so I'm not too fussed by it.   
 Q.  The unforced errors were 28-12.  When you play against a guy like Kei who moves so well, how difficult is it to find the spots to pick and choose if you want to, you know, go for anything?  He's so quick and gets to everything.  
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, I don't think it's just that.  He puts so much behind the ball, as well.  He's not just pushing it back.  It's like you put a ball half in the middle of the court, or even if it's not in the middle of the court, but he can just hit a winner from anywhere.  He just moves really well and returns well.  He's too good.   
 Q.  Putting aside the serves and volleys, what do you take out of these couple of weeks?  From what I'm seeing is that there is a lift in confidence, you feel more comfortable on the court.  What are your own views of it?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah.  I mean, to be honest, it's been a tough couple of weeks for me.  Indian Wells wasn't good.  I was struggling physically.  I was obviously sick.  Then I had a couple of things happen off the court.   
I wasn't expecting too much this week.  I was still trying to find my feet on the court.  Got through a good first round and just went from there.   
I'm really proud of my efforts this week.  Yeah, it just hurts to lose because I was playing -- I gave it everything and I lost.   
 Q.  You said the other day you're not taking things so seriously as you were before.  Do you think that's an advantage?  Moving forward, will you go with that same attitude going forward?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, I think so.  At the end of the day it is just tennis, you know.  Things happening every day that are more important.  So, yeah.   
 Q.  (Question about moving into clay court season.)  
NICK KYRGIOS: Obviously now I'm going to have a day or two off and then just start in on the clay and just try to find my feet.  I'm not going to set too many goals on the clay.  I thought my clay season last year was pretty good.  I had the biggest win of my career.  I'm confident I can play on that surface.  I'm just going to not change anything I usually do.   
 Q.  (off microphone.)  
NICK KYRGIOS: I don't understand the question.  Like what do you mean?   
 Q.  If you feel you have been misrepresented or...  
NICK KYRGIOS: I feel, yeah, definitely.  Yeah, I feel like nobody knows the real me.  But to be honest, I'd prefer to keep it that way.
