  N.  KYRGIOS/F. Delbonis  7-6, 3-6, 6-3, 6-7, 6-3  An interview with:  NICK KYRGIOS   THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   Q.  How important was the win to you, with the injury and everything?  NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, that was massive.  Obviously I haven't played a lot of competitive tennis in the past couple months due to injury.  It was really good to get my first win again.  It was my first win in 2015, Australian Open.  I'm really pleased I got through.  I'm really happy the way I pulled up, as well.   Q.  Did you feel a bit rusty early on?  NICK KYRGIOS: I didn't feel rusty.  I maybe felt pretty nervous out there obviously.  A lot of expectation.  So, you know, I didn't really have much confidence.  You know, I haven't played a lot of matches.  Haven't won a lot of matches in the last couple months.  I had belief in myself how things were going to swing.   Q.  Cranked up the serving speed as the match went on.  Is that just a matter of confidence?  NICK KYRGIOS: Obviously I was a bit looser towards the end the match.  I obviously lifted up my serving a little bit.   Q.  How were you able to get through that fifth set so quickly?  Was it just frustration from the fourth?  NICK KYRGIOS: You know, I guess -- I don't think he played bad at all.  I think his level might have dropped a little bit in the fifth.  I was starting to get on his serve more and I was starting to serve a little better as well and moved better.  As I said, I'm just really happy the way I pulled up physically for the fifth set.  I felt I could go on for a long, long time tonight.   Q.  Thanasi played his first five-setter tonight.  You've been there, done that.  How do you compare tonight's five-setter to your first experience?  NICK KYRGIOS: Massive.  Obviously the first five-setter I played was last year.  I was struggling towards the end of the third and the start of the fourth.  That's a massive improvement, especially since I haven't had the preparation I want.  I'm proud of Thanasi because he's dealing with things as well.  That's a massive win for him.  That's his first I guess nearly top 10 win, so I'm happy for him.   Q.  Is it a case where the longer the match goes, the more comfortable the back feels?  NICK KYRGIOS: Not just that.  You get used to your surroundings.  You feel as if your team's behind you.  Just the atmosphere, the adrenaline starting going.  So, yeah.   Q.  Ivo Karlovic next.  Big serving battle?  NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, he's obviously one of the best servers on tour.  Has been for a long, long time.  With age he seems to be hitting spots better.  I'm not going to think too much about that now.  I'm obviously going to get some food and get some rest and do everything I can tomorrow.   Q.  Can you talk us through the second set, the racquet and the point penalty?  NICK KYRGIOS: I got two code violations, so that equal a point penalty.  Yeah, obviously a little bit of frustration out there.  You know, the guy is playing well and obviously you want to win, so that's how the emotions came out.   Q.  Were you aware of what was happening on Thanasi's court?  Could you hear the noise?  NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, I could hear some noise obviously when he won a set or won a big point.  I think when I saw him win on the scoreboard, gave me a little bit of motivation.  That's what having a good relationship with him has done.  Yeah, as soon as I saw him win and the crowd got really behind him on my court, I was just real happy for him.   Q.  Was it anger with the second set was going or how you were?  NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, just losing the second set.  I don't really like losing, so I guess that's why I did it.   Q.  Did you expect tonight to be as tough as it was coming in?  NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, definitely.  I knew he's a top player.  He's playing some really good tennis.  I was really impressed the way he played.  He served really well.  Hit his forehand well.  Just where I was last week, I wasn't in a great head space playing Sydney and not making it through the whole match without my body holding me back.  So I'm really, really happy.   Q.  First time since 2003 so many men in the second round.  What does that mean?  NICK KYRGIOS: It's exciting when you have guys like Lleyton Hewitt still playing and guys coming up.  I don't think Australian tennis has been in this position for a long time.  Sam Groth's playing some unbelievable tennis.  He has a lot of confidence.  Duckworth.  There's so many names right now, so it's just an exciting time.
