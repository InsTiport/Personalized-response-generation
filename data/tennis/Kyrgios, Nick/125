A. RAMOS-VINOLAS/N. Kyrgios   
7-5, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  On the TV camera, as far as I could tell, there wasn't any kind of recording of what you were meant to have said.  Give us your take on that whole incident.  
NICK KYRGIOS: Obviously I didn't say anything.  You know, I'm the first person if I do something wrong that I will speak up if I did it.  It was a pretty crucial time.  I was obviously struggling out there.   
I was trying to just fight and hang in.  I created chances.  I'm not going to say that contributed to the loss or anything like that, but definitely didn't really help in the second set, for sure.   
 Q.  Was the health and fitness from Dubai and everything, how much of a hindrance has that been?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, it's been massive.  You know, I'm not going to take anything away from Ramos.  Every time I have played him it's been a tough match.   
Matchup-wise I think it's great for me, but he always goes out there and competes.  I thought that these conditions probably suit him.  He likes to rip his forehand a little bit.   
But, you know, I'm nowhere near where I was.  I was feeling great in Marseilles and the start of Dubai, but obviously the year hasn't been great.  I have had a lot of travel.  Trying to get better.  I was trying to force practice sessions here, trying to push, but body wasn't letting me do it.   
 Q.  Playing doubles here with Alexander.  How did that pairing come about?  Secondly, when you are out of the singles and still have doubles, do you wish you were in Miami or you still like to stay around here and do doubles?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, you know, I can't really remember saying yes, to be honest, to playing with Zverev, but we have become pretty good mates over the last couple of months.  I think we organized the play in Marseilles.   
So, yeah, I mean, it's good.  If I'm capable of playing, I'm going to play.  I think it's a great opportunity for us to go out there and get more court time and a great tournament.   
 Q.  That was obviously a tricky call that happened when you had those breakpoints.  Do you feel like you carry the reputation with you and people maybe have a grudge against you or maybe like the umps are looking extra hard during your matches for any little momentum buildings?  Do you get that feeling?  
NICK KYRGIOS: If I've got a reputation, so be it.  If I'm not saying anything -- I mean, I didn't say anything.  I was just speaking to my team.  I wasn't swearing or anything.   
 Q.  What percentage are you able to work at the moment as far as training and practicing with regards to the virus?  
NICK KYRGIOS: I mean, you know, leading up to an event like this I'd like to do two, three hours a day.  I'm lucky to get 45 minutes in at a decent level.   
 Q.  Did you think about not playing here?  
NICK KYRGIOS: You know, I thought -- obviously when Davis Cup was on, I was progressing, I was on antibiotics, and I thought there would be time to play.   
Once I got better, I'd be okay to play.  Actually, I lost a lot of fitness.  I have been sleeping a lot.  You know, I'm just not where I'd like to be.   
 Q.  When did you get here?  How much have you trained since you got here?  
NICK KYRGIOS: I got here about four days ago now, and, you know, I hit when I got off the plane in the afternoon for an hour or so.   
Then, you know, I have just been trying to push.  It's been tough.  Hasn't been easy.   
 Q.  Have you and Bernie spoken about Davis Cup?  He said what he said.  Have you guys talked at all this week about that?  
NICK KYRGIOS: We haven't really talked about it, but I'm not --you know, I'm not really gonna say too much about it.  I'm just a bit disappointed.   
He saw me when I flew down to Melbourne and I was -- you know, his exact words were, You know, you look like shit.  I was disappointed to hear it from him, but, I'm not going to say anything about it.   
He's a great guy and a great player.
