THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. In your singles match you appeared to be struggling a bit with the shoulder. Right, was it the right shoulder? How much did that affect your game in the singles?
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, a lot. Obviously I played the Laver Cup before this event and I wasn't able to compete on day three of the Laver Cup. So, I mean, I was battling with a bit of a shoulder/collar bone injury. I was playing well in the first set, I was obviously up a break serving for the set and, I mean, yeah, my shoulder was, yeah, I was obviously struggling a lot. I'm serving usually somewhere around the 230 kilometers an hour mark and I wasn't even able to crack about 180.
So, yeah, I mean I was obviously hindered a lot, but I mean he played as well as he had to today to take me down with what I had and, yeah, it was, he played too good, he's a tough competitor.
Q. Did something click or something in your shoulder, because like you say you started off playing reasonably well and then suddenly it sort of fell apart a little bit.
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, no, I was playing well from the ground for sure. I was playing well from the ground all through the match, I even thought in the second set, I wasn't serving, but from the ground I was feeling good.
I mean I was feeling this, I felt this about a week and a half ago and then obviously at Laver Cup it kind of flared up a little bit and then it set into it. There's been some clicking in my right shoulder and it's been pretty uncomfortable through my collar bone area.
So at this at any rate I'm not even too sure what I'm going to do moving forward with the rest of my season. I'm going to have to talk to my team and see what's best. Yeah, at this stage it doesn't look great.
Q. Do you seriously think that the doctors could ask you to sit out for a few weeks or perhaps even the rest of the season?
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, for sure, I mean at this rate I wouldn't be surprised. I wasn't able to even serve at a reasonable pace. I mean, there's no point for me to play if I can't really serve, because serving is my strength, my favorite shot, my whole game is based around it and that's where I've had my success this year when I've been serving my best.
So if I'm not able to serve at my best and I'm hindered, I'm probably not going to bother playing until I can get it right again.
Q. You've said things like this before at various points when things haven't gone well for you. Do you think though realistically with the way the calendar falls between here and the end of the year this might be a good opportunity to get ready for Australia?
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, I mean, that's a great way to look at it. Obviously I got Davis Cup, I want to play Davis Cup toward the end of the year, that's mid November I think, so until now and then I've got a lot of time, I can rest, recover, get my shoulder right. And, I mean, man, I haven't been home in almost seven months. So maybe a blessing in disguise, I'm not too sure, but, yeah, at this rate I'm not thinking about playing until my shoulder's -- or I don't even know what it is -- but until my front of my shoulder feels better and I can serve, yeah.
Q. And is there a mental tiredness as well, because there was talks of distractions at the Laver Cup and today you started playing tweener shots and so, I know you do that anyway, but it just seemed like some of the easier put aways weren't going in, it wasn't just the shoulder that was working against you.
NICK KYRGIOS: I don't think I played one tweener today.
Q. It was in the first set.
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, but when I was chopping him, when I could actually serve.
Q. When you were playing well you were still --
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, when I play well I serve and I hit tweeners and that's usually what happens when I win and then, yeah, I mean the reason I lost today was because I couldn't serve. If I could serve, it would have been a pretty routine win for me, to be honest.
Q. Just bearing in mind that with the problem you said you are obviously having, why did you choose to play the doubles despite obviously being in pain?
NICK KYRGIOS: Well he's my good mate. He flew from Europe to come here and play, so I just took some pain killers and I didn't serve, I mean I barely served 50 percent, I was just rolling my serve in. And we almost won, so it's good that he has another opportunity to go out there and play and obviously it's good money for him, so I'm not a selfish person, so that's why I did that.
