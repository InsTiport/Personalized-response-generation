THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. The knee update, please?
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, it's feeling really good.  I've done four or five treatments on it.  Got one more tomorrow.  Yeah, it's feeling a lot better since I last competed, which was in Perth.  So I've had massive improvements in my knee.
Q. And the treatment is?
NICK KYRGIOS: Just putting, like, patches on my knee.  It's another way to insert some cortisone in my knee.
Q. Happy about the Hisense situation?
NICK KYRGIOS: Definitely.  I think Hisense is one of my favorite courts, if not my favorite.  I feel confident on that court.  I love the way it looks.  I like the dimensions of it.  It's a great serving court.  Yeah, I like playing there.
Q. When you played the Fast4 just a few days after Perth, you looked pretty good.  Were you feeling pain-free?
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, a couple, two days.  I think I played four days after.  Yeah, I had a couple treatments.  I had to test it out there.  If I wasn't able to play Fast4, I probably wasn't going to look good to play a best of five match.  I had to test it out there.  It was still giving me some pain, but definitely feeling some improvement already.
Q. How do you feel about your draw?
NICK KYRGIOS: I think it's very good.  Obviously you get rewarded with a good draw the higher your seeding is.  I played well last year.  Got my ranking to top 30 in the world.  I've been awarded with a pretty good draw.
Saying that, Elias can play some pretty high-level tennis.  Everyone in the draw can, can beat anyone on the day.  I got to go out there and not expect to win the match.  I got to go out there and just play and we'll see how it goes.
Q. What are your expectations, Nick, coming in here, given obviously you haven't played a regular tour event for a while, and the knee?  Where are you setting the bar?
NICK KYRGIOS: You know, I'm never been a player to play many tournaments before a Grand Slam.  I like to come in pretty fresh.  So my expectations are high.  I still feel like I can do some major damage and get to the second week and really cause some upsets, so...
My expectations are still pretty high.
Q. Do you get a sense from the Australian public, there's been some rocky moments lately, do you get a sense that everyone is behind you and wants to see you play to your full potential?
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah.  I thought in Perth everyone was behind me.  In the Fast4, as well.  I think it would be silly not to.  We got two players in the top 30 that can do really well and go deep in the draw.  We got a lot of guys in the draw that can do well, younger guys.  Jordan Thompson is playing well now.  It's exciting.  It's an exciting time for Australian tennis.  Yeah, I think everyone should just get behind everyone because we all can play well.
Q. Did you do much different in the off-season this year compared to previous years?
NICK KYRGIOS: I had a bit more of a schedule this year.  I had a strength conditioner.  We've been working pretty hard.  Yeah, I guess it was a couple weeks where I didn't have him this year.  I kind of did my own thing.  I think that's how my knee started flaring up a little bit.  Live and learn, hopefully next year I'll get it right.
Q. Do you feel a different player than last year when you sat in that chair?
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah.  I feel like last year I was an established top-hundred player.  I hadn't beat top guys on a consistent basis.  I feel like now I know what I can do on the court.  Last year I was pretty consistent throughout the year.  Won three titles.  Got to 13.  I feel more comfortable on the court.  I know what my game is, I know how to play it.  I know I can beat anyone on the day.
