 N. KYRGIOS/J. Monaco
  7‑6, 6‑3, 6‑4 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
   
 Q.   How do you assess that?   Looked a little bit flat early.   Heard talk about a headache.   Were you ill out there at all?  
NICK KYRGIOS:   I've just had a little bit of a sinus infection the last couple weeks.   It's getting to the end stages of it.   But it's still affecting me a little bit.   It's going to go away eventually.   But it is, it's pretty annoying at the start of matches.   Started getting blurry vision.   
I thought I dug out the first set well.   Obviously lifted my energy towards the second and third.  
   
 Q.   He's a former top‑20 player.   Doing it in three sets, must be pleased the way you're going?  
NICK KYRGIOS:   Yeah, definitely.   He's capable of playing some pretty good tennis.   He's been in the third round here a couple times.   I was really surprised.   He was hitting pretty big, pretty flat.   I thought to beat him in straight sets is a pretty good performance.   
I thought I served real well today.   My energy was really good, as well.  
   
 Q.   Raonic next.   How is that considering what happened here last year?  
NICK KYRGIOS:   Yeah, I'm excited.   Obviously to play a guy like that, he's pretty much at the top of the game.   After last year's performance against him, I'm confident I can do well.   
But at the same time, if a guy is serving as well as he is, it's going to be tough.   I know what I have to do out there.   But at the same time, there's not so much you can do on his serve.   
   
 Q.   When you have a physical issue you're dealing with, what effect does the fan base have for you?  
NICK KYRGIOS:   Yeah, that's massive.   I think, if they're behind you, pushing you, you just have to dig in and fight through.   I thought I did that well in the first set.   
If he would have won that first set, it could have been a completely different match out there.   I think that first set was a massive part of that match.   
   
 Q.   How bad was it coming back after beating Nadal and playing against Raonic?  
NICK KYRGIOS:   It was tough, obviously, emotionally.   I didn't get much sleep the night leading up to the Rafa match or after.   
I thought I backed it up pretty well.   I lost to Milos in a tight four‑set match.   I had chances to win that.   I had a break in the third.   I can take confidence out of that.   I feel I'm a much better athlete than what I was last year.   
   
 Q.   There was a moment in the first set that you told the Fanatics it was not the best time to be singing.   Does that distract you, the noise?  
NICK KYRGIOS:   I can't even remember saying that.   
   
 Q.   Right at the end.   
NICK KYRGIOS:   I don't know.   
   
 Q.   What happened with the linesman?   What was said to the umpire at the end of the first set?  
NICK KYRGIOS:   I don't know what he said.   I was just asking the umpire what the line judge said.   I was just curious.   I wasn't causing any drama there.   
   
 Q.   Last year against Raonic you said you ran out of petrol basically at the end.   Your endurance these days, how do you feel about that?  
NICK KYRGIOS:   That's where I feel as I've drawn a lot of confidence.   You know, today I didn't feel my body aching or anything at all, in my legs.   That's a lot of confidence.   
I thought last year against Raonic, I gave absolutely everything I could.   I lost 7‑6 in the fourth set.   If it was going to a fifth, I feel I could have completely emptied the tank.   I feel like I'm a lot more confident coming into it.  
   
 Q.   Much talk about the heat today.   What sort of effects did you find from that?  
NICK KYRGIOS:   I mean, playing standpoint, it speeds up the play a little bit.   Yeah, I mean, it was pretty hot out there today.   Bernard, he said he struggled a little bit with that.   I thought I ticked all the boxes well.   Ate a lot on the court, bananas, drunk, ice, towel, all that sort of stuff.   So I thought I did well.   
   
 Q.   Are you aware you're swearing quite loudly, and that's what makes the line judge talk to the umpire, or are you not realizing it?   
NICK KYRGIOS:   What's the question?   
   
 Q.   Are you aware of sort of what you're saying and how loudly you're swearing, given I think that's what prompted the line judge to go to the umpire and say, Say to him you just said this.   
NICK KYRGIOS:   Yeah, I guess, yeah.   I'm aware of what I'm saying.   I'm in pain and I'm playing a tennis match at Wimbledon second round.   A bit of stress out there.   
   
 Q.   I'm saying the reason...   
NICK KYRGIOS:   I guess that's why he did it.   
   
 Q.   What did the chair umpire say to you?  
NICK KYRGIOS:   He sort of said‑‑ I don't know.   I just thought he thought he was top dog in the chair really.   He was telling me not to speak to him, all that stuff.   Doesn't really matter, you know.   
   
 Q.   Apart from the serve with Milos, what's the most difficult part of his game?   Is it return?   
NICK KYRGIOS:   Yeah, he's improved a lot from the back.   Feel he's putting a lot more pressure on the people's serve.   He's getting a lot more points.   I think he's moving a lot better.   He's just finding more confidence from the ground.   
He's improved a lot, as well.   But, I mean, that serve, I think it's possibly the best in the game at the moment.   
   
 Q.   You said you knew what you have to do against him.   What is that?  
NICK KYRGIOS:   Obviously I've got to look after my serve.   I don't want him breaking me too many times.   I have to try to keep creating pressure on his serve.   Do whatever I can, scrape out points.   Stay competing the whole time, from the first ball to the last.
