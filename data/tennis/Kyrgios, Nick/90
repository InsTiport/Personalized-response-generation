7-6 [Ret.]
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Any feedback yet of what's going on?
NICK KYRGIOS: No, just went to the doctors, they gave me some anti-inflammatories.  I'm not going to get a scan, as yet.  I got the injections a couple weeks ago, and then I was in rehab for a couple of weeks and it settled down, and then on that fall I just felt sharp pain.
So I felt pretty much everything I was feeling a month ago.  It's not great at the moment.  But we'll see.
Q. Must be really hard for you.  Can't really catch a break at the moment?
NICK KYRGIOS: I mean, there are worser things in the world than a guy slipping playing tennis.  I'm sure I'll live.
Q. Looks like you were trying to stay in the match.  After the injury you kept playing for it.  You were staying there.  If you had won the first set, would you have kept playing or withdrawn?
NICK KYRGIOS: Probably not.  I have been playing with a sore hip for a long time.  I felt it was painful, and it's not really worth it.  Obviously my main goal is to play well at Wimbledon, so I'm going to try and get it better and rehab it and hopefully it settles down.  I'm sure it will.  There is no point of playing on if I'm feeling pain in my hip.
Q. Did it feel worse than it did before or the same?
NICK KYRGIOS: I don't know if it felt worse, but it just was a sharp pain when I fell.  I started feeling it when I was walking, when I was landing on my serve.  It's exactly what I was feeling in Paris.  I mean, it's tough to play through.
Q. What about the right knee?
NICK KYRGIOS: No, the right knee is fine.  I fell on that a couple days ago in practice.  It's more precautionary.  My knee is fine.
Q. Prognosis for Wimbledon still pretty positive?
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, 100%.  I mean, I'd play Wimbledon if I was injured pretty bad, anyway.  I'm here, anyway.  I don't really have time to go home or anything.  Yeah, I will be playing, for sure.
Q. Was the court a bit slippy?
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, I think they are.  They are always a bit slippery on the first couple of days.  The court is obviously new, pretty slick, especially centre court.
I was expecting it.  It is what it is, honestly.  Doesn't really -- whatever.
Q. Would it be fair to say you're reasonably optimistic about Wimbledon at this point early?
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, of course.  Yeah.
Q. What will you do now in the next few days?
NICK KYRGIOS: Dog & Fox (smiling).
