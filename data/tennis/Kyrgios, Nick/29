7-6, 7-6, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  I think we heard you say you couldn't very see well. Was there an issue?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Just different conditions. Ashe is a massive court. It took me a little while to get adjusted. It was very tough to see.   
He played great tonight. Was super aggressive. I never felt comfortable. That was just credit to him playing his game. Yeah, it was tough.   
 Q.  He's obviously been in good form recently. What did you try to do to unsettle him?  
NICK KYRGIOS: I mean, I had chances. I just didn't take them. I mean, he's playing well. Had a great week in Cincinnati. I wish him all the best. I hope he goes really deep.   
Yeah, nowhere near my best tennis, but it is what it is.   
 Q.  There was a point where the microphone picked you up saying you didn't really want to be here, you wanted to go home. Were you not enjoying being out there?  
NICK KYRGIOS: I guess I've been on the road five and a half months now. It's not easy.   
 Q.  Planning on going home now from here?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Not sure yet. I got doubles tomorrow. I don't know yet. We'll see. I don't have much time before Laver Cup. We'll see how the scheduling works out. I guess that's a disadvantage playing from Australia.   
 Q.  How about after Laver Cup?  
NICK KYRGIOS: I mean, I got the very important Asia swing. Don't want to miss that.   
 Q.  The suspension potentially, would you welcome that in any way?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Would I welcome it?   
 Q.  Maybe a chance to get home for a few months.  
NICK KYRGIOS: I don't know if I look at it like that (smiling).   
I don't know. I have no say in it. I guess it's out of my control.   
 Q.  Have you talked to anybody who is doing the decision making on your fate?  
NICK KYRGIOS: I haven't, to be honest. I mean, no, I haven't. I haven't heard anything about it.   
 Q.  What do you think they should do?  
NICK KYRGIOS: I don't know, man. What do you think they should do?   
 Q.  I've been asked that. I don't have an answer.  
NICK KYRGIOS: Deep down you might have an answer (smiling).   
Yeah, I guess I'm a pretty boring player. I don't bring much to the sport, so...   
 Q.  At one point you said 'Call of Duty will ruin my life.'  
NICK KYRGIOS: That's hilarious. I was just taking a shot because I game a lot. My eyes might have taken a while to adjust to the lights, yeah. Bit of a gamer.   
 Q.  How do you reflect on your summer season? A lot of good moments for you.  
NICK KYRGIOS: It's been fun, that's for sure. It's been pretty consistent. No, I mean, it seemed all right. Just up and down, rollercoaster stuff. I had fun. Definitely had some great moments. Still got doubles tomorrow. Not completely out of the tournament. It's been all right.   
 Q.  What caught your attention to Tom Rinaldi?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Amazing aura about him. Yeah, it was awesome.   
 Q.  Did you know...  
NICK KYRGIOS: No idea.   
 Q.  What do you think the most important things you need to focus on to maximize your tennis potential?  
NICK KYRGIOS: I don't know. You guys are the experts. You tell me.   
 Q.  I'm no expert.  
NICK KYRGIOS: No idea.
