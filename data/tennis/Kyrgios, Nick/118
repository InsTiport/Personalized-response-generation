6-2, 7-6, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Can I ask about the nature of the arm, shoulder problem you had?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, I felt it this morning when I was in my warmup, and I didn't think it was anything, but it was bothering me a little bit and I got physio on it.  It actually loosened up toward the start of the second set, so it's hopefully not too bad.  Feels okay now.   
 Q.  Overall, it seemed like quite a frustrating loss out there.  Is that fair to say?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, I got absolutely destroyed.  Wasn't really fun.   
 Q.  Very competitive in the second set, though.  Especially in that tiebreak.  Did you feel like you were potentially on the cusp of getting your momentum back there?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Definitely.  I had chances in the breaker, and I just didn't play -- I struggled today pretty much in every aspect.  I had chances in the second and I just didn't play big.  I just played really bad today.  Really bad.   
 Q.  How difficult is it playing a Frenchman on that court?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, I mean, he played -- I thought -- he's been playing well.  He's obviously comfortable on that court.  I mean, he's got one of the best backhands in the world.  I thought I might have overplayed it a little bit.  But, I mean, I mean, it was tough.   
The crowd obviously loves him.  Got behind him.  I just didn't play well at all.  He played well.  Yeah.   
 Q.  You had a few words during the game to your box.  Was something concerning you?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Don't want to talk about it.   
 Q.  Is this one of those type of days you want to forget, move on from and concentrate on the grass?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, definitely.  Leaves a bit of bad taste in my mouth.  I thought I had a good clay court season leading up, and it was just a bad performance today.   
 Q.  You mentioned that the shoulder or arm loosened up in the second set.  It's not an ongoing concern to head to the grass court season?  
NICK KYRGIOS: No, I don't have another tournament for a while now.  I can just get treatment and just look after it.  Yeah.   
 Q.  In particular, I could hear you talking about your ball toss.  Was it your backhand as well?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, backhand and ball toss.
