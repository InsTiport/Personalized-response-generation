I. MARCHENKO/N. Kyrgios
4-6, 6-4, 6-1 (ret.)
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Must be really disappointed?
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, obviously I'm pretty disappointed.  You know, a great opportunity.  He's a solid player.  I'm sure he's going to do well next round.
But obviously, yeah, it's not great, is it?
Q. How tough is it to pull rip cord on the match even when you know you're hurt?
NICK KYRGIOS: It's tough.  I don't like to retire.  It's probably like the second or third time I've done it.  It's never easy, of course.  I've got a lot of belief in my game to still win matches when I'm not feeling great.
His strength is to make balls, you know, move you around.  It's not great.  Yeah, I mean, to be fair, my hip was bothering me my first two matches and I got through.  I guess it was just a matter of time.
Q. (No microphone.)
NICK KYRGIOS: I hit a couple wide forehands that didn't feel too good, yeah.
Q. It got worse tonight than it has been before?
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, it's not going to get better by playing, I guess, yeah.
Q. Does this put you down for Davis Cup?
NICK KYRGIOS: I don't really care right now, to be honest.  Yeah, hopefully I get better in time.  Obviously I want to play.  But I'm not really thinking about that right now.
Q. What was the advice of the trainer?  You might possibly do further damage?
NICK KYRGIOS: He completely understands what's happening.  He knows it's painful.  It's almost just hard mentally to play with something like that.
He did everything he could.  My physio has been helping me all week.  I've been trying to fix it all week.
But it's the whole year leading up to it with the whole schedule.  I got to take more time and be more diligent with, you know, gym and everything so this doesn't happen to me.
