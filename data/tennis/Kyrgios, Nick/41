N. KYRGIOS/D. Medvedev   
6-3, 3-6, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You are a champion, very funny player.  How much do you like to give a show on the courts?  
NICK KYRGIOS: That's the nicest question I've had in my life.   
Yeah, it was a lot of fun.  Today I knew it was going to be tough.  Medvedev is an unbelievable player.  He's had a great year.  Last year he played really well.  I knew today was going to be very tough because I haven't played much on the clay.   
I just tried to serve really big.  I tried to dictate as much as I could.  A lot of dropshots.  I was trying to throw him off his game because I knew he loves rhythm.  He's a great player.   
Today was a lot of fun.  I thought the crowd was a lot of fun.  Yeah, I think it's very important to go out there and put on a bit of a show.   
 Q.  Are all the tournaments for you more or less the same?  Do you feel a difference between one atmosphere and another?  Is there a place you like more to go instead of another one, the crowd, the weather, the place?  
NICK KYRGIOS: I just like home.  I don't really like leaving Canberra, my home.  It's all the same to me.  I just play tennis.  When I get to go home, I'm super happy.  When I leave home, I'm unhappy.   
 Q.  Casper Ruud next.  Do you know much about him?  
NICK KYRGIOS: I don't know much about him.  I know he loves the clay.  He's had a pretty good couple of months.  He's obviously won a lot of matches, playing well.  I know it's going to be a grind.   
I'm going to try to keep things on my terms.  He beat a quality player last round.  He did play well.  I'm not even thinking about it.  Nothing is going to change for me.  I'm just going to go out there and serve and just play on instinct, see how it goes.
