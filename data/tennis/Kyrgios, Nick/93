N. KYRGIOS/I. Karlovic   
4-6, 7-6, 6-3   
 Q.  A bit of a serving battle between you and Ivo.  How did you feel the conditions affected the play after continuing from last night?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, it was tough, obviously.  You know, having a couple of break points last night, I didn't take them.   
Then coming back today, had a very slow start.  It was very windy out there, so I couldn't get anything going on my serve.  Obviously he can serve through any sort of type of conditions.   
I just had to stay tough.  Obviously got a couple of lucky points in the breaker and forced a third set.  Yeah, just managed to find some rhythm and find some energy and obviously take the third set.   
 Q.  Looking ahead, you have Rafa or Albert Ramos-Vinolas tonight.  How will you prepare for that one?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, it's going to be tough.  Either one of those guys, they're lefties, and they know how to win tennis matches.   
I have played them both before and beat them both but also lost to them both.  I know it's going to be a tough battle.
