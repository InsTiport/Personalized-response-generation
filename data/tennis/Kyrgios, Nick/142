THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   It was over quite quickly.   Were you able to settle into this match, do you feel?  
NICK KYRGIOS:   I just felt uncomfortable the whole time, really.   Not feeling great.   
He's obviously playing well.   I mean, he hasn't had much time on the grass but obviously winning the French Open, he's comfortable.   
He hit the ball massive, free swinging out there.   I almost found it difficult to get myself engaged and didn't want to be there.  
   
 Q.   Is it partly because you haven't been able to practice fully because of the injury after Paris?  
NICK KYRGIOS:   No, I don't know.   I had enough time on court.   I thought I had been practicing okay.   I don't know.   It was tough today.  
   
 Q.   You seemed to be coughing quite a lot out there.   Are you actually not feeling very well?  
NICK KYRGIOS:   Well, yeah, I don't usually cough just because I can.   Yeah, I'm obviously not feeling great.  
   
 Q.   How was it to just push through in that sort of situation?   Do you feel you kind of just got to go through, whatever?  
NICK KYRGIOS:   Yeah, I mean, I need matches on grass obviously.   Even though I didn't win today, I still have time on grass, serving, returning, just getting a feel for it.   I thought I was all right in that sort of sense.  
   
 Q.   Looking ahead to Wimbledon, that was your big breakout last year.   You say you're not feeling too well at the moment, but are you looking forward to going to Wimbledon?  
NICK KYRGIOS:   Yeah, I feel confident still.   I know that I could do some good things there, and I know that I don't necessarily need too many matches before Grand Slams.   Australian Open, as well.   I had one match going in there.   
I don't know.   I just need to chill out for a couple of days, I guess.   I'm pretty tired.  
   
 Q.   Even going with a couple of losses, you know you can go into the big stage?   You can still...   
NICK KYRGIOS:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   When did it all come on?  
NICK KYRGIOS:   I have been sick for the last week.   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   A lot of people had it coming out of Paris.   Andy said he got back from Paris and a lot of people were sick there.   Was it something in the locker room?  
NICK KYRGIOS:   I don't know, mate.   I don't know.   I'm not a doctor.  
   
 Q.   What will you do now?   Just practicing?   Will you try to get some games somewhere?  
NICK KYRGIOS:   Probably going to stay in my house for a couple of days and sleep, play computer games and chill out.   Not think about tennis, turn off all tennis channels, delete my ATP app, and just not think about tennis for a week or so.  
   
 Q.   Like you said, you don't feel like you need to have lots of time on court to be able to perform at a Grand Slam.   You said you don't feel like you necessarily have to have lots of form and momentum to go and perform at a Grand Slam.   Can you sort of cling to that, at least?   
NICK KYRGIOS:   Yeah.   Yep, yep.   
   
 Q.   Will you play a tournament at all next week?  
NICK KYRGIOS:   I don't know.   I can't tell you at the moment.   
   
 Q.   Do you actually have a base in London, a place here, or do you just rent one?  
NICK KYRGIOS:   I'm renting a house for a month.   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   You were just saying you really didn't want to be out there.   Is it more just to do with not feeling well and sounds like the flu or whatever, or is it a bigger picture?  
NICK KYRGIOS:   I think it's a bit of both.   I have been battling mentally a bit.   I think it's a bit of both.  
   
 Q.   Is it a question of ‑‑I mean, you make no secret of the fact you miss your family.   You have been on the road for a long time.   Is it something to do with that?  
NICK KYRGIOS:   Yeah.   Yep.   
   
 Q.   (Question about buying a scooter.)  
NICK KYRGIOS:   I don't know, mate.   I just bought a scooter because I felt like buying a scooter.   I can't tell you if it's linked to tennis or anything like that.   I just bought a scooter.   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   To get over this kind of ‑‑you're switching off tennis, but are you looking at bringing over some of your family and doing something different?  
NICK KYRGIOS:   Yeah.   I already flew one of my friends in, and my dad is coming in in about a week.   We will see how it goes.   It's tough at the moment, like I say.
