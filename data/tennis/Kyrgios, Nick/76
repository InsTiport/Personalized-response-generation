THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Entertaining match.  Talk a bit about it, how you felt out there.
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, you know, I played him last year.  Obviously didn't have a great one last year.  Obviously got suspended after that.  I just wanted to go out there today and kind of redeem myself a little bit from last year.  I just wanted to prove to myself how much I have improved.
Yeah, I knew it was going to be tough.  He plays a very old-school type of tennis, likes to come forward a lot.  I knew it was going to be tough.
I got broken early in the first.  Then I kind of knew I had to loosen up and find my rhythm a little bit.  I started serving much better, started just relaxing.  I knew I was going to feel pretty comfortable at some stage out there.  Obviously just really happy to get through.
Q. The between points was almost as interesting as during the points.  Skipped the changeover at one point, playing along with the music.  What was going through your mind at those points?
NICK KYRGIOS: Nothing really.  Just chilling out.
Q. You signed to play Antwerp, the tournament in Belgium, later in the season.  Antwerp, a tournament in Belgium.
NICK KYRGIOS: Antwerp, sorry.
Q. Just want to know why you picked this one, what you know about Belgium, what you expect from this tournament.
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, obviously played Davis Cup in Brussels a couple weeks ago.  It was heartbreaking.  You know, every time I think about it, it makes me pretty sad.
I was probably going to go back home possibly after Shanghai.  I knew if I went home, I probably wasn't going to come back and play Basel and Paris.  I knew I had to do something to keep me going.
Obviously Antwerp, yeah, was nice enough to give me a wild card.  I think I'm going to take one.  I thought it was a good opportunity to go there and play, hopefully just keep in the mode of tournament mode, just finish the year strong, hopefully have a good result there.
If I went home, there's no chance I was going to come back.  Australia's the best place in the world.
Q. It's your first time in Beijing.  Talk a bit about it.  Have you got a chance to see the city?  How are you finding the tournament?
NICK KYRGIOS: I think the tournament's pretty nice.  I haven't really explored too much.  But I went for a walk, went to the shopping mall, saw a movie.  Yeah, I've done a little bit.
But, you know, I played Tokyo last year.  I think these two, they're pretty nice events.  Yeah, it's pretty good.
Q. Just about your PlayersVoice piece, have you had a lot of players react to that?  Do you feel like a lot of players feel the way you do, love-hate relationship with tennis but not talk about it publicly?
NICK KYRGIOS: I don't know.  I don't know if they have the same view as me on tennis.  I think a lot of the guys that are playing at the moment on tour love it.  They'll definitely do a lot more than I do.
I was talking about this the other day.  I think if you look at the top 20 or 30, you look at everyone in the top 20 or 30, I'm probably doing 20% of what they're doing, so...
I don't know if they feel the same way.
