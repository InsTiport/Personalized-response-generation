6-2, 6-1
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Wonder if you could do us a favor.  We sit so high up in the stands, we don't really know what's going on.  It did seem the first game was a bit early to get a warning.  I certainly thought you had a point when you got the point penalty because the umpire appeared to be advising Rafa.
NICK KYRGIOS: What was that?  Sorry, the second bit?
Q. The umpire seemed to suggest to Rafa it would be worth his while making a challenge.
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, I mean, the first game obviously came out firing.  Had a breakpoint.  Hit a backhand.  Pretty much had a ball on top of the net.
I don't know, I just got super frustrated.  I just didn't think it was fair, first game in the match, breakpoint.  You set the tone early, come out, break him first game.  It's a replay of the point.  It's not really fair.  Yeah, I mean, I obviously didn't react professionally.  Obviously that's why I got a warning.
But, I mean, that didn't really matter today.  He played well.  I played terrible.  He's in great form.  He just destroyed me today, so...
Too good.
Q. And the challenge thing?
NICK KYRGIOS: The challenge thing I think was just ridiculous.  I mean, he hit a serve.  I didn't know which mark it was.  I asked him which one it was.  He told me it was that one.  I said challenge, because it was out.  Then didn't let me challenge.
The next game, Rafa hit a serve, asked him which the mark was.  He said, It's this one, I think you should challenge.  He challenged.  It was in.
Exact same thing happened, and he got the challenge and I didn't.  I was getting chopped anyway, so it didn't really matter.
Q. What are the positives you'll take from this week, though?
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, I guess I put in a pretty good week, had some good wins.  I mean, I don't know.  It's tough to find positives when you won three games in the final.
But yeah, I mean, I guess there was positives.  In the semifinal I played well, obviously beating Alex.  It's a typical type of week for me:  beat a player well, then pretty much no-show.
Q. Apparently they have you scheduled for doubles in Shanghai tomorrow.  Are you going to get there in time?
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, I'm leaving at I think 8:00 tomorrow.  I'm very excited for doubles obviously.
Q. No doubt some people from the outside will look at the headlines and say, Typical Nick, he's gone off on one and lost his temper, without maybe knowing the full details why.  What do you say to those people?
NICK KYRGIOS: I don't really care.  Like, I mean, I lost a tennis match, man.  Who cares?  Like, why are we focusing on that?  Look at what happened in Vegas a couple days ago.  Really, we're going to talk about it?
