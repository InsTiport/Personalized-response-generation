 Q. Nick, how is the knee?   It looked like you popped it or hurt it during the match, third set?  
NICK KYRGIOS:   No, my body obviously is under‑ prepared.   Wasn't too bad of a match my first match back.   I was happy with the way I performed.  
Obviously I haven't had the ideal preparation, you know.   You know, that's the way it is.   Obviously my body started feeling it towards the end.  
   
 Q.   Any concerns going into the Open?   You're also playing doubles here.   
NICK KYRGIOS:   Yeah, I mean, doubles is always a last‑minute thing.   I'm obviously making the decision now whether or not it's smart to play tomorrow.  
Obviously I only can do so much before the Australian Open, I guess.   I haven't had ideal preparation, so we'll just see how it goes.  
   
 Q.   On the lack of preparation, when you look at the over all aspects, are you happy with the way you're hitting the ball?  
NICK KYRGIOS:   Yes.   I guess I can't complain too much.   I am obviously shattered that I haven't had the right preparation at all for these tournaments.   
I mean, you know, I'm just doing whatever I can to obviously get out there and compete.   Obviously I'm not at the level I would like to be at.  
   
 Q.   On the competing side, slow start but bounced back really well today.   
NICK KYRGIOS:   Yeah, the crowd obviously want ed to see a match.   That was pretty appalling is first‑set stuff.   I was sort of going through the motions obviously getting back out there.   
I decided to lift a little bit in the second and third.   Gave it my all, but obviously not having the training under my belt and obviously the match fitness, I only could do so much.  
   
 Q.   How did the back hold up?  
NICK KYRGIOS:   Yeah, it was okay, I guess.   Obviously I'm feeling it.   It's not great.   But it is what it is right now.   
   
 Q.   Last one:   Between now and the Australian Open, what are your plans?   What are your preps?   
NICK KYRGIOS:   Yeah, I mean, I'm not really too sure.   I can't tell you.   You know, obviously I'm just shattered at the moment, so I can't ‑‑ I don't really know what I'm going to do.
