3-6, 6-1, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Can you talk us through that win a little bit, please.
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah.  I hadn't beaten him before.  Going into today, I knew that I was going to do something a little different.  I was going to kind of just, you know, not give him too much rhythm.  Come in a lot, be super aggressive off my returns.  And obviously try and just serve, just serve pretty much anywhere and just play aggressive.
You know, he played a pretty solid first set.  I played a pretty loose game to get broken.  And then, pretty much from then on, I felt pretty in control of the match.
Q. You had a medical time-out in the first set of your tournament here.  Are at all surprised or relieved to be able to have your body holding up to get you into a final?
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah.  I just got a retape today.  My knee is feeling okay.  But, yes, hopefully it feels good coming into tomorrow.
Q. Is beating a player of this caliber this early in the year a confidence booster?
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, for sure.  He had a pretty good end to his year.  Yeah, it feels good.  Obviously, it's confidence for me.
But I've played a lot of the top players before and I know that I can't just -- you know, it's just another match for me.  I can't expend too much energy on one match.  I'm moving on now and just trying to get ready for tomorrow.
Q. You've played finals before and you've won finals.  Do you expect you'll be nervous before a final here tomorrow?
NICK KYRGIOS: Not really.
Q. What would it mean to win a title on home soil ahead of the Australian Open?
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, it would be really good.  I haven't won one in Australia before.  So, you know, it would pretty cool to win one here, but obviously I'm not going to lose sleep if I lose the final.
Q. Can you remember as a kid watching finals of these lead-up tournaments, Kooyong, wherever they would have been?  Do you have memories of those?
NICK KYRGIOS: I just remember one year where Rusty won his final.  That was probably the last time I watched a final here.  I mean, it would be pretty cool to have my name next to his.
Obviously, we go to Davis Cup in a couple weeks.
So, yeah, I mean, I've got pretty fond memories here, so it would be good to keep adding.
Q. Do you sort of wonder what might have been, I suppose, after Alex's fight in the semifinal?  I mean, it was very close to an Australian final.  Wondering what might have been and your thoughts on that.
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, he had a great run here.  For a little bit there I thought, you know, he was going to get to his maiden final.
And it's been really good all week to watch him play.  He's played with a lot of confidence.  And, yeah, he's only going to get better.  He's a young kid.  He's not very strong yet.  And he's absolutely rapid.  He's very quick.
So he's going to get a better serve.  He's going to have more behind his shots.  So he's going to have a really good career and it's just the beginning for him.
Q. Thoughts on playing Harrison?  You played him a couple times last couple of years.  What do you think that match will bring?
NICK KYRGIOS: He's got a great serve.  That's probably his strength, I think.  I played him a couple times now, and I definitely felt that was his best weapon.  And, you know, he's a good mover as well.
I played him on clay last year, and I don't think that was either of our best surfaces.  I played him on hard court as well.  So I know what he's going to bring, but at the same time it's going to be a tough match.
Q. You two have a bit of history.  Anything extra in that matchup?
NICK KYRGIOS: I don't think so.  Matches haven't been very close, so I don't really know why there's much history there.
