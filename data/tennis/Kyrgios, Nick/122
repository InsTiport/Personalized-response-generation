N. KYRGIOS/M. Klizan
3-6, 6-3, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. The second set, you broke and you were broken back.  What were your thoughts at that point, that time frame?
NICK KYRGIOS: I thought that both of us were playing really average today.  I thought we both struggled with the conditions.  Obviously it was really fast and the ball was flying a lot.  But for me it was, you know, completely opposite conditions to what I played last week.
So I barely hit at all here.  Hit for about half an hour today, and I wasn't feeling great.  So I'm just happy I got through.  But at the other end of the spectrum, you know, I played pretty bad today.
Q. How was it winning Marseilles and immediately you're playing here Tuesday night?
NICK KYRGIOS: Mentally I was okay with it.  You know, I was actually pretty excited to get here and play.  But obviously physically coming off the flights, it was tough.
Yeah, I'm happy I got through.  I wasn't feeling great out there.  To will myself is not a bad effort.
Q. How difficult is it to play Klizan?  He's such a hard hitter of the ball.
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, a couple weeks ago I watched him win a title.  His serve, he's tricky, a lefty.  He gives his forehand a bit of a good rip.
I know today he didn't play at all near his best.  It was probably a bit lucky for me that I made enough balls, but on his day he's a great player.
Q. Have you had any time at all to enjoy the fact you won your first title?
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah.  I guess I had a little bit of time to enjoy it.  Yeah, it was a good week.
Q. Was there any feeling when you won the title that maybe you had a weight on your shoulder to try and get that first one or didn't feel like that at all?
NICK KYRGIOS: Not at all.  As I said, I was excited to play.  But, yeah, I didn't feel great.
Q. There was a little bit of off-court incident involving one fan on Facebook.  Can you talk about that?
NICK KYRGIOS: No.
Q. Not sitting down during the changeovers, were you trying to keep your energy up?
NICK KYRGIOS: Not really.  I was just -- I wasn't really thinking that well out there.  I probably just wanted to get the game going, I guess.
Q. You have Kukushkin next.  Your thoughts on that match.
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, I think it's dangerous.  I think this surface for him is probably his best.  He likes to play on a fast surface.  Hits very flat.
I know serving is going to be key.  I need to definitely play a lot better than I played today.
Q. Obviously you're here, and you go back to Australia and Davis Cup and everything.  Are you kind of used to that whirlwind trip, or are you getting used to that lifestyle?
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, it's tough.  It's never easy traveling from one side of the world to the other in a couple days and then playing, and, you know, knowing that the Americans are going to be there early preparing.  I know it's going to be a tough tie.
Yeah, hopefully this week doesn't take too much out of myself.  I know Bernard is playing in Acapulco.  Obviously I want him to do well and me to do well this week, but I obviously want enough left in the tank to play Davis Cup.
