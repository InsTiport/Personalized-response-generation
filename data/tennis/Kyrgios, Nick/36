N. KYRGIOS/Y. Nishioka   
6-2, 7-5   
 Q.  Three straight wins; how much confidence does that build for the rest of the tournament?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, massive.  I think I played three quality opponents.  Yeah, I'm feeling good.  I haven't played that many matches in the last couple weeks, so to come out here and being able to produce a level that I've brought three days in a row, pretty special, and hopefully I can just keep it going.   
 Q.  I think you played Gombos once before in 2017.  What do you know about him and what do you expect?  
NICK KYRGIOS: He's got a good backhand.  I played him in Marseilles indoors a couple years ago, so very good competitor, good backhand, and obviously he's feeling confident.  He's played a lot of matches this week, so he knows how the conditions are, and I'm not even thinking about that at the moment.  I just need a good rest and play my game and see how it goes.   
 Q.  How is the knee doing?  I know you've been struggling with it on and off all year, but what's it like?  Is it mainly when you're serving that it's a problem?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, stepping and serving I feel it the most.  But I'm doing everything I can.  I'm icing it, and the physios are helping me keep it under control.   
 Q.  You've had pretty good crowds here, and you hear the fans shouting.  How much of that do you hear, and do you feed off the positive energy from a crowd?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, the crowd is amazing.  They hung around two days in a row now when I've played, or three days in a row when I've played the last match on each court.  They're amazing.  The atmosphere has been awesome, and obviously you see a lot of the people screaming out and they're just having a good time.  So yeah, the atmosphere has been good.   
 Q.  Stefanos actually said yesterday that you guys are on for Cincy; is that true?  Are you guys playing doubles together?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, for sure, yeah.   
 Q.  I know you said you wanted to do it, so it's a good place to do it.  
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, for sure.  I think we both maybe want to get to know each other a little bit better.  But I'm excited.  I honestly wanted to play with him in Montreal but he'd already committed to someone else, so that's fine.  But I would like to play with him as often as possible.  He's one of the best players in the world at the moment.   
 Q.  You were going to play with Tiafoe in Montreal.  I think he's pulled out now.  I don't know if you know that or not.  
NICK KYRGIOS: No, I don't know that.   
 Q.  Does that mean you go look for somebody else or are you going to just rest?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Depending on how my body pulls up the next couple days, as well.  I'm not going to be in any rush to find a partner.  But yeah, I would obviously like to play.  It's a lot of fun.  I think it's important, singles are so stressful at times, to have that kind of fun on the doubles court with someone you're pretty close to.  It's cool.   
 Q.  How fun was Yoshi tonight and how glad are you maybe to see him back healthy?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, I've grown up with him since we were about 13, 14 playing in Europe, the junior tournaments, and seeing him go through juniors, as well.  We've probably been two of the top players in our age group for a long time, and obviously that ACL injury was brutal, and to see him back on court now having wins like Goffin, it's impressive.  The way he plays, he doesn't have that many weapons, but he competes and he's super talented.  We know our games back to front.  We've played each other a lot, so it's good to see him back.
