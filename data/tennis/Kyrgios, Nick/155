M. RAONIC/N. Kyrgios
      6‑3, 7‑6, 6‑3

    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You had your chances in this match in the second set.   How did you feel on the court?   What was maybe the key in this match? 
    NICK KYRGIOS:   Yeah, Raonic, obviously he's got a big serve and you're not going to get many chances. 
    I had a number of chances in the first and second set.   I was up a break in the second set.   I wasn't serving well all day.   I thought that was one thing, that I could have served much better.   If I did that, I would have taken the second set.
    But, you know, that's how it's going to go sometimes. 

Q.   Do you think it's still a learning process at this level or a bit of tension? 
    NICK KYRGIOS:   Yeah, I was a bit nervous going out in the first set.   That's normal, I think.
    Yeah, I had numerous chances where I could have taken them and taken that second set.   Who knows?   Would have been much closer than the scoreline says. 

Q.   How comfortable were you playing on the clay?
    NICK KYRGIOS:   Yeah, I was feeling really well, really good out there.   I was moving really well.   I thought I was getting to a lot of balls I wasn't going to get to last year. 
    I played really well from the back.   There was a couple loose errors here and there, but that's the pressure he sort of gives you on your serve.
    Yeah, I was feeling comfortable out there. 

Q.   What's the biggest challenge returning his serve? 
    NICK KYRGIOS:   The fact is he's going to hit a lot of aces, and you can't really let that phase you, I guess. 
    You can sort of anticipate where he's going to serve, but that's what's got him to where he is.   Probably one the best serves going around.
    Yeah. 

Q.   What do you take away from an experience like this?   I know you did well here last year beating Stepanek.   Now that you've come back again with a bit more experience, what do you actually walk away with? 
    NICK KYRGIOS:   I'm sort of‑‑ I was creating chances against a top‑10 player, and I think that's always confidence, you're going to walk away confident.
    I didn't back up well after my first round last year.   You know, I was feeling fine physically out there, so I can take away that I've done a lot more hard work as well.
    Yeah, that's it.   Hopefully I can keep working hard and string another year together and be here next year.

Q.   How important is it to get on the court, as you haven't been able to in the last little while?
    NICK KYRGIOS:   Yeah, it's exciting to be out here playing another Grand Slam.   I got the wildcard as well.
    Gave my best efforts.   Yeah, it's just ‑‑ I sort of forget the question.

Q.   Just about the priority of having to keep your body right to play now. 
    NICK KYRGIOS:   Yeah, you know, kind of a couple niggles pulling out of Dusseldorf, but I was feeling good out there today.
    Yeah, hopefully I can just stay healthy for the rest of the year.

Q.   Is it mixed now you've got? 
    NICK KYRGIOS:   Yeah, I'm going to sign in with Belinda Bencic.

Q.   How do you feel about the grass?
    NICK KYRGIOS:   Way different surface.   I'll head to Nottingham.   Not too soon.   I'll stay around Paris.   Got a lot more Aussies playing.
    Yeah, grass, I am comfortable on grass as well.

Q.   Have you set yourself any particular goals this year in terms of ranking? 
    NICK KYRGIOS:   My goal is to get healthy and start playing again.   But, yeah, haven't really thought ranking‑wise.
    It's so hot in here. 

Q.   Is there any particular area of your game that you've set yourself that you really want to work on, something special you want to improve?
    NICK KYRGIOS:   I think just getting better, feeling stronger.   I think that's my main priority.   Being young versus the older guys, they're so much stronger and really used to all the ‑‑ you know, backing up matches day after day.   I don't think I have that quite yet. 
    But I'm always improving.   I think I'm miles better than I was.   Obviously my serve is usually my strength, but today was probably not a great serving day.
    Sometimes that's the way it goes. 

Q.   Getting off the track a little bit, tell me, what's your setup here in Paris?   Where do you stay?   Who you are with, how you prepare. 
    NICK KYRGIOS:   I have my coach here.   Yeah, my brother is here as well.   My mom.   They're staying in a separate rooms, but, yeah, I'm staying in the room by myself.
    Yeah, my whole team is at the same hotel.

Q.   Where is that? 
    NICK KYRGIOS:   Adagio Tour Eiffel.   It's okay, I guess.
