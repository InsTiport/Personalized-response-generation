7-5, 6-4, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How is the injury?
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, it was obviously bothering me a little bit.  But, you know, I'm doing everything I can for it.  I'm getting a lot of physio for it.
Obviously, yeah, I'm doing everything I can.  But my serve sort of got me out of trouble tonight.
Q. Didn't seem to affect your serving at all.
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, obviously.
Q. Are these conditions tailored to your liking?
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah.  Guys with big games, guys that obviously can serve well, I think these courts favor them a lot.  I feel comfortable playing here.  I think I'm returning really good on these courts.  I've always felt comfortable coming here.
Q. With your injury, happy to be on and off court quickly?
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, just under two hours.  Still relatively decent match.
Yeah, I'm happy.  It could have gone on a lot longer.  I'm happy I got off quickly.
Q. I think Marchenko is up two sets to love.  What do you know about his game?
NICK KYRGIOS: Pretty solid.  Pretty solid competitor.  Always takes pride in his work ethic.  Loves to stay back and grind.
It's not over.  Dzumi can play good tennis and can definitely fight back and win that match.  I know them both pretty well on the court.  They're both tough players.
