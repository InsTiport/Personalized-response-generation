J. CHARDY/N. Kyrgios   
6-7, 6-2, 6-3   
 Q.  Nick, what can you take out of that match?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Jeremy is playing well.  He served really well today.  Again, I didn't do much else apart from serve.  Yeah, I just -- honestly, I'm not really expecting too much.  I've played more tennis in the last two days than I have the entire off season.  So, you know, it's okay.  I mean, obviously my focus shifts now to Australian Open, but I'm just glad to have a couple days now just to chill out, get my body recovered and just go again, I guess.   
 Q.  What do you have to do to get all facets of your game working and going and up to speed before the Slam?  
NICK KYRGIOS: I don't know.  Just a bit of practice here and there, I guess.   
 Q.  Any concerns?  Obviously you had that interrupted preparation.  Any concerns heading into the Grand Slam?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Not at all.  I got plenty of time now.  I got the Fast4 in Sydney, and I got plenty of time.  I'm not too concerned, but again, I know that I probably have to go and hit some balls and practice.   
 Q.  Where do you think it kind of fell down for you today?  Was it that break in the second set?  
NICK KYRGIOS: I think I just fell down for me in the off season when I didn't really hit much.  It's tough to come back and play this level of tennis not really hitting and getting my iron from the back of the court at all.  Every time I have a rally it feels foreign, and I don't really know what I'm doing.  But, yeah, I'm serving well.  That's a positive.  And to go three sets with a guy, Jeremy, barely practicing in the off season, I take as a positive.  So now I gotta get to the practice court, hit a lot of balls and move into the Australian Open.  That's what I gotta do.   
 Q.  Do you wish you'd done the preseason differently?  
NICK KYRGIOS: No.  I had an unbelievable preseason.  I loved every bit of it being home.  And being away from the sport.  I loved it.   
 Q.  Looking at the rankings, looks like you might be out of the Top 50 for the first time in a couple of years.  Is the seeding at the Australian Open a concern?  
NICK KYRGIOS: I honestly could not care less.   
 Q.  I suppose you sort of describe yourself as a dangerous floater it were?  
NICK KYRGIOS: I guess so, yeah.  I feel like no matter who I play, I've got a fair shot if I play the right style of tennis and I'm feeling good.  But at this age I'm not even thinking about it.  I'm just going to go do everything I usually do, just go practice and when the time comes, I'll play a match.  No matter who I draw, I'll play and that's just what it is.   
 Q.  After Fast4, will you go straight to Melbourne after that or will you go home or what will you do, do you know?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, I'll go Fast4 and I'll probably go to Melbourne and go do a lot of stuff the week before obviously, sponsors and all that stuff.  Yeah, I'll go to Melbourne as soon as possible after Fast4.
