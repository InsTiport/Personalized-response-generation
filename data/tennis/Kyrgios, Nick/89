P. HERBERT/N. Kyrgios
6-3, 6-4 (ret.)
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What were your feelings physically going into the match?  What might have changed during it?
NICK KYRGIOS: I mean, I kind of knew I was in trouble.  I have been feeling my hip ever since I fell over at Queen's.  Never got it right.  I was doing everything I could to help it, but just not enough time.
Yeah, I mean, I just wasn't 100%.  You know, nothing take away from him.  He plays great grass court tennis.  He serves well.  So he's going to do well.
Q. What caused you to retire at that moment?
NICK KYRGIOS: My hip.
Q. How different was it from the beginning of the match?
NICK KYRGIOS: It wasn't different.  I thought I could win.  Obviously probably not against him, but some opponents if I played them today, I probably still could have won.
Yeah, I mean, obviously I could feel it a lot.  It was hindering my performance a lot.
Q. What are doctors telling you about this?  Is this something you're going to maybe have to address and do something about?
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, probably.  I spoke to the doctor before the tournament started.  He was leaning towards me not even playing.  It's my favorite tournament.  I do well here every year.  So it's tough for me to go out there and get beaten and pull out.  It's not the easiest thing for me to do.
But yeah, I mean, I had it after French Open.  I did the right things.  I took 10 days off, got an injection, rehabbed, it was fine.  I fell over at Queen's.  I can hardly do anything about it, you know.
Q. Is surgery an option?
NICK KYRGIOS: Probably not at the moment.  I got too much stuff going on.
Q. At what point does surgery become an option?
NICK KYRGIOS: I don't know.  I'm not an doctor.  I don't know.
Q. Would you like to come back here in 12 months' time and be 100% fit?
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, I would love to.  I was in such a good place for one set at Queen's.  I was really enjoying myself.  I was healthy.  And then, you know, it was like I had a taste of it, then that was it.
Q. What do you do now?  Do you hang around?  Go down the Dog and Duck?
NICK KYRGIOS: Probably not.  Probably get an MRI tomorrow.  Hopefully get an injection or something, do rehab, and get healthy, I guess.  I can't really do anything.  You know, it's just a bit unlucky what happened.  I mean, yeah, there's worse things in the world.
Q. How much is it affecting your practice?  You know what the problem is?
NICK KYRGIOS: Yes.
Q. It's tapering your preparation?
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, of course.  Yeah, I mean, my preparation wasn't great.  I was playing practice sets.  I knew I was hurting.  Then I played a couple practice matches at Boodles.  I wasn't going very hard.  My opponents were sort of just having a bit of fun.  I knew I was going to struggle.
I always had to keep my practices controlled.  I wasn't moving much.  I hit yesterday for half an hour with my mate.  I mean, my preparation wasn't ideal.  I mean, can't do anything about it now.
Q. You were quite upbeat after your first match at Boodles.  You felt good?  Is that the best you felt for a bit?
NICK KYRGIOS: I didn't feel good at all.  I don't think I can feel too good after an exhibition at Boodles.  Yeah, I don't think Phillip was going 100%.
Q. You say you don't think surgery is an option.  Is it just that you really don't want to go down that route if you can avoid it?
NICK KYRGIOS: Of course, I don't think anyone wants to go down the surgery route.  I had it right after Paris.  I wasn't feeling it at all.  When I initially got on the grass, I wasn't feeling my hip at all.
As I said, the first set when I played against Donald Young, it was fine.  I couldn't feel anything.  I was playing great.  I was feeling good.  Then it just all got taken away pretty quickly.
Q. You mentioned the hip injury.  How tough is it to recover from that hip injury?  Obviously your game relies so much on movement.  Is it something you can recover and go seven games to win the title?
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, I don't think it's career ending or anything like that.
Q. In terms of the game, how it affected your game.  Do you think it will affect Andy's chances going forward as well?
NICK KYRGIOS: It will maybe affect his chances this week.  After this, I'm sure he'll take the necessary time to get it right, then he'll be fine.
Just like me, I just didn't have enough time to get it better.  Simple as that.  Just didn't have enough time.
Q. You practiced a bit with Kokkinakis.  How do you rate his chances against del Potro?
NICK KYRGIOS: I think Kok is playing really well.  He's got a great game.  He's healthy at least.  I think anything can happen.  DelPo is playing great.  We'll see.  I think that's one of the toughest first rounds.  I think Kokkinakis can definitely win, though.
Q. Bernie had his problems.  Has he talked to you about what he went through?
NICK KYRGIOS: I don't know if I listen to Bernie too much.
Q. Providing you do get fit, what is your planned schedule if you're okay?
NICK KYRGIOS: Atlanta, Washington, all that.  I'd like to play those tournaments.  I love playing in the States, so...
Q. Nobody likes to go through surgery, as you said.  Some people are more afraid of going through surgery.  Some people really hate the idea.  Are you one of those in a way?  You would do everything possible to avoid it forever?
NICK KYRGIOS: I would do everything possible to avoid it.  But I don't know.  Yeah, I mean, obviously -- I'm obviously a little bit scared, obviously.  But I don't think I need it at the moment.
