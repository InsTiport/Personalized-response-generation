  F. GONZÃLEZ/R. Bloomfield  
7-6, 6-3  
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions.   
  
  Q. Looked really good in the first set. Ahead in the tiebreak. What happened?  
 RICHARD BLOOMFIELD: I think I went 4-1 up. He hit two aces. I think I maybe played two kind of silly shots, maybe one dropshot shot, which at this level you can't get away with. Should have just put it down the line, came in, see if he could pass me. No, I hit a silly dropshot there.   
 I think when he had set point, he kind of hit a big forehand, but he shanked hit, so it was tough to judge, and it just went wide.   
  
  Q. You have a really big serve. GonzÃ¡lez was talking your serve up after the match. What do you think you have to do to play those kind of matches against guys like him more and also get the results?  
 RICHARD BLOOMFIELD: I think it's pretty simple: I think you just got to try to qualify more and just try to play those guys more often, maybe get a chance to practice with a top-10 guy like that again.   
 But, you know, it's pretty tough. I think that's about it really.
