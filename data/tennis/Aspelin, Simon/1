  Q. Another ATP World Tour title, particularly coming into a 500 tournament in Dubai. You must be very happy?  
 SIMON ASPELIN: Yeah, I'm extremely happy. I think Paul and I, we have started the year good, we've been playing well, and playing with a lot of confidence right now. And in a big tournament like this here in Dubai, it's great to win.   
  
  Q. Just talk about the experience this week. How important has it been for you to get through the final and win, and how much confidence does that give you for the season?   
 SIMON ASPELIN: Well, I think it helps us a lot. I think we've been playing really well the last few weeks, and I think yesterday especially we played a good match, and we had a lot of match points. And then Lopez and Robredo came back, and it was a really nice feeling to get through the semifinal.   
 And I think we came into the final today pretty relaxed. And, yeah, I thought -- I didn't think it was going to be this easy of a match. But they struggled a little bit. But it's a huge confidence boost for the rest of this spring here.
