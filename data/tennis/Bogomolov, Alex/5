  6-2, 6-4, 6-3

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. It must have been one of the more difficult situations to sleep on that particular score. I just wondered how hard it was and how you come back out again to that situation. 
 ALEX BOGOMOLOV: Yeah, it wasn't easy. It wasn't like a tough night where you're thinking what are you going to do tomorrow. I think it was sort of -- for me I didn't want to come out just because he was outplaying me. He was serving big. 
 You know, today I just wanted to come out and maybe take some chances, but he didn't even give me an opportunity. He got to the finals last year for a reason: He's playing really well on grass and hitting some incredible shots on the run. They're flat, they stay very low to the ground, and you can't really play offense against him.
 If you're playing defense the whole time, it's sort of very frustrating. 

 Q. Did you sleep last night? Seems without saying so, seemed like the result was almost predetermined. So in a way, is that more relaxing?
 ALEX BOGOMOLOV: Yeah, it was just as relaxing as it can get. Nobody at the house spoke about the match. Everybody was just saying, Go out there and see what happens. There was no desperation, nothing like that. Just an easy night. 

 Q. You were one of the last two Americans. Now there's just one. Is that a little bit sad, too, in this? 
 ALEX BOGOMOLOV: Of course. Um, I think for me it was a great tournament, and, you know, Mardy is still playing well. I think he can go well because he has a great game for grass.
 Sad to see no more Americans, but I think Ryan Harrison did a good job out here as well. Now we're just going to get -- personally I'm going to get ready for the hard court season, which is my favorite.
