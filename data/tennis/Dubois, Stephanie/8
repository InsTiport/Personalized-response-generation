 THE MODERATOR: Questions.   
  
  Q. Going into this match, you've beaten her twice, did that give you confidence going into the match?  
 STEPHANIE DUBOIS: Yeah, I even before the match, I was confident. I knew how she was playing. And I had a tactic in my head, the way that I want to play. And I did, so I'm happy the way that I played today.   
  
  Q. Were you a little concerned at the beginning when you had trouble holding your serve?  
 STEPHANIE DUBOIS: I did (laughter)? Oh, yeah, maybe she broke me once or twice.   
  
  Q. I don't think she broke you, but had breakpoints in the first game.   
 STEPHANIE DUBOIS: Yeah, and I came back I think in one of them. Yeah, it was a good start of the match to get a good balance or energy for the rest of the match. So it was important, and I did it, so I'm happy.   
  
  Q. Take us through the rain delay, how that had an impact on your preparation, if at all.   
 STEPHANIE DUBOIS: Yeah, I was so ready to play, really focused. I wanted to play and I was ready because I feel good. I was just positive. I was focused, concentration. I was with my coaches.   
 I was feeling good for tonight, ready to play, too.   
  
  Q. Did the rain delay bother you at all, all that waiting?   
 STEPHANIE DUBOIS: Well, I know that the match before me, they stopped 10 times. I didn't. So I was thinking in my head, Whether I'm going to go, I'm going to play at all. Even if it was at 1:00 or whatever, I would have be there ready to play.   
  
  Q. There was a report there's a virus going around. Has this had an impact on you at all?  
 STEPHANIE DUBOIS: No, I haven't heard of it. I don't know. I feel good, yeah.
