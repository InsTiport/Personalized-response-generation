THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   I was just wondering if you could speak a little bit about what it's like to play in front of a hometown crowd at Rogers Cup, whether in Toronto this year or Montreal.   
STEPHANIE DUBOIS:   Well, I think it's my ninth time in the main draw at Rogers Cup.   It's always nice.   Very proud to play here in front of my family and friends and my country.  
Yeah, they were supportive today on the courts, and it's always a nice feeling to play at home.   It's nicer when you win, for sure.  
   
 Q.   Obviously not the result you wanted, but do you take any solace from the fact that the person who beat you is Canadian?  
STEPHANIE DUBOIS:   Well, yeah, when people ask me how did I react when I play a Canadian, I'm like, Well, there is one going to be in the second round.   Obviously I wanted to be that person, but it didn't happen today.   
You know, it's another match, another player.   Even if she's from my country, I want to win.  
But, hey, she managed to play well.  
   
 Q.   That being said, do you support her?   I mean, she had very good, nice words to say about you.   Do you have a very close relationship with her?  
STEPHANIE DUBOIS:   Well, we have been in the Fed Cup team for a couple of years, and yes, she's been doing very well lately.   She's been working hard I think on her tennis, so yeah, she improved a lot.   That's for sure.
