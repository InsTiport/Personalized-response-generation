MIKI SINGH: First question for Andrew. 


Q.  Tight match for you today.  At times you really had the swing in your favor. 

ANDREW ILIE:  Yeah.  I played all right today.  You know, I started off a bit slow.  I lost my serve first up.  It was a bit difficult to come back from that.  I started returning quite well from the third service game, his service game.  I played all right.  I was a little bit unlucky at times.  Very close calls on the far side, which I thought were very questionable.  Important times, as well.  You know, some days that's the way it goes.  I won a lot of close matches lately.  Sometimes you just lose them, that's all. 


Q.  It was a little frustrating at times, you play with a lot of power, topspin, and sometimes he would backspin the back to you, is that frustrating?

ANDREW ILIE:  Not really.  On average, I play quite well today.  I could have taken a couple more chances.  You know, as I said, you win some, you lose some.  Today was very close.  He played quite well.


Q.  How do you like Miami?

ANDREW ILIE:  It's very nice.  Nice weather.  I was hoping to do a little bit better today, maybe push him a bit further.  Hopefully next year Miami will look better.


Q.  Backhand let you down in that crucial game?

ANDREW ILIE: Wasn't really a letdown.  It was more like a little bit unlucky.  It stopped on the tape.  Had set point, chipped it.  Just stopped there.  It's difficult to say.  Didn't really let me down, no.


Q.  You had a tough call in the last game. 

ANDREW ILIE:  There were like three calls around the same area of the baseline.  Very questionable.  The umpire didn't want to do anything about that.  Lines person was sleeping.  There's lots of room in between that.
