THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Maria, please.  
 
 
Q.  After the first week of The Open this year, can you assess how you're playing relative to your expectations?
 
MARIA SHARAPOVA:  Yeah, I think I started off really well from the first match.  I was really ready.  It was a bit unexpected because I didn't play a lot of matches coming into the tournament, so I thought I would be a little rusty at the beginning.  Surprised myself in the first round, that's for sure.  Played a tough opponent.  That gave me more confidence.  Playing good.  
 
Q.  With a score of 6-2, 6-1, but how do you rate Sania?
 
MARIA SHARAPOVA:  I think she's definitely great for the sport.  You know, tennis is a very global sport.  It's amazing how we have, you know, such great athletes.  She's very young, has a great future ahead of her.  Very big game.  But of course with time, I think she needs experience, you know, she'll learn.  
 
Q.  Was it strange for you to hear so many fans not rooting for you? 
 
MARIA SHARAPOVA:  No.  I think New York is known for being huge sport fans, and they love an underdog.  I totally understand.  That's what makes it more exciting out there.
