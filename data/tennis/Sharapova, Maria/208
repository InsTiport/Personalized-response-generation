THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   When you won, you celebrated like this was a huge match.   Serena will try to play twice today.   You all had incredible success as a professional.   What is it about this event, even though there's no prize money at stake, you're still playing with such passion and energy?  
MARIA SHARAPOVA:   I don't know, it's just, yeah, I feel although we play for our country and we represent it on a daily basis, I think that at the Olympics, there's so much more pride.   You're doing it for the country.   I mean, especially in Russia, it's such a huge part of our culture.   
I grew up where it was all about watching the Olympics, the opening ceremony, just being so happy.   It really just brought the nation together.   
As athletes, that was just one of our goals, is make it there, compete there, not just be there, but try to win a medal, try to win the gold.   It's just that passion we have playing for our countries.   
   
 Q.   Obviously we don't know who you're going to be playing in the final.   Please talk about playing Serena and Azarenka.   
MARIA SHARAPOVA:   Either way it's going to be a tough final.   I've had my fair share of difficult matches against both of them.   
You know, it doesn't really matter.   Whoever it is, is also going to be fighting for a great opportunity to win gold.   This is a chance once in four years.   
It doesn't really matter who's across the net.   I'll be going, fighting, trying to win that match.
