M. SHARAPOVA/E. Bouchard
  6‑2, 6‑0

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Actually what I wanted to ask you was the delays, the blackout, the rain. 
MARIA SHARAPOVA:   Yeah.

Q.   How did that affect you?   What did you do?   Play Ping‑Pong or what in between?
MARIA SHARAPOVA:   No, I was just trying to find a quiet corner where I could just rest and just wait it out, I guess.
You know, I have been on the tour for many years and I have been part of a few delays.   Maybe not a power outage, but you treat it as maybe a rain delay and you go in, and as soon as you have to get out and just be ready, do a quick warmup, and be ready for the match.

Q.   Was the blackout a surprise?
MARIA SHARAPOVA:   Of course it was.   It was a bigger surprise that it was on all around the outer courts as well, not just the stadium.
