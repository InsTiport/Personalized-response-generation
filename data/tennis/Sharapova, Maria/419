THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Maria, please. 


Q.You've reached the fourth round two years in a row.  It seems like last year the loss to Serena went rather easily.  But so much has changed in a year.  How do you feel from now until then? 

MARIA SHARAPOVA:  Well, I feel like I'm a much more experienced player than I was a year ago.  Getting to the fourth round seems a little more normal than it did last year.  Mostly I don't have to play a higher seed than me.  It's a little bit easier going into a fourth round than it was last year having to play Serena, which was the highest seed.  You know, I'm definitely playing a lot better than I was, and I feel more confident just because of the experience I've gotten.


Q.When you see Justine in the same quarter of the draw, does that make you feel anxious to play her?  Have you played her yet?

MARIA SHARAPOVA:  No, I don't remember playing her, no.  But, you know, every match I'm expecting a tough one.  You know, right now I'm just worried about my next one. 


Q.Is it odd having these press conferences where nobody asks questions? 

MARIA SHARAPOVA:  No, actually, it's really good.  It's very convenient (smiling). 


Q.Were you ever a ball girl? 

MARIA SHARAPOVA:  No, no.
