D. GAVRILOVA/M. Sharapova
  7‑6, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Just in general, are you as surprised as you all the fans are of what happened out there?   What did you know about her coming in?   What do you think about tonight?
MARIA SHARAPOVA:   Well, it's sport, and I happened to lose the match.   Of course it's a bit of a surprise.   It's the first round.   I'm expected to win.
But I think that's, you know, one of the reasons why we play the matches, is you still have to go out and win it no matter if you're the favorite.
Today I didn't. 

Q.   Both sets you came back and had chances.   What was the difference in her game that you... 
MARIA SHARAPOVA:   Yeah, I mean, I had little times where I did come back, but I was always behind.   I put myself in a situation that was too far behind to come back from.

Q.   Little more disappointing that this loss happened the first round?
MARIA SHARAPOVA:   I mean, I think any loss is always disappointing. 
Yeah.

Q.   What do you do to kind of bounce back from an early loss like this?
MARIA SHARAPOVA:   Well, you just give yourself the right amount of rest and recovery and get ready, you know, for the next tournament.

Q.   What did she do really well in your mind?   What was her strength?
MARIA SHARAPOVA:   She runs a lot of balls down.   You know, I was committing a lot of errors off of those balls and not really staying patient and just going for, you know, too many maybe winners, not moving forward enough.

Q.   How much does the missed overhead in the tiebreaker stand out in your mind ‑‑or the swinging volley, I guess? 
MARIA SHARAPOVA:   Yeah, I think that would have of course leveled it in the tiebreaker.   Of course those are really important moments, and sometimes mistakes like that give yourself a bit more confidence in a heated moment like that. 
Yeah, I would have loved to get that one back.

Q.   Did it affect you that the crowd was so against you?   Seemed like the crowd was really cheering her on throughout the whole match. 
MARIA SHARAPOVA:   When people cheer for an opponent, I don't necessarily think that they are cheering against you. 
So I don't know if you phrased it correctly. 

Q.   Sorry. 
MARIA SHARAPOVA:   That's okay.   No worry.

Q.   Just sort of cheering for an upset?   They like underdogs?
MARIA SHARAPOVA:   Oh, of course.   That's absolutely expected.   And someone that's also playing really well, I mean, I think that always gets the crowd going.

Q.   Losing is never fun, but is it kind of a little bit I guess better to see it's a fellow countrywoman of yours to get the win and move on?
MARIA SHARAPOVA:   Yeah, I really don't think about it like that.   A loss is a loss no matter who it is.

Q.   Have you seen her play before?   Did you know much about her?
MARIA SHARAPOVA:   Not much actually, no. 

Q.   What's next for you?
MARIA SHARAPOVA:   Fed Cup.
