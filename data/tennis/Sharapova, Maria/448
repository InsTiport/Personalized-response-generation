THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Maria. 


Q.  How do you think you went today? 

MARIA SHARAPOVA:  Yeah, I think -- I don't know.  I think maybe lacking a little bit of experience, you know, in those kind of matches.  Not just experience, you know, but I feel that I'm still, you know, sort of like missing something.  You know, I think it's just going to take just time, you know, just to get me ready.  You know, definitely I had so many chances in the third set.  You know, second set I just basically blew her away.  In the third set, you know, made some stupid unforced errors, you know, when I didn't really need to.  But, you know, those kind of things, you know, I think will just take experience, just things here and there.

Q.  How do you find the age eligibility rule, that you're not allowed to play as much?  Do you think that was a factor?

MARIA SHARAPOVA:  That was a factor because I lost? 

Q.  Not being able to play as many tournaments. 

MARIA SHARAPOVA:  That's because I lost? 

Q.  Do you think that was a factor?

MARIA SHARAPOVA:  No.  I was playing a tournament.  I don't understand. 

Q.  Because you haven't been playing as many tournaments. 

MARIA SHARAPOVA:  That's why I lost, because I was actually playing a tournament? 

Q.  If you're lacking experience. 

MARIA SHARAPOVA:  Oh, no, no, no.  I mean, it's just experience because I am only 16 years old, you know.  I've only played -- my last year is my only full year on the tour.  I mean, I know the players and I know this.  But, you know, it's not easy in your second year just to go and to know everything.  You know, it takes a lot of time.  And I know that.  I'm just going to be very patient. 

Q.  Do you have any specific goals for this year?

MARIA SHARAPOVA:  No.  I just -- no, I don't have any goals.  I don't want to push myself to somewhere, you know, wherever I have to be.  I know if, you know, I work hard, if I keep my head cool, I think I'll be ready.  You know, I just need some time.  I don't want to really set any goals for myself.
