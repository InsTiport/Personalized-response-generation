      6‑2, 6‑2 
  
    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
   
 Q.   How do you feel about your match as a whole?  
    MARIA SHARAPOVA:   Well, I never faced my opponent before.   I think she's had really good, steady success.   She's quite young.   Sort of up‑and‑comer.   But playing really well.   Has had some big results this year against top players.   
    Although I haven't played against her, I've seen a little bit of her game.   Just tried to pick up a few things from the beginning.   
    But I thought I had a really good start, which is important.   A few long games.   I think maybe the scoreline was a bit easier than the match showed.   
   
 Q.   After your flight from Wuhan to Beijing, you posted a picture on Twitter and the Chinese social media site Weibo.   Do you have any idea how popular it is in China because someone sitting in front of you was actually in the newspaper covering the match you played in Wuhan?  
    MARIA SHARAPOVA:   The person in front of me?   
   
 Q.   Sitting in front of you on the plane actually watching the news coverage from your match.   
    MARIA SHARAPOVA:   Right.   
   
 Q.   That tweet was popular in China.   It got retweeted over 20,000 times.   Do you want to say anything about it?  
    MARIA SHARAPOVA:   Well, that wasn't really my intention.   I thought it was quite a funny moment because it's happened before to me where I've been on the plane and someone has been reading an article in the sports section.   You see a picture of yourself.   Sometimes you just kind of want to like hide because you don't know if they are aware you're right next to them or behind them.   
    Yeah, just kind of put my phone up and took a picture.   Actually turned out you could see me in the paper and the person reading it.   
    I thought it was quite funny, but I didn't know it would become so popular.  
   
 Q.   Did you talk to him personally?  
    MARIA SHARAPOVA:   No, I didn't.   
   
 Q.   That would be another amazing story.   
    MARIA SHARAPOVA:   I'm a bit shy, so I don't...   
   
 Q.   As you look forward in the tournament, you have a chance you're going to face Navarro who beat you in MontrÃ©al.   What sort of critiques to you game have you made since then?  
    MARIA SHARAPOVA:   That match is still to be played so I don't know who I'll face.   
    Either way it's a good opportunity for me.   I think either against Flavia, who has had a good, solid year, or Navarro, who I lost to just a couple of months ago.   It will be great to hopefully change some things around.   
    But happy with the way I've started the tournament.   Hopefully I'll continue that in the next match, whoever I play.
