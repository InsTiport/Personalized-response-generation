  THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please.   
   
 Q.   Since losing in Rome, what have you done?   More training?   More fitness work?   Or just recovering?  
    MARIA SHARAPOVA:   Just a balance of everything, recovery and training, and, yeah, spending a few days on the courts here.   Pretty basic.  
   
 Q.   How did you find the court?   Because Rafa said the court was maybe different than last year.   
    MARIA SHARAPOVA:   He probably knows best, so I don't think you should ask me (Laughter.)  
    Yeah, I played on it a couple times.   I played on Suzanne Lenglen, as well.   I think the courts settle down once you play on them.   I was the first one to hit on Philippe Chatrier, so it's quite different now than it was a few days ago.   
    It looks red to me, so it should be okay.   
   
 Q.   Are you somebody who is a tunnel vision woman, don't look at the draw, or do you take a look and see how things might unfold?  
    MARIA SHARAPOVA:   I look at the whole draw.   You know, I don't look at certain matchups, I don't look too far ahead, but I'm not scared to see like who I would play, you know, later down the line or things like that.  
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts on who you might play later down the line?   You're in the same quarter as Serena.   
    MARIA SHARAPOVA:   My coach just told me a little bit about the draw.   I haven't seen it physically yet.   I just got off the court.   
   
 Q.   What is the first thing that you do when you get to Paris, typically?  
    MARIA SHARAPOVA:   I eat some macarons (Laughter.)  
    Q.Do you have a favorite macaron shop?  
    MARIA SHARAPOVA:   I do.   Beside La DurÃ©e, there are a couple others I like to go to.   
    But, yeah, just eat.   Eat some more.   I mean, there are so many things to do.   I really can't name one thing to do in Paris.   
   
 Q.   There has been a little bit of talk about how maybe, you know, the early exit in Rome was kind of a blessing in disguise for you to get here, settle down, recuperate.   Do you feel you're feeling maybe more settled before this tournament starts than maybe otherwise?  
    MARIA SHARAPOVA:   I think time will ultimately tell.   In a way, I think it gave me a few extra days maybe to rest instead of trying to hurry up and come here, and, you know, trying to get on the courts as soon you can and get as many hours on the big courts as you might get before everybody else comes.   
    So in a way it's been great to have that.   Of course I would have loved to have done well in Rome, as well.   I had great preparation.   I had two great tournaments and had really tough matches, easier matches.   I think a lot has been thrown at me in the last few weeks in all the matches I have played, and I think that's great for, you know, coming into a big tournament like this.   
   
 Q.   You won this tournament already; you won all the slams; you have been No. 1 already; maybe you are making a lot of money already.   I was wondering, what makes you still so motivated?   What is the biggest goal for you at this point?  
    MARIA SHARAPOVA:   I want to achieve more and I want to win more Grand Slams and I want to get back to No. 1.   I think when you have that feeling of being there before and holding those trophies, they are so memorable and you work‑‑ spend so many hours training to have‑‑ to feel that excitement, to feel that energy, that adrenaline for those moments of match point victories.  
    And that's why I play, because that's what I've known for my whole life.   And my body still allows me to do that.   I have done it since I was a very young girl.   I love the thrill of it.   I don't think there is anything else that would give me that much satisfaction in what I do.
