  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How are you feeling to begin this tournament?   What are your expectation here?   
MARIA SHARAPOVA:   After a good week in Stuttgart, I obviously would love to continue that form and play with the level I played last week.   
Last year was a great tournament for me getting to the final and the year before in the semi, so I really hope that I can take it a step further this year.   
   
 Q.   How do you feel about your season?   
MARIA SHARAPOVA:   Yeah, it was tough missing the last part of last year's season.   I'm finding myself regaining the form in the last few weeks, in Miami and last week.   
It's always challenging coming back from an injury.   It's something that you have to work on extremely hard.  
But, yeah, it was great to win a title again, and I hope that I can continue that level looking forward.   
   
 Q.   You have been already practicing.   How have you found the courts this year?  
MARIA SHARAPOVA:   Yeah, the courts are good.   I think they need a little bit more playing on, but they feel really good.
