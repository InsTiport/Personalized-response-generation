R. FEDERER/T. Robredo
  7-5, 6-2, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. You started very well in the first set. What was working for you early on? 
 TOMMY ROBREDO: Well, I think at the beginning was working that the match was close, and both of us had chances. When we got to the 5-All, he just broke me and then he start playing very aggressive and very easy for him everything. 
 So he was playing so good. When he plays like this, it's tough.

 Q. Did you change the way you played in the second, try to be more aggressive, or was it him stepping up?
 TOMMY ROBREDO: Well, a little bit both. When he saw that he was up a set, he start hitting harder and with confidence. Then it's tough to handle it. 
 So then you have to try to hit harder sometimes. Then the match goes so easy for him. 

 Q. What did you say at 5-1 when there was a challenge?
 TOMMY ROBREDO: I don't know. He was laughing at that. Maybe it's too easy for him, the tennis, so he can even laugh.
