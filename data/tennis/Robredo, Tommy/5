      6‑0, 6‑2, 6‑2

    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How good was that Rafa that was out there tonight?   Is that the best you have seen him play or at least against you?
    TOMMY ROBREDO:   Well, you have to ask him.   I don't know the way he felt, but obviously I felt that he was doing pretty good out there.   Not much to say.   At the beginning, it was a little different for me.   I started a little bit tight, and he was up very quick.
    Then it was nothing else to do.   He was too good.

Q.   You looked very tight and tense at the beginning.   Was there any reason for that?
    TOMMY ROBREDO:   Well, always is not easy.   I'm not used to play a quarterfinal like this.   But I felt that the court was a little bit different than the others, and it's a little tough to get used to this at the beginning.
    But anyway, it's nothing to say.   He was hitting the ball all the time very good, and I wasn't able to get into the rhythm that I wanted to start a little bit close in the score, and then we'll see if I could play my best.
    But very soon he was up a break and he was hitting very, very fast and with a lot of confidence.
    I don't know.   Sometimes there is nothing to say.   It's just congratulate the other, and hopefully next time we will have a chance.

Q.   If he continues to play at this level, can you see him being beaten here?
    TOMMY ROBREDO:   I don't know.   Is going to be tough for the others, but who knows?   The others play different than me.   Maybe my game, he likes it better than some other games or he like it worse, I don't know.
    But today he was very good, so nothing to say.
