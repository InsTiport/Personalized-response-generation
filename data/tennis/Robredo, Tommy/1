  S. WAWRINKA/T. Robredo  7-5, 4-6, 7-6, 6-2   THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   Q.  You have beaten him consistently.  Now you lost twice in important matches.  What is difference?  Did he change, or...  TOMMY ROBREDO: Well, in the sport, anything can happen.  Always depends the way you arrive, the way you are playing. In Australia I arrive dead and he arrive with only one-and-a-half matches in fourth round.  I was very, very tired and he was playing amazing and he deserve it. Today I arrive a little bit tired, as well, but I think I did a pretty good match.  I don't know.  I think that today the key point was the third set.  I had a lot more chances than him and he got it. After that, it was very tough for me to keep fighting till the end, because I was really, really tired.  Anyway, I think I did a great tournament, a great match. I'm leaving thinking that I left a good opportunity for a couple of points maybe.   Q.  What happened between you two on court there?  TOMMY ROBREDO: Nothing.   Q.  Seemed like in he said something to you and you said something back.  TOMMY ROBREDO: No, it's something that can happen in a match.  I think he did something not nicely, and I just told him if he had a problem today.  But that's it, nothing to talk about.   Q.  Waving his racquet?  TOMMY ROBREDO: No, no, nothing.
