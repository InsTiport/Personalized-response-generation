Q.  What happened to you today?  Did you feel bad on the court? 

TOMMY ROBREDO:  Well, I've been playing well the last week.  He was playing at a high level.  He was leading 3-1.  He hit a lot of aces.  He has a very solid game.  I wasn't very good with my first serve.  The match got complicated for me. 

Q.  Do you think you can learn a lesson from this defeat?

TOMMY ROBREDO:  Yes, you can learn always everything from a match.  I played with him six months ago.  He beat me.  You can learn from him because he has a clear game.  He makes you run a lot.  He makes you feel tired.

Q.  For Moya tomorrow with Novak?

TOMMY ROBREDO:  I think he has to try to move him a lot.  If you play quickly, he's comfortable.  But I think that Carlos has a very good first serve, and with his first serve he can play more comfortably because he makes the opponent run a lot.  It could be a difficult match for Carlos, though.

Q.  What do you think of your season this year?

TOMMY ROBREDO:  It's positive.  First playing indoors and beating Mirnyi, it's a good record.  I would have loved to have played better with Novak.  I think you have to learn from every match.  I've been playing a lot of matches.  It is good for my future.  I hope to gain a lot of experience, gain a position in a year or so.

Q.  What are your plans from now?

TOMMY ROBREDO:  Tomorrow I'm going to Barcelona.  I'm going to Stockholm on Saturday.  It's the second to the last tournament of the year.  Then we go to Paris, Masters Series of Paris.  The season will be over.  I'll take some holidays, then back to the season.
