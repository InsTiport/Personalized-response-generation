MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  I asked Todd if you were a typical Spanish player.  He said you could play on the baseline, behind the baseline. 

TOMMMY ROBREDO:  I play the baseline. 

Q.  He said you can play behind the baseline or on the baseline, returned a lot of his balls, made it very uncomfortable for him.  Do you think you're a typical Spanish player?

TOMMMY ROBREDO:  Well, I don't know.  I think that I'm a Spanish player, but also I can play hard court because I like to play inside the court.  Well, today I play good tennis.  When I must stay back, I stay out back on the baseline.  When I could go inside, I'm going, and I won the point.  I make a good match.  Maybe he has a little problem on his knee.  For me, it's a great victory.
