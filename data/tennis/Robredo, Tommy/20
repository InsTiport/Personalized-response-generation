  A. RODDICK/T. Robredo  
6-3, 4-6, 7-6  
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. What happened in the third set tiebreaker? How do you think the match went?  
 TOMMY ROBREDO: I don't know. I think nothing strange. We just played a tiebreak. He make me a small mini break, and then he hold it until the end.   
 So I think it was a tough tiebreaker, and at the end and he could get it and win the merchandise.  
  
  Q. Do you feel like the faster clay here has anything to do his success and the other successes of the attacking players this year?  
 TOMMY ROBREDO: Yeah. Obviously the court is so fast. I think there is part of the court that's clay and parts there's not much clay and the ball bounces different in one part than in another.   
 Obviously it help him a lot. But anyway, Andy is a good player, so it's always tough to beat him.
