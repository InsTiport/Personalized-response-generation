R. FEDERER/T. Robredo
  6-3, 3-6, 6-2, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. After a pretty good performance today, do you feel like your bridging the gap towards getting closer to beating him?
 TOMMY ROBREDO: Closer? No, because to get closer you have to win two sets. After the way he started the match, he started playing great and making unbelievable shots all the time.
 I think for me, being there and winning the second set is great. Then in the third, I had chances to break him in the beginning. He broke me, and then I had chances to win these games again. 
 So it was a little bit unfortunate there. If you make these mistakes with Federer, then it's normal that he gets the third set, and then it's very difficult to stop him.
 But at the end, I'm happy the way I perform.
