T. ROBREDO/S. Koubek
  3-6, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6, 6-1

 Q. Fantastic match to watch, and at this stage very tough for you, too. It looked in stages during your match that you were ailing. Are you physically fit? 
 TOMMY ROBREDO: What does that mean, ailing? 

 Q. As if you were physically struggling. Any injuries?
 TOMMY ROBREDO: No, I think I was better physically than him because during the fifth set he was struggling and I was there. 
 But obviously it's not easy to move feet around the grass. It's like you have like a thousand small points on your shoe. You have to all the time be trying to don't fall down, and it's not easy to play on grass. That's why I think maybe I was not that quick. But no, I was okay. 

 Q. Give me a sense of how much this tournament means to you. How do you value it, rate it, compared to the others, and what's your realistic expectation of how far you think you might go here? 
 TOMMY ROBREDO: If you ask me if I really like this, I would say not. It's tough to play on grass. When you start playing one day and it's full of grass, and the day after it's half of the grass and the day after it's less grass, it's not good. So you play two tournaments a year on grass and the rest another surface. 
 If you ask me if I like it, I say not. It's a great tournament for sure because it's a Grand Slam and everyone wants to do great. But obviously it's not the best place that I like to play, and when I come here I just try to win one match, then another one, and going round by round. It's really tough for me because it's not --

 Q. Your surface?
 TOMMY ROBREDO: Yeah, for sure.

 Q. So you have no expectation of going deep then in this tournament? 
 TOMMY ROBREDO: Well, my expectations, it's survive every day.

 Q. Match by match?
 TOMMY ROBREDO: Survive. Not win, just survive.
