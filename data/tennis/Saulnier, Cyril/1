THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.


Q.  Did you expect something better?

CYRIL SAULNIER:  No, I went on to the court with the mindset corresponding to my objectives, meaning I didn't want to expect anything on clay, I wanted to play my best and enjoy myself.  It will be the same for the next two months.  During the first set, that's what happened.  I enjoyed myself and I played very well.  But I got caught by the result.  There were two games where I had opportunities to break him.  I could see that I had possibilities today because he seemed nervous, but I didn't keep cool enough and I didn't play well anymore.  I kept thinking about those breakpoints that escaped me.  After that, it was difficult to accept it and to continue playing.
