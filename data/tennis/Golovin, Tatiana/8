  Q. Obviously a fantastic effort today.   
 TATIANA GOLOVIN: Yeah, you know, it was pretty much my first  really tough match against one of the best players. I think I definitely had a lot of  opportunities I think in the sets and the games and the points, so I think I'm  going to really learn from this match to be able to go after and beat the top  players.  
  
  Q.  Do you feel like you know her game really well, that's why you obviously  troubled her early on?  
 TATIANA GOLOVIN: Well, she knows my game as well as I know  hers, I guess. I think that kind of  evens it out. But definitely she  bothered me with her slices. At the end  where we got tired and I couldn't get down anymore, I started making more  errors. Her forehand was better  today. She was only missing kind of the  easy ones. When I was able to hit hard  at her she was able to hit them back. I  knew she was going to miss, but at the same time I want to be aggressive and  it's kind of tough to get the ball.
