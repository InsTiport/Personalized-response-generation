THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.  
 
 
Q.  What are your thoughts on the match? 
 
TATIANA GOLOVIN:  It was a positive experience.  It was my first time out there.  You know, I really enjoyed it.  I think the crowd liked it, too, so that was important.  And, you know, I had my chances out there.  You know, obviously I'm pretty happy because I played better than I did when I played her at Wimbledon.  So obviously that's positive.  But, you know, I'm there, you know.  I had my chances.  I'm with her.  So that's a good thing. 
 
Q.  What were your impressions of her? 
 
TATIANA GOLOVIN:  You know, I was ready.  I was ready for -- you know, I know how she plays now.  You know, I already played her, obviously.  So I was ready.  I was ready for what she was gonna do out there.  So, no, I can't really say I was impressed. 
 
Q.  How do you feel about Serena's clothes?
 
TATIANA GOLOVIN:  The clothes?  I think it's cool.  I like the dress, yeah.  It was nice.
