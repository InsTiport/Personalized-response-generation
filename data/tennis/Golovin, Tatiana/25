THE MODERATOR:  English questions, please.  
 
 
Q.  This is obviously your first Grand Slam. 
 
TATIANA GOLOVIN:  Yeah. 
 
Q.  I was wondering, what were your expectations when you were given a wildcard?
 
TATIANA GOLOVIN:  I was just really happy having the wildcard.  We worked really hard all winter.  My goal was to pass a few matches, get a few points.  I just started to play really well.  I'm feeling confident now.  I'm just hoping to have a good match on Monday. 
 
Q.  You spent a lot of December working with Amelie and Nathalie. 
 
TATIANA GOLOVIN:  Yeah, we went to the mountains, we worked for two weeks in the mountains, skiing, doing a lot of cardios.  I think that helped me a lot out here today.  I started with my new coach, Pierre Cherret.  So I think everything's worked out really well so far. 
 
Q.  When you were in America, did you work with Brad Gilbert for a little while?
 
TATIANA GOLOVIN:  Yeah, we worked together.  He came to the US Open and Wimbledon when I played Juniors.  I got to the semis with him.  We still keep in contact.  I just saw him after my match.  Yeah, we worked for like -- I've known him for like a year and a half now.  I go to his house, practice a little bit. 
 
Q.  You're entered for Juniors.  Will you request a delay there, or will you...
 
TATIANA GOLOVIN:  No, I think I'm gonna have to pull out, yeah, unfortunately.  
 
Q.  How long did you live in Russia for? 
 
TATIANA GOLOVIN:  We moved when I was eight months. 
 
Q.  Eight months?
 
TATIANA GOLOVIN:  Yeah, so I never went back.  So not long at all. 
 
Q.  To France? 
 
TATIANA GOLOVIN:  Yeah.
