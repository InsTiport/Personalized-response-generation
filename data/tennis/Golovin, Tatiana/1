   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.   
  
  Q.  You lost the last two sets, but winning the first one in that way, coming back from 5-2, do you take any consolation in the fact that you were able to come back so well?   
 TATIANA GOLOVIN:  You know, I think I started off a little bit slow.  You know, I was kind of trying to test how she was going to play, because I hadn't seen her play in a while.   
 And then, you know, I really started to kind of play my game.  I was offensive, I was being aggressive.  I was taking the ball early.  And that's what made me win the first set.   
 And you know, second set it was kind of on and off.  And the third, I definitely had my chances in the beginning.  I think the first two games should have been mine.   
 Then I come back and make two stupid errors then you're at 3-2.  So definitely a little bit of regrets in the third set because did I have my chances.   
 But overall, it's been a great week.  I hadn't played at that level for so long, so it feels good to be out there in front of a good crowd and playing high quality matches.
