M. TRUNGELLITI/Q. Halys   
3-6, 6-7, 7-6, 6-4, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.   
 Q.  How do you feel after this nearly four-hour match?  
QUENTIN HALYS: Right now, I'm extremely disappointed.  I was very close to winning first three sets, then four sets.  Finally lost in five.  Extremely disappointed.  I think there was room for me to actually win the match today.   
 Q.  So what was missing?  You were at 4-2 in the fourth set and you ended up losing it.  
QUENTIN HALYS: Maybe my serve.  I don't know.  At one point I had a downer.  He was playing a little better than I was.  Set ended up in his favor.   
I don't think I made any major mistakes, but with a better serve, I may have won the match.   
 Q.  You asked for medical attention.  What was it?  Was it your back?  
QUENTIN HALYS: I fell.  I fell on my stomach.  But nothing serious.
