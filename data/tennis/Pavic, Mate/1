PAVIC-SOARES/Melzer-Vasselin
6-7, 6-1, 10-4
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. I would like to know about the serve, and how fast is the surface at the O2 Arena?  Unfortunately we are not there to follow it from a close distance, but you can describe it better for us.  You achieved seven aces during the match, so it's quite a good number, right?
MATE PAVIC:   Yeah.  Well, I think we served pretty good throughout the match, the whole match.  If I have to compare the surface, I would say it's a bit slower than the last week in Paris, in Bercy, where we played.  But Bercy again is one of the fastest surface out there.
So I think the conditions in general are pretty fast.  The ball is going, you know, so personally I'm happy with the way conditions are, and I think it suits me.
Q. The absence of supporters at the arena, really sad, because for you guys having Brazilian supporters and Croatian supporters, which are very loud supporters, is always a strong factor for a team like yours.  How it is to play without these guys watching you?
MATE PAVIC:   Yeah, it's a bit sad, like you said, but it is the way it is at the moment.  We just actually, when we finished the match, we were doing some interview on the court, and I just said to Bruno, I said, It's pretty strange, actually weird to play.
You know, you did practice in front of nobody obviously, but to play a match, to compare it with the other years where we played here, it's a different feeling, especially because the place, the arena is so big.  It's just a weird feeling, but I guess you have to get used to it.
