MARACH-PAVIC/Herbert-Mahut
6-4, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Did you feel any pain today?
MATE PAVIC: No, everything is good.  I just didn't serve, let's say, from Paris.  Just had a couple of days ago slowly by slowly just getting into it.
Was just a strange feeling, I would say.  Just a little bit more in the head than I actually felt something.  I was okay.  After this match, there's no problem with it.
Q. Your opponent, Mahut, suffered a painful looking fall in the first set.  Were you surprised he was able to carry on?
MATE PAVIC: Well, yeah, I mean, they called two medicals.  Honestly looked like it in the beginning.  Later on, I mean, on some moments looked like he cannot barely walk, other moments he was playing normal.
I don't know how much of a pain he really felt or not.  I don't know.  Honestly, they played normal.  By the end of the match, they broke back.  He was fine.
Yeah, some moments he was maybe more acting than actually he felt pain because I felt they were fine completely.
Q. Was there a little bit a dÃ©jÃ  vu of the French Open final?
OLIVER MARACH: Well, it's a different surface.  DÃ©jÃ  vu?  Yeah.  We are happy we won it today.  For sure, one team we lost twice this year.  It's a very tough team when they really play well.  They're tough to beat.
We played today very solid, I have to say.  We had a great start.  We served both very well.  We returned very well.  Yeah, at the end it was tighter.  When the break got back, energy dropped a little bit for me.  It's not easy.
But we fight good back in the tiebreaker, played some good points.  I think we deserved to win that match today.
Q. Back to the fall.  Those blocks, their placement on the court, are they dangerous for players?
OLIVER MARACH: No.  I think for me it's a way from the lines.  If he runs back there, I mean, you know you have the blocks also.  It's unlucky what happened.  If the block would be from the baseline two meters away, then I would tell you, Okay, it's dangerous.
This is the block in every tournament you have.  The linesmen are there sitting.  Especially here, a big center court, four or five meters around that.
It was unlucky it was on the lob.  He couldn't look down and it happened.  I think it's not an issue.
