F. ABANDA/T. Andrianjafitrimo
6-3, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.
Q. How do you feel after this match?  I guess are you happy about what you did well, or are you just disappointed that you were not able to win even if you were leading at first?
TESSAH ANDRIANJAFITRIMO: Well, I guess I am a little disappointed because I ended up losing my match.  However, I think I did my very best with what I -- you know, the weapons, so to speak, I had.
I do realize that I still have a lot to learn and a lot of work to accomplish for the rest of the season.
Q. Last year, you had a tough defeat.  Is this year a little different even if the result is the same?
TESSAH ANDRIANJAFITRIMO: Yes.  Last year, the French Open was very difficult.  This year, it is very different.  However, I think I did my very, very best, first of all, to prepare for the match, and I did my very, very best last year.  When I arrived here in Paris, I had just been injured before, and I wasn't really very prepared mentally, physically.
This year, I did my very, very best and, obviously, it was not enough.  But I'll be back and I'll be better.
