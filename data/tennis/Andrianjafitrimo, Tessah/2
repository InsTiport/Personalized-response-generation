Q. WANG/T. Andrianjafitrimo
6-0, 6-0
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.
Q. (Off microphone.)
TESSAH ANDRIANJAFITRIMO: Frankly, I did not expect such a match.  I mean, I was defeated 6-Love, 6-Love, a double bagel.  It hurts.  I mean, since I started tennis, I have never experienced such a situation.  It does hurt a lot.
Q. This morning, how were you?  Uptight?  Tense?  How would you describe the situation?  Why did you lose that way?
TESSAH ANDRIANJAFITRIMO: I mean, I talked about it with my coach.  It's a matter of preparation.  Maybe I didn't prepare well the French Open.
So basically I'm reaping the bad fruit that I have sowed.
Q. What do you mean by that?
TESSAH ANDRIANJAFITRIMO: Regarding my preparation for the French Open, I haven't done a good job.  Totally different to the other tournaments.
I didn't prepare well, so I paid the price.  There was nothing today, nothing today on court.
Q. What was the difference in terms of your preparation for the French Open?
TESSAH ANDRIANJAFITRIMO: There's a difference when you prepare the French Open.  I didn't listen to my coach a lot.  I wanted to be on my own, but I have lots of things to learn.  I'm still a young player, and I wanted to behave as an adult would behave.
Q. What do you mean by that?  You haven't practiced well?
TESSAH ANDRIANJAFITRIMO: I did practice, but I didn't pay heed to the advice of my coach.  That's all.
Q. Tactical advice?
TESSAH ANDRIANJAFITRIMO: Yes, tactical, mental, psychological advice.  But of course, when I practice I tried to give my best, and even today during the match I tried to give my best, but it was not clear in my head.
Q. Was it your game plan that was not clear, or what was the reason?
TESSAH ANDRIANJAFITRIMO: My game plan wasn't clear in my head.
Q. Is it the first time you have met such a player?  In Saint-Gaudens defeated Kovinic last year, so you think that you didn't approach the match well?
TESSAH ANDRIANJAFITRIMO: Yes, exactly.  I didn't prepare well before the match.  Past two weeks I haven't prepared the way I should have.
Q. Regrets?
TESSAH ANDRIANJAFITRIMO: Yes, lots of regrets, that's for sure.
Q. What have you learned today?
TESSAH ANDRIANJAFITRIMO: I have learned that I should stick to my routine.  I should listen to my coach, even more today, and I should be more disciplined for the days to come and for the rest of my career if I want to make headway tennis-wise.
Q. Will you be in the juniors tournament, girls tournament?  Any different approach versus last year?
TESSAH ANDRIANJAFITRIMO: I will have a different approach to that for the main draw.  I can be among the favorites in the juniors tournament.  I can win the tournament, I think.
