   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 

 Q.  After such a long match last night did you feel tired? 
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  It was kind of tough to get on the court and be as sharp as I wanted to.  I didn't really get much sleep.  But I think really the way Kuzy was playing today it was really tough to do something about it. 
 Again, the conditions were quite tough with the wind on the court, but I gave it my best and it just didn't work today. 

 Q.  When play a match like yesterday which finishes after 11:00, what time did you go to bed?  Four hours later? 
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  2:00 I went to bed.  It's impossible earlier for me with all the adrenaline going on.  Even if I try to just doesn't work. 

 Q.  So even though you lost today what about the confidence on clay?  Is it there? 
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Yeah, I think so.  I think this week showed me that I can play on clay as well.  I had some very good matches here and beat some tough players an clay. 
 Especially last night I was very proud the way I fought even though I wasn't playing my best.  I think that's something that I've been doing much better.  That sometimes even if I don't feel great and I don't play the way I want, I still find a way to get through. 

 Q.  And the fact that you practice in Spain and you have a Spanish coach, does it help? 
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Definitely, I think so.  They are trying to convince me that I can play on clay as well, which I don't think I believed in the past.  I'm really excited about French Open this year.  I think it's going to be a good test for me, and I just can't wait for that to begin. 

 Q.  Is it the first time you were in a semifinal on clay? 
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Good question. 
 JOHN DOLAN:  Yes. 
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Yeah.  So it's nice to pick it here in Rome. 

 Q.  So are you happy with this tournament? 
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Definitely.  Yeah, Rome is my most favorite city in the world, so to make it first time here in semifinals it's great.  Once again, I had fantastic week.  I enjoyed it very, very much. 

 Q.  Did you change something compared with previous years?  Your foot work?  Your game?  Technique? 
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  I think it's more about the tactics, the way I try to play the matches.  The guys in Spain are trying to teach me to be more patient and not necessarily having to hit winners all the time. 
 But even if the other make mistake it's still point for me, so maybe I think mentally I had to change my thinking on clay. 

 Q.  And on your serve, especially maybe second serve, you put more spin on the ball than before; is that right? 
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Yeah, especially on clay.  There is not really a reason to go for it.  It's quite easy to return I think a harder serve than the one with the spin. 
 So I think makes more sense to play it safer and get into the rally like that. 

 Q.  So you have some more strength to play in Strasbourg next week? 
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  I hope so.  I hope so.  It was pretty tiring this week so we'll see. 

 Q.  You going to go there? 
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  I have to see doctor with my leg because I pulled one of the muscles on my left leg, but hopefully it gets better.  So we'll see.
