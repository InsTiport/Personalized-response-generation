THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Daniela, please. 
 
 
Q.  Were you surprised at how well you were able to play in the tiebreak?  Pretty good winners.
 
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, the tiebreak was unbelievable, especially, you know, the rallies we had in such important stage of the match.  I was just really pleased the way I work out the points in the tiebreak, and I was just fighting for everything 'cause I was talking to myself that no matter what happens I'm just going to get through this one. 
 
Q.  Are you surprised she hit a dropshot on matchpoint a little bit? 
 
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Well, I mean, she was trying all the different things during the match.  So maybe I guess she didn't know what to do because I was putting her under a lot of pressure, and maybe she wanted to try something different.  
 
Q.  When did you take the wrap off your hand? 
 
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  You mean the tape?  
 
Q.  Yes.
 
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  After the second set. 
 
Q.  After the second set? 
 
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Yes.  
 
Q.  What was it preventing you from doing? 
 
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Not letting my thumb to go up, because it really hurts when I have to lift it actually. 
 
Q.  Your thumb? 
 
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Thumb, uh-huh. 
 
Q.  You took it off because you were not hitting the shots you wanted to?
 
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Yeah, yeah.  I just didn't have the same feeling as I have without it.  I just thought it was going to be better.  I mean, it still hurt but I felt like there was a good decision. 
 
Q.  You think you have a good chance to play against Serena, despite your injury?
 
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Oh, definitely.  I mean, I'm just so happy to be in the quarterfinals.  I'm really looking forward to this match.  I played her in Wimbledon and I got a lot of experience from that match.  I'm just I think ready to play her.  I'm just going to try to do my best and see what happens. 
 
Q.  What did you learn from that Wimbledon loss?  You played her close in some games, but she still won in straight sets. 
 
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Yeah, I mean, you know, she was serving really great.  I think that made the difference there because all the chances I had, she just, you know, served big.  That was it.  But, I mean, this is different surface and I'm really happy the way I'm hitting the ball.  I'm really confident at the moment because, you know, the first few rounds made it quite easy for me.  I was very pleased the way I played.  Today I got through one of my toughest matches I ever played. 
 
Q.  You were serving for the match in the tiebreak.  By that I mean you had two points, it was on your serve.  You lost both of them.  Was it tightness or she just played better?
 
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Yeah, well, I think I missed two easy shots that I shouldn't.  But, I mean, at that stage of the match I think we both were quite tight because it was very close.  Maybe I just wanted it too much in those points.  But then I got the other two on her serve, and that was important.  
 
Q.  Do you still feel pain? 
 
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Yeah, I mean, it still hurts.  But, you know, I hope during the night it will get better and hopefully I will be ready for tomorrow. 
 
Q.  The only thing you're doing is icing, or are you also taking something for it? 
 
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  I took some stuff to ... 
 
Q.  Anti-inflammatories?
 
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Yes, yes, to, you know, not to  -- just to make the pain a bit  -- ease it down.  I'm just icing it.  Then for the match we taped it.  Yeah, that's the only thing I guess I can do with it right. 
 
Q.  Would you consider not playing?
 
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  I mean, definitely.  I mean, even though it hurts, you know, when I'm out there on the court, I just try to forget about everything and to play.  
 
Q.  Is it strained ligaments?  What is the injury?
 
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Yeah, yeah.
