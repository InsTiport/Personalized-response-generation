   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.   
  
  Q.  Did she seem 14 to you at all?   
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  I think so, yeah.  Her face looks very young, very cute (laughter).   
  
  Q.  What about just her demeanor and the way she played?  Did she seem inexperienced?   
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Yeah, I thought her attitude was very good, and from the baseline she's hitting the ball very well.  I think she's got a good future ahead of her.   
  
  Q.  Some people would say that there was much more pressure on you than her.  Did you feel that at all, like, oh, boy, I'd better beat this kid pretty good?   
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Yeah, of course.  She has nothing to lose.  If I win, okay, that's what I'm supposed to do.   
 If I lose, it's the biggest disaster in the world.  It wasn't easy to handle that, but I'm really glad how I handled it mentally and stayed positive and went for my game.   
  
  Q.  Any fatigue coming out of Indian Wells for you?   
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Yeah, it was pretty tough.  The couple days after the tournament I felt like I needed to rest and get my energy back, but today I felt again very good on the court.
