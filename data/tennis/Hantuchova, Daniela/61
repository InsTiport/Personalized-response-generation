MODERATOR:  First question, please.  
 
 
Q.  It was a bit of a wait, wasn't it, to get on court tonight?
 
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Yeah.  I mean, the match before us took forever.  I mean, they played like for four hours.  Was, you know, pretty tough to wait so long.  But, I mean, that's what it takes sometimes.  I think I'm pretty much used to it after having, you know, wait like this for a couple of matches also in Wimbledon last year.  So, you know, it's just a question of, you know, staying calm and not to waste too much energy before the match.  
 
Q.  Once you got on court?
 
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  You know, I feel like I'm hitting the ball better and better from match to match.  You know, I didn't know what to expect from her because I never played her.  You know, I think, especially in the second set, I raised my level, and I'm glad that I got on top of her and that I got through this match so easy.  
 
Q.  Can you remember much about your match against Venus here last year?  It was pretty close. 
 
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Yeah, definitely I do remember a lot from that match.  Can't say was a breakthrough; I didn't beat her.  But that match gave me a lot of confidence.  I was, you know, very close of beating her last year.  You know, that's what I'm hoping  -- you know, this year, to get to play her, and hopefully to do a little better than I did last year.  Yeah, I mean, that match definitely gave me a lot of confidence for the whole year.  
 
Q.  So, obviously, that will be one thing you're thinking about in your next matches?
 
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  First of all, it's the next one that I have to think about, which is against Patty Schnyder, who is a very tough player to play.  First I have to think about that one before I start to think about Venus.
