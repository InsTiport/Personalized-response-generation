THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   So can you talk us through hour by hour your last 24 hours?   So you finished the match in Pattaya, what, 5:00? 
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:   7:00.   Yeah.   Went straight to my room, packed quickly, rushing to the airport.   Didn't sleep at all during the flight and got here 5:30 in the morning.
Then I tried to sleep.   Nothing.   Had breakfast.   Went to a little bit of bike just to kind of move my body a little bit.   Then had a warmup, some treatments, and I don't know how I'm still awake (smiling). 

Q.   You could have done without three sets like this tonight?
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:   Yes.   But much of like this is what I work for, and this is where the love for the sport comes in.
Yes, I'm tired, but it's the best feeling in the world.

Q.   You said something about you got an hour's sleep?   When was that?   After breakfast when you went to your room?
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:   Yes.   Well, it was half an hour and half an hour on the plane.

Q.   You must be very proud of what you have achieved. 
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:   I am, yeah.   Because honestly when I was warming up today I was telling J.L.   it was like, even five minutes' running, felt like five hours. 
Yeah, I knew that once the adrenaline of the match kicked in that it was going to be easier, but still, from the middle of the second set my legs were just, yeah, out of control.

Q.   What kept you going in the third set?
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:   Like I said I think just the heart.   Really, I do appreciate so much the opportunity I got here, given the wildcard.   So I did not want to, you know, give up.   Just kept fighting till the end.

Q.   I'm just curious, what did you do between Melbourne in terms of travel between Melbourne and Pattaya?
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:   I was actually here in Dubai training for one week really hard.

Q.   You've got a tough one again tomorrow night. 
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:   I think with the way I feel, everything is tough now (smiling).   Like I said, this is what I have been working so hard in the offseason for, and feels like it's now all paying off.   Doesn't really matter who is on the other side.   I think it's now more important just to try to rest as much as I can and get some energy back.

Q.   We are making the assumption you flew in a more comfortable part of the airplane. 
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:   I did.   But I'm a horrible sleeper on the plane.   I never really sleep.

Q.   The players who made the final in Antwerp were given something called a performance bye. 
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:   I guess I didn't deserve that.

Q.   Apparently it's just for the premier tournaments and not the internationals.   Do you think that's fair?   Do you think it should be... 
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:   Not really.   Because we are both playing the same amount of matches.   I know it's a smaller tournament, but still, you know, the travel and everything, it's just the same.   But like I said, I'm not going to complain, you know. 
I would give everything maybe two months ago to have these problems if I can call it that, so it's all good.

Q.   Do you drink a lot of coffee?
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:   I took ‑‑well, actually today, no.   In Pattaya I was taking cappuccino every morning because also there I was not sleeping much.
But not today, no.   Before the matches I try not to, no. 

Q.   Are you going to sleep now?
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:   I think so.   If I don't sleep tonight, tomorrow, I don't know (smiling).   I'm really ready to go now.   Yes. 

Q.   Do you ever remember playing a match without having slept?
DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:   No, because normally we used to have like one day in between to kind of...   So it's going to be interesting tomorrow how I feel.
