 Q.  You really didn't do anything wrong today.  You must be happy with your preparation for the tournament. 
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Yeah, definitely.  I felt like I was doing everything right today on the court, and tactically I think I played very smart. 
 Yeah, I think, as I've been saying the last few weeks, I started to feel really good on grass, and I think I had two very good tournaments, so I was coming in very confident into this one. 

 Q.  What does it mean to you to be back here as the No. 10 seed? 
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  It means a lot.  I mean, it's a great feeling to be back in the top ten.  I know how to appreciate it this time, you know, where before maybe I was taking too many things for granted and didn't really realize what I was doing. 
 But yeah, it feels great, but I feel like that's not my final stop.  I want to get much, much further. 

 Q.  And on that, do you look ahead in the draw? 
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Not really, no.  I just try to take it one match at a time, not look too far ahead of myself and take it as it comes and just try to do my best, and we'll see. 

 Q.  Do you know who your fourth round opponent could be? 
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  I have no idea. 

 Q.  So you don't want me to tell you? 
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  I don't care. 

 Q.  Serena. 
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Okay.  First I think we both need to get there.
