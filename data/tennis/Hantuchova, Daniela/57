THE MODERATOR:  First question for Daniela, please. 


Q.  How do you feel you're playing right now?  How has your game been going since you were here last?

DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Well, I feel really good on the court.  I had a really good practice in the last couple of days, and I'm really looking forward for this tournament.  I mean, you know, it's a big opportunity for me, so I'm going to try to do my best and see what happens.

Q.  What's been the big difference for you as your game's improved in the last year?

DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Well, especially I think mentally I got much tougher because I played many more matches and have been on the tour a bit longer.  And also tactically I have been working really hard with my coach, and I think that made a difference last year.

Q.  With Serena playing so well, does it affect the other players at all knowing how tough she's always going to be when she's out there?

DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Well, I mean, once I'm on the court, I'm not thinking about who I'm playing.  I'm always trying to do my best.  At the moment she's really dominating the game, and she really deserves to be No. 1.  It's really tough to play against her. But as I said, I'm trying to concentrate on my game and improve it as much as I can.
