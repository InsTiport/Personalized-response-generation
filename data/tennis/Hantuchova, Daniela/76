Q.  Do you like the life so far?

DANIELA HANTUCHOVA: Oh, yeah, I love it.  Yep.  (Smiling.)


Q.  Are you one of the players who look around in the town?  Because a lot of players do not look around in the town during the tournament.  They only see the tennis courts. 

DANIELA HANTUCHOVA: Yeah, I think there are many other important things in life, not just tennis.  So you have to also look around.

Q.  May I tell you that you look different now that you are seated here.  You look very relaxed.  On the court this morning sometimes to me can be the impression you looked a little bit stiff. 

DANIELA HANTUCHOVA: In practice?


Q.  No. 

DANIELA HANTUCHOVA: Oh, in the match?


Q.  During the game.  Is it the wrong impression of mine, or you were in some way too tense or...?

DANIELA HANTUCHOVA: Well, maybe the first few games I was a little bit tense, but then I started to play my game so I was more relaxed.  I don't think I was tense at all.


Q.  So this was not Mauresmo's fault?

DANIELA HANTUCHOVA: No. 


Q.  I noticed you volleyed a couple of times. 

DANIELA HANTUCHOVA: Who, Mauresmo?


Q.  You. 

DANIELA HANTUCHOVA: I should have been more often.  Well, I like to  -- the game of serve and volley, but it's very tough, you know, against the best players because they return so good and their passing shots are really good.  So it's really tough to get there with those players.


Q.  But you would like to?

DANIELA HANTUCHOVA: Yeah, yeah. 


Q.  You like to play on grass?  Do you know grass already?

DANIELA HANTUCHOVA: Yeah.  Well, actually I don't care what surface I'm playing on. 


Q.  So with all this occupation and traveling with mama, you don't have any time for a sentimental life, I assume?

DANIELA HANTUCHOVA: Well, that's the way of tennis.  So I really enjoy the game, so...
