   THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 

 Q.  Summarize that game for us.  It was a good one first up? 
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Yeah, definitely. 

 Q.  Very tight. 
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Yeah, it was very tight.  I was really glad to get through in two sets.  I mean, it was quite a big fight, especially in the second set.  I thought Vania was playing very well. 
 I was just pleased the way I hang in there and play the big points well.  That was, I think, crucial today. 

 Q.  What is your goal for this year? 
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Not really putting any expectations.  I mean, just want to go out there and play my best in every match, and how far I get in the tournaments, we'll see. 
 Obviously I feel like I'm playing well and I'm pretty confident.  So, yeah, I just want to enjoy it and always do my best. 

 Q.  Fully fit? 
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Yes, fully fit.
