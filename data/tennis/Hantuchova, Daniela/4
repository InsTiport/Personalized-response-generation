      6‑2, 6‑3

    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Obviously there were opportunities there and lots of breaks and so on.   How do you feel overall?   Do you feel like there were missed opportunities there?
    DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:   Definitely.   I didn't feel like I played my best tennis today, which is unfortunate because I had many chances and didn't hold my serves when I needed to.   Throughout the whole tournament my serve was working great, just not tonight.
    I mean, I was trying everything, but it was just not going my way.   Very disappointed with the performance, because I know what I can do and how I can play.   So I was going into the match feeling confident; just didn't work out today.

Q.   Is she a very different player to play against than she was two or three years ago?
    DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:   She's always been very solid and she doesn't give you anything for free.   She makes very few mistakes; moves extremely well.
    I knew what to expect.   Like I said, it was just from my side.   I didn't bring out the best of me.

Q.   There was a couple of double faults there, as well, that cost you. 
    DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:   Yeah, especially that 2‑All game.   That was huge.

Q.   What's your schedule after this?
    DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:   I'm supposed to play in Tokyo if I get in, and then Beijing, Linz, and Moscow.
