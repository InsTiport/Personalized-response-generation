MODERATOR:  Questions for Daniela. 


Q.  Talk about maybe comparing this match to Wimbledon, how she was different, how you were different. 

DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  I think definitely today I didn't have as much energy as I had in Wimbledon because the match last night took a lot out of me.  I just felt like, you know, I was not sharp enough, I was not moving that fast.  I think in Wimbledon I played much better tennis than I did today.  You know, at the moment she's the No.  1 in the world, so obviously she's very confident.  It was very tough to play her. 

Q.  What impression did you have about Serena's play?

DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  I mean, she played great.  She was serving really hard.  Sometimes on her service games, there was nothing I could have done about.  I think I didn't play my best today.  I didn't serve as hard as usual.  You know, it's for me great experience.  I just have to learn from it and move on. 

Q.  Did you go into it looking at it as a yardstick?  You must have thought you had a chance to win.  How were you approaching the match?

DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  I was just trying to do my best out there.  I was looking for it a lot.  I just couldn't play the same way as I did yesterday, which in that case I think would have been much more interesting match. But still was great to be out there on the center court.  I enjoyed it.  The crowd was great.  I have learned a lot from this match. 

Q.  Do you think she ever invents reasons to be more excited about a match?  You've been getting a lot of attention.  She comes out and just seems to like kick into a higher level. 

DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  That's why Serena and Venus are so good.  They raise to another level.  They start to play even better when it's crucial.  That's what makes them so good.
