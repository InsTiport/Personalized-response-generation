   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.   
  
  Q.  How was it out there for you tonight?  From up above it looked pretty routine for you.  Was it?   
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Yeah, I was really actually pleased the way I played.  Felt great.  Like I said many times, I feel like it's my court.  So even though it was cold and little bit windy, it was much easier to play than yesterday or the day before, so it felt good.   
  
  Q.  Seems like you've got into a nice rhythm right away.  Coming in here, seems like a lot of people have been struggling with three setters.   
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Yeah, I know, I'm actually really pleased about it.  I didn't really know what to expect after I've been sick for a while.  I was just trying to back into practicing well.   
 You know, as soon as we got here I started to have a good feeling again, as I always do about this tournament.  You know, it was just, again, just happy to be out there.   
  
  Q.  When you said sick, what was your illness?   
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  I had a virus for two weeks.   
  
  Q.  Two weeks?  When did you get over that, about?   
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  About 10 days ago.   
  
  Q.  Ten days ago?   
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Yeah.   
  
  Q.  You feel pretty fit right now?   
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Yeah, that's what I -- that's what I said, that I didn't really expect that I was going to feel so good, and especially I feel like I was moving well and hitting any shot I wanted to.   
 I was expecting a very tough match because I saw her playing against Bondarenko, and she is a tough player.   
  
  Q.  What's your thoughts about playing against Sania next round?   
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  She won?   
  
  Q.  Yeah.   
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  She's a big hitter.  You never know what to expect.  Yeah, it's going to be a tough match.  But, again, I hope I'll be playing on my court, and there anything can happen.  But I know I'm going to enjoy it and I'll see.  I will just do my best and see what happens.   
  
  Q.  Did you say anything to the tournament director to make sure you're always playing on this court?  Did he make any promises?   
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Of course I always hope to be playing out there, because it's my court.  I understand if there are more important matches or whatever to be put on that court, so it doesn't matter.   
  
  Q.  Well, you are the defending champion.  You do have some say, don't you?   
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  I know, I know, but I just leave it up to them.   
  
  Q.  How are you playing?  Where do you think your level is in general?   
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  We've just been talking about that.  Actually I'm really surprised the way I've been playing, because I didn't expect being sick here for two weeks.  I felt like it was going to be much longer to find my rhythm, but today I felt great.  I felt like I was moving well, and it was a good match.   
  
  Q.  When you're sick, sometimes I hear with certain players that sometimes you're able to focus better because you know you can't stay out there forever and every ball counts.   
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Exactly.  And also just gives me different view on, you know, how to approach matches.  I just appreciate it so much, just to be able to be healthy and be out there on the court.   
  
  Q.  So I read you said the other day that that court feels like the best one for you.   
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Definitely.   
  
  Q.  It's just magic when you walk out there?   
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  I love the bounce:  not too fast, not too slow.  I feel really I can do whatever.  I was just thinking about it.  I just wish so much every tournament we play on that court.  It would be a different story for me.   
  
  Q.  You can buy a house here and start your own tournament, eh?   
 DANIELA HANTUCHOVA:  Yeah.
