D. MEDVEDEV/K. Nishikori
6-2, 6-4
Q. Congratulations again on qualifying for the semifinals.  What's your reaction?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV:   Yeah, really happy for the team.  Semis is a big step.  Just two days starting the tournament, already in the semis.  Looking forward, yeah, really happy that we made it in both singles.  It was actually straight sets, so really happy for the team and hopefully we can go further than that.
Q. Can you talk about playing a quality player like Kei and how pleased are you with your performance?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV:   Yeah, of course.  First of all, I feel sorry for Kei because he had to do the hard quarantine here.  It's never easy to play after 14 days without tennis, especially for him.  I think he didn't play a competitive match since maybe one year or something like this, one year and a half if I'm not mistaken.  Tough situation for him.  I had to do my job.  I've done it, so I won't say too much about the match.
