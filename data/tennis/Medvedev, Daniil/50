A. ZVEREV/D. Medvedev   
6-4, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You obviously beat him a few weeks ago in Shanghai. Did he do anything differently that surprised you or was it a bad day for you?  
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Yeah, he chose a different court probably 20 times faster (smiling). So I don't think there was another tournament where I was so bad on return during the whole year. That's where the result came from.   
I mean, actually if not the first game where I probably lost my concentration, maybe didn't get as well in the match as I could, he didn't have that many chances on return, either. Funny, tennis.   
 Q.  The results over the last two, three weeks, do you think in one sense that the incredible results you have had over the last three, four months may have caught up with you?  
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: It is possible. I cannot know what it is, for sure. I can tell you that tennis is made of many small things, and many of them depend on your actually, I would say, out-off-tennis things, the way you feel, are you happy at this moment or not.   
I had, like, I would say, one tough week outside of tennis, and I think it cost me a little bit of, I would say, tennis level in Bercy, and then I couldn't keep up with it. Is it also coming from the results I had earlier this season? It is completely possible, but I'm not sure it is.   
I mean, I hate to play like I did these weeks before. I never thought that I should have lost a match to be better in ATP Finals, you know.   
 Q.  What is the balance of this experience here in London?  
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: A tough one, but I always said that for me actually experience of something new is the key, and it was my first time in ATP Finals.   
I can say that I was thinking about it after the match with Rafa, because I thought I would not have the chance to get out of the group. Then I actually had but then I didn't, finally.   
I tried to remember if I actually had any good first-time experience in tennis like, I don't know, coming to first Grand Slam and winning, going in the semis or anything like this. I don't think I ever did it, so I'm really the guy who needs to know how it is before to really get into it.   
So hopefully this experience will help me if I will have the chance to be in another ATP Finals during the next years.
