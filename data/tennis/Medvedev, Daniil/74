D. MEDVEDEV/C. Garin   
6-3, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French, please.   
 Q.  Can you talk about the win today.  Were the conditions difficult?  
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: There was wind for the whole match.  I can't say it was too bad.  In some tournaments this year it was much more serious.  But this time it didn't bother me a lot.   
When you win 6-3, 6-3, you can believe it was not too much wind.  If I had lost, I would have said it was too windy, I couldn't play.   
But it didn't bother me today.   
 Q.  This week players were describing the atmosphere here as being close to a Grand Slam.  With your experience on center court, how would you describe the atmosphere here in Montreal?  
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: It's a beautiful atmosphere.  It is, indeed, close to a Grand Slam.  Every time we take the little car to go and practice or go to the match, the car can't go through because there are too many people.   
The first day I was surprised because normally on the first or second day of a tournament, Monday or Tuesday, there are not too many people because they're working.  Here it was crowded, especially in the evenings.  It's great.   
For my matches, there were many people.  But they are very fair with every player.  That's great.   
 Q.  There's a rivalry with the other Russian player in the top 10.  We might have that in Canada, too.  The fact that there is a second Russian player in the top 10, is it pushing you?  
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Of course, first we play for ourselves.  I am sure that even if Karen wasn't there, I could also be in the top 10.  But it's a good competition between us two.  During the past two, three seasons, it was a good competition.  It was fun.   
 Q.  You speak French because you've been practicing in France for many years.  You maybe could have learned English, which is a more international language.  Why did you learn a third language?  
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: At the start it was my parents who told me, You have to come and learn French.  It was great for me because before I didn't know much.  It was great that I learned French before I came to France because it was easier to learn the language there.  At least I was able to understand what they were talking about.   
Then my coach was speaking French to me only, all the players were speaking French to me.  Suddenly I realized that, yes, I'm speaking French.   
 Q.  How old were you when you started learning French?  You were a child?  
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: No, I was 17 or 18 years old.  It's only when I started practicing in France, training in France, that I started learning French.   
 Q.  Can you describe the importance of French culture in tennis.  There's a lot of presence of French in tennis.  
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Yes, the culture of tennis in French is big.  I think with South America, it's where tennis is more present.  In those countries, there's a big culture of tennis.  That's why I decided to come and practice in France.  I'm very happy because it worked out well.   
 Q.  In the interview with the ATP, you were saying the crowd had adopted you because you were able to speak French.  Was it a joke or was it true?  
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Sorry, I didn't understand.   
 Q.  Were you serious when you were saying the public adopted you?  
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Yes, I didn't know that word.  My French is not perfect.   
But, yes, I believe this is the reason.  After the match, everybody says, Oh, you speak French, Daniil.  I think this brings the crowd to support me.  It's funny.   
 Q.  A change of subject.  You had two good first matches.  How do you see the next match against Thiem?  Is it good to play Thiem now at this stage, especially given the last match you had against him where it ended in a tiebreaker in the third set?  Is this the right time to play him again?  
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: It's going to be a very difficult match like the last two times.  On clay, he beat me.  As you said, on hard courts it was 7-6.  It was a tougher match.   
I think he played very well.  I know he's in good shape right now.  When he plays like this, he's difficult to beat.  We saw that in Indian Wells.   
So I'll consider this match as a test.  Am I able to beat players that are in good shape like he is right now and like him?  That will be a good test.
