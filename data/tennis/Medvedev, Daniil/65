D. MEDVEDEV/P. Gunneswaran   
6-4, 6-1, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  This is the first time in 34 years we have two players in the main draw from India, obviously an exciting time, both getting able to play top 5 players. What are your thoughts on Prajnesh and what do you think he needs to do to play consistently at this level?  
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: I don't know what he has to do to play consistently on this level because I'm not a tennis coach, but I can say first set was really great from him. It was really tough. I'm happy that I managed to win it 6-4.   
Then he dropped his level, but that's kind of normal at the level we are that. Me, I tried to stay consistent throughout the whole match. That's what he needs to learn to do. And how to do it, this I have no idea.   
 Q.  What was the issue with your -- was the hamstring a bit tight?  
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Yeah, I'm not even sure. It's, like, between hamstring and glute. Just felt I would say a bit tight and painful there. Decided to call the physio to make sure that it's not going to get worse. After I called the physio I felt nothing. So everything should be good.   
 Q.  Did you notice -- Prajnesh was saying his ankle rolled over at 2-2 in the first set. Did you notice anything going on at the other end?  
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Yeah, I saw something. I ask him if he was okay. He said yes.   
I don't know exactly what happened, but, yeah, he seemed to be painful with his ankle a little bit. I don't really know what happened. I haven't seen it happen.   
 Q.  Also you said it was a tight first set. Could you talk a little more about how he played and the level of his play.  
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Yeah, as I say, first set he was, let's say, tough to say, because everybody knows how to play tennis, but let's say top 50 level, for sure. But the thing is that after his level dropped then it was kind of two easy sets for me with a lot of unforced errors for him. That's where he should be better.   
 Q.  I was talking to Kei Nishikori after his match and we were talking about the lock the big three have had, have won them all since Stan won here four or five years ago. Your name came up. He mentioned you as one of the players who really could start to put some pressure on these guys coming up. When you hear these types of things, and certainly been written about as you being one of the guys who can usurp yourself against those three guys, how does that make you feel?  
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Actually, just -- I don't know the exact word in English, but not makes me proud, because I respect Kei so much, he's a great champion of our sport. To be champion, you don't need to win 16 majors at least. Kei is a great player, and to hear my name come up like this, is just -- how to say, I don't have the word, but it's a great feeling and I'm thankful to him for that.   
Me, I always try to stay at the same time a little bit away, because I always say at this moment of my career I haven't even been in the quarters of a slam yet. So that's the first step to make, and if I make this step, then I can talk about bigger goals and bigger achievements.   
 Q.  The way you played against Djokovic in the second half of that semifinal is very different from the way you usually play, a lot more risk. For you, was that just a one-off, or do you feel like maybe that showed you a different way that you can play?  
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: No, I basically felt, I mean, playing against this big three opponents or anybody who is tough, you need to adapt your tactics. I felt really tired, which is completely normal, this match. I just felt that if I continue just kind of pushing the ball and staying solid, I'm going to destroy myself and he's going to destroy me.   
That's why I knew that the only chance is to go aggressive, and since I'm a good player, I was able to play good even playing kind of not my style, and that's actually -- that's why it's a big victory, also.   
 Q.  Do you think that's something you can see yourself doing again?  
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Yeah, we are working a lot on this on practice, because of course you need to reinforce your strengths. But you have to also work on your kind of, let's say, not weak parts, but things that you need to improve.   
I play really aggressive on the practices, and that's what I have been working on. It pays off step by step.   
 Q.  Do you think the prime reason for this wonderful summer you have had is aggressiveness? How would you put it in terms of the reason you have had such a surge this summer?  
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: No, I would say that actually it's consistency, that is the biggest key to this summer. I mean, because, to be honest with you, every match I played, even the match against Rafa, I felt really good inside, only confident of my game.   
I mean, I was making my opponents doubt a lot what they should do to beat me, and I lost just two matches. Yeah, that was the biggest key.   
And after, of course, I tried to adapt my tactics every time I play someone different, especially if he's starting to beat me.   
 Q.  How do you prepare for someone that you're not familiar with, in this case Prajnesh? Did you know anything about his game?  
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Not really. Actually, it's funny, but we practiced in Chennai once when I was there and I made final. I don't know if it was four years ago, three? I think it was three years ago.   
And I practiced with him there. I always remember this practice, because this time he was, like, 600. I just got into top 100 and now we are at different level.   
I didn't remember anything about this practice. So my coach watched some matches of him, which we usually do like this. My coach watches me, tells me what he saw, and this way we prepare the match.   
 Q.  Talking about the great summer you have had and the accomplishments, compare right now your level of confidence coming into this Grand Slam as to any other. Are you about as confident as you have ever been during this two-week tournament, hopefully two weeks?  
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: I think talking about my confidence inside of me, I would say I was already confident in the other Grand Slams. But talking about my confidence in my tennis game, of course it grew a lot just because, I mean, these last three weeks they were, without a doubt, the best in my career. Because even this year I still had my ups and downs in some tournaments, and these three weeks I basically didn't have any downs. I had only great matches.   
It gives a lot of confidence to me that I'm able, as you said with Novak, for example, change my game and the momentum and start to give him problems. Hopefully I can bring this confidence on the court, and as you say, hopefully for two weeks or more.
