D. MEDVEDEV/D. Schwartzman
7-5, 6-3
Q. That was two excellent performances by Russia.  How would you describe it?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV:   Yeah, of course really happy with the win of the team because it's not an individual competition, it's a team competition first of all.  I had some things that I can improve, but it's the first match after almost one month and a half, two months without competition matches, which is never the same as practice.  So happy with the win and let's get going.
Q. What would you say was the key to your game tonight?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV:   I think the key when I play with Diego is that I served a little bit better and that's where I am always -- on his serve I have my chances, and for example tonight I was not really happy with my serve and I could have done better.  He broke me three times if I'm not mistaken, but I always had chances on his serve, so it's a little bit tough for him, especially on hard surfaces.  Clay it will be for sure completely the opposite.  But yeah, that was a good win.
