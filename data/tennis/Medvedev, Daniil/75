D. MEDVEDEV/Z. Zhang
3-6, 7-6, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Can you compare the courts, how they play here, to last week?  Also, carrying on your form from last week to this week, is it as easy or is it difficult to start again?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Of course the courts are totally different because, first of all, it's indoor there and outdoor here.  It's probably one of the toughest transitions in tennis.  I mean, the worst is going from clay on hard or hard to clay.  But to go from indoor to outdoor is really tough, and I had only one day to get used to.  For sure, I was not in my best shape today.
But at the same time, I managed to make a good match.  That guy was playing unbelievable, like, really, level, for me, top 20.  I don't know if I'm saying the right thing, so I'm happy to win it.
Q. Your opponent was never ranked above 150.  Can you comment more about his game, what part of his game threaten you the most?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Yeah.  As you say, he was never more than 150, and I thought of course, you know, that everybody can play good tennis, but anyway, I thought I'm going to be able to make some shots, some serves, some returns better than his level, and like this I'm going to manage to win.  Finally, like I say, he was showing some amazing tennis today, making winners, serving about 220.  Me, in my life, I never in my life did a serve of 220 kilometers and he did it like five today.
I don't know what happened, but he was playing amazing.  He was serving so good.  He was not missing a lot.  He was making winners.  At the net he was unbelievable.  So I'm really happy to manage to win this match and to play Roger in the next round.
Q. Can you talk a little about playing Roger.
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: I mean, it was my dream probably to play him once, because we all know that his career will not gonna last forever.  And I had few chances I remember in Rotterdam and Wimbledon, and I lost tough matches to play him.  Of course I was sad, because I practiced with him once, but to play him in the tournament on the central court, especially in Masters, is something amazing.
I hope I'm going to be able to play better than I did today, just by getting used to today to the conditions, and if I'm going to play good, I'm going to have my chances.
Q. Playing Roger in practice, obviously it's not playing in a match, and you will probably know tomorrow, but how was it to play him?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: It was one-and-a-half years ago, so I was playing worse than I am right now.  But, I mean, he was just destroying me on the court, on the practice (smiling).
But it's gonna be good for tomorrow, because I know that straightaway from the first one I will need to try to put pressure on him also, because that's what he does.  If I stay passive, if I'm just going to try to put the ball in the court, that's not gonna work out.
So I'm going to try to be aggressive, try to put him under pressure and let's see how it goes.
Q. Congratulations for your win in Tokyo.  Do you feel a little tired, even though it's not a very long trip to here?  Also, could you please comment of the atmosphere today?  Do you think they are fair to you?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: So first of all, about coming from Tokyo to here, it was not that easy, because even if I played seven matches in Tokyo, I was feeling good physically, but I decided to come at night to have one day to practice.  My flight was delayed, so I came in the hotel at 9:00 in the morning, so it was not easy.
I'm happy to manage to win in 2 hour 30 match today, not cramping, not bringing my physical level down.
So about fans, they were not fair, but it's okay.  I was playing against a Chinese guy in Shanghai, so I totally understand it and it's normal.
