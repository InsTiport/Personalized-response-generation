D. MEDVEDEV/S. Tsitsipas
6-2, 1-6, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Do you think the main difference between you and Tsitsipas -- taking a look at your record against him, you won four matches and they were all very close -- is that you have something more about on mental side of the match?  You were more focused during the match?  That's what I thought.  Do you agree with this idea?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: It's tough to say, because maybe it's true.  At the same time, for example, him, he had bigger wins than me.  He's higher in the rankings.  So he's also not bad (smiling). And he's younger than me.
But it's true, yeah, that all of our four matches were really tight.  I managed to go on top of all of them.  Why?  Well, me, every match I play, I try to win every point, in fact.  Not that I even fight for every point, but before every point, I think, okay, what should I do to win this point?  And it works well against him (smiling).
