 DANIIL MEDVEDEV
 THE MODERATOR:   An excellent start at the ATP Cup.  How would you summarize that tie today?
 DANIIL MEDVEDEV:   Yeah, I'm really happy for the team that we managed to win it already even though the guys are still playing doubles, because it's not that often that we have a team tournament.
 So as much as I'm happy with my individual win, I'm happy for the team.  That's the most important here.
 Talking about my match, I think there were some things I could have done better, but still, it's first match in two months against a top-10 player.  A win is a win.  So hopefully it gets us going into the next one.
