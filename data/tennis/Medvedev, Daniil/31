D. MEDVEDEV/F. Tiafoe
6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. When you play Frances, what do you expect?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Yeah, he's a tough first round. Frances is really a great player. I think last year he was maybe seeded on some of the slams. Knew it's not going to be easy.
But happy with the win because that's most important. First round of a slam, never easy. Sometimes the most important is to really not show some crazy level or crazy shots, but just to win the match, get into the tournament.
Was a tough match against Frances, but happy to win it in four sets without playing five hours.
Q. Was there anything that felt different for you stepping out in a Grand Slam match for the first time after what you accomplished in New York?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Yeah, I would say not really. After what I accomplished in New York, I don't really think about it too much because I had a lot of tournaments after. A lot of tournaments after Australian Open there will be.
Of course, it felt different because that's the first time in my life I was stepping out on the center court in the first round of a slam as a favorite. I played once against Stan in Wimbledon. That was some new feeling.
Finally was a good feeling since I won. If I would have lost, it would not be good feeling.
Q. Do you feel like you were pretty close to your top level?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: I think I have a lot of things to improve regarding today's match. Especially the serve, I was not happy at all with my serve.
As I say, finally the most important is to win, to just win the match, get into the second round, get the sensations of the court, of the atmosphere, everything. Usually later in the tournament everything goes better and better.
Q. How would you describe the condition of the court and balls?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Today was cold. Was not cold, but was not hot. The ball was not going so fast. For me it's a little bit tough, I would say, to accelerate the ball. For example, for Frances it's easier. For me it's a little bit easier when it's hotter. The ball goes fast by itself without my help. Had to, you know, adapt my tactics during the game.
When I lost the second set, I knew I had to be more aggressive because he started pushing me all over the court. It worked well.
Melbourne, conditions change every day. You don't know what's going to be on Thursday.
