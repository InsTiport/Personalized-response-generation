D. MEDVEDEV/A. Popyrin
6-4, 6-3, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How was your performance?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Yeah, was a good match. I think didn't lose my serve. Had maybe only a couple of breakpoints, maybe only two or three. That's the most important in matches in Grand Slams, to try to hold your serve easy, to make your job easier.
I have some things I maybe could have done better in my mind. At the same time, won quite easy today. Really happy about it. Can save some energy for next round.
Q. (Question about winning points at net.)
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Yeah, I had in my mind against him sometimes I could go to the net to his backhand more because he slice and his slice can go up sometimes.
I don't think I went too much. Maybe I even lost some opportunities where I could go to the net. At the same time the percentage was quite high. Even the last point of the match I was at the net.
It's something I'm working a lot on practice. Sometimes doesn't work very well in the match. That's what you have to do in some situations.
Q. Is there something you still are looking to work on before Stan?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Well, during the tournament is a little bit tough because I have only one hour, maybe one hour 15 practice tomorrow. Of course, I'm going to work something.
Stan is a big hitter, great serves. I'm going to work a little bit on return, maybe will work just to be aggressive myself, to not let him all the time he wants because that's when he's the most dangerous.
I will just have to give my best on the court. That's how I have my opportunities to win.
