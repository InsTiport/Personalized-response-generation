S. TSITSIPAS/D. Medvedev
7-6, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What did you miss the most during this match?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: I think just general energy was not the way I wanted. And talking about energy, I'm not talking only about physical. Mentally I was missing something. I was not, I would say -- yeah, I didn't have good energy enough to get the win today.
But honestly, the way I was practicing last few weeks, I should say, I really lost a little bit the level I was playing, so I should say it was positive today, and I'm quite happy with the way I played regarding my last performances mostly on practices.
Q. Looking at the way Stefanos kind of celebrated afterwards, do you think he was very frustrated with the head-to-head that he came in with against you? Do you think it meant a lot to him?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: I -- yeah, I mean, I guess so. But I do think the most important for him was to win his match, his first match just like me in London Finals.
So I think he would celebrate this way against anybody no matter who he beat here, and, yeah, that's the answer.
Q. What you did in the summer, between the summer and the last tournament, was something unbelievable, no? Playing every tournament, going at least to the final. So my question is going to sound probably like a bit paradox, but is it possible that the break that you decide to take in Moscow affect a little bit your tennis and your confidence? Because you were playing unbelievable, and then you stop and you suddenly are giving me the feeling that you're struggling a bit more than what you did before?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Yeah, it's true. As I say, I'm struggling a little bit with finding back my level I had in USA and Shanghai and St. Petersburg, which is, I should say, I think normal for any sportsman, and that's what is amazing about top 3, big 3 and Murray before, that even when you kind of look at them and you think, okay, they are not playing as good as they can, they still win these matches.
That's what I'm missing right now, and that's what I'm going to try to work on and still have two matches to come. Hopefully can play them better than today.
But as I say, I have to say I'm positive about the way I played today. Of course I hate to lose, so I'm really disappointed to lose, but hopefully I can make it better in the next two matches.
Q. Is it more annoying for you to lose a match like that and against an opponent with who you have had a strained and difficult relationship with in the past? Does it piss you off more?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: In a way, because as I say, if I would be feeling -- no, I don't want to say my best way, because your best way you don't feel every day, but if I would be feeling good, if I would be confident about my tennis and I would have lost, I would have been, like, Okay, he was better today.
And he was better today, but I felt like I was missing some things. This frustrates me after. I do think it would frustrate me against any other opponent.
As I say, I hate to lose against anybody. Of course I wanted to make it even more bigger head-to-head, but it's the way it was, it's the way it is, and hopefully it will change the next time.
Q. You say you're missing something from your game. Is it more of a mental thing or more a physical thing?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: No, there is more problems physically, and actually answering another question, that's why I decided to take a break from Moscow in the end, because I knew that my body needs a rest if I don't want to get injured. So that was a decision to make. We cannot play 40 tournaments in a year.
So it's something more mentally. As I say, I lost the momentum a little bit, but try my best to get it back. I should say I'm quite confident that at one moment I will get it back. The other question is is it going to be this tournament or the next one?
Q. If you could go back in time and play this match again, what would you do differently?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: This match today?
Q. Yeah. What would you do?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Don't really see anything. I mean, there were some shots -- for example, I remember one point at 30-All, I think was like 3-All in the first set and I didn't put away an easy volley -- but 3-2, actually.
But it's just small moments. As I say, I did feel during the match that the momentum was on his side even if the match was really close. Actually, it was the same in the previous five matches. They were all really close, but I had the momentum.
Today it was on the other way, and I don't think I could have changed anything except just play better, which I tried and it didn't work out.
Q. Can you tell me something about the Italian moment in your opinion? Because we have Berrettini playing the first time the Masters. Sinner winning the NextGen where you were. Gaudenzi becoming chairman of the ATP. In 2021, Turin will have the ATP Finals. All these things together. Fognini winning his first slam [sic]. What do you think? How do you explain it? Coincidence?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Well, I'm not working in the Italian Tennis Federation to explain why suddenly it's like this. It's true, Sinner is playing unbelievable. He's just 18 years old. Of course he has to get experience and win the titles, big matches, but at this moment it seems like he's going to do it.
Matteo is also my age. First time in London. He had the same result as me yesterday. That's good. No. (Smiling.)
Amazing player. I remember playing him in Indian Wells when he was outside the top 100, and I was, like, This guy is playing unbelievable. He's proven this.
So Italians have always had good players, I think. Now they are going even better. We'll see what happens next.
Q. Do you feel that the way Stefanos played was different compared to your previous matches?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: I do not think so. I felt kind of the same game. I mean, tough game to play because he's a great player, but answering your question, I didn't feel any different. As I say, the most difference was inside of me.
Q. A quick word on Chris Kermode who is leaving the ATP. What kind of legacy do you feel he's left men's tennis?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: To be completely honest with you, I'm a little bit too young and not that long on the tour to talk about these political things. I have to know more about the structure, to know more about how decisions are made. And for this I think the best people to talk about this are players, talking about players are those who either were or are in the council.
So I can only say my opinion. I think Chris is a good guy. But again, talking about his professional achievements or abilities, I cannot talk much. I do think that he did a great job for tennis in general, looking on the way tennis is progressing as a sport, and hopefully it's going to be even better with Gaudenzi because that's what we players want.
We want to represent a great sport, want to help it get better. And of course we need people who hold the structure to help us.
