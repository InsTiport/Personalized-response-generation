THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You've thrown some coins in the direction of the umpire's chair at the end of the match.  What was the significance behind that?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: I was disappointed with the result of the match.  It was frustrating after a big win I had.  All the match was not going well for me.  So I was just very disappointing.
In the heat of the moment, I did a bad thing.  I apologize for this.
Yeah, I have nothing to say more.
Q. You were unhappy with one of the calls in the fifth set, is that correct, unhappy with the umpire as a whole?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Yeah, it happens in the match sometimes you are unhappy with the call.  Sometimes it's in your favor.  It happens.
Q. Did you ask for the umpire to be changed in the fifth set?  There's some suggestion that you called the supervisor.
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: I don't actually remember what I said.  It was a long match.  Was very hot out there.  So I actually don't remember what I said during the match.
Q. What was the significance of tossing the coins towards the chair?  What does it mean?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: I mean, as I said, I was just frustrated, so it has no meaning.  I apologize for this.
Q. You understand the interpretation of it would mean you perhaps thought the referee or the umpire was biased or had been bought?  Would that be the interpretation?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: I haven't thought about it.  And that's not the why I did it.
Q. So it wasn't meant as in...
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: No, not at all.  No, no.  I mean, it would be really stupid.
As I said, it was stupid, but it was not like this.
Q. You said you are apologizing.  Are you expecting some sort of comeback, some sort of punishment?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: That's not for me to decide also.  If there will be, that's my fault.
Q. Has anyone spoken to you from the referee's office at all?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Not yet.
Q. Have you sought the umpire out to apologize and the referee to apologize?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: I haven't seen her yet.
Q. Will you apologize personally to her?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: If I see her.
Q. Do you often take money onto the court?  Do you take coins onto the court?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: No.  It was just that I was packing my things and I saw my wallet.
As I said, in the heat of the moment, I did a stupid thing.  So I was ready to leave the court, but that's what happened.
Q. Did you have a choice?  Did you have a  Â£20 note or something heavier?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: I don't even remember what the coins were.
Q. How quickly after showing your frustration like that do you think, I wish I hadn't done that?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Straightaway.  It was a stupid thing to do.
Q. What did your coach and team say afterwards?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: We didn't talk yet because we're all disappointed.
Q. What was the significance of actually throwing the coins, though?  What was it meant to mean?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: As I said, it didn't mean -- it didn't mean to mean anything.  And I was just -- I don't know why I did it.  As I said, like, in the heat of the moment, I was frustrated to lose the match.  Maybe there were some bad calls.  It can happen in sports.
I was just disappointed and made a stupid thing.
Q. It wasn't meant to mean that she was being biased?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: As I said, no.  As I answered before, no, not at all.
Q. Obviously, there were a lot of overrules, weren't there, in that match?  How many do you think were bad calls?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Well, I didn't count.  I mean, I didn't count how many were there overrules and were they on my side or on his side.
Maybe in the match, during the match, I thought that it was a bit not in my favor.  But right now I can just say that it happens everywhere, in every sport.  Like there are referees, and they can make some mistakes.  But me as a tennis player, I do some mistakes, too.  One of them was, for example, after the match.  I just have to apologize.
Q. (Question regarding a bad game.)
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: It's not for me to decide.
THE MODERATOR: Do we have any further questions?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: About the match maybe (laughter).
Q. Thank you for coming in.
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Thank you.  Thank you also for coming in, all of you.
