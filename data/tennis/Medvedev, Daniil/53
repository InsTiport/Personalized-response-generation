D. MEDVEDEV/H. Dellien
6-3, 7-5, 5-7, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Talk about the match, your thoughts on how you played.
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Yeah, well, was not easy. I think first thing that is tough is the change of the weather from yesterday to today. Yesterday was really humid, kind of cold. Today was hot. I found it dry.
So was tough to feel the ball, especially yesterday where everybody was 10 hours in the locker room waiting for the matches. Was not an easy match with ups and downs.
The moment when I thought I had it, I started cramping. But, I mean, I'm just happy to finally win it and be in the next round.
Q. Presumably you'll be playing tomorrow.
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Tomorrow night, which is good for the recovery. If not, I said straight after the match, cramps is not an injury. You just need to relax, to have a good sleep. Usually your body -- I mean, we're sportsmen. Your body reacts good the next day.
At this moment I'm tired, but looking forward for tomorrow I think it should be okay.
Q. Are you still feeling really good vibes coming off of the last several weeks? Tempting to look into the second week and think what if?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: I'm trying to take it match by match. Of course, as everybody says, before the tournament I was one of the favorites. Probably unconsciously I was looking in the second week, at the draw.
As I said, I'm trying to convince myself to look at match by match. I have a tough one tomorrow against Feliciano, playing good this season again. Never tired.
Talking about the match today, as I said, with its up-and-downs, not really great level of play I think. But the most important is to win these kind of matches. That actually can give you a lot for the next rounds.
