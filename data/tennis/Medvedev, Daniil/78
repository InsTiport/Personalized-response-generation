D. MEDVEDEV/P. Lorenzi
6-3, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How do you feel after the win?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: I feel very good.  I mean, I'm happy.  I came through quallies.  Play really good tennis here.  Don't give a lot of chance to my opponents.  I'm happy to be in the semifinals.
Q. You're on a five-match winning streak.  Only lost one set in all that time.  How do you feel going into the semifinal tomorrow?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: As I said, I feel quite confident, but at the same time, I know that Fabio is amazing player.  I lost to him once last year.
So it's going to be a tough battle, and I will try to be the winner.
Q. Looking sharp today on court.  Are you able to carry some of that form with you in tomorrow's match?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Yes.  I'm playing good now, and I just hope to not lose it until tomorrow.
Q. Fabio had a pretty long game today, almost three hours.  He's feeling a little fatigued.  Will you look to exploit that tomorrow?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Well, I could say the same about me yesterday, but finally I won today (smiling).  So it's not a big deal.
I know Fabio.  I know he's very strong physically.  It's not going to be the main part tomorrow, but let's see maybe how it goes tomorrow.
Q. There were a couple of hot days earlier on in the tournament.  How are you adjusting to conditions now?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: I feel much better when it's not so hot (smiling).  I played, I think -- yeah, I played one qualifying match when it was, like, plus 42 this day.  It was the hardest match.  Finally, it was my opponent who got heat stroke or something like this, so I won because of this.  But it was not easy to play in these conditions.
