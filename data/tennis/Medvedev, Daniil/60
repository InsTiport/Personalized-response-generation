THE MODERATOR: With his runner-up performance, Daniil will move up to a career high No. 8 in the ATP rankings tomorrow, and will become the No. 1 Russian player, as well.
Questions in English.
Q. You said yesterday there's a different pressure playing against one of the big three.  Did you feel that pressure today?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Actually not that much because I played Roger two times, Novak four times.  I knew how it's going to be.  I was kind of ready for it.  Then didn't manage to probably show my best tennis, but at the same time Rafa was I think incredible today.
I need to see the match on the TV to say for sure, but congrats to him.  I need to do better next time.
Q. You've won a few tournaments the past year, year and a half.  Given this is your first Masters 1000 final, the way you played, making a lot of new fans, would you put this tournament as one of your best-ever tournaments?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Yeah, I think it's one of two best tournaments I've played in my life.  One was basically of course Tokyo, the only ATP 500 I won at this moment.  Of course, to be in the final of a Masters 1000, I mean, it's an amazing achievement for me at this moment.
Of course I always say this:  if you don't win the tournament, you are always disappointed.  Even if you lose in a final of a Grand Slam, you will be disappointed.
Of course, I'm happy to be in this final.  I will try to do better next time.
Q. Can you talk about what you were trying to do tactically versus Rafa.  Does it feel different when you're getting a ball from each of the big three?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Yeah, first of all, each of the big three are totally different.  In fact, I need to say every player is different.  Every player you play has special shots.  Especially regarding how many Grand Slams, how many Masters the big three won, they have something better than all of us.
Of course, it's tough to play.  It was tough to play Rafa.  My tactic was to not give him that much time, to try to play deep, to not give him easy shots.  It was kind of working in the beginning of the match, but then I completely lost the momentum.  It was only him controlling the play, controlling the game.
Even a few moments in the match I tried to not come back but win one game, see how it goes, the moment I was close, he just played too good.  That's how it went.
Q. Did you feel with the slices, with the topspin, was it tougher for you than, for example, in the semifinal with Karen?  It's a more straightforward approach, more bang-bang?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Yeah, as I said before, it's not only the slice or the topspin, because everybody of top 100 knows how to slice or do the topspin.
As I said, regarding how many Grand Slams, Masters these guys won, they have something inside of them, in their game, better than all of us.  Of course, we need to do our best to try to still beat them.  I mean, that's my goal.
Every match I play, that's my goal, to win.  That was my plan today, to go on the court to win.  Finally only won three games, but I will be better next time.
Q. Do you believe the gap is closing with you and the big three, that you can definitely crack those guys, become one of the best?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Yeah, I think I gained experience by playing these matches.  Novak, for example, I finally managed to beat him this year, not on my best surface.  It was the fourth time I played him.  I was getting closer and closer from what I was feeling.  Finally I beat him.
I think I just need to go further in the tournaments, to play them more, and that's how I will find my rhythm and my tactic to beat them more.  This moment I only have one victory.
Q. I know your diet has improved over the past year.  You still have a sweet tooth.  After a big tournament, do you treat yourself to sweet cake?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Well, I love sugar.  It can be tough on me during the tournament.  I mean, probably one small cake won't change my result of today's match or yesterday's.  That's what I'm trying to do.  I'm trying to be professional.  I'm trying not to do it.
Yeah, probably tonight I'm going to celebrate with a dessert, I don't know, tiramisu, panna cotta.  I don't care, just give me sugar.
Thank you very much, guys, for this week.
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.
Q. The first rally in the beginning of the match was very long.  You ended up winning it.  You had a breakpoint also later.  After that, what happened?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: It's difficult to tell.  It's difficult to say if it's only Rafa who played incredibly well, which is true, or did I play bad.  It's difficult to say.
In the first game, he started off very well.  I had breakpoints.  Even if I didn't win them, it was a good beginning for the match.  But after during the match, my energy started decreasing progressively.
I can only say congratulations, Rafa.  He did everything he had to do to beat me easily.  I need to do better next time.
Q. Finalist this week, what will you keep from this week here in Montreal?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: At this stage of my career, I believe it's the best week ever.  My level during all the matches was extremely good.  Of course, I would have liked to do better today, but it happens.  I will take experience from this match.  I will try to do better next time.
Of course, I have to do everything good that I did this week, to repeat it other times.
Q. You were saying a loss is not what you wished for, but still is Montreal going to have an important place in your mind?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Yes, it was my first final in a Masters 1000.  It was a beautiful week with all the fans who appreciated me from the first match on.  Every time I was speaking French, it was funny, everyone started loving me.  I'm sure that Montreal will be one of my favorite tournaments.  I hope it's going to last for all my life.
