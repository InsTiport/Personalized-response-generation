S. WAWRINKA/D. Medvedev
6-2, 2-6, 4-6, 7-6, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You were up two sets to one. Did you expect him to play so well? He said he never played well since the surgery he had.
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: That's tough to hear. I would be happy if it was next tournament he played like this.
He was playing really well. I think I did a good job to make it two sets to one. I had some opportunities in the fourth set. Didn't have breakpoints, but was really close in many games.
But Stan played good, served amazing. I think was a tight battle where first and fifth set he was really better than me. Second and third, I was better. Fourth was kind of the deciding set, let's say, where he was really good on the tiebreak.
Great play. Not so... After a loss I'm not disappointed too much. Here I'm like I did my best. Of course, I could do some shots better. But he played a great match. I wish him only luck for the rest of the tournament.
Q. Was he physically better than you in the fifth?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: I don't think so. I think it was just the tennis. He was better than me in tennis. The first game he played at 0-0 is unbelievable. Straightaway he gets a break. I think I had, like, four breakpoints to break back, but didn't manage to do it. He didn't make any mistakes, played good.
I don't think the physical conditions were the issue. I was still running good. I was chasing some tough balls. As I say, I think it's more about tennis.
Q. You haven't had much luck with five-set matches.
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: It's true.
Q. Do you know why? Anything you can do differently in the future?
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: Yeah, I mean, all the matches were different. All the matches were different. Of course, feels not good to never win one. Well, I'll probably have many more opportunities.
As I say, just talking about today's match, it's not about physical conditions or even mental. As I say, for me it's just that both players did a great match, and he was better than me today. I couldn't do much. I could maybe serve even little bit better, that's the only thing. It's tough.
I served better than all the three matches before. Hopefully I will maybe at one moment - you know how it is in life, things turn - maybe next five-set matches I will win. Me, I try to do my best all the time.
Q. Young tennis players have trouble going to the fifth set. Statistically the young players have more trouble to win the five-setters.
DANIIL MEDVEDEV: I think from one side, it's normal. Experience is the key in many things. Of course, the more five-set matches you play, the more experience you gain, even if you lose them. After, of course, if you're up two sets to zero, you try to win in three sets, not make it to five.
As I say, me, I don't like to play five sets. I get tired. Even though I'm there, I want to win it. As I say, at this moment, didn't win one in my life. We'll try better next time.
