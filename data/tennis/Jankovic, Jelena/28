THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Seemed to have a bit of trouble with your forehand early today.   Any reasons for that?  
JELENA JANKOVIC:   Yeah, I don't know.   Especially in that first set I framed a lot of forehands, and, you know, especially some of those short balls.  
I had a game point at 5‑All, and as well missed, you know, one of the forehands, you know, wide.   
I think, you know, just I wasn't moving the feet enough and wasn't setting up for the ball very well.  
That's why I was not hitting so clean or so solid.   But it happens.  
   
 Q.   Just wanted you to sum up your Australian Open.   I know you're very disappointed right at the moment, but how do you feel?  
JELENA JANKOVIC:   Yeah, I mean, what can I say?   It's obviously disappointed when you lose especially ‑‑I mean, it was tough.   I mean, these last three rounds I played, I was fighting, I was not playing, you know, my best tennis, but I was in there.  
Then today, you know, I felt a few points here and there if I stayed‑‑ you know, if I was a little bit smarter a little bit, you know, fitter, at times I would do much better.   But it didn't go my way.  
So overall, I mean, it's okay.   You know, of course it could have been better.   I thought I was going to go further, but that's life.  
   
 Q.   Would you have been happy with another fourth Japanese in a row?   Might have helped.   
JELENA JANKOVIC:   I could have, if I played in Japan maybe, but here in Australia, no.
