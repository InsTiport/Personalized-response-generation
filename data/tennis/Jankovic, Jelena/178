   THE MODERATOR:  Questions.   
  
  Q.  You must be very pleased.  Unexpected to get this far?   
 JAMIE MURRAY:  I don't know.  I guess mixed doubles is a bit of a lottery.  I guess a lot of it depends how the girl plays and stuff.  She obviously plays very well.  That's probably the reason we're still here.   
 JELENA JANKOVIC:  Not really.  I'm trying my best.  You know, I'm really enjoying playing this mixed doubles.   
 I'm actually surprised, sometimes I come up with some pretty good shots.  My volleys, it's not usual.  But I'm just trying to enjoy it.  We'll try to go as far as possible.   
  
  Q.  New partnership.  Do you think it's coming together each match?   
 JAMIE MURRAY:  Yeah.  Well, I guess today was probably our best match I think.  We got better each day.  Hopefully tomorrow we'll be even better.   
  
  Q.  Do you think it's a shame you don't get a chance to play more mixed?   
 JAMIE MURRAY:  I don't know if she could handle any more.   
 JELENA JANKOVIC:  I don't know if I could handle him (laughter).   
  
  Q.  Looked like he was really making you laugh during the tiebreak.   
 JELENA JANKOVIC:  He always does.  I make a mistake.  He goes, Give me a smile.  He's always trying to make me -- it's very important to stay positive, so it's a good thing.   
 It's good to keep your partner -- you don't need to get down on yourself.  It's kind of motivate each other.  It's good for both of us.   
  
  Q.  How hard was it to pick yourself up after losing earlier in the day?   
 JAMIE MURRAY:  It wasn't a problem.  We obviously didn't perform as well as we wanted to.   
 Yeah, in the mixed doubles, possible chance to win a Grand Slam title, so obviously you're going to be fired up to try and do that.   
 JELENA JANKOVIC:  Ran for dropshots, lobs, everything.   
  
  Q.  Do you think you could win it?   
 JAMIE MURRAY:  I don't know.  I don't see why not.  I don't think there's any real like favorites or anything like that in mixed doubles.  I mean, Bogo and South won the other day against Bryan and Raymond who were No. 1 in the world.   
 JELENA JANKOVIC:  We beat the No. 3.   
 JAMIE MURRAY:  We did.  That's good work, isn't it?  I don't see why if we kicked them out we can't progress further.  Is that a good quote there?   
  
  Q.  Are you surprised at what Venus has done here?  What is the feeling among players?   
 JELENA JANKOVIC:  No, people ask me before who do you think are the favorites for this tournament.  I always put Venus in there.  She has won this tournament three times, if not more.  Her game is really great for this surface.   
 She played some great tennis in the last two weeks.  I think she has a big chance to win the whole thing.  I wish her good luck.   
 But I'm really disappointed.  I should be not in this press conference.  I should be playing right now (laughter).  When I went to the locker room, I was watching the match Justine, Bartoli, I said, That's my spot.  I should be there.   
 But that's life.  Have to move on.  Forget about it.  Enjoy my mixed doubles.   
  
  Q.  Do you know what your schedule is now?  Do you play twice tomorrow?   
 JAMIE MURRAY:  Hopefully, yeah.   
 JELENA JANKOVIC:  If we win, we have to play two.   
  
  Q.  It's the first time you've played mixed doubles.  Do you think you'll play again after this tournament?   
 JAMIE MURRAY:  Yes (laughter).   
 JELENA JANKOVIC:  Now another proposal.  He keeps coming with it each time.   
 No, I will see.  I would love to play mixed doubles at the US Open.   
 JAMIE MURRAY:  With me?   
 JELENA JANKOVIC:  We'll see.  I will try.  Just for me it's very difficult because I play a lot of singles.  It can be sometimes very tiring to play both.  I try to save my energy for singles.   
 JAMIE MURRAY:  That's why I'm running for all the dropshots.   
 JELENA JANKOVIC:  Okay, if he will do that, I will play with him.   
 JAMIE MURRAY:  Loads of conditions.   
  
  Q.  You obviously want to hang on to her as a mixed doubles partner.   
 JELENA JANKOVIC:  Doesn't want to let go.
