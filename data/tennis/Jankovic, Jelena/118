J. JANKOVIC/A. Sugiyama
  6-4, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. What were your thoughts on the match today? 6-4. 6-4 scoreline. 
 JELENA JANKOVIC: Today was a tough match. I thought I competed much better than in my previous two rounds. 
 Ai is a tough opponent. She doesn't really give me any free points. She fights very well and is a very solid player. I had to work for every point. Just happy to get through this kind of match.

 Q. She was getting some treatment during the match. Does that put you off at all? 
 JELENA JANKOVIC: No, not really. Because I was just focusing on myself. At that time when she took that break, time-out, and received the treatment, I was just thinking about what I had to do in order to finish up that set and what was my game plan and how I need to continue. It didn't put me off at all.

 Q. You were taking off your shoes and just slipping with the heat, was it?
 JELENA JANKOVIC: Yeah, it was very warm out there. The court is so hot, and also the soles of my shoes are very hot as well. It's normal for it to be -- I feel like I'm on fire, you know. 
 So every time I had a chance, I took my shoes off to cool off. That's basically it.

 Q. So the air conditioners haven't arrived for your shoes yet?
 JELENA JANKOVIC: Maybe in ten years time they'll make that.
