   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 

 Q.  How would you assess your level of play today?  You feel like you got what you wanted out of the first round? 
 JELENA JANKOVIC:  The first rounds are always tough, and especially in the windy conditions, you're not -- you have to be really focused and really try to move your feet. 
 That's what I did today, so I'm really glad with my performance today, despite the conditions, I'm happy to get through. 

 Q.  Can you read anything into today's result - Love and 2 - but do the conditions make it just too difficult to think, oh, look, I can do this or that for the next match? 
 JELENA JANKOVIC:  No, no, no.  The conditions are the same for both of us, but sometimes it's more difficult to play in this kind of conditions because the ball moves around, and so sometimes you'll miss some of the shots that you normally don't miss or to go in a certain direction, which you didn't want it to goings.  But that's the game, and that's the challenge that we have.
