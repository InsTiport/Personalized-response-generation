 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. You come in here quickly. You seem in a hurry. Have you got an exciting evening planned that you're not telling us about?
 JELENA JANKOVIC: No, I don't have any dates or something. (Laughter.)
 No, I just really want to get all my, you know, things related to tennis and do the press and get everything done so I can have a nice massage, have a nice dinner, and, you know, relax.
 You know, I really want to get all this done so I can really have a, you know, nice time with my mom and, you know, with the people that are here with me.

 Q. What do you and your mom do in the evenings?
 JELENA JANKOVIC: Well, you know, I think not with just my mom here. It's with my sparring partner, as well, and I have as well some friends. We just, you know, have a nice dinner, you know, chat, talk, and we all have some laughs, and I think that's good. You know, it's some positive energy.

 Q. Is it that you played better or she played bad?
 JELENA JANKOVIC: I think that I really played well tonight. I was really going after my shots, and I really felt confident out there.
 I felt that I was hitting the ball very solid, very clean, and I was really moving my feet, so I didn't really give her a chance to play, to play her tennis.
 She can hit a big ball, especially off of the forehand, and I didn't really allow her to do that, so I really put my game out there. So I kind restricted her from doing her thing. Overall I was very pleased with my performance, and hopefully I can continue like this.
