S. HALEP/J. Jankovic
  6‑1, 6‑2

Q. Bit of a tough match tonight. Talk me through it.
JELENA JANKOVIC: Yeah it was a tough match. Simona played really well and was very solid and was not making any mistakes.
I was a little bit flat on my side. I think I was a little bit tired mentally and physically. I had a long week and played quite a lot of matches.
I mean, anyway it was a good week for me and great preparation for the US Open. I just don't think I was at my level today and she was really good.
So credit to her.

Q. But you've always played so well here in Cincinnati and your run has continued. What do you love so much about playing here?
JELENA JANKOVIC: I love the conditions. They really suit my game. I have a lot of support. You always love coming back to places you've played well, that you have had great results in the past.
This year was a great week as well. I played some good tennis, some really tough matches, and like I said, it was a great week of tennis for me. Gives me quite a lot of confidence before the US Open, which was my main goal, to get as many matches as possible and kind of compete out there at the high level.
Even though today I wasn't at my level and I didn't play a great match, I can take some positives out of this match and this week and move on and improve. 
So I have next week to practice and prepare and fine tune my game, work on some things, get better, and hopefully I will be in even better form for the Open.

Q. Last question. What have you got planned for the next few days? Are you heading to Florida or going to straight to New York?
JELENA JANKOVIC: I will go to San Diego for a few days, and then I will probably go to New York and train on those courts and adapt to the conditions.
