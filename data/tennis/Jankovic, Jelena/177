   THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 

 Q.  How did you manage to raise your game, you particularly, Jamie, given your medical timeout in the quarters?  You actually raised your level at Centre Court. 
 JAMIE MURRAY:  Yeah, we played well.  I think we were pretty tired after we played our first match.  But I think that almost helped us because we were pretty relaxed.  We went out there, were loose.  We actually played really well. 

 Q.  Can you just talk about the nature of the injury, what the problem was. 
 JAMIE MURRAY:  I don't know what I did.  I kind of hit like a shot in an awkward place.  My foot sort of slipped a bit.  It was okay.  I got it taped up. 
 I didn't really feel it at all in the match there.  It's fine. 

 Q.  It's not a concern? 
 JAMIE MURRAY:  I don't think so. 

 Q.  You seemed to be having an awful lot of fun out there.  John Lloyd said he'd never seen anyone laugh in the middle of a rally before. 
 JELENA JANKOVIC:  I'm so tired (laughter). 
 JAMIE MURRAY:  Yeah, we had fun.  We seem to get along pretty well.  I think that's probably one of the main reasons we're in the final, to be honest, because we have a lot more chemistry than any of the other teams that we play against and stuff. 
 I think, yeah, that's a big reason for us being in the final. 

 Q.  Did you know you weren't actually a member of the last eight club until you won that one? 
 JAMIE MURRAY:  No, I didn't.  I thought it was after we won that match today. 
 JELENA JANKOVIC:  So now we are? 

 Q.  Now you are.  Rule changed in 2001 apparently. 
 JAMIE MURRAY:  You get a badge for life. 
 JELENA JANKOVIC:  Oh, really? 
 JAMIE MURRAY:  She doesn't seem so impressed (laughter). 
 JELENA JANKOVIC:  After you play six sets, what do you expect from me? 
 JAMIE MURRAY:  A smile because we're in the final maybe. 
 JELENA JANKOVIC:  I gave you a hundred million smiles today.  Isn't that enough?  Need to give me a break sometimes (laughter). 

 Q.  Can you talk about the experience of Centre Court particularly, being out there in such a big match. 
 JAMIE MURRAY:  I think it felt different 'cause the roof and stuff wasn't there.  It felt so open. 
 But, yeah, we enjoyed it.  At least I think we did. 
 JELENA JANKOVIC:  It was different.  You know, we were playing on the smaller courts, and then we came on Centre Court.  It's a huge court.  You know, it's a great atmosphere to play there.  I really enjoyed it. 
 We are in the finals, and hopefully we can enjoy it tomorrow and maybe come up as winners.  It would be nice. 

 Q.  Where you a bit disappointed there weren't more people at the beginning, before the atmosphere really warmed up? 
 JAMIE MURRAY:  I don't know.  I don't know what the deal was.  I guess they started letting in the public who didn't have tickets kind of midway through the match and stuff. 
 It was still a good atmosphere.  Obviously, everybody wanted us to win, which is a good thing also. 

 Q.  Now that you're obviously so close to a Wimbledon title, is it still going to be easy to stay relaxed, stay happy, keep that vibe going? 
 JAMIE MURRAY:  I think so, yeah, because it's not so intense, you know.  I mean, we never get to play mixed doubles.  It's not like our career or anything like that. 
 I'm sure we'll be fine tomorrow.  But, I mean, we'll obviously want to win and stuff.  But, yeah, I'm sure we'll do the same as we've done in all the other matches. 

 Q.  You kind of see this as a bonus, an amazing bonus? 
 JAMIE MURRAY:  Yeah, of course.  When I got to Wimbledon on the first Monday, I didn't expect that I'd be playing a match on Centre Court on Sunday, especially in mixed doubles. 
 JELENA JANKOVIC:  I didn't know what I got into, as well. 
 JAMIE MURRAY:  She didn't know what she got into when she agreed to play. 

 Q.  Are you aware you could become the first British champion in 20 years, the first person to have a title here since Bates and Durie? 
 JAMIE MURRAY:  They were the last to win.  They won the mixed doubles.  I guess that will be our motivation.  You'll be Jo Durie. 

 Q.  Doesn't mean that much to you, by the sound of it. 
 JAMIE MURRAY:  We're delighted to be in the final.  A Wimbledon final is a Wimbledon final.  I mean, yeah, we'll be going out to win.  If we do, then yeah, it's great. 

 Q.  I understand Andrew has been in touch by text message. 
 JAMIE MURRAY:  Not yet.  Still waiting (smiling). 

 Q.  He sent a message to your mother. 
 JAMIE MURRAY:  Okay, I haven't spoken to her. 

 Q.  What was the process of you guys getting together? 
 JAMIE MURRAY:  Well, I think I was fortunate that she agreed to play, to be honest.  I just asked her.  We kind of turned up at the same time in the morning.  I don't know when it was, Tuesday maybe. 
 JELENA JANKOVIC:  It was meant to be, I think. 
 JAMIE MURRAY:  Destiny. 
 JELENA JANKOVIC:  Yeah, what are the odds we're going to show up at the same time in the morning? 
 JAMIE MURRAY:  Yeah. 
 JELENA JANKOVIC:  I agreed.  I didn't make a mistake, so I'm happy. 
 JAMIE MURRAY:  You thought you did at the time. 
 JELENA JANKOVIC:  I thought I did, but...  First try, being in the finals, it's really amazing. 

 Q.  Do you think your partnership will do something for Anglo-Serbian relations? 
 JAMIE MURRAY:  That is the most interesting question I've heard so far. 
 JELENA JANKOVIC:  What did he say?  I didn't understand. 
 JAMIE MURRAY:  I didn't know we had a bad relationship. 
 JELENA JANKOVIC:  What kind of relationship? 

 Q.  Do you think it will help culturally? 
 JELENA JANKOVIC:  I think none of these things are for the newspapers.  I think it's better to keep it. 

 Q.  In the context of brotherly rivalry, what does it mean to you to have reached a Wimbledon final before Andrew? 
 JELENA JANKOVIC:  He's going to be jealous, big time (laughter). 
 JAMIE MURRAY:  I hope so.  I guess nobody thought I would get to a Wimbledon final before him.  But it happens, so...  He'll have to work harder. 

 Q.  Is it true you've invited Jelena to Scotland for Christmas? 
 JAMIE MURRAY:  Yes, it is true (laughter). 

 Q.  Is this the first you heard of the invitation? 
 JAMIE MURRAY:  When I asked you. 
 JELENA JANKOVIC:  I heard it before.  I didn't think he meant it seriously.  Now it's serious (laughter).  Okay, I'll think about it. 
 JAMIE MURRAY:  She's playing hard to get. 
 JELENA JANKOVIC:  He's trying too hard, though.  But we're having a lot of fun.  It's a great game that we are playing.
