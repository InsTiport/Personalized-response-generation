THE MODERATOR:  First question for Jelena, please. 
 
 
Q.  6-1, 6-4, it looks easy.  Was it easy on the court?
 
JELENA JANKOVIC:  It wasn't easy on the court.  The first set I played well, I didn't make many mistakes.  I won it 6-1.  But then she went to the bathroom when we finish the set, so I little bit got -- I cooled off and I was down 3-love in the second.  Then I came back and was 4-3, 4-4, 5-4 and took the set.  But it wasn't easy match.  
 
Q.  Also, second last point, you took the racquet.  What happened? 
 
JELENA JANKOVIC:  Yeah, my grip was wet from playing and my hand was also all sweaty.  So I served and I was loose, so it just flew and on the court.  But I was not happy about that.  It was a big point, and it just went out of my hand.  
 
Q.  The next opponent, your second round?
 
JELENA JANKOVIC:  I don't know.  I didn't see.  I'm just happy with this win.  It's my first win over a Top 10 player, so we'll see.  
 
Q.  Is this your biggest win in your career?
 
JELENA JANKOVIC:  Yeah, it's my first win over a Top 10 player so it's my biggest win for now.  
 
Q.  Do you have good memories from last year here? 
 
JELENA JANKOVIC:  Yeah, last year I qualified here and lost in second round against Amanda Coetzer.  I lost 6-4 in the third.  But it was my first Grand Slam last year, so I did a good job.  I played five matches, I lost to Amanda.  But this year, you know, I won over a Top 10 player so it's better, and I'm still looking forward to the next matches.  Also, like in 2001, I won my junior title here so I have very good memories here in Australia, in Melbourne.
