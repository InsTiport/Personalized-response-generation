6-1, 6-1

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Good second match for you?
 JELENA JANKOVIC: Yes. It was a good match for me. I was very focused from the beginning. I played quite aggressive, and I'm very pleased with my performance.

 Q. Did you expect such an easy match today?
 JELENA JANKOVIC: No, I didn't expect an easy match. She's a great player, and I knew I had to play really good tennis if I wanted to win.

 Q. We saw you have some problems in the match against Pennetta. How are you feeling now?
 JELENA JANKOVIC: Yes, I've been sick for now one week and I've been struggling a little bit. I have problems breathing. I'm still on antibiotics and trying to recover and try to get healthy. 
 We will see. I'm trying my best on the court.

 Q. So now you're focus again to win again this title?
 JELENA JANKOVIC: Yes, I would like to. I have very tough opponents ahead of me. I will fight very hard and I will fight for every point, and then we will see at the end what will happen.

 Q. Were you surprised with upset of Ivanovic?
 JELENA JANKOVIC: Yes, I was surprised. She was playing an opponent that she should have won, but everybody has bad days. 
 We are not machines and we cannot play very good every time, so it can happen. 

 Q. A curious question about the color of your fingernails. You change every match, it's true?
 JELENA JANKOVIC: No, not every match. But I like to paint my nails for my matches, and off court as well. 
 I just like to be a girl and I like to look feminine, so why not?
