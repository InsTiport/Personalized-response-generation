THE MODERATOR: Let's start with questions in English, please.
Q. How was the form? What do you think about the format of this new Davis Cup and how do you feel playing these first matches?
MATE PAVIC: If you ask me, I think it's not really Davis Cup anymore. It's a different competition, obviously. And I'm not saying it's bad. I think it's good. But there are things to improve. A lot of things.
I think there is a lot of matches been going on during the day -- throughout the whole day, sorry, the morning sessions, the night sessions. I think everything is kind of going for too long. Players are finishing quite late, especially the matches go long, to play the day after and stuff like that.
Obviously it's the first year. There are a lot of things to improve. It's -- I would say it's just a different kind of competition, yes.
THE MODERATOR: Anymore questions in English? Let's move into the local language.
