THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
   
 Q.   First title, a Masters title.   How does it feel?   
MARCELO MELO:   It feels great.   A great opportunity to come here in the Masters in Shanghai and play like we play since the first match.   Have a couple tough matches against Roger in the first match, the Bryans.   We are happy to win here in Shanghai.   
   
 Q.   Talking about the match, how did you regroup for the super tiebreaker?   
MARCELO MELO:   The match tiebreaker, when we stopped a little bit to thinking about it, we just lost like the last point in the tiebreak.   Was one really close ball.   We have beat the Bryans in the tiebreaker as well.   
We put out the confidence we had before.   It was good to put there the same way we did in the first and the semis.   
   
 Q.   Looking forward to the ATP World Tour Finals, you're third in the rankings.   Must be feeling good about your chances.   
IVAN DODIG:   Yeah, we feel good.   It's important for us.   We're looking forward to having another great experience after this title and play in the last eight teams in the Masters.   
We will for sure enjoy it over there and try to give the best on our court.   
   
 Q.   Winning in Shanghai, what's so special about this tournament?   
IVAN DODIG:   This tournament is like the best during the year of the ATP.   It's special for us.   Like I said, first title Masters Series here in Shanghai, which the tournament make possible everything for the players be comfortable.   We are really, really happy.
