J. VESELY/L. Saville
  6-0, 6-3

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Could you just sum up the match the way you saw it? It looked very easy in the scoreline, 6-Love, 6-3. Was that the way it was for you? 
 JIRI VESELY: Well, in the first set I was a little bit nervous before the match, because you go the first time to the center court before the Australian crowd. Was a little bit tough for me.
 But I think I start pretty well. I moved very good. Yeah, I won the first set 6-Love. But the second game I break him, but we played I think the game more than ten minutes. That was I think the big point where I start playing good and he was just a little bit, yeah, down. 
 Yeah, in the second set, he start better. He took a medical timeout, and then I came back and I play just unbelievable. 

 Q. What does it mean to you to win this championship? 
 JIRI VESELY: Yeah, it's unbelievable. It's something what you can't imagine before the tournament, because you go to the a Grand Slam tournament and you have to win six matches. You play against the best guys in the world. 
 Then if you are No. 1 seeded, then there is a little bit more pressure on you to play against the other guys.
 But I think I played really well this week. I didn't drop a set, what is unbelievable. Yeah, it's just amazing. 

 Q. And you expect the win will give you a lot more confidence for the next year and a couple years to come?
 JIRI VESELY: Yeah, of course. When you win a tournament like this, then you get a big confidence. You just feel so easy. Yeah, when you play the next tournament, then the other opponents, they have still more and more respect before you. 
 There are just four players in one year that can win a Grand Slam tournament, so it's just a special, special moment.

 Q. Luke was unseeded, and he said before that he was able to cause some upsets during this tournament and to progress to the final because he played a lot against men recently, and that helped him lift his game. Is that something you would be doing, do you think, a bit more often? 
 JIRI VESELY: Yeah. Of course I think Luke is a great player, because when you are playing final of a Grand Slam and you are one year younger than the other guys, then it's something very big. 
 I think that when you are playing men's tournaments, then you are getting better. You get the big experience. And then when you come to the junior tournaments, especially last week, and then came to play the final, then you get respect before the guys. 
 Yeah, I think that Luke was playing great tennis here. He beat very good guys, what is very good for him. I think that he can win maybe next year the Australian Open. 

 Q. Have you got any thoughts about when you might turn professional?
 JIRI VESELY: I have to work hard. It's still a very long way. You have to be fit still all the time. You have to work every day. I don't know how long I can be professional, but I will start this year with some future tournaments and we will see what will happen. 
 But I hope I can be a professional or playing with the top guys maybe in two, three years. That would be great. 

 Q. I was just checking, and it's been 12 years since a boy swept the singles and doubles. Did you know that?
 JIRI VESELY: No, I didn't know.

 Q. When you were coming into this was that a goal, or was it icing on the cake?
 JIRI VESELY: Yeah, when I play tournament, then I always want to win the tournament. So I was going into the tournament that I want to win singles, but then we start playing doubles. Then of course you go on the court with the think that you want to win the match.
 So we go match by match, and we won the tournament, what was great yesterday. Got me a little bit more confidence for the singles final.

 Q. Do you look at your idols like Ivan Lendl, Jan Kodes, Radek Stepanek, Tomas Berdych? What kind of idols did you have? 
 JIRI VESELY: Idols, yeah, Ivan Lendl and Jan Kodes, they were playing when I wasn't even on the world, so I don't know how they are playing. I know how they are playing, but it's other tennis now than was before.
 So now I think I have the idols Tomas Berdych that I'm practicing with him sometimes in my club, what's the best club in Czech Republic. There's everything what you can, massage, physio, so everything what you need to have. So think it's Tomas Berdych. 
 And then I like the game from Federer, because I was ten years old and he won the first Wimbledon title. So I just know the - or not that I know - but I was watching on the TV more and more tennis when was winning all the tournaments and all the majors , so I love his game, and I hope I can be once like him.
