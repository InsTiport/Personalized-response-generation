J. VESELY/J. Sousa
  6‑2, 6‑2, 7‑5

THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.

Q. Your assessment of the match. You had early breaks. 
JIRI VESELY: Definitely I played a good match from the beginning on till the end. I would say I was dominating the first two sets pretty much. I was more aggressive. I was definitely lucky that I got break the beginning of the first two sets. I had more confidence and more self‑belief. 
Obviously after the second set, to lead two sets to love is always nice. But still it wasn't easy to finish the match in three sets. This is my first fourth round. Of course, I had it in my mind. It wasn't easy. But at the end I was, again, more active and I got the break at the end. 

Q. What did you feel on the other side of the court? He seemed subdued. He was not his energetic self. 
JIRI VESELY: It's tough for the opponents because I'm serving very well here, which is definitely a big key of my game, my success so far. I knew I have to be active and aggressive because otherwise he will control the game. That's what I actually don't want, that the opponents will make me run. 
Yeah, I think that's what I was doing well today, that I was trying to control it, not be too passive. 
Yeah, I think the main thing is that I'm serving very well.
