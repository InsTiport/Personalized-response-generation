Q.  What happened today in your match? 

MARTINA HINGIS:  You saw it. 


Q.  Yes.  How did you feel? 

MARTINA HINGIS:  She played a good match.  I won the first set and I should maybe feel like this; then the next two sets, too, but I didn't, I changed my game and I played so badly. 


Q.  What do you mean you changed your game? 

MARTINA HINGIS:  Play more powerful with everything on the court. 


Q.  Was there a problem adjusting in the second set? 

MARTINA HINGIS:  What? 


Q.  The second set? 

MARTINA HINGIS:  I changed my rackets and everything. I couldn't find my timing and the groundstrokes? 


Q.  Did you underestimate her? 

MARTINA HINGIS:  Maybe a little bit. 


Q.  What made you underestimate her, you think? 

MARTINA HINGIS:  Her ranking is not that great and also she won the qualifyings and the first round, shouldn't do that, but in the last time I won good matches against Japanese girls, but she has a different game. 


Q.  What was it about her game that gave you trouble? 

MARTINA HINGIS:  She could play very high groundstrokes.  She can play very good.  She could open the court. 


Q.  What can you take away from a loss like this -- 

MARTINA HINGIS:  We'll see. 


Q.  -- besides bad feelings? 

MARTINA HINGIS:  I have to train more and make better practice. 


Q.  Is there anything specific that you need to work on from this match? 

MARTINA HINGIS:  Yes, I mean especially the groundstrokes and the serves, she returns very good, but normally not every girl can return that great like her today, but the serve was not that great.
