Q. Your thoughts on the match tonight; how you played?

MARTINA HINGIS: Well, I think it was a very good start. We both played very well. Well,
I hope it was an entertaining match for the spectators too. We had very long rallies and
it was, yeah, quite a work out today, especially in the beginning.

Q. Seem to have more patience than her in the rallies. Did that help you out?

MARTINA HINGIS: Well, I tried to always be on top of the rally which I most of the time
was able to be and then I was waiting for my chances and later on when she got a little
bit shorter and I tried to come in, that was probably the key of the game that I was able
to come in, put a little bit more pressure on her and just finish up quicken those rallies
too.
