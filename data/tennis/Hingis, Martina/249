Q. You lost your first set and last two matches just because you start slow or --

MARTINA HINGIS: I trained in the morning, and I was playing well in the morning.
Patricia wasn't playing particularly well, and I was making a lot of mistakes with my
forehand. In the last two sets I was feeling more certain about myself. It was also
extremely hot and I have a little cold so I wasn't really thinking clearly.

Q. You are through this round now. Are you feeling more comfortable despite the heat
and despite the cold, are you feeling more comfortable here at this tournament and have
you set a destinational goal for yourself in this tournament?

MARTINA HINGIS: This is my first time going so far in a Grand Slam tournament. I have
gotten to the third round. I knew that when I saw the draw that I have the chances. In the
second round when I played Magdalena, I knew it would be difficult game, but I thought I
had chances and I think there are good possibilities for me in the next match.
