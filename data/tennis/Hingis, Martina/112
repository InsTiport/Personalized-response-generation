MODERATOR:  Thank you so much for joining us.  We have a few selective writers on the conference call today.  One, just to have a quick chat with you, and to talk about your upcoming US schedule, which includes the State Farm Women's Classic in Scottsdale, the Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells, and the Nasdaq-100 in Miami.  Please go ahead and open it up to questions. 


Q.  Venus is set to become No.  1 at the end of next week.  I just wanted to get your thoughts on that.

MARTINA HINGIS:  I think she won the last two tournaments now, so it's a very close call there.  All those players, it can be one week Jennifer, one week Venus.  Hopefully, pretty soon I'll battle with them, too.

Q.  Do you think she may be there to stay or do you think the competition is still going to be pretty tough between all of them?

MARTINA HINGIS:  It's just the beginning of the year.  You still got, you know, the American tournaments coming up now.  After that, probably they'll be able to say more.

Q.  Just wondering, are the days of somebody having a really long stretch of being No.  1, do you think there are still players out there that can dominate that way and spend a long time at the top of the ranking?

MARTINA HINGIS:  Well, like I said, I think at this point there's lots of girls up front which are still playing great tennis.  So I think it gets more and more difficult, as you see in the men's game.  You don't have too many steady No.  1 players up there.  But, I mean, it was nice for me to be there for so long, like four years.  At this point it's hard to say.  I mean, like I said, the competition is getting stronger, so...

Q.  I wanted to ask you your thoughts on how you think your tennis has gone this year, how you're playing, how you think about your tennis game this year?

MARTINA HINGIS:  Well, I think I started off very well.  I mean, playing in Australia, I won the first tournament, then made the finals against Jennifer, won in Tokyo.  So I can be very happy about the starting.  Now I'm here in Florida practicing, getting ready for Scottsdale, Indian Wells and Miami.  So I feel very good.

Q.  Are there things you did in your off-time besides recovering from the injury to help your tennis more, whether it was fitness, on court, whatever?

MARTINA HINGIS:  It was mainly on court that little bit.  It was nice to be home for like almost three straight months.  I enjoyed that very much, been in the mountains, that gave me energy.  I was practicing a lot, too.  That paid off. 

Q.  What have you been doing pretty much since the Tokyo tournament finished? 

MARTINA HINGIS:  I was like a few days in Europe, and then I came here to Florida to get ready.

Q.  You're in Florida right now?

MARTINA HINGIS:  I'm in Florida right now, yes.

Q.  I mean, a lot has been made of Jennifer doing kick boxing, Tae-Bo.  Would you ever consider doing any of those things?

MARTINA HINGIS:  I did all of these things, too, when I was in Switzerland, like growing up, I had a few boxing lessons for almost like two years.  I do a lot of swimming, Tai Chi I used to do, too, a little bit.  Now for me I think is better to spend as much time as I can on the court and do stuff like rollerblading or also swimming, like certain things on the court, it's always great, it helps.  But tennis is my game, and that's what I can do the best.

Q.  There are a lot of people in tennis or people I've talked to that feel it's going to be very difficult for you to forget your loss to Capriati at the Australian Open; it was so close, must have been such a disappointing event that you're going to have a very difficult time putting that behind you. 

MARTINA HINGIS:  It went pretty well just the week after.  I didn't have such a tough time getting over it.  I won the week after that in Tokyo, beat Monica in the finals.  I can't be too disappointed about that loss.  I came very close.  Can't get closer than having four match points.  So I think I did better than expected. 

Q.  Do you feel then you've put this in your past already, I gather?

MARTINA HINGIS:  Yeah, somehow.  Like I said, I didn't expect myself playing that well coming off of an injury.  So, like I said, I won the first tournament, then did so well in the other two.  Here in Florida, it's just the beginning of the season, so there's plenty of chances hopefully ahead of me.

Q.  In looking back at that match, do you feel that you were defeated by your opponent or more by the heat, by the conditions there? 

MARTINA HINGIS:  It's both together.  I mean, if Jennifer wouldn't be playing that well, I'd still finish it hopefully somehow.  I mean, it's the same heat for both.  Can't blame it on the heat.  But, you know, it was a great match.  I got very close.  Just ended up a little bit better than I, in the third set especially.  She just had more to give.  Hopefully I get to play her some more and have many more great finals like that. 

Q.  Not to change the subject, but I'm fascinated by your remark that at one point in your life you took boxing lessons.  A number of women now engage in exercises related to boxing in which they hit the bags and so forth, but they don't actually get punched in the nose.  What was the nature of your boxing lessons? 

MARTINA HINGIS:  Oh, it was mainly also like in the room, not really in the ring.  It's just great for the fitness, like jump rope, just like two hours straight, you just always do something.  It's great for the stamina.  It's a great physical workout.  And got the speed and everything what you need for the tennis.

Q.  How did you regroup mentally going straight from Australia to Japan?

MARTINA HINGIS:  How did I what? 

Q.  How did you keep your focus going into Japan and winning so quickly then?

MARTINA HINGIS:  Probably just try to forget about it as soon as you can.  I mean, (inaudible) play that thing, I can be very happy about it.  Sometimes to believe in everything, just have to make it one more step.  I think there in Tokyo I had great chance, it was very fast surface, I was the No.  1 seed, so I had to prove myself over again.  That's what I did.  I tried to do my best.  I was playing very well at that point.  Against Monica, it was a great final.

Q.  Are you geared more toward each individual tournament or are you thinking more about the Grand Slams when you're doing your scheduling? 

MARTINA HINGIS:  For me it's like definitely for all the top players, the Grand Slams are very important, but also the upcoming tournaments.  Every tournament you play, I'm a competitor, so I always want to do well.  I always want to win, but you can't always win.  It's very difficult in this competition.  The next tournaments are very important to see how you do on hard court and also going into the clay tournaments in Europe.  But that's far ahead.  I mean, Indian Wells and Ericsson are big tournaments.  They're very important.  The Miami tournament, I didn't say the sponsor, right (laughter)? 

Q.  Could you talk a little bit about how the player/coach relationship with your mom has kind of evolved over the years and maybe how she helped you mentally coming back from the injury?

MARTINA HINGIS:  Oh, she was the most important person.  I mean, that's what you need at tough times when you have surgery, when you're injured.  You've got to have the right surroundings around you, otherwise you just never make it back.  That's very important.  I can always trust her and rely upon her.  Also what I can say about Mario.  That was just good to keep to the success I had early.

Q.  What would you tell maybe young players coming up that are coached by a parent in order to make those relationships kind of work?  What advice would you give them?

MARTINA HINGIS:  Well, you see that all the time.  I don't know, kids and their parents, just hang in there sometimes, you know.  There are difficult times.  For me, it was that I had success very early on.  Somehow it just came that I always loved the game.  So sooner or later, always like to come back and do well, even if you sometimes don't have like the highlights in your career.  But try to do the best you can, and even sometimes it's not going your way, you just always try to believe in yourself and work hard.

Q.  A lot was made about what Marcelo Rios said in Australia.  Could you still talk about the depth of women's tennis, particularly when you play those first four rounds of a Grand Slam, how it is now as opposed to maybe when you first hit the tour? 

MARTINA HINGIS:  I mean, every round you have to take serious.  I think it changed a little bit.  You have the 32 seeds now, and that makes the draw a little bit more open because for the Top 30 players I would almost say a level higher than the rest of us.  But you don't see the seeded player till third or fourth round.  That makes it maybe a little bit easier.  But I thought it was quite interesting to have the top 16, every now you had a tough first round.  I had my junior (inaudible) Razzano, she was the No.  1 junior in the world in the past.  I don't think I had the easiest first round.  I just came prepared and played well.  Now you just always have to be ready. 

Q.  What would you like to see change in your game or your approach this year?  Do you have any specific goals?

MARTINA HINGIS:  Well, I was already working on it during my off time, you know, just speed-wise, the top girls, you just have to play a hard game.  You just have to fight, even sometimes it doesn't work.  Kind of like physically, definitely I have to play with them all.  Now it's nice that I'm here in Florida and I can practice with the guys and also Jennifer sometimes.  So for me it's great practice.  But definitely speed-wise, that's the key in my game, just have the finesse and the anticipation.  But that comes with much experience.

Q.  Do you still enjoy tennis as much as you did when you first started, you were just getting going on the Pro Tour?  Are there things you like more or less?

MARTINA HINGIS:  Yeah, it was different.  I wasn't as nervous sometimes going into the matches when you're like 14 or 15 you just go into it, you're free, you have nothing to lose.  I don't feel like I have much to lose at this point.  But just go into it a little bit different.  More responsibility, you want to do better.  I look at it from a different view.  I think it's much better now.

Q.  What's much better now? 

MARTINA HINGIS:  I mean, it's a good game, I like it.  I mean, now I go into practices sometimes and I enjoy getting better.  Before I was sometimes like, "Okay, do the same old business."  But now it's more - I don't know, I just enjoy it more, especially coming off this injury and just prove myself again.

Q.  When were you feeling kind of stale?  Last summer before The Open?

MARTINA HINGIS:  I don't understand the question.

Q.  When did you feel it was just kind of business and not as fun?

MARTINA HINGIS:  I mean, last year when you know you go into tournaments and you know you're not in best shape, you kind of feel like, "Okay, those matches are going to be very hard to go through again, like the Williams sisters or Lindsay or Jennifer, and it's just going to be very hard to win."  But now I feel like I made another step in my game that I got better.  So I feel like I have the game to beat everybody. 

Q.  Were you a little bit embarrassed after you lost to Serena like you did at the US Open last year?

MARTINA HINGIS:  I mean, sometimes it happens.  I mean, I beat Venus in Australia the year before, and I beat her more than once.  Can't be embarrassed about it. 

Q.  But it hadn't happened to you like that in a big tournament. 

MARTINA HINGIS:  Well, it doesn't feel the greatest.  I mean, you just sometimes don't have the day.  But she was just better than me at that point.  But I knew it was very  -- I mean, I was happy to get into the semifinals.  I could have lost in the third round.  Later in the fall I got injured.  I knew, like I said, I wasn't playing the best tennis at that point.  And that's very hard to beat somebody like Serena.

Q.  After you got injured and your time in Switzerland and home, was that one of the matches where you thought, "I need to get in better shape because I never want to lose like that again"? 

MARTINA HINGIS:  Maybe a little bit, too, yeah, was part of it.  Just the whole season wasn't  -- I still made semifinals and played all right, but it wasn't like good enough.  The break probably did me well.  Now I feel like I'm playing better than before. 

Q.  You talk about coming back from injury.  Obviously, Lindsay is out now.  Anna has been hurt.  Are there more injuries now?  Is the game making the players more susceptible to injuries? 

MARTINA HINGIS:  Just the whole game got tougher, tougher on the body, too.  It's an all-year sport.  Play like 20, 22 tournaments a year.  Body is not like everlasting, so sometimes it gets a little difficult.  The way you practice, I haven't been really injured that much.  I think, you know, you just got to plan your own schedule and try not to get injured.  I can't really speak for the other girls.  But I know with me, it works pretty well. 

Q.  Speaking of that, I know there was talk after Jelena dropped out of the final against Venus, talking about trying to get a legislation or rule in now that if somebody drops out of the final, they can sort of bring in the lucky-loser or something.  Would you be in favor of that? 

MARTINA HINGIS:  Well, I haven't been there, so I don't know what exactly happened.  I heard of it.  Lucky-loser is not going to stay around for the whole week, so I don't know what they're thinking of.  But definitely it's disappointing for the tournament director not having a final.  But I don't know. 

Q.  Martina, were you planning to play doubles in Scottsdale?

MARTINA HINGIS:  In Scottsdale, I'm not planning on playing doubles. 

Q.  Anything in particular that you like or dislike about the tournament in Scottsdale?

MARTINA HINGIS:  Well, I was there a couple years ago, and I like the place, it's a beautiful resort.  It's a golfer's paradise, I guess.  It's nice for playing tennis in the tournament.  When I got there, we got rained out.  It rains like three days a year, and we got rained out in the finals against Lindsay.  It was a little disappointing.  Hopefully this year will be better.

Q.  How do you feel about the field, possibly Serena, Jennifer?

MARTINA HINGIS:  Yeah, it's a strong field.  I know Jennifer is playing.  I don't know the whole list, but it's big.  Knowing that everybody is there, it's great practice.

Q.  Do you have a favorite part in your American hard court schedule?

MARTINA HINGIS:  A favorite tournament or part? 

Q.  Yes. 

MARTINA HINGIS:  Well, I like these tournaments.  I like Indian Wells as much as I do Miami.  They're all a little different.  They have their own atmosphere, and the crowd, usually it's great.  So it's nice to play in front of all these people.

Q.  Do you find it sort of surprising that Scottsdale, at least at the very top, has a much stronger field than Indian Wells? 

MARTINA HINGIS:  I know that Indian Wells, for me I always love to play that tournament.  But I don't know why Scottsdale, I don't know, has better dates, or certain players like some tournaments better than others.  I don't know, I'm playing all of them, so don't ask me. 

Q.  Are you also playing doubles at Indian Wells?

MARTINA HINGIS:  Yeah, I'll play with Anna.  She's not playing in Scottsdale, so we'll play Indian Wells.

Q.  What do you like the most about that tournament in Indian Wells? 

MARTINA HINGIS:  I just love the site, you know, the mountains in the background, the new stadium, it's still a little rough, but now the last two years it's gotten better.  I always had quite some success there, so it was always nice to be at least in the semifinals.  Going back to the tournament, you say it's a good feeling.  I kind of like it because of the attendance of the people, men's and women's tournament, so it always attracts more people, big crowds. 

Q.  Just wondering maybe what your Nasdaq highlights are?  When you think of that tournament, what are the moments that stand out in your mind?

MARTINA HINGIS:  The few titles I had there.  Was it anything in particular about the two titles that made them special to you.  The one time, I think the first year I won, it's the week after I became No.  1.  That was one of the highlights.  The other time, just to have won any games, great feeling.

Q.  And will you play doubles with Anna there, too?

MARTINA HINGIS:  Yeah, I'll play doubles with Anna. 

Q.  You had your share of doubles partners.  Is there anything about the partnership with Anna that makes you think you click especially well?

MARTINA HINGIS:  Yeah, we just get along very well, and it's just a team where the team spirit works very well with her.  We're about the same age, have the same interests.  On the court, the chemistry has worked very well together. 

MODERATOR:  Martina, thank you so much for being on.  We really appreciate your time.  Good luck at the US tournaments this spring. 

MARTINA HINGIS:  Thank you very much. 

MODERATOR:  Thank you, everyone, for being on this.  I know the time was a little bit late.  I really appreciate you taking some time out to be a part of this teleconference.
