WTA: Questions in English. 


Q.  How did you feel out there today?

MARTINA HINGIS:  Pretty good.  I mean, I know Karina very well.  We practice a lot together.  It was kind of strange playing her already first match because we played like Hopman Cup.  We haven't played for a while.  It was like a practice for us because we knew where the shots are going to go.  We were like both waiting there sometimes already.   But it was a good match.  I think a good start to this tournament.
