VERONIQUE MARCHAL: Questions.  
 

Q.  You were pretty much laughing the whole game.  Looks like Monica was taking the game seriously.
 
MARTINA HINGIS:  They both were.  Can you imagine how embarrassing it is if you're the No.  1 doubles team in the world and you're behind 8-0; 6-0, 2-0.  You have no chance to get a game or make something.  There was this unbelievable rally when we made the first game.  Okay, we're happy, we made one game.  No more score 0-0.  
 
JANA NOVOTNA:  I make it short (laughter).  That was the long version.  The short version is, when we don't laugh and when we don't have fun, we play very bad.  So in order for us to play well, we need to enjoy it and have fun.  That's what we started to do finally in the middle of the second set.  It was almost too late, but we just made it. 
 
MARTINA HINGIS:  Just made it. 
 

Q.  Very uncommon in today's tennis to have fun, play good, and to win. 
 
JANA NOVOTNA:  It is?  
 

Q.  A rare case, you did it together? 
 
JANA NOVOTNA:  Yes, because we are nut heads.  No, I don't think it's very rare.  I think that a lot of players enjoying it.  Don't get us wrong.  I mean, even when we do have fun, we still are trying very hard and we are very serious in between the points.  You know, there were some great shots.  It was entertaining for all of the players and for the public.  So why not to laugh occasionally?  
 

Q.  I'd like to know about your spare time.  How did you spend your spare time in Miami?
 
MARTINA HINGIS:  I didn't do much.  I was most of the time on the court, like yesterday I spent there four hours, something like that.  Today another two and a half.  I'm at the Sonesta, so I stay most of the time here on the island.  I practice.  Once I went to Coconut Grove for dinner or Bayside, but never made it any further.  No shopping this time.  No time.  
 
JANA NOVOTNA:  And no party either. 
 
MARTINA HINGIS:  No party either.  They were always so far, Miami Beach.  You never know about traffic and all this.  I was a very brave girl this time.  
 
JANA NOVOTNA:  Very good girl.
