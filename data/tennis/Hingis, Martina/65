  Q.  This is your first win at the championship since 2000, isn't it?   
 MARTINA HINGIS: 2000?  Six years?  Geez, well, I guess that's how it comes around, right?  I'm not thinking about stuff like this.  So, no, I mean it's been a great match.  And I'm lucky and very happy to be through.   
  
  Q.  It was a strange match.  She got off to a terrible start, but it was more tactical than --   
 MARTINA HINGIS: I think a little bit nervous to have a terrible start.  I think she underestimated me, even after she watched me yesterday, and she had a great match against Amelie.  She played very well, very solid serving.  And I knew I had to come out strong in the beginning otherwise I'll be blown away and I think that I have this early break, you know, to go up 2-Love and 4-Love and show her she had to play.   
  
  Q.  Now the situation in the group, it's really difficult for all of you, but you still have chances for the finals or how do you see?   
 MARTINA HINGIS: That's nice.  As I was saying before on the court already, the round robin system, that even if you lose you still can get through.  And that's the nice part about it.   
 Play another match, another chance and, of course, if you lose the first one, you like having more chances, yeah.   
  
  Q.  About just the last one, about the schedule of the tournament, do you think it's too late?  We should have started earlier?   
 MARTINA HINGIS: Well, I don't want to complain too much.  I won today.  And I have another one tomorrow.  So I can't -- it's definitely not in my favor, but you have to make the best out of it and we tried it today and we're in Spain people like to live and watch tennis later.  You choose professional sports and you have to adjust the best you can.
