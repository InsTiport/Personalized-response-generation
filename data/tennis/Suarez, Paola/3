THE MODERATOR:  Questions.  
 
 
Q.  It was a tough game for you today, doubles as well.  Now tomorrow not much rest and you play the No. 4 seed.  How do you prepare for so many games?
 
PAOLA SUAREZ:  Yeah, I mean, I play long singles and doubles today.  But I think I'm okay.  Today I think I'm okay.  We see tomorrow on the court.  I already recover a little bit from my singles, and I'm going to do all the things, the massage and rest and try to be a hundred percent tomorrow, as well.  
 
Q.  Did you find the support of the crowd helpful today, because there was a point in the game where it looked like it could go either way and you seemed to find another level of your play? 
 
PAOLA SUAREZ:  I don't understand.  The support of the public?  
 
Q.  How did they help you? 
 
PAOLA SUAREZ:  No, I mean, they support me, you know, I think so good.  It's really important for us when we are on the court.  You know, I was in the third set, I was really tired today because I run a lot, you know.  When you can listen the people, you know, to say your name, it's good for us.  I mean, for me it was good.
