THE MODERATOR:  First question, please.


Q.  Virginia, how did it feel to finally beat a legend like Martina Navratilova in tennis? 

VIRGINIA RUANO PASCUAL:  Yeah, it's not the first time that we beat her, so she's another player.  She's now like us on the court.  We know she's a very good player from the years, no?  But I think is good to play against her. 

Q.  Why do you think you play so well here?  And, now, will you try to concentrate on winning the other majors? 

PAOLA SUAREZ:  Well, I think we try to win all the, you know, all the Grand Slam, to play well.  This is the second time that we won here.  I think it's coincidence, you know.  The other Grand Slam, we lost the final and we couldn't get the final, you know.  But I think we have good like results in Grand Slam.  It's just a coincidence that we won two times here.
