V. AZARENKA/M. Keys   
7-6, 2-0 [Ret.]   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Sorry about that unfortunate end.  Just tell us what happened.  
MADISON KEYS: I felt my hamstring kind of tighten up in the middle of the first set, and at the end of the first I really felt it get worse.  Then playing the first couple of games, it wasn't getting better, and I didn't want to make it worse than it already was.   
 Q.  Talk a little bit about that tiebreaker, because she was 5-Love up and then it seemed like you were coming back in there.  Was it hurting or were you thinking about it or you were just trying to win it?  
MADISON KEYS: I was just trying to get a couple of points.  But, I mean, obviously I felt it, which is why I called the trainer ahead after, but yeah, I mean, I was just trying to do as much as I could without making it any worse.   
 Q.  How does her form look to you at this point?  She's still relatively, you know, in a comeback phase.  
MADISON KEYS: I mean, just from watching her from Indian Wells to Miami, she looks like she's playing well already.  There is obviously a couple of things here and there that aren't perfect, but I was impressed with her form, and she's obviously a great returner, which she showed tonight.   
I wouldn't be surprised if she was doing incredibly well in a couple of weeks.   
 Q.  Do you find, because you have had injuries here and there and everything, that you become more cautious about maybe I shouldn't play or I should take care of it and worry about that?  
MADISON KEYS: I think I have gotten smarter about it.  I think I have made some injuries worse by trying to play through it, and I'm just not interested in doing that at this point of the season right now.   
So I think it was just the smarter idea to get off the court.
