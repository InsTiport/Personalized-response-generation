M. KEYS/P. Hon   
7-5, 5-7, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  I'm sure you would have rather it not been a two-day match.  
MADISON KEYS: Whenever you're fourth and you know there is no lights, especially after two men's matches, you know there is always a chance that you're going to have to come back and finish it.  It's not ideal, but very happy that I got the win.   
 Q.  What is it like to play, especially in a Grand Slam, against a qualifier or a wildcard, somebody who's just got nothing to lose and is swinging freely?  
MADISON KEYS: It's always a little bit tough, but it's also expected, knowing that they are probably going to play some of their best tennis and just go for it.  I think that's what Priscilla did and I think she played really well.  It was very expected, though.   
 Q.  Following your success on clay this season, I see that my American colleagues are now referring to you as a clay court specialist.  I wonder how that makes you feel and what the biggest change is in your game that is giving you the good results this year?  
MADISON KEYS: I think it's just been lots of years on clay now and understanding how I have to adapt my game a little bit to play on the surface.   
More than that, just feeling more and more comfortable with my movement and not rushing to finish points.   
 Q.  The tag as a clay court specialist, how does that make you feel?  
MADISON KEYS: I think people are still joking when they say that (smiling).  I definitely feel more comfortable on clay and I actually enjoy it so every year is a little bit better.  But I think people are still joking when they say that.   
 Q.  Just talk a little bit about, it's been a little while, but talk a little bit about Charleston, to actually go all the way to lift the trophy to win there.  What did that mean to you?  
MADISON KEYS: Charleston was great.  It came at a time that was kind of necessary.  I haven't had a great season and being able to play that well and play a bunch of people that, in the past, I had struggled against was just icing on the cake.   
But being able to win another title and my first on clay meant a lot.   
 Q.  A tennis career is based on the choices, decisions a player makes.  If you could look back and say the one, maybe two decisions that have been really key in your career, what would that be?  
MADISON KEYS: I don't know, to be honest.  I don't think it's always just one or two decisions.  I think it's kind of a buildup of things and situations and dealing with things the best that you can.   
I don't think, in my career, I could say it was one or two very specific things.   
 Q.  We're going to see Sofia Kenin here tomorrow on the big stage.  You have played her recently and you've seen her in some really pressureful Fed Cup situations.  Where is she on her learning curve and what can we expect to see tomorrow?  
MADISON KEYS: She's having a really great year, obviously.  Her getting that first Fed Cup win did a lot for her confidence, and being able to play through those nerves for the first time and finally get that win I think was really big for her.   
She's a really great tennis player.  She was definitely one of the ones, when she was coming up in her group, that everyone kind of knew that she was going to do things.   
I think tomorrow she's going to have a lot of fun, and I think she doesn't really back down to pressure, and she really enjoys it and likes being able to play up.  I think she's really going to have some fun out there.   
 Q.  Has there been any player, male or female, who you've learned from the most in observing the game and watching the game over the years?  
MADISON KEYS: I think you watch and you take bits and pieces from everyone.  Everyone does different things well.  Everyone handles situations a little bit different, so being able to see how people react in certain situations, I think you can apply that to yourself and your personality.   
And I think that's the beauty of the men's and women's game is that there are so many people and there are so many personalities that you can really look around and learn a lot.   
 Q.  Any 411 on your next opponent, Blinkova?  
MADISON KEYS: I didn't even know I was playing her, so I have to go back and rewatch some of her matches.
