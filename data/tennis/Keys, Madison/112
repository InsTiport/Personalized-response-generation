4-6, 6-4, 6-4   
(Transcribed from WTA recording.)   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Great comeback.  Talk us through how that match went for you.  
MADISON KEYS: Yeah, I had chances in the first set.  Wasn't really able to convert.  Had one bad service game.  Then kind of just a battle throughout the whole second set.  A little bit of slow start in the third.   
I managed to kind of get it back and figure it out, fight back and get the win.   
 Q.  What did you tell yourself towards the end of the second set when you were down?  
MADISON KEYS: I think it was just, you know, try to get one more ball, one more ball; just stay in it; make her win it and not give it to her.   
 Q.  You love playing in Australia.  You did well here last year.  Great crowd support.  What is it about the Australian Open that makes you perform so well?  
MADISON KEYS: You know, I love whenever I come here, every city I visit.  It's one of my favorites.  I just think Australians are so welcoming.  I think after last year, I kind of created somewhat of a fan base.   
Coming back to that is always great.  Even tonight, even playing Aussie Ana, I definitely had some of my own fans.   
 Q.  Talk about your potential two opponents, Zhang and Lepchenko.  
MADISON KEYS: You know, Lepchenko, I've played her a couple of times.  We're both from the States.  I know her well.  I don't know if we've ever played a match.  Yeah, we have.  She beat me.  She can be tough and crafty.   
Zhang, we're so happy for her now.  She's won not only one, but two main draw matches.  That's great for her.  I haven't played her since three, four years now.  Obviously she's playing well if she's had the upsets that she's had, so either match will be tough.
