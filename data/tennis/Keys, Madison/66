THE MODERATOR: Questions,  please.
Q. Would you say this is the first major tournament in a while where you feel close to your best again?  If so, how does that feel?
MADISON KEYS: This is for sure the first Grand Slam I have come in and felt really good and healthy and ready to play.  I'm really excited.  Just looking forward to having a good first round for now.
Q. What do you take out of that, the match against GarbiÃ±e in Cincinnati being close?  Is that a positive match in your mind?  Negative match?  She went on to win.
MADISON KEYS: Yeah, she went on to win the tournament and be No. 1 in the world, so it's not a bad person to lose to, but obviously I wasn't super happy with how it ended, but I think there were lots of positives there.  At the end of the day, it gave me enough time to kind of have days off and all that.  Definitely took a lot of positives from that.
Hopefully in that situation it doesn't happen that way again.
Q. Given that eight women come into this tournament with the ability to walk out No. 1, and any other number players are so close to the top, what does it say about the opportunity that's in front of you and others here?
MADISON KEYS: I think right now is a really good time for women's tennis.  I think there is a lot of depth.  I truly believe that, you know, anyone who is playing well could beat anyone the next two weeks.
So I think it's really interesting, great time for women's tennis.
Q. Serena is having a baby, and you are one of the top-ranking Americans in the tournament.  Is there any special pressure that's on you, since Serena is not in the tournament and you have a very good ranking, to perform well?  What are your thoughts about the landscape changing with her not here?
MADISON KEYS: I don't think Serena being gone it's like immediately, like, Madison, you're our only hope.
I'm focused on myself, and, you know, I'm not really concerned that I'm wherever I am in the women.  I think there is a lot of great American women playing at the moment, and I think there is lots of opportunities.
So I'm more focused on that.
Q. Have you decided, are you playing in the Fed Cup final?  Have you talked to Kathy about it at all?  Any thoughts on that?
MADISON KEYS: To be honest, I haven't gone much past US Open right now.  I'm taking it one step at a time.  No, it's an amazing opportunity for us to be in the finals, and, you know, knock on wood, I'm healthy and able to play in that final.
Q. Have you talked to Kathy about it at all?
MADISON KEYS: Yeah, I have talked to her about it.
Q. I remember at Wimbledon you talked about the disagreement you and your agent had about whether you should play because of your physical condition at that time.  What did you prove to yourself at Wimbledon?  And if you can carry the story forward to now where you say you're feeling the best you have at a major.
MADISON KEYS: I didn't really prove anything to myself.  I think playing for two-plus years hurt, you know, showed me more about myself more than just playing Wimbledon.
But I'm just really excited that I'm healthy, and I'm going into a tournament feeling really good, and finally have had the time to prepare.
Q. How would you describe that road, though, from being at the low point to where you are now?
MADISON KEYS: It hasn't always been fun, but I think I have learned a lot and grown a lot through the experience, so yeah, I'm just really happy that I feel like I'm on a really good path right now.
Q. You were talking about getting the days' rest before this tournament.  How is the arm feeling just in terms of the strength and things like that?  How important was that time off?  Does it feel 100%?  Is it as good as it's going to be right now, I guess?
MADISON KEYS: I guess it's as good as it's going to be.  It's tough trying to rehab while playing in a season, getting it back to 100% strength.  It's just not really possible.  So I think it's as good as it's going to be, and then offseason is going to be the time where I can really focus on it and strengthen it and not worry about being sore playing for matches or anything like that.
Q. Will you, as a fan, watch Simona play Maria?
MADISON KEYS: I don't think any tennis fan in the world is not going to have that match on.  Let's be honest.
Q. What are your thoughts on Maria being back in major play for the first time in so long?  And when you see her game, what strikes you most?
MADISON KEYS: To be completely honest with you, I haven't seen much of her playing this year.  But I think we all knew it was inevitable that she'd be back in majors and playing.  I'm sure this first round is going to be interesting.
Q. What's your reaction to her getting this opportunity?
MADISON KEYS: I didn't really have a reaction to it, to be honest with you.  She got a wildcard, and then from then on it was just kind of, we'll see where she ends up in the draw.
Q. When she's at her best, how would you describe her play?
MADISON KEYS: I mean, she's won Grand Slams and been No. 1 in the world, so I would say that she's really, really good (smiling).
Q. Was there a feeling in the locker room, like, oh, God, who's going to get her in the first round?
MADISON KEYS: I don't think so.  I don't think any of us really talked about it.  It's always interesting when, you know, a former champion is floating around and not a seed.
I mean, I think everyone knew it was a possibility that something like this would happen.
Q. What's your relationship with New York?  Is it a city that you always have taken to?  Does it take time?  How do you feel about the city?
MADISON KEYS: I have always loved it.  It's just taking some time to manage it and know, you know, what days to sleep in and come here to the site late, what days to wake up early and just get it done with.
I think enjoying the city bits at a time and not all at once has been the key.
