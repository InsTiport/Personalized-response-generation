S. HALEP/M. Keys
  6‑7, 6‑4, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

Q. I guess we want to make sure, are you okay? What happened to your leg towards the end?
MADISON KEYS: I started cramping. Yep. 

Q. That kind of happened to you a few years ago here, right? Against Radwanska? That match where... 
MADISON KEYS: Shvedova. I tore my adductor in that one. I haven't cramped for like five‑and‑a‑half years. So good timing today (smiling).

Q. What's your reaction to the match? You played well throughout. Just how did you feel? Where did it go away from you? Was it purely when you started cramping?
MADISON KEYS: I think I played pretty well. I think there were chances for both of us in the in the first. And in the second, I had a couple of chances. Looking back at it, I wish I was able to convert. 
Overall, I think it was a really good match. Then towards the end of the second, I just felt like I couldn't really move as well anymore. I felt like my level really dropped after that.

Q. Is there something to be learned from this or taken from it, or do you just kind of view it as more frustrating overall?
MADISON KEYS: I'm sure in like two days I'll look back and see a lot of positives from are it, but right now I'm just really frustrated.

Q. What's the best way for you to get over something like this? Retail therapy? Getting away from tennis?
MADISON KEYS: Definitely going to get away from tennis for a while. Go see my family, hang out and just kind of re‑evaluate this whole trip. I'm sure after I have had some time away, it will be mostly good things.

Q. There is lots of positives you'll take from the grass? 
MADISON KEYS: I think, for sure. I don't think you could look at my season and say it was bad in any means. Obviously I'm really disappointed with how things turned out today, but that's just how some things happen. 
You have to learn from it and get stronger and just try to come back and do better next time.

Q. Did you feel like you were made to work harder than you were in the earlier matches? We talk about the cramping. Do you think it's just a hydration issue? Is it exhaustion, fatigue on the court? Have you had a chance to talk to your team about it yet?
MADISON KEYS: I think it's probably a combination of exhaustion, just playing a lot of matches and being kind of tired. But nerves, as well. I think that played a part in it. 
So I think it was probably just a bad combination.

Q. You're the youngest player at this level of the draw right now. You're frustrated and a difficult loss, but do you sort of feel like part of you says, Well, I'm young and there is still plenty of time to get this all figured out? You don't feel like you're behind schedule at this point, do you?
MADISON KEYS: I wouldn't say like I'm behind schedule, but also I'm not satisfied with ‑‑I'm not totally satisfied with what I have achieved. I think I can do more. I want to do more.
So even being young, it's great, but at the same time, I want more.

Q. You have made such a point to put together a team around you this season. Do you feel like it's more a matter of time that the work you guys are doing pays off, or does this feel more like you need to sort of recalibrate the kind of work you have been doing?
MADISON KEYS: I think the team that I have put together and the work that we do, I definitely think it's going to help me. I think it will click. You know, we have definitely been doing a lot of hard work and it hasn't been very long that every piece of my team has been together.
So I definitely think everything will kind of come together.

Q. When you won Eastbourne a couple years ago, what did you do with the prize money? Did you kind of treat yourself to anything?
MADISON KEYS: I don't even remember. Put it in my bank account, I guess. Used it for expenses.

Q. You have played a lot in the last few weeks. Are you going to give yourself a chance to perhaps celebrate that you made the top 10 and everything that you have managed to achieve so far this season?
MADISON KEYS: Maybe. I don't know yet. 

Q. A little while ago you were good enough to share a few comments from your sisters back in the States. Any more interactions with them of interest?
MADISON KEYS: No, they have been pretty boring lately. They have just been really supportive, actually. So that's been weird.
