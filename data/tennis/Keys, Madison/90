An interview with:   
MADISON KEYS   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  The speed of your serve, 204 kilometer, I don't know if you know what that is in miles per hour, but it's really fast, about 110.  Crazy numbers.  Is this fast for you, normal for you?  Are you just feeling it right now?  
MADISON KEYS: I feel like when I'm serving well, I usually have a couple of those mixed in.  Obviously I don't look at the speed during the match.  But, yeah, I feel like when I'm really feeling my serve, I definitely get a lot of power on it.   
 Q.  Especially the third set, so dominating.  
MADISON KEYS: I played really well in the first set I feel to get a good lead, then kind of fell off for a couple of games.  The second set, I was a lot more passive and was letting her dictate the point.  It's tough when you're playing someone who is so great at being aggressive.   
I just knew in the third set I either had to step up, be aggressive, go for my shots, or I wasn't going to like the outcome of the match.   
 Q.  How do you reset the game at the end of the second set and turn it around?  What do you do?  
MADISON KEYS: It was really just, you know, kind of put the second set out of your mind, not think about it.  Think what was I doing well in the first set, and what do I do, how do I play tennis well, knowing that if I'm not going to go out and do that, I was going to be behind the baseline running side to side, and that didn't sound like very much fun.   
 Q.  Was it part of your game plan to strike the ball as hard as you did in the third set?  
MADISON KEYS: No, it just happens.  I don't usually think about hitting it as hard as I do.  Yeah, it just happens.   
 Q.  In the third set there was the one game when you hit service winner, two back-to-back aces, closed it out cleanly.  Is this one of those games where it just clicked, what you were trying to do the entire match worked, or did you open up the throttle and fire those aces?  
MADISON KEYS: I felt like the game before I found my rhythm again on my serve.  I felt like I lost it a little bit in the second set.  Once I was feeling good about it, I kind of just thought, I'm going to go for it.  Once I felt one, I thought, Okay, it feels really good, I'm just going to keep doing it.   
It's just one of those things, when I'm really feeling my rhythm and all of that, I'm going to go for it.   
 Q.  How pleased are you to make the semifinals and again continue to back up tournament after tournament what you've been able to do for the last couple of months?  
MADISON KEYS: I'm really happy with it.  That was my biggest goal, was to be more consistent, you know, to overall have matches where I'm not playing great but be able to figure them out.  I think that's been what I've been doing.   
So really happy with that and really happy that even after a bad set today, I was able to kind of regroup and have a really good third set.   
 Q.  For consistency, is the key to play those bad matches and get through them?  
MADISON KEYS: I think so.  I think it's figuring out ways how to win matches when you're not playing great.  It just gives you that confidence that when you aren't playing a good match or you're down, you know you can figure it out.   
But I think a huge part of it is my practices have been very focused and intense.  They haven't been as long, but I'm going out and giving everything that I have.  Having that confidence and knowing I've been putting all of the work in has been really helpful.   
 Q.  A thought on your possibly opponent.  What do you know about either of those two girls?  
MADISON KEYS: Honestly, I don't know much about either.  I know Jo a little bit more.  She's had a great year.  She played really well last week and won the tournament.   
I don't know who she's playing.  I know she's two hands on both sides.  Other than that, I haven't seen much of either player.
