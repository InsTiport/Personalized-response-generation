S. ZHANG/M. Keys   
3-6, 6-3, 6-3   
(From WTA recording.)   
 Q.  Talk about the injury, what you had, and when it first really started to bother you.  
MADISON KEYS: Kind of did at the end of the first set and then just got worse and worse.   
Yeah, I think just probably pulled, tore an adductor.  Yeah, it's pretty much it.   
 Q.  Had you felt it against Ana, that same injury?  
MADISON KEYS: No.  That was kind of my ab, which then also started to go in this match tonight.   
Yeah, so that was something else.  Yeah.   
 Q.  Madison, why keep playing?  
MADISON KEYS: I mean, you don't want to -- one, I hate retiring; two, you don't want to do that to someone who is trying to get in the quarterfinals.   
 Q.  Was there a hope that if you played on you maybe able to get better for the quarterfinals?  
MADISON KEYS: Yeah.  I thought maybe I could figure it out and somehow get through and then have a day off and try.   
But obviously that didn't happen.   
 Q.  Is the leg problem something -- you've had problems in the past I think, right?  
MADISON KEYS: Yep.   
 Q.  Same spot?  Similar thing?  
MADISON KEYS: Yep.   
 Q.  Any thoughts on how to solve it?  
MADISON KEYS: Trying.  If you have a magic pill, let me know.   
 Q.  It's kind of an obvious question, but how disappointed are you?  
MADISON KEYS: I don't think there is a word for it.   
 Q.  How frustrating is it having put all that work in in the off-season and you feel like this is something that you've dealt with before and that's crept back up?  
MADISON KEYS: Also don't think there's a word for it.   
 Q.  Are you impressed with how long you were able to stay out there and compete at the highest level?  
MADISON KEYS: I think on some shots I kind of just closed my eyes and kind of just slapped the ball.  Not fully impressed with myself.   
Yeah, but, I mean, you know, yay me for staying out there.   
 Q.  The commentator on Channel 7 said without injury tonight you could win the match for sure.  Do you think so?  
MADISON KEYS: I don't know.  You never know.  You can't say that.   
 Q.  Is there any regret at all?  
MADISON KEYS: No, I don't think so.
