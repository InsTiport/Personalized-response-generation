G. MUGURUZA/M. Keys   
6-4, 3-6, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How tricky was that match just with the conditions, the way the match began and then the rain delay and then everything after that?  
MADISON KEYS: Yeah, it started really windy, and I think everyone could see we were both struggling on our serves.   
Then the rain came, and then it was just really heavy after that, it felt.  But, no, I think it was kind of two different matches kind of smashed together.   
 Q.  What do you think was the difference in the end?  
MADISON KEYS: I think she played amazingly well at the end.  She really didn't give me any unforced errors or anything like that.  I obviously had some unforced errors that I wasn't happy about, but I felt like I had to go for it because she was just going to make everything.   
 Q.  Did anything about her game surprise you today?  
MADISON KEYS: No.   
 Q.  What's the plan now?  Head straight to New York?  Go home?  
MADISON KEYS: I might stay here for a day and go see Fiona at the Cincinnati Zoo and then go to New York.  Yeah.   
 Q.  What are you taking away from the past few weeks on the hard courts here in North America?  Because you played quite well.  
MADISON KEYS: Yeah, I think I have played really well.  Obviously it's not the perfect way to end right before the US Open, but I'm playing really good tennis.   
Even today was a really good match and, you know, great momentum going into the Open.   
 Q.  Do you feel good physically, too?  
MADISON KEYS: Yep.  Physically I feel really good.
