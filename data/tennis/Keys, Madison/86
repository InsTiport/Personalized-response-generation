M. KEYS/A. Riske
4-6, 7-6, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Do you enjoy having the record of latest match ever or...
MADISON KEYS: Now that I'm a part of it, yay.  Let's try not to break it.  (Laughter.)
Q. What was she doing well in the first set?
MADISON KEYS: I think she played really well.  I think errors started kind of creeping in a little bit at the end.  I wasn't totally expecting her level to be as high.
I mean, especially her forehand.  She was hitting it really well.  You know, she was pushing me back.  She was dictating.  Normally I would get a ball I could be aggressive on she was handling really well for the first set and 12 games.
I was really happy that I just kind of stuck in there and was able to eventually kind of break her down.
Q. First set at a slam, dropping it, it can be a bit of a panic moment for many players.  How close did you get to that panic mode and how did you claw it back?
MADISON KEYS: I feel like I actually handled it really well.  Being down a set and a break first round of the US Open is never a comfortable feeling.  I knew if I let that panic set in then it would just go downhill, so it was a very conscious effort to stay really mellow and be clear thinking.
Q. What is that panic like?  Are you thinking, Oh, my god.  I lost first round.  Everyone is going to think I'm slumping.  Transcribe some of your inner dialogue for us.
MADISON KEYS: It's more I want to do so well.  I have been training so hard.  I don't understand why this is happening.  And then it spirals.  If you let it, it can get very bad very quickly.
I think a big key, especially for me, if I start feeling it, take a step back and take a couple seconds and try and regroup and get back to level so that it doesn't start spiraling.
Q. (Question regarding the shoulder.)
MADISON KEYS: Just a little bit of shoulder pain.  I think it was a little bit heavier out there tonight.  Yeah, I think with some treatment it will be fine Wednesday.
Q. At any point during the match, down a set and a break, did the stage, opening night on Ashe, start to creep in?
MADISON KEYS: It didn't actually, surprisingly.  I feel really comfortable out on Ashe.  That was only my third match on Ashe, but it felt just like another court.  The occasion didn't really ever feel daunting.
It was more of an excitement factor.  This is something to kind of rise to the occasion.
Q. How would you describe playing at that hour?
MADISON KEYS: It's not that bad.  I mean, we both knew we were going to be on late today.  I slept till almost 11:00 this morning, so I definitely wasn't awake at like 6:00 a.m. and at the courts at 8:00.
I didn't show up until like 6:30, so it wasn't that bad.
Q. You play Kayla Day next.  Do you know anything about her at all?
MADISON KEYS: She was in the junior program at the USTA in Carson when I was there.  I officially am starting to feel old because she was like the young group.  I guess now she's winning Kalamazoo and stuff like that.
I don't know her.  I mean, I know her, but I don't know how she plays or anything like that.  So we'll get Thomas to watch some videos.
Q. You were two points away from losing.  Is that a thing you realize in the match, that it's that close, or are you so zoned in that you don't notice?
MADISON KEYS: I didn't really think about it honestly.  Obviously I knew it was really close in the tiebreaker, but it never really sunk in that it was two points.
I knew when we had that long rally and she missed the swing volley, that was when I was like, That was really close.  Let's not do that anymore.
Other than that, it didn't really come into my mind.
