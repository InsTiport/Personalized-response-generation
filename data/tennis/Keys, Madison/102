K. BERTENS/M. Keys
7-6, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Just your evaluation of the match and maybe a little bit broader question just about your clay court season.
MADISON KEYS: I definitely don't think I played my best today, but she played really well.  I felt like a lot of things I was trying to do weren't quite working today and it was frustrating.
You know, I felt like I was kind of banging my head against the wall at times, but that's just kind of how it goes sometimes.
You know, overall I'm really happy with my clay court season.  Obviously it's the best one that I have had so far.  I'm very excited to get on grass, but, you know, I'm obviously going to take what I learned from this one and, you know, use it towards the next clay court season.
Q. Did you find the conditions to be difficult for your game?  Did you feel at all that waiting the last few days and all that sort of took you out of any kind of rhythm overall?
MADISON KEYS: It's obviously really tough to play on, whatever, on Saturday and then play again on Wednesday.  It's not an ideal schedule, but obviously we couldn't really do anything about it.  It was just raining.
It's obviously not ideal, but the tournament did the best they could.  The conditions today were definitely very heavy and slow.  So I think it favored her more than it favored me.
But everyone had to deal with the conditions and try to figure it out, and I think she did a better job today.
Q. Was there anything particularly tricky about what she was doing, anything that impressed you or surprised you?
MADISON KEYS: I was surprised by how many balls she got.  I think part of it was just because the court was a little bit slower and my ball wasn't doing as much.
But I think she just kept continuously making me hit one more ball, one more ball, one more ball.  I think I started going for things too soon, and she definitely took me out of my rhythm.
Q. Were you surprised by the level that Kiki Bertens played at today?
MADISON KEYS: I don't think surprised.  She's obviously been playing well.  She won Nuremberg, she beat Angelique.  I was expecting a tough match and wasn't really surprised that she gave me a tough match.
Q. Can you tell when a player is feeling confident?  Is there anything in the way they look or the way they react?  Again, Kiki is on a pretty hot run right now.  Is there anything about that that you can sense when you get on court with someone like that?
MADISON KEYS: I think the one place you really see it is just -- I was surprised by her serving.  She was serving really, really well, and you could tell she's been in a really good rhythm with that and that has gotten her out of maybe bad spots for the last, I don't know, nine matches that she's played.
But, yeah, she just seemed very confident.  You can definitely feel that when you're on the other side of the net.
Q. I'm not sure if you have had a lot of time to talk to Thomas since the match, but if so, what did you guys talk about in terms of wrapping up the season or what you do together from here?
MADISON KEYS: I haven't really spoken to him.  Got drug testing done and all of that, so haven't really had any time to do anything.
Q. What's your grass court schedule?  And your thoughts on Shelby's run here.
MADISON KEYS: I'm going to do Birmingham, Eastbourne, Wimbledon.  So definitely not playing Nottingham which starts in like three days.  And then, you know, I'm very, very happy for Shelby and going to be cheering her on.  You know, hopefully she can win later today, and, you know, definitely going to be on her side and kind of watching from afar.
