M. KEYS/A. Potapova   
6-3, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You didn't have to throw any shoes today during your match.  Are you feeling good about your match?  
MADISON KEYS: I don't think I have ever thrown a shoe at anyone.  I feel good about that.   
I also feel good about playing tennis today and happy nothing was thrown at anyone.   
 Q.  You got a bit of a test in the second set.  I know for the first three sets you have been here they have been clean, and then being down in the scoreline and having to battle back, how much confidence do you get out of that, given the lack of match play?  
MADISON KEYS: That actually is kind of the perfect test.  When you are able to get out of that, you look back in a weird way you're thankful for that.  I was really happy with how quickly I just bounced back, I got back in the game, and then to get back in the return game when I was down Love-40, those three games right there meant a lot to me.   
 Q.  I was curious with players who are working with a coach who hasn't worked on WTA before, and especially coming directly from ATP, how the process has been for Jim and if you have had to teach him a different lay of the land on this side of the aisle?  
MADISON KEYS: He's definitely appreciated that it's not the same.  It's not the same game, it's different.  And so that's been refreshing, because I feel like a lot of the men's coaches, when they try to coach women, they just think it's all the same.   
So not having to do that has been nice.  It's just been nice to have a completely new voice, someone who hasn't worked on the WTA and is just, has taken a step back and just watched all of it.   
So having his perspective has been really interesting.   
 Q.  Are there one or two of those key differences he picked up on or you told him right away that you can think of as examples?  
MADISON KEYS: His biggest thing is being more aggressive on second-serve returns.  For the longest time, it had always been -- I have always been told, you know, don't go for as much and be safer and all that.  And he thinks the reverse of that and says, No, go for it, commit to it.   
It's actually been working better for me, thinking that way, so that's been the biggest thing.   
 Q.  Is that something in your mind you always thought, well, I should be going for this, but because everybody told you to hold back you didn't?  You were waiting for affirmation?  
MADISON KEYS: No.  It's been something that I have had to actively get myself to do, especially breakpoints, not playing too conservatively, because when I play conservatively, things usually don't go great.  I have to commit to it and swing.  So that's been a good change for me.   
 Q.  When working with a new coach, how easy or difficult is it when you're told something that's different from the way you have done it before, to accept that or to think, gee, this doesn't sound right to me?  
MADISON KEYS: I think it's pretty easy when you have been trying it one way and it hasn't been working, it's pretty easy to buy in to, Well, I'll try it this way and see if it works.  And if it does, great.  But it's also nice because the communication is there where, if I feel uncomfortable and I feel like I'm not doing it great, there is a happy medium where we can have a conversation and figure things out.   
So it's not solely do it this way because.  It's, okay, well, maybe it's not exactly that, but maybe we can find a little bit of an in-between.   
 Q.  What's your take on now all the Grand Slams, all four of them, kind of end in the fifth set or the third set in a different way?  Is that good?  Should it be uniform?  What would you prefer to see?  
MADISON KEYS: I have to be honest.  I don't watch many first set to fifth sets.  I go in and out.   
So I think it should be shortened, just because it's so long.  I think everyone taking the initiative to change things a little bit, a step in the right direction.  We will see what people like best and then maybe we can go from there.   
 Q.  You play Elise Mertens next.  Your thoughts on that?  
MADISON KEYS: She's going to be a tough match.  I just remember playing her at US Open.  It was a close one.   
She's had a great year and a half, and I'm going to have to go and watch what she's been doing the last couple of matches and see if I have a good game plan for her.   
 Q.  You know she has a new coach?  
MADISON KEYS: Yes.   
 Q.  Do you know who it is?  
MADISON KEYS: Yes.   
 Q.  So is that a bit funny or weird, because it's David, the guy you worked with before?  
MADISON KEYS: No, I think at some point we have all played someone who we used to be coached by.   
 Q.  Back to the second-serve return, just talk about, does that put you in a more aggressive mindset, as well?  Does that make a difference mentally for you?  
MADISON KEYS: Yes, and I think that's why it seems to work for me, because my tennis is not passive or kind of one foot in, one foot out.  It's fully committed and swinging.  When I'm doing that, even if I miss, it's usually a good hit.  So then I can make adjustments versus making a mistake because I was too passive.   
 Q.  Four days into the tournament, I'm just kind of curious what your sense is as to the vibe of the 2019 Australian Open, like what is standing out to you so far about kind of just this edition of this tournament?  
MADISON KEYS: The biggest thing is just the matches are incredibly competitive.  I feel like everyone is competing really hard, and everyone has a chance on the men's side and the women's side.  So it's been really fun to watch.  I have, like, four screens going at all times so I can watch all of it.   
I think it will be an interesting 2019.   
 Q.  Do you like to watch a lot of tennis in your downtime?  What do you do when you're not here?  
MADISON KEYS: I literally have it on four screens, my computer, iPad, phone, and the TV all going at the same time.   
 Q.  What's been the best match you have seen so far here?  
MADISON KEYS: Last night, Millman and De Minaur, we're like going back and forth, and I was texting someone, Did you see that?  Yeah.  They're like, No, I was talking about the other match.   
There was just so much going on.  Those were really exciting to watch.   
 Q.  Do you watch equal amount men and women?  When you're watching the women, how much of it is for fun, sort of, the way you were just describing as opposed to, gee, if I play her, or looking for things you can pick up?  
MADISON KEYS: I would say I probably tend to watch more women's matches, mostly just because I know all of the girls.  You can always pick what's going to be a good matchup.   
I'm usually watching for fun and entertainment and obviously unless I'm playing them, and then I will start looking for certain things.  But I really enjoy watching.   
 Q.  Only if like you know, like, you're playing the winner of that match kind of thing, or somebody who might be on your part of the draw?  
MADISON KEYS: I never look past who I'm playing, so it's usually watching older matches if getting ready for the next round.   
 Q.  Last year you were watching a lot of Netflix or things...  
MADISON KEYS: I still fit Netflix in.  There is plenty of hours in the day.   
 Q.  I know "Grace and Frankie" are about to start the next season.  What are you watching?  
MADISON KEYS: Yes, very excited about that.  I'm watching I think it's called "Tidying Up." It's about organizing.  Really into it now.  Kind of can't wait to go home and redo my whole closet.
