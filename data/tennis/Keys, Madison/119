THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
   
 Q.   What was the difference in that match today?  
MADISON KEYS:   Uhm, I think there was a couple of points in the first set that I think got away from me.   I had a couple of chances.   I think it really kind of came down to that.   
I think, you know, she played well.   She wasn't making very many mistakes.   You know, it was a point here or there.   
   
 Q.   When you look at the stat sheet, you have so many more winners than her and so many more unforced errors.   Does it feel like the game is on your racquet with her or does it feel she's still in control of things also?  
MADISON KEYS:   I think for the most part I feel like I was dictating a lot of the points.   It definitely was on my racquet.   
But, again, that's why she's so good.   She can get to lots of balls and, you know, make you hit the extra ball.   
So I think it's one of those things where I feel like I'm going to be the player that has more winners and errors, but she's really good at what she does.   
   
 Q.   Is that a match you think you should have won?  
MADISON KEYS:   I mean, I think I had chances for sure, yeah.   
   
 Q.   Is there anything you would have done differently with hindsight, looking back at the match?  
MADISON KEYS:   I mean, there's a couple of shots where I wish, you know, maybe I did something different.   But I think, you know, I fought, I competed, and I did everything I could today.   
At the end of the day, I think I'm pretty happy with, you know, the effort that I put in.   
   
 Q.   What did you think of your opponent?   Her defense is so remarkable.   She's tough for any opponent in that regard.   
MADISON KEYS:   Yeah, she's a great mover.   She makes you hit three, four extra balls every point.   She just doesn't give you anything.   
She hits really low, so it's even harder to stay in rallies.   So I think she's a great player.   You know, I'm not surprised that she's doing well.   
   
 Q.   You won more points than her.   But 40 unforced errors is quite a total, wasn't it?  
MADISON KEYS:   Yes.   
   
 Q.   You're obviously a wonderful talent, improving all the time.   Semifinals in Australia, quarters here.   What is the plan to take it to the next level?  
MADISON KEYS:   I think it's just consistency.   I think, you know, I've definitely been getting better and better even just this year.   But it's doing it every single week and getting better at doing that.   
I'm still working on that and that's definitely my goal.   I think that's the big difference.   
   
 Q.   What are you most pleased about with your two weeks at Wimbledon, and what are you most disappointed about?  
MADISON KEYS:   I think I'm most pleased with, you know, there was times in matches when I wasn't playing my best but I was able to figure out how to win even not playing my best.   
You know, definitely disappointed that I wasn't able to, you know, actually win the points that I needed to win today.   
   
 Q.   What are the things that you learned to win when things aren't going so well?  
MADISON KEYS:   I think just playing more within myself, you know, not forcing things, just trusting my game.   
   
 Q.   Three slams now for the year.   Feeling pretty good about your performances at them?   Are you pleased overall with that run?  
MADISON KEYS:   I'm definitely happy with how I've been doing so far this year.   But, you know, making semis and quarters just makes you want it that much more.   
I mean, as happy as I am that I'm getting further and further in slams, you know, it's still you want more.   
   
 Q.   How about the internal dialogue compared to a couple years ago in big matches?   How do you feel you're doing with that?   Is it a different sort of place you're in during a match?  
MADISON KEYS:   I think so.   I think I've gotten a lot better at being more positive, you know, letting things go, not constantly rethinking about it.   You know, just really trying to be positive after every point and get back to levelheaded.   
   
 Q.   Is that particularly difficult against a player like Radwanska?   Does she really test your patience with those defensive skills?  
MADISON KEYS:   She's definitely the type of player that can.   I think today for the most part I did a pretty good job of that.   But she's definitely the player that can push you.   
   
 Q.   How is your summer shaping up schedule‑wise?   What are you expecting after all these big things you're doing overseas?   What will the US Open be like?  
MADISON KEYS:   I haven't even thought about the US Open yet.   I'm kind of thinking about the next week really.   
Obviously I would always love to do well there, love that it's my home slam.   But right now I'm just really looking forward to a couple days off, then getting back to work, having the US Open Series.   
   
 Q.   Stanford?  
MADISON KEYS:   Stanford, yeah.   
   
 Q.   You said you want more.   What does that mean in your own mind?  
MADISON KEYS:   I think that means I want, you know, finals of Grand Slams and winning Grand Slams, winning WTA titles and things like that.   That's kind of a motivator every day to get out of bed and get out on the court.
