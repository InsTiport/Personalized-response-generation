  6‑1, 3‑6, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You said yesterday that you were looking forward to this match because you came up with no pressure having never faced Maria.   Talk about today.   Did you feel pressure?   How did you feel out there?
MADISON KEYS:   Well, I mean, definitely don't think I played my best.   Especially the first set.   That was a bit of a disaster. 
But, you know, I think it's definitely improvement from what I have done in the past.   You know, after a bad first set I could have gone away, but I kind of figured it out and started playing better. 
It's definitely an improvement.   But, you know, I didn't really feel much pressure.   It was more just trying to figure out my game and get some better timing.

Q.   It went well for you in the second set.   What were some of the things you were able to figure out and feel good about implementing there?
MADISON KEYS:   I think I just kind of ‑‑I started taking time away from her a little more and was definitely kind of moving her around more and being more in charge.
So, yeah, I think that kind of changed it a little bit.   Then I also started serving a little bit better. 

Q.   In the third set, did you back away from that, or did she step up her game?
MADISON KEYS:   She definitely stepped up her game.   I also think, you know, in big points I got a little tentative.   I mean, that showed, you know. 
I mean, after I got broken at the very beginning it was really hard to try to break back.

Q.   How do you feel that your experience over the last 12 months or so helped you out in a match like today's?
MADISON KEYS:   I mean, I definitely think I have grown for sure in certain areas like that.   Before I could have just completely gone away and lost 1 and 2. 
But, you know, I think just being in the situation and kind of being able to stay calm and think clearly really helped me.

Q.   Obviously you use on‑court coaching during the WTA Tour, and then when you get to the slams, the US Open, you won't be able to call the coach to help with tactics.   Is there any concern whatsoever about that kind of difference?
MADISON KEYS:   No.   I mean, honestly, if they got rid of on‑court coaching I wouldn't be sitting in a corner crying and not know how to play tennis anymore (laughter).
I mean, we do it at Grand Slams.   We manage to win matches without our coaches coming on to court.
Honestly, I use it because it's an option, you know, and it can be helpful.
But, no, I don't think I will have a meltdown or anything.

Q.   But you're confident in your ability to think yourself through a match? 
MADISON KEYS:   Yeah.   I mean, obviously it's great if you're panicking and your coach comes out and it just could just be like, Calm down; this is what you have to do.
But at the same time, at Grand Slams you can't have that, so I think you know going into a match at a Grand Slam you can't have that lifesaver, so you're ‑‑ 

Q.   On your own?
MADISON KEYS:   Yeah.   You know you're on your own.

Q.   You obviously won a title not too long ago, but between a year ago and now, what are you most happiest about your game that you have been able to achieve from one year ago?
MADISON KEYS:   I definitely think there is a lot less up and down.   You know, definitely getting more and more consistent.   Still need lots of work on it, but I'm getting better. 
I'm much more comfortable just being on the tour and, you know, knowing where we're going and how the whole year is going to be.
I think just being more and more comfortable with, you know, not only my game but just what I'm doing.

Q.   Are you entered in New Haven?
MADISON KEYS:   No.

Q.   Are you going to try and play New Haven?
MADISON KEYS:   Nope.   I'm going back to Boca and training for a couple of days, and then up to US Open.
