N. OSAKA/M. Keys
6-2, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Talk about the matchup, how she played.
MADISON KEYS: I mean, honestly, looking back at the match, there was what I would consider a sloppy game, just missed returns, early in the first set.  Other than that, I mean, every time I had a breakpoint, anything like that, she came up with some unbelievable shots.
As far as being disappointed, obviously, but honestly she just played better than me tonight.
Q. Kind of leveled up in the second set.  Did you feel like the break was coming?  What was your mindset going through the final stretch?
MADISON KEYS: I mean, honestly, it was just trying -- I felt like if I could break, maybe I could get back into it.  Every time I had a breakpoint, it was an ace or a winner or something like that.
I mean, it's obviously tough because you keep fighting, trying to get the breakpoint, then for her to come up with some of the shots, it was difficult.  But you're in that match and you think, Okay, she's going to let up eventually.  She didn't, so...  All credit to her.
Q. She seems like somebody that doesn't get phased, 20 years old.  Talk about the composure she has at that age.
MADISON KEYS: It was really impressive.  For a first-time semifinalist on a big stage and all that, it was really impressive she held her nerve the entire time, never really had any kind of slipup.
Q. Do you think she played differently compared to previous matchups?
MADISON KEYS: I don't know if she played differently, but she definitely executed the best that I've ever played against her.  I think there was really two games where I didn't play perfect tennis, and that was why I lost.
Q. You talked about how impressive she handled the situation.  Are you curious to see how she handles Serena and the finals?
MADISON KEYS: I'm definitely interested.  I think if she plays like she did tonight, she can definitely give Serena a run for her money.  It will be a really good match.  I'm for sure going to watch it.
Q. What's next for you?  How will you recover from this and move forward?
MADISON KEYS: I'm going to go home and figure it out, figure out when I'm going to Asia, then just go from there.
Q. How do you rate this with respect to the instances where you've gone deep into slams, semifinals or finals, and have lost?  You played well throughout the entire tournament.  How does it compare to other instances where you've had to bow out?
MADISON KEYS: Previously I've felt like maybe I didn't play as well.  I was more disappointed just in my level of tennis.  But I have to say, like, being down a set and a break, being 100% committed to fighting through the entire second set, I'm not disappointed in that, so...
I mean, I'm walking away with a lot of good thoughts and feelings, just obviously disappointed I didn't get the outcome I wanted.
Q. Reflecting on Sloane's tournament, which came to an end earlier than yours, she said, I was glad I didn't come into this tournament and 'shit the bed'.  I think after last year, there was a nervousness she was going to get knocked out the first and second round.  Did you have a bit of those nerves?  Do you think, I got to the semifinals, it's a good run for me?
MADISON KEYS: I think to come in as a finalist for the first time and get to the semifinals, I'm really proud of that.  There were definitely some matches going into it I was nervous and had that extra expectation on myself.  To be able to do as well as I did following up last year, I'm definitely proud of that.
