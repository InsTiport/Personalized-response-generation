M. KEYS/E. Svitolina
7-6, 1-6, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Can you describe your emotions after pulling off that comeback and what it means to make the quarterfinals.
MADISON KEYS: I don't really know what I'm feeling right now.  It hasn't been very long.
But, I mean, it means the world to me to make the quarterfinals.  Yeah, it was a really rough start to my year.  This is just amazing.  You know, I'm really proud of myself for digging deep and figuring that out tonight.
Q. Can you talk about the adrenaline rush that went through you in the last four games.  Felt like you got more and more pumped up as it went on.
MADISON KEYS: Yeah, I definitely felt like I kind of hit a wall at the beginning of the second set.  My energy dropped.  Once I got broken in the third, I just kept telling myself, Just try to figure it out, just get as many balls in as you can.
I was lucky that I had an amazing crowd and atmosphere.  They definitely helped me pull through in that third set.
Q. The atmosphere you've played in a few times.  Last on night match.  Not totally full, but really loud.  How much are you enjoying that vibe?
MADISON KEYS: I really like it.  I mean, it's for me, so...
They are an amazing crowd because no matter what they're still there and they're still cheering for you.  No matter what the score was, they were definitely behind me.  They definitely help you raise your level.
Q. Did you see yourself raising your level in the last part of the third set?
MADISON KEYS: Yeah, I went from being down 5-0 in the second set to kind of just making a lot of balls and being tough.  Yeah, I'm really happy with how I closed out the match today.
Q. Do you feel like you turned some kind of corner tonight or was it just another win?
MADISON KEYS: It's definitely more than just a win.  So often a match like that could have gone really quick for me, and I could have lost that third set fairly easy, come off and been really disappointed.  So the fact that I dug deep and I figured things out, you know, I came out with a win means a lot to me.  More than that, it just proves how deep I can dig and how hard I can fight.
Q. After the match point, you ran over to your corner and gave everybody high fives.  That's not a common celebration necessarily unless it's a final.  Talk through why.
MADISON KEYS: Mostly because I was about to start crying, so it was better to not have a camera on my face.  I mean, this whole year has been, again, really tough.  They've stuck beside me and helped me through some really low moments.  Previous yeah, I mean, it just felt like it was more than just a round of 16 win.
Q. Did you ever know how good it would feel to be in the second week of a slam?  How does it feel?
MADISON KEYS: I mean, I've been in a few.
Q. Here at the US Open.
MADISON KEYS: Isn't the fourth round a second week?
Q. Yeah.
MADISON KEYS: Three times now (laughter).  Into the quarters?  Being in the quarters of the US Open feels fantastic.
Q. That's what I wanted to hear.
MADISON KEYS: Helped you out there (smiling).
Q. Four American women in the quarterfinals.  How does it feel to have such a representation of American tennis in the quarterfinals?
MADISON KEYS: I think it's great.  I think it shows how hard we've been working.  I think it's just really exciting.  I'm really happy that none of us are playing each other in the quarterfinals.
So yeah, I think if there's some all-American matchups in the rest of the tournament, I think that says really good things about women's tennis.
Q. Do you think you're going to get a text from Billie based on the volleying you just played?
MADISON KEYS: I don't know.  We'll see.  I have a lot of messages on my phone.  My phone hasn't stopped ringing.  I've got to go through and see if Billie sent me anything.
Q. Do you have a real connection with the other three American women, besides you just being Americans?
MADISON KEYS: Yeah, I've played on a Fed Cup team with all of them, including Venus.  I was at the Olympics with all of them.  So I think we're all cheering for each other.  To see Sloane coming back from a long injury, having to have surgery.  I mean, Coco is always a force to be reckoned with.  I don't think anyone is totally surprised about that.  Venus has made two slam finals.
I'm not really surprised that anyone got this far, but I think we're all cheering for each other, excited that there's four of us in the quarters.
Q. Looking ahead to your next match against Kanepi, would you want another late start?
MADISON KEYS: I mean, why not?  Let's just change the whole tournament.  We'll start at 10 p.m. every night.  Clearly, I mean, I'm on that schedule already, might as well stay on it.
Q. Are you naturally a nocturnal person?
MADISON KEYS: I am, but not to this extent.  Like this is a little insane.  Going to bed at 4 a.m. every morning and waking up at 11, it's not totally natural and normal.
But now I'm afraid to, like, play in the sun because I haven't done it in two weeks, so...  I'm fine with playing at night.
Q. How long does it take for the excitement to kick down?  You said you go to bed at 4.
MADISON KEYS: Right now it's 12.  Fingers crossed I'm asleep by 3.  Everyone cross your fingers for me (laughter).
