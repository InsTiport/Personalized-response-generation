  7/5, 6/7, 6/2

  MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Must be relieved to get the match done before the rain came.   Were you hurrying a little bit in the last game?
MADISON KEYS:   Yeah, no, definitely really happy that I was able to finish before the rain. 
I was rushing a little bit because I could feel it starting to come. 
But just really happy that I finished it.

Q.   Going into the third set, how were you feeling physically?   You talked about the transition coming from Eastbourne to here.   Did you feel it going to a third set that her chances were better than yours?
MADISON KEYS:   Physically I felt fine.   I wasn't really physically all that tired or anything. 
But, yeah, I mean, she definitely upped her level in the second set. 
For the third set I really just kind of had to, you know, get my momentum back. 

Q.   How were you able to do that?   In the tiebreaker there was a dip in your level.   She was going into the third with a lot of momentum.   What did you tell yourself?
MADISON KEYS:   You know, it was really just stick to my game, calm down, don't rush, just go back to the basics, don't panic. 

Q.   I suppose you matched up well against her, like your basics were going to be good enough to beat her.   You have a very different game.   It was decided on your racquet, it looked like. 
MADISON KEYS:   Definitely the whole match I wasn't playing my very best today, so there was definitely a lot of balls that came off my racquet that were not great. 
So, you know, it was really just staying with it and eventually feeling the ball a little bit better. 

Q.   How would you describe your comfort level with the aura of Wimbledon, all that means, how it's changed as you've gained experience here?
MADISON KEYS:   It's definitely, you know, not nearly as overwhelming as the first time I was here.   Just getting more and more comfortable with it.
But then at the same time, you know, embracing every match that I get to play here. 

Q.   How so?
MADISON KEYS:   I mean, for me, Wimbledon's definitely one of my favorite tournaments.   Just the history behind the whole tournament. 
So being able to play in it when, you know, as a little girl I was watching and wanting to be here one day, and finally being here, it's just taking a moment and appreciating that. 

Q.   You mentioned you weren't playing your best.   Is that reassuring looking forward to the next round, possibly next week?   Is it nice to know you have that level you can step up to?
MADISON KEYS:   Yeah.   It's reassuring in a way.   At the same time, it would have been nice if I came off of the court and felt like, Wow, I played really well today. 
You know, there's definitely room for improvement, and that's what I'm going to go out and practice tomorrow. 

Q.   What do you attribute this run you've gotten onto on grass in terms of getting your game together?
MADISON KEYS:   I mean, I think it's just I've been working really hard at staying consistent and doing all the right things.   Sometimes that wasn't working for me in matches. 
I mean, it doesn't always work every day, but just staying consistent and slowly getting better and better and better. 
And I think the last six, seven weeks I've had really consistent practices.   Just been doing really well.   So I think it's kind of just showing a little bit now. 

Q.   What effect on your confidence is your serve?
MADISON KEYS:   I mean, it's definitely nice to know in a tight point I can rely on my serve.   It's definitely a big confidence booster for me. 

Q.   How would you compare it with all the other women's serves tour at this present time?
MADISON KEYS:   There's so many people who have big serves who are weapons.   Lisicki, Serena.   I mean, I think maybe down the road hopefully I can be someone for someone to look up to and say they want to have a serve like me. 
Right now I'm just really focused on getting my serve better and better.

Q.   Whose do you look up to?
MADISON KEYS:   Is it bad if I say Federer?   I think he has an amazing serve. 

Q.   What particularly about it perhaps have you tried to emulate?
MADISON KEYS:   I just think he's just so composed before he serves, no matter what the score is.   If it's a pressure moment, he just stays really composed.   You can always tell he has confidence in it.

Q.   How and how hard is it for you to focus on the process and not focus on results?
MADISON KEYS:   I'm getting better, but it's definitely something I'm working on.   I mean, yeah, sometimes it's really hard not to focus on winning and losing right this second, thinking of the process, thinking down the road. 
But slowly it's getting better and better.   This whole Europe trip that's been my big focus.   Not really worrying about winning or losing matches.   Just getting better and coming off the court and thinking, Okay, was that better than last match?   What can I work on? 
So far it's been okay. 

Q.   There's a lot of green at Wimbledon.   Anything to match your sofa just yet?
MADISON KEYS:   Sorry? 

Q.   Don't you have like a very, very green sofa at home?
MADISON KEYS:   No.   I don't have a green sofa.   I don't think I have anything green in my apartment at all actually. 

Q.   This is the third time you've reached the third round at a major.   Is there a feeling for you now that it's time to take the next step and go one better?   Is that a particular motivator for you?
MADISON KEYS:   I mean, you always want to do really well in slams.   This is, yes, I think the third time I've reached the third round.   Obviously I'd be really excited to get to the fourth round. 
But then again, at the same time, I'm also trying not to focus on results and just playing a good match. 
But, yeah, no, if I made the fourth round, I'd definitely be really happy. 

Q.   How different do you feel about yourself as a player with a title under your belt?
MADISON KEYS:   I feel like a whole new person (smiling). 
I mean, I feel confident, you know.   It's just knowing that I kind of have that milestone down.   I mean, it just makes you want to go out and win even more titles. 

Q.   Did you chase down any of those One Direction guys that were wandering around?
MADISON KEYS:   I didn't even know they were here.   I saw Laura's Twitter.   I saw she had a picture of one of them.   I don't know who it was, though. 
So I figured they were here.   But, honestly, I don't think I could pick them out of a crowd. 

Q.   There was a story about you being inspired by Venus Williams and wanting a dress like Venus' when you were a kid.   Is that how you got into tennis?   Was it looking up to the Williams sisters?   Were they the inspiration for you?
MADISON KEYS:   I was four, so I think it had a lot more to do with the fact that I thought the dress was pretty. 
I mean, honestly, it was pure chance and luck that I walked in and just happened to see that dress and decided, I want one. 
So I don't think at four years old I was smart enough to really know how great Venus was and how amazing she is for the game.   I think it was purely just the dress. 

Q.   What does it mean to you that she has won a couple of times here, and with all that she's been through physically is on a run again at Wimbledon?
MADISON KEYS:   I mean, I think it's amazing.   I know she's definitely struggled.   It's always great to see someone, you know, who so far through their career is still out here battling and loving what we do. 

Q.   When you say Venus is amazing for the game, what do you mean by that?
MADISON KEYS:   I know she was very influential in helping us get equal prize money, so, Yay, Venus! 
Also, she's one of the best American women's tennis players.   She's one of the best women's tennis players, period.   She'll always go down in history for that.
