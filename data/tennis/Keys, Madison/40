M. KEYS/B. Pera
6-4, 6-1
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Good to have an earlier finish tonight?  How are you feeling?
MADISON KEYS: I feel good.  It's always nice to finish when the sun is still up.  I like that (smiling).
I feel really good about today.  I think I definitely brought my game up to a better level in the second set, so happy with it.
Q. What did you make of the conditions out there?
MADISON KEYS: I mean, it wasn't as hot definitely.  It was still humid, pretty warm.  But it definitely was not as hot.  It was nice to kind of be on a court that wasn't in direct sunlight.
Q. As you know, Venus and Serena are playing each other tomorrow.  When you think about them playing one another, what stands out most in your memory about that matchup?
MADISON KEYS: I think the biggest thing is that it's always a really great match.  When I think about it, I can't even imagine having to play one of my sisters.  I always imagine how difficult that must be for them.
Q. What do you look for when you watch both of them in terms of how they play, their body language?
MADISON KEYS: I mean, I think they both treat it as another match.  I don't think it's different for them.  I think they've played each other a lot.  I think they both go out, compete their hardest.  I would say there's not much different from either sisters' demeanor.
Q. What do you think the history of their matchups has meant to the sport?
MADISON KEYS: I think those matches are always legendary.  Everyone is always excited to watch them.  As far as matches of, you know, history in tennis, they're forever going to be those matchups.
Q. You didn't play New Haven this year.  You played it in the past.  Do you have a philosophy of playing or not playing a week before a major?
MADISON KEYS: I don't.  I think if I feel like I need matches, that's something that's lacking, then I'll play the week before.  But if I feel good and, you know, I feel like I have enough matches under my belt to feel comfortable going into a slam, then I won't play.
Q. Would it be fair to say that injuries have impacted this season in some way?  You haven't been able to get a lot of traction over the course of this season.  I noticed a number of abdominal and rib and wrist.
MADISON KEYS: Yeah, I got sick after the Australian.  Then I had an injury in Rome.  I mean, it comes with the territory.
Q. You haven't been able to put together a big run of matches.  Cincinnati was pretty decent.
MADISON KEYS: Yeah, I mean, I still had good results throughout the year.  I obviously would like to have been able to play more matches, but I can't change my body, so...
Q. It's healthy now?
MADISON KEYS: Yes.
Q. Considering you made the finals last year, you're here trying to make it that far again, trying to defend your points, do you feel any more added pressure this year?
MADISON KEYS: I feel pressure from your question right there.  Geez, God (laughter).
How many points do I have coming up I need to defend?
Well, I'm trying not too think of it that way.  Really just taking it match by match.  It's my first time having to defend a big result like that, so that's something I'm going to have to deal with every day.
The biggest thing is to not put pressure on myself and think it's a failed tournament if I don't make the finals or win.  For me, it's doing the things I can do to control the situation, see how things go.
Q. You said you couldn't imagine having to play any of your sisters in a tennis match at least.  Is there any sport or activity that raises the competitive level with you or your sisters?
MADISON KEYS: My sisters aren't really sports people.
Q. Any activity?
MADISON KEYS: No.  We're pretty smart, we don't really do that to ourselves.  We would have a lot more fights if we tried to get competitive with each other.
Q. Kurnic next.  You played her here before.  What are your memories of that particular match?
MADISON KEYS: Not great (smiling).  But I did play her again in Stanford a couple of years later.  She was a tough opponent at the US Open that year.  She played really well.  I feel like then the next time I played her I figured some things out.
I don't totally remember how either match went as far as game plan, but that's something I'm definitely going to look back at, both matches, and see what was working and what I need to focus on.
Q. When you're training for all these summer tournaments, do you do anything differently to train for the heat and humidity than you would ordinarily?  Also, what is your favorite cold beverage?
MADISON KEYS: I live in Orlando, so that pretty much checks dealing with heat.  It's pretty miserable there currently.  Having to play in that has actually been really great for me, has gotten me used to a lot of the summer conditions.
Favorite cold beverage?  Evian (holding up Evian bottle).  Thank you (laughter).
