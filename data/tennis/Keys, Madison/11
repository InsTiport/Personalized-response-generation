THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
 Q.  Can you just talk about just kind of what the preparation has been like for this tournament? Do you come in rested, do you come in tired, because it's the end of the season? What's, how are things?  
MADISON KEYS: I am as rested as I could possibly be, considering that it's the last tournament of the year for me. I got to go home for a little bit, which was nice. I came over a little bit earlier, just because I had to get used to the time change again.   
 Q.  Physically, how are you feeling? I know there's like bad luck earlier in the Asian season with your foot and everything. So how are you feeling ahead of this tournament?  
MADISON KEYS: Feeling pretty good. Foot's fine, knock on wood. Yeah, I mean, it's the end of the year, so everyone probably doesn't feel a hundred percent perfect, but all in all I'm pretty happy with how I feel considering where we are.   
 Q.  Can you share any memory about last time you played here and this time you're in the same group as Saisai again. Can you share any thoughts?  
MADISON KEYS: Yeah, this is my third time in Zhuhai, I was here last year and then I was here for the first year of Zhuhai. Always really good memories and it seems like the fans are always really excited to be here and to have tennis here, so just looking forward to playing another year here.   
 Q.  How about with Saisai? Can you talk about playing with her.  
MADISON KEYS: Oh, yeah, that was four years ago, so it's been a little while. I mean, I think things change a lot, so, obviously, just have to see how she's been playing recently, just because, I mean, four years is a while ago.   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in Chinese.   
 Q.  This is the third time you play in Zhuhai and last year you finished at the top of the group, but didn't make the semi-final because of physical reasons. This year we have seen that you have come earlier to prepare for the tournament. What is your expectation for your performance this year?  
MADISON KEYS: I'm hoping that -- obviously last year I was able to win my group, but unfortunately I couldn't play the semi-finals. So definitely looking forward to hopefully being able to finish in the top of my group again and do as well as I possibly can here. It's a great opportunity to have such a big tournament at the end of the year.   
 Q.  In this season we have seen the rise of many younger generation tennis players making breakthroughs in their career. Including Sofia Kenin and Yastremska does that mean you're going to be under more pressure when you're playing with the younger players?  
MADISON KEYS: I have to get out of my group in order to have to worry about that. So I'll, hopefully I do have to worry about that, but I don't have to worry about that until Saturday or Sunday.   
So I think there's been a lot of great younger players this year and obviously two of them did really well to get to this tournament and I don't think it's much of a change, I feel like there's always a really great group of younger players.   
 Q.  You went to the Lionsgate Park yesterday. Curious what you made of the experience and if it's inspired you to learn any sleight of hand magic or anything like that.  
MADISON KEYS: It was kind of full-on. It was definitely really fun, it's the first time I've done something like that. It was fun to go with Saisai. I just basically tried to make her do everything that I was afraid of. So it was nice to have her there with me.   
And as far as magic, every time I see it I always say that I'm going to try to do it and whatever and then it's really hard, so then I quit.
