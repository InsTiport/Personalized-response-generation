THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Congratulations.   Good day for you?  
MADISON KEYS:   Yeah.   Really, really excited and happy.  
   
 Q.   How does it feel to be in your first final?  
MADISON KEYS:   Oh, I'm so excited.   You know, I'm just really, really happy and ready to go for tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   What do you feel about your game today?  
MADISON KEYS:   I definitely think I served well.   When I had break points down, it definitely helped me out and got me back in some games.  
Then I think I just returned well a couple of games, and that was really the match.  
   
 Q.   Playing Angelique Kerber tomorrow, what are your thoughts on that match?  
MADISON KEYS:   She's a great player.   We have played before.   Obviously she's done really well, and she's constantly fighting.   
I feel like she loses the first set almost every round and somehow manages to pull it out.   But, yeah, no, it will be a really good match.  
   
 Q.   You have climbed the rankings very quickly in the last 18 months.   Have you surprised yourself how well it's gone for you?  
MADISON KEYS:   Yeah.   There has definitely been times when I kind of surprised myself, but then at the same time there is definitely still those not‑so‑great weeks and it kind of helps keep it all in perspective.  
   
 Q.   Obviously your first final.   How nervous do you think you're going to be and how much of an issue are you anticipating having to manage your nerves?  
MADISON KEYS:   I mean, obviously I'm going to walk on with some nerves, but at the same time I'm just going to go for it, first final, and I'm playing against someone who has won multiple titles already.   Really, I have nothing to lose.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel like the underdog?  
MADISON KEYS:   For sure, yeah (smiling).   
   
 Q.   Have you given yourself any time to think about Wimbledon while all of this has been going on?  
MADISON KEYS:   I mean, I have heard some things about it, but I'm mostly just focusing on this week and finishing this week and then moving on to Wimbledon.  
   
 Q.   Not even looked at the draw?  
MADISON KEYS:   No.  
   
 Q.   No?   
MADISON KEYS:   No (smiling).   
   
 Q.   Do you know that you hit a 123‑mile‑per‑hour serve in that match?  
MADISON KEYS:   Did I?   Hmm.   That's pretty good (smiling).   
   
 Q.   Is that the fastest serve you have ever hit, I'm guessing?  
MADISON KEYS:   Yeah, that's probably the fastest one.  
   
 Q.   Were you looking for that to be a strong weapon for you?  
MADISON KEYS:   Yeah, I was definitely struggling a little bit at the very beginning, but then I got my timing and, you know, I really started to feel good with it.  
   
 Q.   Are you comfortable on grass?  
MADISON KEYS:   Yes, I am.   
   
 Q.   Have you a background in grass‑court play at home?  
MADISON KEYS:   No, not really.   I first hit on it maybe two‑and‑a‑half years ago, three years ago, and kind of just instantly fell in love with it and have loved playing on it since.  
   
 Q.   It's your favorite surface?  
MADISON KEYS:   Yes, it is.   
   
 Q.   Was the first time you played on grass here in the junior competition?   
MADISON KEYS:   Yeah, I think that's right.
