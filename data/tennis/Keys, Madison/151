M. KEYS/D. Hantuchova
  6‑4, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Not a bad win today. 
MADISON KEYS:   No.

Q.   She's a pretty good player.   How do you feel about that?   Pretty happy about that? 
MADISON KEYS:   Yeah, I mean, I'm really happy about it.   I mean, I think I served well.   I think that really helped me today. 
I mean, she's a great player.   She's obviously done a lot in her career, so really happy to get through that one.

Q.   Next up, Li Na.   Thoughts on that also?
MADISON KEYS:   I mean, it's such a good experience, you know.   I think I have played her ‑‑she's probably one of the only ‑‑her and Radwanska are like the only two top 5 players I play on a continuous basis (smiling). 
So, I mean, we have played each other a couple of times, and, you know, she's a great player.   She just won the Australian Open so she's obviously doing well.
Yeah, just a good experience and excited to go play.

Q.   Do you want more variety in your opponents?   Do you want a crack at a Serena soon or something like that?
MADISON KEYS:   I mean, it is what it is.   It's how the draw is.   But I know Bethanie Mattek‑Sands and I always joking because we played each other eight times within a four‑month period. 
So sometimes that gets a little bit annoying.   But, you know, the draw is what it is.   Just always excited for the next match.

Q.   How much does it mean to you to be able to come to this tournament and be successful considering it's not far from home?
MADISON KEYS:   I mean, this is definitely my home tournament, so being able to come and do well and have the crowd behind me, it's always just such an amazing feeling down here.

Q.   People were lined up outside to watch you.   People were complaining, like, Why is she on the small court?   We can't get in.   When you hear that, you know, that this community, Florida welcomes you that way, how much does that add to your experience?
MADISON KEYS:   I mean, it's so incredible.   I mean, not only playing in the States but playing so close to home and, you know, people really embracing that and coming out to watch me is just‑‑ you know, it's really ‑‑I'm just really blessed to be able to play.

Q.   Do you remember the first time you were here?
MADISON KEYS:   Against Patty Schnyder. 

Q.   What do you remember about that experience? 
MADISON KEYS:   15, 14, something like that.   What I remember about that experience.   I remember after I lost I thought it was the end of the world and that I'd never play this tournament again.
Obviously that was false (smiling).   But, I mean, I remember playing on Grandstand.   I remember, you know, just being overwhelmed a little bit just playing here and trying to deal with all of that. 
It was a great experience.   I was really lucky to be able to play so young.
Yeah, I think, you know, just being able to play again, what, four years later, is, you know, amazing.

Q.   What has gotten easier about playing on these stages or losing, whatever, learning experiences you have had?
MADISON KEYS:   I mean, I think just doing it over and over and over again.   You kind of just get used to it a little bit more.   You know how to handle it, especially on the big stages with, you know, your home crowd behind you. 
You get used to it a little bit more.   You're used to the nerves and all that.   It's not as nerve‑wracking.   But, I mean, it's still such an experience to go out and have the crowd just to get really pumped up off of them.

Q.   You and Li Na are both Eisenbuddies.   Who do you think he will be rooting for?
MADISON KEYS:   I think he's going to be out in his car in the parking and lot and not even watching the match.

Q.   Do you do Eisenbuddy activities, like dinners or anything?
MADISON KEYS:   No.

Q.   Would you like to?   It's a fun group you have. 
MADISON KEYS:   We do have a good group.   We should talk to Max about that one.
