M. KEYS/M. Buzarnescu
6-1, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.
Q. So the love affair with clay deepens; is that true?
MADISON KEYS: Yes, I like it a little bit more now (smiling).  It's always a little bit easier to like it when you're in the quarterfinals, though.
Q. How important has patience been as a virtue for you over the last couple of years as you have progressed maybe not quite as quickly as you always would have wanted to?
MADISON KEYS: That's something that I have had to get better at in all aspects of my life, especially on the tennis court.  So I think it's become more consistently better for me and something that I'm always going to have to work on, but it's definitely something that's helped me become more consistent.
Q. This is the first time you have had a clean sweep of all the quarterfinals.  How much does that mean to you especially in a year where you have had to overcome a whole lot of injuries?
MADISON KEYS: It's awesome.  I mean, I can't really think of another word.
This was always kind of the one where it was the most difficult for me, and it was always the toughest one to feel like I could play well here.  So to be able to get to the quarterfinals really means a lot.
Q. Leaving aside the surface, how are you feeling in terms of the way your game is compared to, say, last September when you got into the US Open final?
MADISON KEYS: I think that it's -- I mean, it's always a little bit different, different year, different conditions and all of that, but I'm overall very happy.  I think the US Open, for me, was a lot higher energy and just because it was late at night and all of that.
So to be here and just kind of consistently getting through and just being happy with kind of low-drama matches has been really nice.
Q. If I could just elaborate on the patience issue, so in the second set when, you know, a few points got away from you, do you treat that and handle that differently than you would have a year ago, and if so, how?
MADISON KEYS: I would like to think so.  I think those are the moments where, when I got to the changeover at 5-4, I was just really just focusing on the little bits and pieces of information that I always try to tell myself before I go out for a serve, just to take out all of the nerves and thinking of the moment.
So little things like that help me build the point a little bit better, which all in all leads to making smarter decisions.
Q. Can you pronounce her name now?
MADISON KEYS: Buzarnescu?
Q. Better than me.
MADISON KEYS: Yes (fist pump).
Q. How much homework do you do?  How do you go about that?  Do you learn a great deal or do you keep it simple?  How do you approach it?
MADISON KEYS: It's always a tricky match when, one, you haven't played them, but I really haven't been able to see many of her matches.  I saw a little bit of her playing Svitolina the other day, but I try not to get too much information and start thinking about what she's going to do too much.  There is a couple of tactics where, where does she like to serve, what's her better shot, things like that.
But other than that, it's more focusing on what I can do to, you know, break down her weaknesses or things like that.
Q. It seems like almost every year here there is at least one woman who says she hates clay and then makes the semis here.  Maybe you're in that role this year, I don't know.  But how do you sort of manage the expectations game for yourself, knowing that somewhere you don't feel at your most comfortable or at least you think you don't always, and battle that, but also wanting to back yourself and do the best you can?
MADISON KEYS: I think, you know, even though it's still not my favorite surface, I definitely feel more comfortable on it.  I feel like this year especially I have been finding the balance of being a little bit more patient but also playing my game, whereas before I feel like I would go too far one way.  That's the biggest thing of just remembering how I like to play tennis but just maybe adding a couple more shots to each rally.
Q. You said that you have been fairly drama-free.  Your potential opponents thrive on drama I think is the nicest way of putting it.  Thoughts on either matchup.
MADISON KEYS: I think in a lot of ways they are very similar and in a lot of ways they are very different.  I have played both of them a couple of times.  I mean, it's one of those matches where you really don't know what to expect no matter who wins, and I'm just going to be sitting and waiting to find out who I play and then go from there (smiling).
Q. Tennis is such a tough game.  It can get really tough really fast.  When things are challenging, what are some of the unique things that you try and say to yourself to meet the moment or to be positive?
MADISON KEYS: My biggest thing is just focusing on what I need to do for my game and having one or two very specific things, whether it's, you know, forehands crosscourt or aim up the middle, just so that I'm not thinking of anything else.  I'm just thinking of that tactic and not the moment and it's a lot easier to handle the big moments that way.
Q. I know you and Lindsay's relationship has been grounded for a long time, whether or not she's formally your coach.  Can you sum up her impact on you, and especially in this sort of phase 2 that you have been in?
MADISON KEYS: Lindsay has been amazing for me in a lot of ways, but I think we have always really managed slams well, which, before I started working with her was always a tough one for me, especially managing my emotions.
But not only that, she's just really helped me enjoy the game, and she helped me through a really tough time when I was dealing with my wrists and all of that.
Having her in my corner, whether formally my coach or not, she's someone that I have always relied on, and I probably always will.
Q. For a player your age at this stage in your career, when you look at Serena's situation, 36 coming back after a pregnancy and obviously still having the fire, what's there to learn from that for someone like you, or do you view her as a bit of a one-off in terms of what she's like and everything?
MADISON KEYS: I think that Serena's obviously the greatest female tennis player and possibly the greatest of all time.  To see her coming back after pregnancy and doing so well and being so excited and happy to be on the court, it's not surprising at all, just because it's how she's always played tennis and it's how she has done everything in her life.
So I'm very happy that she's back on tour, but I'm definitely not surprised at how great she's been playing and how much fire she has on the court.
Q. Now that you're into the last eight of a slam and you're in the last eight club here, congratulations, is there an end-game mode you switch into at this stage of a tournament, eyes on the prize, while still being one match at a time?
MADISON KEYS: I think there is always a little bit of a different feeling between first week and second week.  First week, I just, like, my goal is to get to the second week.
Then once you get to the second week, every match obviously has more nerves, and there's more on the line and all of that.  So now it's really just managing your expectations and your nerves and the moment.
So I'm going to try to say that I'm just going to focus on one match at a time.  But it just makes it that much more difficult once you're, you know, one of the late eight.
Q. Can you just extend your comment a little bit about Serena?  She does just so many incredible things both on court and off court and is sort of a one of a kind.  Seeing her up close and personal, what really does make her special, would you say, just as a person and a player?
MADISON KEYS: I think the thing that makes Serena so, you know, great and one of the greatest of all time is just she takes everything with the same fire, and everything she does, it's always at an extremely high level.  If she puts her mind to something, you know it's going to be good.
And I think the thing that I love is that you can tell how much she cares.  She's obviously a very emotional tennis player.  So I think it's awesome to watch someone who is so, you know, doesn't really care what other people think but is going to go out there, and whatever she has to do to win, she's going to do it.
Q. On that subject, I presume you'll be watching the match tomorrow.
MADISON KEYS: What match?  (Smiling.)
Q. I think it's Williams/Sharapova.
MADISON KEYS: Hmm.
Q. What's your view on that?  And also your view on Sharapova's performance so far at this tournament?
MADISON KEYS: I mean, honestly, I haven't been able to see much of Maria or Serena.  My tennis coverage in my room has been a lot of the French players, and I haven't been able to find Maria or Serena or anything (smiling).
Unfortunately I haven't gotten to see either of them play very much, but I'm obviously a tennis fan just like everyone else, so I think I'm just as excited to see that match.
Q. Luckily all the French guys lost, but have you seen any of Sloane?  She's in your half of the draw, too, and she obviously has been a tough opponent for you and also a friend of yours.  Wondered if you noticed her in the draw, what your feeling is like, if you're happy to see her advancing or kind of wish she would get out of your way?
MADISON KEYS: Actually, during treatment yesterday I had Sloane on and was living and dying on every point in the end.  I saw her in the locker room, and I was, like, God you made me nervous at the end.  She was, like, You were nervous?
I mean, I always want to see Sloane do well.  I'd love for both of us to be able to be in the position to play each other multiple times.  I'd love to be able to get a win (smiling).
You know, I'm always cheering for her.
