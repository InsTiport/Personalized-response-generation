M. KEYS/S. Kenin   
6-3, 7-5   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Talk through when you started not feeling well, then talk through the match.  
MADISON KEYS: Yeah, it was super weird. Just kind of in the middle of the first set, all of a sudden started feeling not perfect. The end of the first wasn't feeling amazing.   
But luckily I was able to get through it. I feel like I played some good points in some big moments when I needed to. Just really happy I got through in two.   
 Q.  What was not perfect?  
MADISON KEYS: Just super nauseous. Won't give you all of the gory details. But, yeah, wasn't feeling great.   
 Q.  Do you feel like adrenaline was able to help you block it out during the points? How much were you feeling it throughout the match?  
MADISON KEYS: Definitely adrenaline and also just thinking and focusing on wanting to get it done in two. Knowing if I got to a third set, it was going to be that much more difficult.   
Really just trying to focus on each point. Every point became that much bigger. Was just really focused in on everything.   
 Q.  With Svitolina next, a person you played at the Australian Open, what do you think you'll be feeling like over the next couple days? What are the challenges of playing her?  
MADISON KEYS: I had no idea I was playing her, so... Thanks (smiling).   
It's going to be tough. I'm just going to go back and try to get better. Also just look at my match from Australia playing her, see what was working well and what wasn't. Just do what I can to execute better.   
 Q.  The doctor came out. Any thought you might not be able to continue?  
MADISON KEYS: No.   
 Q.  Do you think you're going to be good tomorrow, day after? Does this feel like it could linger?  
MADISON KEYS: I better feel better tomorrow. That's the plan, so...   
 Q.  Coco Gauff and Naomi Osaka play tomorrow night. What are your thoughts about that matchup, what Coco has been doing?  
MADISON KEYS: It's going to be a really fun match. I look forward to watching it. I think what Coco has done is amazing. Her ability to handle herself and everything that's come with her wins from Wimbledon, it was really, really incredible. The ability at 15 to be able to manage all that, have another really good run, is really impressive.   
I hope everyone is just very kind to one another in the match tomorrow.   
 Q.  You played Elina here two years ago, pretty epic. What do you remember from that match?  
MADISON KEYS: Just that it was really up and down. Turned out to be one of my best matches. Hopefully it's not like that the next time we play each other.
