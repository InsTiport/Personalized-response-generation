M. KEYS/T. Paszek
  6‑2, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Not unexpected given how well you've been playing.   She's a seeded player.   You have to be pretty pleased. 
MADISON KEYS:   Yeah, very happy.   You know, thought I played pretty well; happy with how the day went.

Q.   What was the key for you today? 
MADISON KEYS:   I think serving.   My serving definitely helped me today.   You know, in the first set when I got down Love‑40 when I was up 4‑2, I think being able to hold and come back definitely helped me out. 

Q.   Do you feel different in this slam versus the other ones you've played in the past?
MADISON KEYS:   I feel more prepared for this one.   My first US Open main draw, it was a big stadium and wasn't really used to it.   But I feel good about this one so far, yeah. 

Q.   What are the differences in terms of when you're on the court and how that manifests itself? 
MADISON KEYS:   I think it's kind of in everything.   You know, worked really hard this off‑season.   Think I'm in pretty good shape.   Working with a new coach.   It's been going really well.   Hopefully I can keep it up. 

Q.   I don't know if you saw Lindsay Davenport tweeted today that she hadn't had hope for a young American like you since Serena Williams.   How does that make you feel to get that kind of compliment?
MADISON KEYS:   I mean, it makes me happy.   You know, I think I've been working really hard.   I think it's starting to show. 

Q.   No nerves at all.   Have you felt any real nerves going on court? 
MADISON KEYS:   First round here was a little bit nerve‑wracking.   But I think today it was much better just having that one match under my belt.   You know, I was playing an Australian, big court, crowd was against me, but I felt like today I just played tennis.

Q.   When you were 14, you had that win in Ponte Vedra, and then you were at the French Open, the wild card, and you had a stomach muscle pull.   How long did that take you out?   Took a while to heal, didn't it?
MADISON KEYS:   I don't really remember, honestly. 

Q.   You have Kerber next round, a top‑five player.   A little bit different approach or just go out and try to rip it?
MADISON KEYS:   I mean, I think just really have to focus on playing my game and just worrying about me.   She's obviously a good player.   She's been around and she's done well the last couple years. 
I think if I just focus on what I'm doing, then it doesn't really matter. 

Q.   So both your parents are lawyers, right?
MADISON KEYS:   Yes.

Q.   Both still working?
MADISON KEYS:   Both are still working, yes.

Q.   How did you get from lawyers' kid, especially two working lawyers, to become a tennis player at this level?
MADISON KEYS:   Complete luck.   No one in my family plays tennis.   I just came upon it one day.   Just thought, Hey, I'll try it.   You know, it's worked out pretty well.

Q.   So you got addicted pretty quickly?
MADISON KEYS:   For sure.   Right away.

Q.   First time?
MADISON KEYS:   First time, fell in love. 

Q.   Went home and said, I got to play tennis every day; get me lessons? 
MADISON KEYS:   Every single day.   My parents fed me balls.   Eventually it turned into having a coach, and then it went to being at an academy.

Q.   Your parents don't play?
MADISON KEYS:   Neither one can play tennis.

Q.   What initially attracted you when you saw tennis for the first time?
MADISON KEYS:   The outfits (smiling). 
Really wanted a tennis dress.   My parents told me that if I played, they would buy me one.   I was like, Hey, I'll try it. 

Q.   Who were your tennis idols growing up?   Who did you like to watch?
MADISON KEYS:   Really, really liked watching Kim Clijsters.   I thought she was very passionate, and I thought her movement was incredible.

Q.   How old were you when you started, picked up the racquet for the first time?
MADISON KEYS:   I was four. 

Q.   How much of the transition, adjustment, I mean, you switched from Chris to the USTA, but it's on the same property.   Was there a big adjustment or... 
MADISON KEYS:   I mean, there wasn't a huge adjustment.   I mean, it's the same place, same courts, just different coach.   Working with someone different. 

Q.   Do your parents watch you play?   Are they watching on TV now?
MADISON KEYS:   Yes, they are.   My mom is in Illinois right now working.   My dad is in Florida with my little sisters.

Q.   They're watching you online?
MADISON KEYS:   Yes, they both watched me.

Q.   Do they get nervous?
MADISON KEYS:   My mom doesn't really get nervous.   And I don't think my dad gets very nervous either. 

Q.   Any chance they're going to come over if you advance a little bit further?
MADISON KEYS:   Probably not.   I think I'm here by myself. 
But I always tell them that they have to come like maybe next year.
