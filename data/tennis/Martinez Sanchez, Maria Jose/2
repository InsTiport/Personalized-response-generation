 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about what happened on the last point, what your interpretation it is?  
 MARIA JOSE MARTINEZ SANCHEZ: Well, I think it was a confusing. At the beginning, I thought she asked for challenge for her return, not for the serve. I talked to the chair umpire that it was too late, no?   
 So when I serve and he say that it was out, I thought 8-All, no. And then she ask for challenge, but I don't know why I was thinking it was 8-All, and I do the first serve. So it was a confusing.  
  
  Q. So you didn't know it was a second serve?   
 MARIA JOSE MARTINEZ SANCHEZ: Yeah, I know, but I don't know why before she has a challenge it was 8-All. And I was thinking on that score, I don't know why. I don't know. I was disappointing. I don't know what happened.  
  
  Q. But it looked like on your last serve that you hit a first serve.   
 MARIA JOSE MARTINEZ SANCHEZ: Yes, I had a first serve, of course.  
  
  Q. So the match was over and you're like, Oh, my God?  
 MARIA JOSE MARTINEZ SANCHEZ: Yeah. I thought it was 9-8 not finish, so I was disappointing. I don't know what happened, really.  
  
  Q. Do you think that her challenge was too late?  
 MARIA JOSE MARTINEZ SANCHEZ: Yeah. Yeah.  
  
  Q. What did the chair umpire say to you when you talked to him?  
 MARIA JOSE MARTINEZ SANCHEZ: He told me that he didn't know if she ask for challenge for the serve or for her return.  
  
  Q. What did you say?  
 MARIA JOSE MARTINEZ SANCHEZ: He told me that it was for the serve. And I said, I think that it was too late, but he she said no. She told anything, but I don't know about the serve or about her return.  
  
  Q. That's difficult at that point in the match, huh?   
 MARIA JOSE MARTINEZ SANCHEZ: Yeah, I know. I know.   
  
  Q. Have you talked to anybody since then, any officials?  
 MARIA JOSE MARTINEZ SANCHEZ: No, no.  
  
  Q. Like the referee to ask them if it was the correct call?  
 MARIA JOSE MARTINEZ SANCHEZ: No, I didn't.  
  
  Q. Do you plan to watch the replay?  
 MARIA JOSE MARTINEZ SANCHEZ: I didn't have time to do that.  
  
  Q. Are you going to watch the replay later on today and see for yourself?  
 MARIA JOSE MARTINEZ SANCHEZ: Well, maybe.   
  
  Q. What kind of positives do you take out of the match? It looked like it was a very tight match all the way through.   
 MARIA JOSE MARTINEZ SANCHEZ: Yeah, I think in the first first set I didn't play my best tennis. I was a little bit nervous. But see, also she didn't play so good.   
 It was a bad match for me and also for her. Sometimes you have to win without play really good, no? This is the more important for tennis. If you are top and you win when you are not playing so good, this is the more important thing.   
 But today, maybe if I put the serve on, the last serve on, I could win. But I make a mistake.  
  
  Q. Were the conditions a factor? The wind?   
 MARIA JOSE MARTINEZ SANCHEZ: Sorry?   
  
  Q. Were the conditions a factor? The wind seemed to be picking up.   
 MARIA JOSE MARTINEZ SANCHEZ: Yeah, uh-huh. I think so.  
  
  Q. It affected your serve or...   
 MARIA JOSE MARTINEZ SANCHEZ: Uh-huh. Well, I think she have a really different game, because she play with a lot of spin. It's not so easy to play against her.  
  
  Q. Do you feel very disappointed because of how the match ended?  
 MARIA JOSE MARTINEZ SANCHEZ: A little bit, yeah.   
  
  Q. A little bit or a lot?  
 MARIA JOSE MARTINEZ SANCHEZ: No, no, a little bit. It was a confusion. It can happen to anyone, but it was unfortunate, I think.  
  
  Q. Has that ever happened to you, anything like that, in your whole career?  
 MARIA JOSE MARTINEZ SANCHEZ: Maybe no. But with maybe with this mistake I can learn too much.
