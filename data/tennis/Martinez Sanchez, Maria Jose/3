 LLAGOSTERA VIVES, MARTINEZ SANCHEZ/Peschke, Srebotnik
  7-6, 6-4 
   
  Q. As a pair, you have started making winning a habit. What is the secret?   
 MARIA MARTINEZ-SANCHEZ: Well, you never know. We start losing 5-2 in the first set. In doubles, if you are focused all the time, you have a chance in every game, and we changed the match.   
  
  Q. A certain amount of the pressure goes off after they beat Cara and Liezel yesterday. Did you feel less pressure today because you didn't have to play them?   
 NURIA LLAGOSTERA: No, we were excited about playing the final. It didn't matter against who. We had good feelings because last match we played against Cara and Liezel, we won. It was really tough, but we won.   
 But we knew that today would be also very tough, even if it was not them, because these girls we know they play very good doubles. And really it was a tough match for us.   
  
  Q. What are plans for the rest of the season? I mean, do you have some sort of targets, the Grand Slams or the big ones or the one in Doha?   
 MARIA MARTINEZ-SANCHEZ: Well, in Doha, it was a very important tournament and we won. And after Doha, this is the second premier, $2 million and we won. And I think that now our next goal is to win a Grand Slam.   
  
  Q. This year?  
 MARIA MARTINEZ-SANCHEZ: Uh-huh.  
  
  Q. Which one?   
 MARIA MARTINEZ-SANCHEZ: Doesn't matter.  
 NURIA LLAGOSTERA: All (laughing).   
  
  Q. Who would be among the players who might be the top? You have black and Huber.  
 NURIA LLAGOSTERA: I think this pair can do very good if they keep playing together. Also there are many good doubles players.  
 MARIA MARTINEZ-SANCHEZ: Yeah, Raymond and Stubbs, Stosur also and Petrova.   
 NURIA LLAGOSTERA: Well, I don't know Schiavone and Kleybanova, they are also very good pair. But I don't know if they play all are year together or not. But there are like 10, 20 very good doubles players. I think not only them, I think every pair is dangerous. Because when we play, you know, now we have more pressure than we used to have because now we have better ranking, yes.   
 For us, I think every single doubles pair is dangerous. We have to be very serious and focused in every match. Doesn't matter against who we play or what ranking they have.  
  
  Q. In the doubles, I mean, especially in the women's doubles, I think it's a little bit of difference in the sense you have some legends on the men's side. You have the Bryan Brothers. But in the women's, do you sort of think at any time you'll want to be there like the legends?   
 MARIA MARTINEZ-SANCHEZ: Well, there are players like Black/Huber, and also Raymond and Stubbs, but especially Black/Huber they play all the time together.   
 I think this is the key. If you can have the same partner, you're in a long time. But in women's, it's difficult, no.   
  
  Q. And then you get a chance to even play Davis Cup and Fed Cup?  
 MARIA MARTINEZ-SANCHEZ: Yeah, I think that is important that we are from the same country, yeah.   
  
  Q. So the idea is to stick around together?  
 MARIA MARTINEZ-SANCHEZ: Yes, of course, yeah.   
 NURIA LLAGOSTERA: It's working, so (laughing).
