  6-3, 6-3 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. What was it like playing inside?   
 MARIA JOSE MARTINEZ SANCHEZ: Well, is different. Is a little bit more fast. But is okay. Better than wait all day.   
  
  Q. Do you think your experience playing together, this was the first tournament they played together, do you think that was sort of a big difference today?   
 NURIA LLAGOSTERA VIVES: Yes, I think so. They are good doubles players, but we've been playing for one year and a half already, almost two maybe. And we know a lot each other. We know how to play. Maybe that was the difference today.   
  
  Q. Does it take a long time for a doubles team to get in sync and find a rhythm?   
 MARIA JOSE MARTINEZ SANCHEZ: Yeah, I think if you don't always play with the same partner, is difficult to know your partner.   
 NURIA LLAGOSTERA VIVES: Also, we are not specialized in doubles. I mean, now, we are playing a lot of matches. Until now, we were not taking it seriously. We were just playing for fun and for play more matches, for playing more matches.   
 But now we seen that we are doing good, and now we are taking it seriously. Until now we were only singles players trying to play doubles, no?   
 MARIA JOSE MARTINEZ SANCHEZ: Yes.   
  
  Q. You will play doubles in New York?   
 MARIA JOSE MARTINEZ SANCHEZ: Yes.   
 NURIA LLAGOSTERA VIVES: Singles and doubles.   
  
  Q. Does that wear on your an awful lot or does it excite you because it's a Grand Slam so you don't mind playing both?   
 NURIA LLAGOSTERA VIVES: We are excited about playing both. Me, I'm very excited because I haven't been playing. These last tournaments I couldn't play the quallies. We were playing good in doubles, so I missed two quallies.   
 Now I'm in main draw, so at least I can play a singles match.   
 MARIA JOSE MARTINEZ SANCHEZ: We are trying to play the championship. Now we are in the race in the second position. So we have chances if we play good in US Open.   
  
  Q. Do your styles complement each other well?   
 MARIA JOSE MARTINEZ SANCHEZ: Yeah, I think so. Normally I come to the net always with the serve. We always do Australian, which is a good tactic.   
  
  Q. Was it important to get some tennis in today so that everything doesn't get backed up for the weekend?  
 NURIA LLAGOSTERA VIVES: Yes. I think we needed to play today because we don't want to be here without doing anything. There is a big tournament waiting for us. Maybe we'll have to play on Monday singles. So we need to get there as soon as possible.   
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
