D. ISTOMIN/E. Gulbis
  7‑5, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You were down a break in the beginning.   How did you turn things around?
DENIS ISTOMIN:   Yeah, I start really bad in the beginning, so I lost my serve in service game, and I just stay in the game, you know, and try to do what I have to do, so return and try to put the ball in.   So I knew that Ernests is a big hitter. 
You know, when you hit hard you have chance to miss.   I just need to be concentrate, which I did well from 4‑1 and until the end.   Yeah. 

Q.   Did you know he's been going through a struggling period?   He hasn't won a match this year yet?   Did that help you think, oh, this guy is pretty beatable?
DENIS ISTOMIN:   You know, Ernests can be losing like one year and then he can beat anyone.   You have to be concentrate, anyway.   He's a great player, top player.   He's top‑10 player. 
So, yeah, even some players they can lose, but like I say, he has very aggressive game, so if you don't feel a little bit so you miss a lot, and one point can, like, do the match, you know. 
For sure he will coming soon and start winning. 

Q.   How do you think you can help in sort of take tennis forward in Uzbekistan?
DENIS ISTOMIN:   I already did a lot, so I'm representing my country.   So a lot of player who is in Uzbekistan, they always trying to watch my matches. 
I mean, it's really good to be top 100, and for future tennis player in Uzbekistan, it's good opportunity.   A lot of kids coming to play now, so if it starts, then it's good.
