THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.


Q.  How do you feel like you played?  What do you take from it?  How do you describe it?

SCOVILLE JENKINS:  Didn't play too bad.  I mean, that's probably the best person I've ever played in my life, No. 2 in the world, defending champion.  Never seen a serve like that before.


Q.  When you were walking out on the court, even though you were walking out with one of the best players in the world, could you still get a sense of pride in what your accomplishments were?

SCOVILLE JENKINS:  Yeah.  I mean, what do you mean?  Say that again.


Q.  Could you feel a sense of pride walking out there on Arthur Ashe court, feel your sense of accomplishment, even though you have Andy Roddick walking out there with you.

SCOVILLE JENKINS:  Yeah, I mean, I feel like it's a great accomplishment, to be here at 17, and play Roddick.  I mean, that was a great accomplishment.


Q.  What is it like to return a 152 miles per hour serve?

SCOVILLE JENKINS:  I don't know, I didn't return a 152 miles per hour serve (smiling).


Q.  First service game, what are you thinking at that point?

SCOVILLE JENKINS:  I'm thinking, "Can he hit it any harder?"  152, I mean, there's nothing you really can do when 152's coming at your head.  By then I'm just guessing where the serve's going.


Q.  Did you miss shots today in the game out of nervousness that you might make at any other time?

SCOVILLE JENKINS:  Yeah, I did.  I was very nervous coming out there, especially in the beginning.  I missed a lot of shots I know that I could have made.


Q.  What has this whole experience been like?

SCOVILLE JENKINS:  It's been a great experience.  It's a learning experience.  My first year, I'm playing on Arthur Ashe Stadium against Andy Roddick.  When I come back, I'll be ready to go back on here because I came preparing for the worst, and this is the worst playing.  It's been a great learning experience for me.
