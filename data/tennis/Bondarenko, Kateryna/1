K. BONDARENKO/G. Muguruza
4-1 [Ret.]
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Did you notice anything wrong with her early in the match?
KATERYNA BONDARENKO: No.  We started like normal match, I think, every point.  First game was deuce and second game was deuce.  I think it was just normal start.
Q. Obviously not the way you'd want to win a match, but how does it feel to make it through here to the third round?
KATERYNA BONDARENKO: It's good that I'm through, but, yeah, it wasn't really a win.  She retired, so...
Q. Is your daughter here with you?
KATERYNA BONDARENKO: Yes, she's always with us.
Q. How does she enjoy kind of the setup of this tournament?  It must be nice to have the hotel and the site right next to each other.
KATERYNA BONDARENKO: Yeah, it's really good, because she can go sleep any time she wants.  Actually, when I play, she's going to sleep (laughter).
Q. Obviously not the first mother to go on tour.
KATERYNA BONDARENKO: Yeah.
Q. But how difficult is it?  You come with all your equipment, anyway, but...
KATERYNA BONDARENKO: Yes.  Well, it's difficult, but at the same time, it's very nice to have her around.  She makes me laugh just all the time.  It's much better with her than without.
Q. Does it actually help with your tennis?  You're more relaxed off the court?  Not just focusing entirely on the matches?
KATERYNA BONDARENKO: I think so.  Yeah.  Yeah, because I play with her, and I don't really think about anything else.  I just play with her (smiling).
Q. Your thoughts on potentially playing Caroline next, I think, Wozniacki?  Might be your next opponent?  Thoughts on that if she wins?
KATERYNA BONDARENKO: No, I didn't think about it.  I'm thinking just step by step, every match.
Q. What's the challenge of playing Caroline?
KATERYNA BONDARENKO: Well, for sure it's long rallies.  And then we'll see.
