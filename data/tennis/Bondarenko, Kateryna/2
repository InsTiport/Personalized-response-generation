 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. You had the chance to save the first set. You had the chance to win the second set, but you didn't. Can you explain that?   
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: I think even if I had a break point, she didn't give me any chance to win it. She just played unbelievable today. And when she was breakpoint down, she hit a winner.   
 I cannot really tell that I was playing bad. She was playing good.  
  
  Q. So what did you feel when you're going to the center court, when you're walk in corridor? What come to your mind?  
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: That I just have to focus on my game. I have to try to do my best and try not to think about that it's quarterfinal.  
  
  Q. You were too nervous?   
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: I don't think that I was too nervous. But, yeah, for sure I was nervous, a little bit.  
  
  Q. What positives can you take away from your performance in the tournament? It's hard, I know, after you've just been defeated. Can you take some positives away?  
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: No, I was playing good these two weeks and still had good result, quarterfinal. First time in Ukraine female got to the quarterfinal, so I think it's good result.
