 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Could you describe your feeling?  
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: Describe my feeling? Well, I am really happy and excited to be in the quarters. I think I just didn't look to the draw, so I didn't know who I am playing. Only just day before the match I find out who all the time.  
 So I'm just happy to be here.  
  
  Q. What does this represent? Big surprise? Happiness? You don't believe it?  
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: Yeah, maybe it's big surprise, but I was practicing for it, so just pays off.  
  
  Q. What do you think about the score?   
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: About the score?   
 Good score. (laughter.) I don't know what to tell you, actually. I'm surprised that it's 6-Love, 6-Love, and I'm really happy that it went that way.  
  
  Q. I might have missed it, but was there at all a revenge factor because she beat your sister?   
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: Maybe a little bit, but I didn't think about it that way. I don't know.  
  
  Q. Did you think about it before the match?  
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: No, not really. I just got some messages to do the revenge for my sister, so I start to think about it when I read the messages.  
  
  Q. Did she give you any tips?  
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: My sister?   
  
  Q. Yeah.   
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: No, not really. (laughter.)  
 She just was reading the book before my matches.  
  
  Q. Maybe the next round will be against Wickmayer. You beat her in Toronto. What do you think about that?  
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: I will see. She still needs to win her match.  
  
  Q. Why do you think you can play this level in this tournament? You are very consistent and you are very calm on the court. Why?   
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: I'm trying not to think about that it's US Open and that it's quarterfinals. Just it goes the way like this.   
  
  Q. Who do you prefer Kvitova or Wickmayer?  
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: I don't care.   
  
  Q. Some players like New York. Some of them don't. What about yourself? Do you like New York?  
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: Yeah, I love New York, and we have a lot of friends here, so I really enjoy to be here.  
  
  Q. Do you have time to visit?   
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: Actually, I went to the center park. It was really nice. And a lot of shops we've seen already.   
 Also some restaurants are really good.   
  
  Q. What about the atmosphere, the crowd? The stadium?   
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: I really like it, and I enjoy to be on big courts, because the crowd is always cheering for both of the players, not only for the one who they prefer.  
  
  Q. You're wearing a very beautiful jewel. Does it bring you luck?  
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: Thank you. I think so.   
  
  Q. Is it something special? Is it a gift?  
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: Yeah, it's gift from my sister for my birthday.  
  
  Q. When was that?  
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: 8 August.  
  
  Q. Did she buy it in the United States or were you already in Los Angeles?  
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: Yeah, she was in Los Angeles but came to Cincinnati, and I think she bought it in Los Angeles.  
  
  Q. Does it bring you luck?  
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: I think so.  
  
  Q. Are you surprised by yourself, or you are not surprised?  
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: Maybe a little bit. I don't know.   
  
  Q. Can you tell us something more about your matches against Wickmayer? First she beat you in Fed Cup, and then you had your revenge in Birmingham in the final.   
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: Yes.  
  
  Q. Your only victory up till now. Will it be a special match?  
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: Just another match. Nothing special. Just have to play my game and focus, as usual.  
  
  Q. What about your legs? You have big tape. Was it hurting or...   
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: It hurts a little bit, but it's getting better with each day, because the physios are doing really good job.  
  
  Q. Do you have some close friends from Czech, players on the tour over here?  
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: No, not really, but...   
  
  Q. You know some, right?  
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: Yeah, I know all the girls.  
  
  Q. And you speak with them. Do you know how the Czech describe the situation when they beat somebody 6-Love, 6-Love.   
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: I don't know.  
  
  Q. They call to give somebody canary, the small bird. When that happened last time you give somebody canary, and maybe you get canary from somebody? Somebody beat you 6-0, 6-0? Do you remember?   
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: I think it was long time ago.  
  
  Q. Did you think about it when it was 6-0, 5-0? I'm going to win this one double bagel?  
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: No. I didn't think about it: I was trying just focus on my game and every point.  
  
  Q. But are you still nervous when you're 6-0, 5-0 up?  
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: Actually, I was nervous whole match.   
  
  Q. More than in the previous matches? Are you getting more nervous match after match?  
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: No, I think it's still the same.  
  
  Q. You know, that you have a big draw, big possibility to go far in this draw. Are you thinking about that?  
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: I did not see the draw. Seriously, I didn't see it.  
  
  Q. You want to see it?   
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: No, thank you.   
  
  Q. Did you have a chance to talk with Alona after the match?   
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: Yeah, I did. She kiss me I think five times.  
  
  Q. Did she tell you what was the reaction of Princess about this win? Princess was crying in Cincinnati when you loss. She was very happy today, right?   
 KATERYNA BONDARENKO: I think she is very happy today. I think she is always happy when you feed her.
