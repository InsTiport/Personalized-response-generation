  Q.  Somebody said on the radio yesterday you suggested you might support a future boycott here if the prize money issue is not sorted out.  Is that, in fact, true?   
 KIM CLIJSTERS:  No, it's not that we support that.  They asked me if the players have thought about that.  And I said, Yeah, we've thought about it.  But, you know, that's the end, I think, option that we're looking at.   
 We're talking about it.  I think Venus wrote a really, really good article in the papers.  I think what she said in there just summed it all up.  I think she said what we all think.   
 Yeah, I think that she made her point.  I know it's not going to come down to that.   
  
  Q.  You don't think so?   
 KIM CLIJSTERS:  No.   
  
  Q.  Did you feel you struggled somewhat today to find your best form?   
 KIM CLIJSTERS:  I felt I played a good match.  You know, she's a tough player.  I played against her once in Hong Kong before Sydney, in an exhibition.  There, it was a close match.   
 She's a good kind of like a counter-puncher.  She likes to play fast rallies and likes to, you know, just stand on top of the baseline and just dictate the points.  And it was important for me to keep, you know, moving her side to side and not letting her play her game.  I think I did that really well today.  I served well and I think I played a good match.   
  
  Q.  You didn't seem as clinical when you had all those breakpoints in that one big game.  Do you feel there's maybe still room for improvement?   
 KIM CLIJSTERS:  There's always improvement.  There's always room for improvement.  Doesn't matter how good you're playing.   
 No, like I said, I felt like I played a really good match.  You know, I came off the court with having a real good feeling, and that's the most important thing.  That's what I'll take with me to my next round.
