 K. CLIJSTERS/A. Hlavackova
  6‑3, 6‑3 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Have you played under the Centre Court roof before?  
KIM CLIJSTERS:   Yes.   First day.   
In 2009 when we had the opening ceremony, that was the first and the last time.   
   
 Q.   Everything going well?  
KIM CLIJSTERS:   Yeah, I was very happy with the way everything went today.   I felt it was another step upwards from my first match against Jankovic.   You know, we had a long match before us, so I was really focused once I got out there and just really tried to be ready from the start.   
I was able to just keep my level up throughout that whole match.   I thought my opponent played, you know, a really tough game to read as well.   She was serving well.   So it was only a couple games here and there that made the difference.
