Q.  How frustrating is it to lose that match?  You were not far from winning. 

KIM CLIJSTERS:  It's frustrating, of course.  Every match you play, you want always to win.  If you lose 7-6 in the third, you feel more disappointed when you know you have the chance to do it, and I didn't.  In the tiebreaker , she started like with hitting good returns and she was moving good today, I think. 

Q.  Are you satisfied the way you played today?

KIM CLIJSTERS:  Yeah, definitely.  Especially if you look at the way Lindsay has been playing the last couple of weeks, I'm very satisfied.  I was feeling good on the court.  I was moving well.  I was returning well.  Yeah, I'm satisfied.  But, of course, it's still too early.  I'm still a little bit disappointed.  It's still too close.

Q.  It was tough by the end of the third set.  Did you think about what happened in Paris in the final, same kind of situation?

KIM CLIJSTERS:  No, not at all.  That's already such a long time ago.  I don't know, I feel like I forgot it already.  No, I was very focused.  I was only focusing on the match that I was playing right now. 

Q.  Is there something you can regret in this match?

KIM CLIJSTERS:  No, nothing.  Like I said, I'm happy with the way I played.  I fought until the end.  I gave myself 200%.  There's not more that I can do. 

Q.  So just one week to go, then you're going to deserve some good holidays. 

KIM CLIJSTERS:  Yeah, last week, then I've got holidays.  It will be nice.

Q.  Will you stay in Belgium?  Will you go to Australia?

KIM CLIJSTERS:  No, I'm going to Australia, to the sun (smiling).
