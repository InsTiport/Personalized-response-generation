 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Tough to pull off two great escapes in two nights, I guess. Don't put yourself in that position too often, do you?  
 KIM CLIJSTERS: No, I think tonight was going to be very tough obviously. But, you know, just didn't feel good out there. Just mentally, physically, didn't feel right.  
  
  Q. Was it just too many tournaments in a row or the shoulder?  
 KIM CLIJSTERS: I don't know, combination of a few things. Yeah, physically maybe. Tough few last days. But not in a way that I should not be ready for that. I train hard enough to physically be capable of doing that.   
 Mentally just kind of feel like I didn't have any fighting spirit. You know, it's obviously tough against someone like her. You know, against some lower-ranked players maybe it's possible to get through matches, but against somebody like her, not.   
  
  Q. How is your shoulder?   
 KIM CLIJSTERS: It's okay. It's under control.  
  
  Q. Did you think it affected your serve today?  
 KIM CLIJSTERS: No.   
  
  Q. How will you prepare the clay court season?   
 KIM CLIJSTERS: Um, I have no idea. I'm just looking forward to a break right now.   
  
  Q. How long will you take a break?  
 KIM CLIJSTERS: Well, can't be that long because we have Fed Cup in a couple of weeks. So probably be a few days, get settled at home, and then back to -- we're playing in Charleroi in the south of Belgium, so we're off to there.  
  
  Q. She won here two years ago. Does this seem like a good setting for her for any reason?   
 KIM CLIJSTERS: Um, I don't know. Did she already come in? You should ask her. Ask her. Up next.
