Q.  Three teenagers won today.  What do you think the chances are of one of you winning the tournament?

KIM CLIJSTERS:  If you see the players, a lot of the players have beaten the players that are still in the tournament.  Justine beat Capriati already.  I've beaten Lindsay already.  Jelena has also beaten a lot of top players.  It's hard to say.  I know in this tournament the top players are very focused than if you meet them in smaller tournaments.  Lindsay will be focused because she can end up No.  1.  Jennifer also.  It's very exciting I think also for the other players to see how this tournament is going to end up.
