  3-6, 2-1 (Ret.) 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Can you tell us what happened?  
 KIM CLIJSTERS: During my warmup today before my match, I just felt my left stomach muscle really, really tight, and when I started serving it just gradually got worse.   
 So before the match, I got taped to try and protect the muscle as much as possible so that I wouldn't make it worse. And during my match I just felt like, yeah, it just went worse and worse. Starts with the serve and then gradually, just doing rotations with your body, upper body kind of upwards, started hurting, as well.   
 So I already had an ultrasound here on-site, and I have a partial tear in my left stomach muscle, a little bit of blood.  
 So yeah. That's it.   
  
  Q. What does this mean for the US Open? Have you ruled that out?  
 KIM CLIJSTERS: No, not yet. Obviously, you know, I still have a few weeks until then, so we'll try to do everything to obviously be ready for the US Open.  
  
  Q. What are your plans for tomorrow, for the immediate future? What are you going to do in order to cure it? Do you consider playing in Cincinnati?  
 KIM CLIJSTERS: To have obviously a lot of treatment now the next few days, do more tests, and I will just take it one day at a time.
