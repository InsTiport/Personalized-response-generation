Q.  How have you built up the power in your game in the last year?  Through weights, running? 
 
KIM CLIJSTERS:  No, well I've been doing a little bit more.  When I had my shoulder injury, since then I've been doing a lot of shoulder exercises to stabilize my back and my shoulders.  For the rest, I got my build from my dad.  I've never really even touched weights or anything.  At the end of December 2002, I've been doing a lot of running and physical training with Lleyton's trainer, as well.  I've been working out with them.  I think it's been paying off.  
 
Q.  How close do you feel you are to the Williams sisters? 
 
KIM CLIJSTERS:  Well, I don't know.  I mean, I don't really think like that, in that way.  I just try to get the best out of my game, and then we'll see.  I've beaten Serena and Venus once before.  Every time I play against them, it's a different match.  I don't know how close I am.  It's really hard to answer that, I think.  Like I said, I try to get the best out of my own game.  I try to get as fit as I can and to try to be able to compete with all the other, you know, top girls that are up there.  
 
Q.  You said you got your build from your father.  What did you get from your mother?
 
KIM CLIJSTERS:  I think my flexibility.  She used to do gymnasts.  I mean, for a strong girl like me, I think I'm very flexible, as well.  So I think it's a very good mix to have.  I mean, so far, my shoulder injury has been my only problem, and I've never had any really big problems with my legs.  So that's been good.
