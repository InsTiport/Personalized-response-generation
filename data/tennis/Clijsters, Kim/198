Q.  Do you prefer Real Madrid or Juventus? 

KIM CLIJSTERS:  Juventus.

Q.  Which player in particular?

KIM CLIJSTERS:  No, not really one particular.  I like the team, yeah. 

Q.  Easy match?

KIM CLIJSTERS:  Yeah, it was.  I didn't expect it to be, to be this easy, especially because I was feeling a little bit tired after my matches in Berlin.  I think I played eight matches in four days there.  So that was a tough schedule.  But it was good that I got a late start and that I could play tonight as well.  It was not as warm, so I could get my rhythm, you know.  And, yeah, I was really pleased with my level as well.  I did well last year, so that makes me also come back and want to come back and play good.  So, yeah, that definitely helps as well.  If you have a tournament where you go back to and you've had a good result there the year before, it makes you even more motivated to do the same. 

Q.  After Miami did you have a break?

KIM CLIJSTERS:  Yes, I had a break.  I just was feeling  -- because I played so many matches, you know, in the beginning, from January until Miami.  I had a few weeks off, like one week here and there.  I always played singles and doubles, and in every tournament I went at least - in the singles and doubles - at least to the semifinals.  So I was really like dehydrated and exhausted at the end of Miami.  I was sick.  So I just went home and did nothing.  I just had a few weeks off, and then I started training again on the clay court for Fed Cup.  We played Fed Cup.  It was really nice.  It was, you know  -- I had a lot of fun at home.  It's nice.  Because sometimes I can spend two days, three days at home and then I have to leave.  Now, I was actually there for two weeks and it was, yeah, it was really nice.

Q.  What do you think about Rome, about the city and about this tournament? 

KIM CLIJSTERS:  Well, you know, I always play good at the tournaments where I feel good and where I like to go to, so Rome is definitely one of my favorite cities  - although, I think the driving and everything can be a little bit crazy sometimes.  I'm putting my seatbelt on straightaway (laughing).  That's the first thing I do when I hop in the car.  But, yeah, no, it's good.  I really like it.  Yesterday I went to  -- you know, my mom is here and a friend of my mom as well, so we went to shop a little bit near the Spanish Steps.  We had dinner there.  So it's really nice.  I think, you know, because there's so much other things to do out of the tennis that I think for me, it's good to have something else to focus on a little bit as well so you don't always have to think about the tennis all the time. 

Q.  Did you buy something?

KIM CLIJSTERS:  I did.  I bought some pants and a handbag and a shirt, so one outfit  - and a belt, too, yeah.  It was nice.  I went there and I didn't think ...

Q.  Which boutique? 

KIM CLIJSTERS:  It was Dolce  &  Gabbana, yeah.  It was nice.  I went in and I thought, "Oh, no," because in the beginning it's very fancy and they have the very special  -- but mine is just plain, just beige, normal pants.  Nothing too...

Q.  It's for people young like you.

KIM CLIJSTERS:  Yeah, yeah (smiling). 

Q.  Serena didn't play very well yesterday.  What do you think about this?

KIM CLIJSTERS:  Well, you know, I think the fact  -- this is the first clay court tournament she's playing so, you know...  I mean, if  I would have shown you a video of my match when I played Fed Cup, my first match on the clay, it was terrible.  So I think it's just a matter of getting used to  -- you know, tennis is a completely different game on clay, I think, and you need a lot of  -- you can practice as long as you want to, but you need the match rhythm on clay especially.  I think that's what she was just missing a little bit, but she still won in two sets.  So, I mean, so she's still strong enough even if she's not playing good at all, she can still beat some good players in two sets.

Q.  Do you have a good sensation for the red clay season? 

KIM CLIJSTERS:  I do.  You know, I don't think it's the best surface for my game, but I feel comfortable.  I always  -- I grew up playing on clay in Belgium, especially in the summer, so I enjoy playing on clay.  Like I said, you have to work harder and the rallies take a little bit longer.  Like on grass or on hard court, if I hit a good shot or a good serve, you know, most of the time it's a winner.  But here on the clay, you have to work and you have to expect every ball to come back .  Especially on clay, there's so many more good players as well.  The lower-ranked players are tougher to beat as well.  So every match is a tough one. 

Q.  Tomorrow you have to play against Black, Cara Black.  What do you think about her? 

KIM CLIJSTERS:  I've played her a few times, on hard court a few times.  She's a very tough, tough girl, you know.  She runs a lot, she gets a lot of balls back.  She has a good serve, good volley.  She's a good doubles player as well.  So I'll have to play as good as today, I think.  I'll have to be on my game, and I have to be aggressive because she's the type of player who, you know, I have to keep her under pressure and try not to let her get into the match.

Q.  For you, is it difficult to be aggressive?

KIM CLIJSTERS:  No, but I have to focus myself on doing it the whole match, because sometimes in the beginning  -- I always start well, you know.  I start playing well.  But then sometimes my game loses a little bit of concentration or, you know, I'm not focusing as much.  That's what I'm really trying to work on, is being consistent throughout the whole match.
