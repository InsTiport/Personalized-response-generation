Q.  Regarding Lleyton, he has a bit of an image problem in America. 
 
 
Q.  Do you feel it's a little unfair how Lleyton has been treated with the fine, just in general?  Is he a nice guy?
 
KIM CLIJSTERS:  I know he's a nice guy.  You have to see it both ways.  I think what the ATP did wasn't fair either, so you have to know the both sides of the story.  I know if the WTA would come up to me and tell me, you know, a few hours before my match that I had to do a half an hour interview, I wouldn't be happy either.  You have to know both sides of the story before you ask any silly questions, I think. 
 
Q.  Why do you think people have a bad perception about him?  Why do you think Lleyton seems maybe a little guarded with the press?
 
KIM CLIJSTERS:  I don't know.  You know, I don't think that's a question you have to ask me because I don't feel that way about him.  Maybe you have to ask some people in the crowd or something, not me.
