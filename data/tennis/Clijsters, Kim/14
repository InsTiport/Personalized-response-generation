THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   The scoreline suggested it was quite comfortable for you out there.   What are your thoughts?  
KIM CLIJSTERS:   You know, I think the conditions were tough today, as well, you know, going on and off court.   I think I managed to stay focused, you know, even when I won the first set, when we had to go back inside.   
It didn't feel easy.   At this stage of the tournament, you have to fight and you have to play some of your best tennis, and I did.   I felt like I was, you know, doing a lot of good things out there today, and was better, you know, served a little bit better at important points.   
So overall I'm very pleased.   
   
 Q.   Can you put to one side while you're playing a match the situation you're in with this being your second to the last tournament?   Is it tough to put it to one side or is it entering your mind?  
KIM CLIJSTERS:   No, it's actually surprisingly easy.   I'm here to play tennis, and that's what I'm focusing on.   You know, I don't think about it being finished.   I'm so used to, you know, for the last 17, 18 years, I've been focusing on my matches.   I'll do that until I play my last match.   I think that routine and that rhythm is there automatically.   So it doesn't change anything.   
You know, when I came here to Wimbledon a few weeks ago, you take your time to take a lot of things in.   You think about things a little bit more.   But once you're focused on your match, I mean, I don't think about that this is my second to the last tournament at all.
