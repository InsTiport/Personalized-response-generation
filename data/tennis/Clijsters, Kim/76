K. CLIJSTERS/P. Kvitova
  6-1, 6-1

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.

 Q. That looked like a really comfortable game for you. Was it?
 KIM CLIJSTERS: Yeah, it was nice to have a match like this, I think, especially after my tough loss in Indian Wells. I think it was just nice to come out here and be really focused and try to just be -- raise my level. 
 I think I've been practicing really well. It was just nice to, you know, take whatever I was doing really good in practice and really show that in my matches now. I think that was obviously what I was trying to always work on and trying to improve.
 In Indian Wells I kind of just felt like here and there there was a lot of really good things, but then at the important moments it I wasn't quite there. 
 I felt like today I was just really consistent and I'm very focused. I think that was something that was maybe missing a little bit last week.

 Q. Was it difficult to be on that court? 
 KIM CLIJSTERS: I liked it. I like playing on smaller courts, too. But I like playing night matches. Even with a court like this, I don't -- it doesn't bother me at all. 
 I was just waiting for the people to turn the lights on in the beginning of the match because it was getting really dark. I think I was only at 4-Love or 4-1 where they turned them on.
