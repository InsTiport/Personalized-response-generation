THE MODERATOR:  Questions in English, please. 
 

Q.I have a question unrelated to your match today.  As someone who's played in the Australian Open final, to lose the first Grand Slam, is it any more disappointing because then you can't win the calendar Slam?  How much does that factor into...
 
KIM CLIJSTERS:  Sorry?  Can you repeat that, because I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 

Q.The person who wins the Australian Open is the only person who has a chance at winning all four majors in the same year, okay?
 
KIM CLIJSTERS:  Yeah. 
 

Q.So to lose in the Australian, is it any more disappointing than the other three majors because now you have no chance at winning all four?
 
KIM CLIJSTERS:  Uhm, well... 
 

Q.Or is it something you don't even think about?
 
KIM CLIJSTERS:  No, I would not think about that at all.  I think, you know, as you said, it's probably not the right question to ask -- I'm probably not the right person to ask that question.  I think you probably have to ask the person who was in that situation. You know, it doesn't -- no.  I mean, it's not really something I think about, and I would doubt if a lot of other girls would think about that actually.
