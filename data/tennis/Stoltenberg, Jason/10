Q. You seemed to be in control in the first set, 5-2.....
 
JASON STOLTENBERG:  Yeah, I got an early break, 2-Love; then he broke back; got 5-2; never really felt comfortable all day.  I was up and down.  Really didn't have a lot of rhythm.  One of those days where it was a little gusty and tough, but, yeah, just disappointed that I didn't take it to him when I had the chance.  
 

Q. Last week you won a couple of tournaments in Cincinnati.  Is this a huge interruption in momentum heading towards the U.S. Open or is this not going to be a problem?
 
JASON STOLTENBERG:  No, I don't think so.  It is just one match.  I felt like I played reasonably well last week; got beaten by Muster in the third round, but the match before that I played quite well.  Today is just one of those days didn't play well.  Always got next week and I will try to prepare better for that one next week.  Four, five days 'til I play again, so I am not disappointed, but I am not panicking at this stage. 
 

Q. Do you feel anymore pressure or expectations going  into the Open given what happened at Wimbledon?
 
JASON STOLTENBERG:  No, not really.  I think it has taken a little bit pressure of me away.  I want to do well in the Grand Slams this year, and, you know, after losing first second round, I started to get a little anxious again trying to do well; taken a little bit of a load off my shoulders; hopefully give me the confidence to do equal as well at the Open.  Of course, it depends on the draw and how I do over those two weeks.
