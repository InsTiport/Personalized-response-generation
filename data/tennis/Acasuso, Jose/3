S. QUERREY/J. Acasuso
  6-3, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. You didn't really have many breakpoints in the whole match. Was his serve the key? 
 JOSE ACASUSO: Yeah. I think he served really good today. I had only one breakpoint, and he served good that point. And then I play good, but only two games. Then I play bad. He broke my serve. 

 Q. Can you talk about the difference playing indoors. Did that affect your game at all? 
 JOSE ACASUSO: Oh, I think it's the same. It's the same surface. But maybe it's a little bit fast, the surface. And the light, obviously. 
 But only that is the difference. 

 Q. Can you talk about where you think your game is going into the Open?
 JOSE ACASUSO: Yeah, it's a good week for me. I played four matches. I played the first three matches 2 hours, almost 3 hours, so that's good for the Open because we have to play best-of-five sets there. So it's good for me. 

 Q. You broke your racquet in the second set. What was the frustration? Not being able to return his serve?
 JOSE ACASUSO: No, because I not play good today. That's it. Only that. I not play like the other days, so... 

 Q. You were up 4-3 in the second set. He won the next three. What happened there? 
 JOSE ACASUSO: Sorry? 

 Q. You were up 4-3 in the second set. 
 JOSE ACASUSO: 4-3, yeah. 

 Q. Then he won the next three. What happened there? What did he do?
 JOSE ACASUSO: No, he served good in the 3-4, then I not play good my game with my serve. I make the double-fault. I don't know after that. 

 Q. Can you talk about your day yesterday as far as did you think you would be playing indoors yesterday at all. 
 JOSE ACASUSO: Yesterday we talked with the other players and we wait for play outdoor. But for today, the weather is no good. They say is rain all day so we move to indoor because, you know, the weather is no good for today. 

 Q. Obviously you'd like to be playing for a championship, but is it easier you can pack up and go to New York?
 JOSE ACASUSO: Sorry? 

 Q. Right now I guess you just go to New York. 
 JOSE ACASUSO: Yes. 

 Q. If you won, you would have another day of looking at the weather, seeing if you could play tonight. Is it better to lose almost?
 JOSE ACASUSO: No. I want to win. I go to New York now. That is good. But I want to win the match and play the final tonight.
