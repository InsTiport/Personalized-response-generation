  7-6, 1-0, Ret.

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Can you tell us what happened?
 JOSÃ ACASUSO: I don't know. I'm not sure. I feel pain yet in my knee. 

 Q. The left?
 JOSÃ ACASUSO: Yeah, the left one. It's starting at the US Open and still I feel the pain in Kuala Lumpur and last week in Beijing, so now I go back to Argentina tomorrow.

 Q. How do you think you were playing during the match besides the pain? 
 JOSÃ ACASUSO: I play good. I broke his serve 2-0 and then I feel the pain all the time, so I don't know. I feel I play really good in the last three weeks, and especially in USA. But, I mean, I feel the pain in my knee, so I can't run, and I feel the pain all the time. 
 But tennis I feel okay. I feel good. 

 Q. I'm really sorry for you quitting the game. I guess it's a tough decision. I just want to know, what's your impression of this city, Shanghai, impression of Shanghai?
 JOSÃ ACASUSO: Great city. I like it, yes. City like Europe, I don't know, United States. It's a very nice city.

 Q. Do you think that -- I mean, the injury, is a bad one? Do you think this could be the end of the season for you, or is it something small that you think you'll be able to play in the indoor European tournaments, or is the season over for you? Do you have a feeling, or... 
 JOSÃ ACASUSO: I don't know. I go back to Argentina tomorrow, and first of all, I try to play in Europe. I have to play Vienna and Valencia, so I try to play there. 

 Q. You said it's been bothering you since around the US Open. Have you talked to a doctor about it, and have they given you any idea of what it might be and what to do?
 JOSÃ ACASUSO: The trainers, ATP trainers, they told me -- I don't know. I feel the pain in the meniscus, but I feel inside the knee, but I don't know what -- I go back to Argentina tomorrow and I check with my doctor.

 Q. Is it the same thing as against Monfils at the US Open?
 JOSÃ ACASUSO: Yeah, yeah. 

 Q. Both you and Del Potro are from Argentina. How far do you think Del Potro can go in the ATP series here?
 JOSÃ ACASUSO: He's a great player, and I think can win this tournament, player like Nadal and Djokovic, I think.
