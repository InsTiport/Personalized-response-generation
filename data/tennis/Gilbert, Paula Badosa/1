THE MODERATOR:   Questions in Spanish.   
   
 Q.   Tournament is over.   You have lifted the trophy.   What was the most difficult part of it?   I mean, you are playing against favorite players, good players, but last year you were not the favorite.   That's why it was tough at the start.   What were the difficulties?  
PAULA BADOSA GIBERT:   Yes, it was very difficult for me to come to terms with the fact that I was playing in a big tournament.   I handled the situation well and I'm very happy, because I can manage the whole pressure around Grand Slam tournaments.  
   
 Q.   Will you become a pro player or will you continue to play junior tournaments?  
PAULA BADOSA GIBERT:   I will focus on professional tournaments and I will try to improve my ranking.   Maybe I will play at the Australian Open, but I will continue to play ITF and WTA tournaments.  
   
 Q.   We have been talking about the future, but what are you going to do for the next weeks?   Which tournaments are you going to play?   You have just won the juniors tournament.   What do you think of that?  
PAULA BADOSA GIBERT:   It's incredible.   It's amazing.   Lifting the trophy is outstanding.   Winning a Grand Slam is a great achievement.   I'm delighted with it.  
   
 Q.   We don't know you as a player.   How are you, and can you describe yourself?   
PAULA BADOSA GIBERT:   A very aggressive player.   I serve well, and I think that that's all.  
   
 Q.   (Off microphone.)  
PAULA BADOSA GIBERT:   My idol was Sharapova all the time.   I like the way Sharapova plays tennis, even though I cannot compare my tennis with that of Sharapova.   
   
 Q.   So we have some players, tennis players, some Spanish tennis players, and there is a wave of new generation of players.   Are you practicing with Carla?  
PAULA BADOSA GIBERT:   Yes, I have been practicing with Carla.   We have GarbiÃ±e, who is also very young.   
We have Sara Sorribes.   We have also Bolsova.   I can tell you that women's tennis in Spain hasn't been in the headlines recently, so it's good this achievement now that I have made.
