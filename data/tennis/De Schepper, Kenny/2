J. CHARDY/K. De Schepper
  7‑6, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French, please. 

Q.   At the end of the first set you yelled in anger for a long time.   Did you believe you could win that set?   In the beginning you seemed to be the fitter player on the court. 
KENNY DE SCHEPPER:   Well, I was rather frustrated because of the set point I played.   That's why I yelled. 
But I was there to win that match, and I was not looking at my opponent.   I was frustrated at that moment, but this is a good thing, I believe. 

Q.   It seems stupid, but you were slipping a lot.   I mean, you were sliding. 
KENNY DE SCHEPPER:   Well, this is something I do very often.   That's why my shoes don't last a long time. 

Q.   But it's rare to fall so often.   Indoors, at least. 
KENNY DE SCHEPPER:   Yes, it happens to me quite often, like GaÃ«l.   When I try to get a dropshot, sometimes I slip and fall.   But I try to control it. 


Q.   Jeremy said just now he was surprised to see you play so well from the baseline.   What did you think about this?
KENNY DE SCHEPPER:   The baseline, you're saying?   Well, thank you. 
I always play well from the baseline, but I believe now I'm moving a bit better.   I believe I'm a more complete player now, and my game is starting to make it more difficult for other players more and more, and I believe this is a sign that I'm improving. 

Q.   What did you do during the two matches?   After the singles you were opponents, and suddenly you had to become friends again. 
KENNY DE SCHEPPER:   That's not a problem.   We get along very well.   I have seen him on the tour for a long time now.   I get along well with him, and we knew each other when we were young, too. 
So there is no problem.   During the match we're really opponents and we fight hard, but after there is no problem. 
Well, we were a bit tired, though.   But for the doubles, we did the best we could.   Unfortunately we lost. 


Q.   When did you start playing?
KENNY DE SCHEPPER:   At eight years old.

Q.   I mean with him. 
KENNY DE SCHEPPER:   I played him in the quallies for a competition called Les Petits As, and I played him also in the French Cup three or four times.

Q.   What is your schedule now?   How do you assess this season?
KENNY DE SCHEPPER:   I believe this season was a good season.   I had a letdown during the summer, but otherwise, I'm quite pleased with my level of game and how I behave on the court.   My mental attitude is good, and I'm going to use that to start next year on a good basis and to work on it.


Q.   What were your tactics against Jeremy?   What was your game plan?   He was making mistakes in the beginning. 
KENNY DE SCHEPPER:   Yes, he was making quite a lot of mistakes, but I wanted to hold my serve, most of everything. 
And also, he can be very dangerous with his forehand.   He sometimes turns around his backhand, so what I wanted to do is open up the court for my shots.
