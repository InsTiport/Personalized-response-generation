Q.  What was the experience like, going out there on Ashe Stadium?

LAURA GRANVILLE:  I mean, it was great.  It was I think a very difficult experience because I haven't played on anything even close to the size of that stadium.  But I think I just have to chalk it up to experience.  I think it was just a great experience to be able to play on that court.  You know, hopefully in the future I'll be more comfortable on it.

Q.  If you had to say the one biggest difference between playing at Ashe Stadium and other stadiums, what would that be?

LAURA GRANVILLE:  I think it's not even close.  Taube Stadium I mean, they're just so different.  I really couldn't think of anything that was similar. 

Q.  Were you ever in a position where you had a very difficult decision to make about whether you would turn pro or go to college?  Was that a decision a couple of years ago that you had to make?  Was it hard for you?

LAURA GRANVILLE:  No, it wasn't hard at all.  Well, I always wanted to go to college.  So two years ago I knew I was going to go to college.  It wasn't even a decision.  Last year, I thought about it a little.  But I really wanted to stay and have another year.  I was really enjoying it.  So I think going into college, I always thought I would either stay two or four years.  It really wasn't that difficult a decision.

Q.  Is it two or four now?  Have you decided?

LAURA GRANVILLE:  I turned pro a couple months ago. 

Q.  Do you have your degree from Georgia?

LAURA GRANVILLE:  No, I don't. 

Q.  It's Stanford. 

LAURA GRANVILLE:  I have two more years.

Q.  What are you studying?

LAURA GRANVILLE:  Actually, I didn't declare a major because I want to declare it when I go back.  Leave it open.

Q.  When you play somebody like Martina Hingis, who clearly had a jump-start on you in terms of the professional circuit, are there any regrets at all, or not really?

LAURA GRANVILLE:  No.  I mean, I think it's not easy for anyone to start out.  I've enjoyed the summer.  You know, I've played a lot of challengers.  I mean, there are no regrets.  I think in two years, if I'm not enjoying it, there might be regrets.  But right now, not at all.

Q.  Where were you when you found out the draw?

LAURA GRANVILLE:  I was in New Haven practicing.

Q.  Who told you?

LAURA GRANVILLE:  Ashley Harkleroad actually did.  She saw it first. 

Q.  What did you say?

LAURA GRANVILLE:  Actually, I didn't want to see the draw at first.  I was just asking her who some of the players played.  She kind of gave it away, so...

Q.  When you got that break in the first set, it looked like it was a little distracting for you, there was a bit of a down after that.  Did you find it distracting?

LAURA GRANVILLE:  No.  I really can't explain it.  For some reason, I just wasn't comfortable out there.  I just couldn't get any of my shots  -- I couldn't get really a rhythm.  I mean, there was no reason why.  I mean, Martina played well.  I just wasn't able to see the ball and get into a rhythm.

Q.  Did you expect a wildcard here? 

LAURA GRANVILLE:  I thought I might just because I won the NCAAs, but I wasn't sure.

Q.  When did you hear about it? 

LAURA GRANVILLE:  Actually, I think I heard about it maybe like when it came out, I think it was a week before the tournament.  I really don't remember where I was. 

Q.  People have been saying this might be Martina's year not to get very far in the tournament, she may be vulnerable.  Did you feel that out there?

LAURA GRANVILLE:  Well, I mean, I know she hasn't played as many tournaments this summer.  You know, it might not be.  It's hard to say.

Q.  You played Martina.  One of the Bryans has to go up against Patrick.  Tonight the other Bryan goes up against Agassi.  There's a conspiracy theory going around that the draw has been rigged by someone from Cal.  Can you comment on that? 

LAURA GRANVILLE:  I mean, it's just luck of the draw.  Stanford players didn't get very lucky this year.  You know, hopefully next year we'll get better draws. 

Q.  On television they showed you saying you had a tough time getting to sleep last night.  Can you talk about that?  Were you up very late?

LAURA GRANVILLE:  Well, I think actually I just had a hard time getting to sleep.  Otherwise, I think I'm just generally kind of tired from the whole summer.  You know, I've been on the road for most of it.  I don't think it was just last night's sleep.

Q.  There's some debate whether a player can go to college and emerge as an elite player on the tour.  Could you comment about your college experience, whether it was good for your tennis, good for you as a person?

LAURA GRANVILLE:  Well, I think college tennis  -- you know, I think it's good.  Well, let me start over.  I think college tennis is really good for someone as a person.  I think I matured a lot over the two years.  I really can't imagine playing the tour without it.  But as to the tennis game, you know, I think it's probably better to go out there and play against the best players in the world.  You know, college tennis is good for developing your game, but you're not playing against the best players.  I would say it's probably better if  -- it's a good decision if you want that time to mature as a person, and you just don't feel ready to go on the tour and make tennis your job. 

Q.  Has your regimen for working out, physical fitness, changed the last few months?  Has it upgraded dramatically at all?

LAURA GRANVILLE:  Not that much, just because I've been playing a lot of tournaments and haven't had that much time to really train.  But, you know, in college tennis, you do still play a lot of tennis.  You play, you know, two hours a day, then you do fitness.  I would say that I probably am playing a little bit more.  You know, then again, it's hard to play and train really hard when you're playing tournaments.  I mean, I think this fall, you know, I'll probably play more and train harder just because I have no other distractions. 

Q.  Will you take a quarter at all at Stanford?

LAURA GRANVILLE:  Now? 

Q.  Yes. 

LAURA GRANVILLE:  Probably not.  I'll probably go back whenever I decide to stop playing tennis. 

Q.  A little disappointing that you're in a big stadium like this, US Open, so few fans?

LAURA GRANVILLE:  I don't think it was that disappointing just because it's kind of overwhelming as it is.  I mean, there was a decent amount of fans.  But it's the first day.  You know, it's early.  It's like 11:00.  I wasn't expecting that many anyway. 

Q.  When you come back here next year, where do you want to be in your game?  What are your thoughts? 

LAURA GRANVILLE:  Well, I'm setting high goals for myself just as far as developing my game in the next year.  I really don't want to put any goals on results or rankings.  I think just getting myself better in every way, ready to compete against the best and the better players on the tour.  So I think I'm just going to focus on my game more. 

Q.  As someone who has played Martina, what do you think of all the scuttlebutt about her demise?  What do you make of that?

LAURA GRANVILLE:  Well, I mean, I think that just because she's not winning every Grand Slam, I just don't really buy it that much.  I mean, she's still doing well.  She's still ranked No.  1 in the world.  You know, it's not all bad.  She's still doing really, really well.  You know, the Williams have come on the scene.  Capriati has come back.  There's tough competition for her.  I mean, she can't win them all.
