THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

Q. What is it that makes Coco so good on grass?
ROBERTA VINCI: Well, she's a great player, especially on this surface. She has a good serve. She hit every single shot. Today she play a good game. She play better than me, especially with the serve.
That's it. I knew it was a tough match, tough third round. She's in confidence. She play good in Birmingham, I think. That's it.

Q. Do you feel her confidence when you're across the net from her? At least watching you see how confident she is?
ROBERTA VINCI: Yeah, especially with the serve. Yeah, she won a lot of points with the serve. I saw 115, 114 serve. So strong. 
Also, the second serve, I had difficult to return. Good kick. She deserve to win today.

Q. Was it just a question of power today or her confidence, as well?
ROBERTA VINCI: I don't understand you. Sorry.

Q. Was it her power that defeated you today? Power? 
ROBERTA VINCI: Power? Yeah, she's strong. She has a lot of power. Yeah, so strong. The return. She always was close to me.
It was tough for me today. She play better than me. So that's it. 

Q. Do you think that she can win this tournament?
ROBERTA VINCI: I don't know. If she play like this, why not? I don't know. She has a good chance in this surface.
