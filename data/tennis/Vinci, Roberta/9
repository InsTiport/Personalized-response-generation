An interview with:
ROBERTA VINCI
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What is your take on the match you played this afternoon?  Was there a turning point in the match, something that happened?
ROBERTA VINCI: Yes.  Was, of course, a tough match.  She's a young player.  She's an intelligent player.  Today was a different match than yesterday against Giorgi.  Was completely different.
But I think she play better than me today, more consistent.  Probably my serve was not good today.  I play so many second serve.
She play better than me today, so that's it.
Q. You faced her before today?
ROBERTA VINCI: Yeah, I played against her in Doha this year.  I won 7-6 in the third.  I saved two or three matchpoints.  Was a tough match, too.  I knew it would be a tough match.  She's young.  She's always improving her game.  Yeah, she's good.
Q. What part of her game makes you...
ROBERTA VINCI: She's a regular player.  She plays a lot of spin on my backhand.  I have one backhand, so was tough for me.  I tried to play more aggressive with my forehand.  Sometimes was tough.
She serves better than me today, a lot of kick.  Yeah, she's good.  She's a great player, yes.
Q. When you say she's an intelligent player, what do you mean by that?
ROBERTA VINCI: I think she has a good hand, good tactics.  She plays good forehand, high.  Sometimes she try to play also back, good back.  She has a good kick.
She's not like, you know, all the players, poom, poom.  She's a little bit more, yeah, intelligent.  The point is always a lot of rallies.
She miss not a lot today.  Probably she's in confidence, too.  She's young, 19 years old.  I'm 33, c'mon (laughter).
She has a good future, yes.
