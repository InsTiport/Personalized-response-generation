THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Talk to me about the keys to the victory.   She got off to a fairly quick start.   You got back in the second and third set.   What was important for you today?  
ROBERTA VINCI:   Yeah, it was a tough match today.   She's a great player.   She played a good first set.   
I won the second set, and the third I was 3‑Love down.   I know it was difficult.   A lot of wind especially on one side.   On the third I tried to play aggressive and to try to put a lot of balls in the court because she's ‑‑ sometimes she play an unbelievable game, and then after not so good.  
So she has a lot of up and down.   Was tough, but I think ‑‑I didn't play good tennis today.   But important thing was won.  
   
 Q.   Sometimes it's not about playing well.   It's about the fight and the experience and all that, right?  
ROBERTA VINCI:   Yes, yes.  
   
 Q.   And she's, like you were saying, she has a great forehand, moves pretty well.   
ROBERTA VINCI:   Yeah, she's a great player.   She's strong.   Strong player.   
I told you sometimes she played unbelievable tennis, and sometimes she play so bad.   The important thing for me was to stay, fight, and try to play good tennis.  
   
 Q.   When someone's like that, sort of up and down, good and bad, is it hard to keep your concentration?  
ROBERTA VINCI:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   Because you don't know...   
ROBERTA VINCI:   Yeah, it's tough.   You never know how she play.   Sometimes good; sometimes bad.   For me, was tough.   Especially because it was a lot of wind and it's not easy to play, to playing confident.   
But in the end she play so bad, and probably she's not in confident and that's why I won today.  
   
 Q.   So how do you feel about your level since you have come back to play on hard courts over the last couple of weeks?  
ROBERTA VINCI:   Well, in San Diego I played a good game.   
   
 Q.   Against Mattek?  
ROBERTA VINCI:   Yeah, yeah.   I won against Mattek, and I lost against Ivanovic.   But I played a good game there.   Here, I won.   This is important, and I try to play much better in the second round.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel like you got enough of a mental break after Wimbledon to sort of refresh yourself?  
ROBERTA VINCI:   Well, after Wimbledon I played Palermo and I won there.   Was on clay.   I started to play on hard season in SanDiego, so now I have this one, and then Cincy and New Haven, try to play, try to be in confident for the US Open.  
   
 Q.   So basically no vacation?  
ROBERTA VINCI:   No vacation.   Just three days or four days.   That's it.  
   
 Q.   But I'm sure you want to play in Palermo because obviously you're from Italy.   
ROBERTA VINCI:   Yes, but I live there.   So that's why I played.   
   
 Q.   But it's not so easy, given the big effort you put in the clay court season, Roland Garros, Wimbledon, and then almost no break?  
ROBERTA VINCI:   Yeah.   I know, it's tough.   But, well, I prefer to play.   I know that I need some days of vacation, but probably at the end I prefer to play tournaments, matches, to be good in U.S. or this season.  
   
 Q.   Mentally, that isn't a big battle if you're playing every week?   Because you play doubles too.   
ROBERTA VINCI:   I know, I know, I know.   It's tough.   But after Palermo I had four or five days off and then SanDiego.   But it's okay.  
   
 Q.   Let me switch topics to Fed Cup final.   
ROBERTA VINCI:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   I assume you have been to Sardinia?  
ROBERTA VINCI:   Yes.   We play in Cagliari.  
   
 Q.   It's a club?  
ROBERTA VINCI:   Yes, I think so, yes.   
   
 Q.   Is that where you wanted to play?   You didn't want to play in Rome or Milan?   
ROBERTA VINCI:   We like to play outside, on clay and outside.   
   
 Q.   It's sort of warm there in November?   Not so warm?  
ROBERTA VINCI:   Not so warm, but I think it will be nice.   It's a nice city, nice island.  
Well, we play outside on clay, and we will see.   We hope a lot of public, of course.   We will try...   
   
 Q.   And hoping Sharapova does not play outside on clay?  
ROBERTA VINCI:   I hope not.   (Smiling).   
   
 Q.   Or would you rather just have her play because you want to beat the best players Russia has?  
ROBERTA VINCI:   Well, Russia, there are so many players, so many good players.   So I don't know.   Sharapova, Kirilenko, Makarova, Vesnina for doubles.   They are strong.   But we play in Italy, so better for us.
