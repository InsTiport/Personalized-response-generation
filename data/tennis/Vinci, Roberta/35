  6-4, 7-5 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Did you feel that the wind was a factor in the match today for you? How did you feel or deal with it?  
 ROBERTA VINCI: Well, I wasn't confident. Today was so hard to play, and I saw that Caroline, she makes a lot of mistake, especially in the first set.   
 So yes, yes, I think that I can win today, yeah. Was not easy, but I can. I can do it.   
  
  Q. I was wondering where that win ranks in your career in terms of all your victories. Did you do anything different last night to prepare against someone who was ranked No. 1? Did you eat anything differently or do anything differently?  
 ROBERTA VINCI: No. No, nothing special, nothing -- no change. I have the same coach, same trainer, same friends. No. (Laughter.)  
  
  Q. What was, I guess, going through mind as you started rallying back? You're down 5-1, picking up a game at a time. At what point did you say, I'm gonna take this match?  
 ROBERTA VINCI: Yes, I was 5-1 down, but I knew that that I can win the set, because as I told you, it was a lot of wind, so some mistakes, some balls -- I was focus every point.   
 I tried to stay, yeah, focused and play aggressive, some slice on her forehand when was possible. And that's it. I think this is the key that I won the set.  
  
  Q. Where does this rank on your wins in your career? Is this the greatest win?  
 ROBERTA VINCI: This is the best win, victory in my life. Yes.
