THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
   
 Q. It's been a couple of years since you had a first‑round win at Wimbledon. What did today's win for you?  
ROBERTA VINCI: I'm happy. Finally I won a match here in Wimbledon. First round is always tough. My opponent today was a great player, especially on this surface.   
But I played a good first set, a lot of chance to win the second set, then on third, 3‑1 down, but I'm try to play aggressive, try to play my game. At the end, I was a little bit nervous. A lot of match point saved.   
But I'm happy. Finally I won. I'm really, really enjoy today to play.   
   
 Q. Was it important for you to have a test at this stage of the tournament?  
ROBERTA VINCI: To have a test?   
   
 Q. Yes.   
ROBERTA VINCI: Is always tough. The draw is always a good draw. The first round is always, for me, the worst, the worst match. So at the beginning I was nervous. Before my match, I spoke a lot with my coach about today. I try to stay quiet, think on my mind always to push. Don't think about the results. Try to play focused every single point until the end.   
Today I did it.   
   
 Q. You entered this tournament with a career‑high ranking. Is your confidence still growing at this stage of your career?  
ROBERTA VINCI: Sometimes yes. Sometimes a lot of pressure. Well, I'm the top 10. I'm 6. I'm so happy. I play today on Court No. 3, a good court. Of course, I'm happy. I like to enjoy this tournament, of course, try my best. Every single match will be tough. But step by step.   
   
 Q. What are your thoughts on the Euros and Italy's team and chances?  
ROBERTA VINCI: We won. C'mon. Good.   
   
 Q. What does it mean to you to be able to watch?  
ROBERTA VINCI: I was lucky. Yesterday I didn't play, so I saw the match. Everything perfect. We had happy, of course.   
   
 Q. Looking ahead, what are your thoughts on the team and its chances?  
ROBERTA VINCI: Yeah, why not? But will be tough, yeah. Finger cross.
