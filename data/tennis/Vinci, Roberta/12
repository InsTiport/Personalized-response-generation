THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Good to be back on grass?  
ROBERTA VINCI: Yeah.  Happy.   
 Q.  You're getting close to retirement, I guess.  Which surface will you miss most?  
ROBERTA VINCI: Maybe the grass because it's a different surface.  It's difficult to play, there are not so many tournaments.   
 Q.  Will you have chances to play on it as a retired player?  
ROBERTA VINCI: I don't know.  I don't know.  Now I don't want to think about my future.  Just think about this tournament and Wimbledon and all the other tournaments.   
 Q.  How do you feel for this tournament?  
ROBERTA VINCI: Well, I'm feeling good.  It's tough to play on grass, but yesterday I play one doubles and is nice to play some matches and some doubles before singles.  I have a bye, so I have more day to practice.  The weather not so good, so no practice today probably.  (Smiling.)   
But, yeah, I'm happy to be here and to prepare I hope in a good...   
 Q.  Good preparation for Wimbledon?  
ROBERTA VINCI: Yeah, it's a good preparation.  I prefer to play, the week before the Grand Slam, I prefer to play some matches.  Not practice and -- yeah, it's good.  I'm ready for here and for Wimbledon.   
 Q.  Are you selected for the Olympics?  
ROBERTA VINCI: Yes, I am.   
 Q.  Are you practicing for doubles or singles?  If you could tell us a little bit more about it.  
ROBERTA VINCI: Yeah, I will play singles, doubles, and -- yeah.  But Rio is in two months.  Yeah, now I don't think about the Olympics games but just for this tournament and Wimbledon.  And then we have more time to practice for the Olympics games.   
 Q.  How are you feeling physically after the clay court season?  
ROBERTA VINCI: I'm good.  Yeah, yeah, I don't have any problems with my body.  I'm good.  Yes.   
 Q.  How are you adapting to the grass, as well?  Have your practices been going well?  
ROBERTA VINCI: Well, yesterday was my -- well, yesterday I played doubles and two days ago I practiced just one hour with the weather.   
But I like to play on grass.  I know it's different, it's difficult, but I have a good style and good tennis for this surface.  So I hope to play good tournament here and also in Wimbledon.   
 Q.  How do you deal with the rain delays?  
ROBERTA VINCI: Nothing today.  Just gym and wait, wait, and hope.  Yes, nothing special.   
 Q.  Do you have a favorite game you play?  
ROBERTA VINCI: When...   
 Q.  When you're waiting.  
ROBERTA VINCI: Yeah, I can play Candy Crush.  I see a lot of Italian fiction, you know, in serious TV.  Serious?   
That's it.  And a lot of message, WhatsApp messages.
