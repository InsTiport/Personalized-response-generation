R. VINCI/A. Friedsam   
6-2, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  The great memories from last year, if you could just talk about do you still carry those with you?  How does that help you coming into the tournament this year knowing that you had such great success last year?  
ROBERTA VINCI: Yes.  Was great to be back here to play on center court first match.  I was proud to play in Open, this US Open 2016.   
Yeah, it's incredible to be here.  It's pass one year, so like yesterday.  But I had of course a great memory, but today just think about the match and keep the positive things of the last year.   
Was a tough match.  Is always tough play the first match of a Grand Slam, but I won.  So this is important thing today.  I start to play great first set, and then 2-Love in the second set a little bit nervous, a little bit scared about the match because, well, she's -- also in Australia when I lost against her I won the first set easy and then I lost in the third.   
So just my mind to stay focused and think about every single point.  Don't think about the opponent.  Just keep -- just try to play aggressive.   
But was a little bit nervous, so I fight a lot and I won the second set.   
 Q.  Talk about how you feel coming into the tournament and what your expectations are.  You know you can go far here.  You have done it before.  
ROBERTA VINCI: It's tough to repeat of course the results of last year (Smiling.)  But I'm No. 7, so of course I have a lot of pressure.  They expect me semifinal, quarterfinal, step by step and match by match.   
So now I'm really happy that I won the first round.  Tomorrow relax and play the second round.  I don't know the opponent right now, but will be of course a difficult match, tough match.  I try my best and don't think that I have a lot of points to defend.
