 R. VINCI/A. Ivanovic
  6‑0, 6‑0 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Were you surprised by the result?  
ROBERTA VINCI:   Yes.   (Smiling.)   Very surprised.   It is not easy to win 6‑Love 6‑Love against a great player, for sure.  
I played good.   She played so bad I think today, but I played really consistent, a lot of slice.   She doesn't like my slice.   But I'm happy.  
   
 Q.   Is it rare to have an opponent play as bad as you thought she played today?  
ROBERTA VINCI:   Yes, it's strange.   You know, I played against her a lot of times, but for me, you know, when you have nothing to lose, you play probably better.   
But, yeah, it's strange to play against her when she plays like this, for sure.  
   
 Q.   Which was the key of the match?   Your slice?   
ROBERTA VINCI:   My slice probably, yes.   She doesn't like my slice.   I play a lot of slice.   I play all the time slice, so probably this was the key.   She was a little bit confused about my slice.
