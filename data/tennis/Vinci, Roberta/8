J. LARSSON/R. Vinci   
7-6, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  That was a pretty long and tough set under warm conditions.  You seemed sluggish in the second.  Was it fatigue?  Were you injured a little bit?  
ROBERTA VINCI: Yeah, I'm injured a little bit.  I have a little bit of pain of my tendon on left foot.  I had this kind of problem starting from Rio.   
Yesterday was good, was better.  But today, yes, was a tough match, tough condition, tough first set.   
On the second set, I was not tired.  But I thinking always to my pain, and I lost.  But now I have two or three days off before New York.  Try to recover, try to stay better for the U.S.   
 Q.  That first set, she broke you so early, then you fought back, were up 4-1 in the tiebreak.  What happened there?  
ROBERTA VINCI: Yeah, I lost two or three points so bad.  One volley.  Also I think 6-All, double-fault for me.  Of course, I was a little bit tight, nervous.  I knew first set was important for me, for my confidence, for my foot, everything.   
Yes, I lost an unlucky first set.  Then second set, easy, but I was always thinking on my foot.  That's it.   
 Q.  How will you manage the foot?  Will you take a few days off now?  
ROBERTA VINCI: Yeah, I think so.  I go tomorrow to New York.  Yeah, I have two or three days off maybe, then try to play little bit.   
I think the most important thing is to rest a little bit because I played Montreal, Rio, Cincinnati.  Too many weeks.  So maybe I need two days off, some treatment of course, yeah, some rest, then ready for the U.S.   
 Q.  What have they been doing to your foot?  Ice, heat?  
ROBERTA VINCI: Yes, ice, some laser, some normal treatment, some massage.  Like always, normal treatment.
