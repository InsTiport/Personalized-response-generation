THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You already said it in Italian obviously that this tournament is a great one for you, but also a pretty difficult one.  Can you just try and explain that.
ROBERTA VINCI: This tournament is incredible for us, but sometimes is tough, you know.  There are so many persons, also the family, all the friends comes to watch.
For me personally is not easy, but maybe is, I hope -- it's tough, but I will try to stay focused and think about just the match and not think about everything.
