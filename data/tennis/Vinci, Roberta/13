J. KONTA/R. Vinci   
6-0, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Roberta, not an easy first-round match against Jo, but is it just some sort of bad luck here in Rome, just unable to play your best tennis here?  
ROBERTA VINCI: Yeah, it's always tough.  Also, this year I haven't played a good game.  Was of course nervous at the beginning of the match and during the match, and also the weather was not so good.   
Yeah, she played good, but I didn't play -- I didn't play my game.  Always nervous.  Also this year I played so bad.
