THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
   
 Q.   Congratulations to the both of you.   It's been really a magical year for you guys.   Let's talk about what this championship means.   
SARA ERRANI:   Yeah, we won the US Open, so of course we are very happy.   
ROBERTA VINCI:   Great tournament.   
SARA ERRANI:   Was tough match, but I think we play aggressive.   We play aggressive and was good for us.   
   
 Q.   What's the name of that dance?   
ROBERTA VINCI:   No name.   
   
 Q.   No name?   
ROBERTA VINCI:   No.   
   
 Q.   Sara‑Roberta tango?  
ROBERTA VINCI:   No, no, no name.  
   
 Q.   Is that your first performance of it?  
ROBERTA VINCI:   Yes.   So bad, eh?   So bad.  
   
 Q.   To reach No. 1 and 2, as you will effective tomorrow, it's obviously reflective of just how incredibly you're playing as a team.   What does that mean to the both of you to have achieved that?  
SARA ERRANI:   Well, it's a dream come true.   We play an amazing year, so we play good all the year.   So this is very important for us.  
We play good from Australia; we make final and we won Paris.   We won so many matches on clay.   Maybe all, so of course it's amazing year.   We hope to continue.  
   
 Q.   After your last singles win here, you obviously get to really celebrate.   How different does it feel to be able to celebrate today just feel like you can do a full, full celebration?  
SARA ERRANI:   Well, is better to finish with a match won.   (Smiling.)  
We are happy can celebrate this.   Good thing is we can celebrate together.   It's a good thing.
