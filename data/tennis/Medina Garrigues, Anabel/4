ANABEL MEDINA GARRIGUES: Yeah, sure, because I play against Dementieva, she's he's No. 6 in the world. I need all the points and when the chair umpire says out, when I think it's good, I feel bad because I need all the points for her, but it was good. 

ANABEL MEDINA GARRIGUES: Yeah, of course, I was in Roland Garros with her in three sets and last week in three sets. I feel like I can win the Top-10. I needed one of these. Now I win Dementieva, but I don't have to go to the stars and start too crazy, I have to stay on the earth and stay with my work and try to feel the same today and do it more times. 

ANABEL MEDINA GARRIGUES: Yeah, here all the matches are hard but I played against her like two or three times and I feel good against her game. I think I can do very good match. I don't know if I am going to win or lose, we have to wait, but I am doing very good tournament. I am very happy to this score and the next round when coming, I see. 

ANABEL MEDINA GARRIGUES: This moment from 0 to 5-1 I played very good. Then she start to play better because she start to do a lot of mistakes and then she feel better 5-1 but I feel good. I stay on-court all the time and I run a lot (Laughs) and I think this is the more important to win this match. 

ANABEL MEDINA GARRIGUES: Yeah, of course, because her forehand is very strong. She plays very hard and I think her backhand is good, but it's more better her forehand. I put more pressure on her backhand and I change to her forehand and pressure on her serve. 

ANABEL MEDINA GARRIGUES: Her serve or mine? 

ANABEL MEDINA GARRIGUES: Yeah, I feel I can put pressure against her serve, but it's difficult to return because it's a slice and go to out of the court and it's difficult to return. All the people say no, Dementieva, her serve is not so good, but sometimes it's difficult to return the ball. 

ANABEL MEDINA GARRIGUES: Yeah, for this because she serve a slice -- 

ANABEL MEDINA GARRIGUES: My serve? 

ANABEL MEDINA GARRIGUES: Yeah, I feel good, because I played with a lot of kicks and I think this for Russian people or -- it's difficult to return because they play very hard and I think the kicks and the ball with topspin it's difficult for them. 

ANABEL MEDINA GARRIGUES: Yeah. 

ANABEL MEDINA GARRIGUES: No, because here the ball is losing the hair, I don't know, very fast. 

ANABEL MEDINA GARRIGUES: They change 7 and 9 but for me I need the ball with big and for my game. Always I am looking for balls like this, not very -- no old balls, I like new balls, but sometimes we play with the same balls a lot of times and it's going to be more older than the other ones. I am looking -- 

ANABEL MEDINA GARRIGUES: Not faster. Slower. 

ANABEL MEDINA GARRIGUES: Because if it's more new the ball take more spin, you know, if it's very fast, if it's old, it's better for me.
