A. IVANOVIC/E. Bouchard
  6‑1, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Genie, I heard you saying when Nick was out there you felt like it was tough to feel like you were ready for this tournament.   Obviously it's great to be here, but maybe not quite as prepped as you want to be.   You feel it during the matches, I guess. 
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   I can.   It's something I knew going in, so it's not so much of a surprise.   But it's still, you know, disappointing, I guess.
You know, I still had the belief I can try to work my way into it, which is what I've done in the past.   You're never 100% perfectly prepared for every event.
Just unfortunate that it would happen at a big event like this one.   Definitely better to be here than not to be here.   Just been trying to give it my all and do what I can do to try and prepare; that's what I've done. 
But I still don't feel myself on the court.

Q.   What do you think she did differently today? 
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   Well, she played well.   You know, she was solid.   I think I had a lot of chances which I could have taken, but she also came up with some good points.   On break points she serve well, things like that.
I wish I had something new and interesting to say, but it's kind of the same old story:   missing too many routine balls; you know, kind of not being as consistent as I want to be. 
So that's what happened. 

Q.   Strange you had a much higher first serve percentage than her but you couldn't convert that into winning points on your first serve.   How do you account for that? 
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   My serve was not very fast, you know.   I guess I won a higher kind of winning percentage on my first serve rather than just percentage in the court.   That's something I've always tried to do, but I feel like I haven't been doing well recently.
It shows that. 

Q.   Where do you think the rust shows the most?   Is it in the serve?   Certainly velocity is not there.   Is it location?   You feel like the confidence takes the biggest hit to what part of your game?
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   A little bit in the serve, yes, and also, you know, just in the points.   Usually I can rely on myself to stay in the point, and only if I go for a high‑risk ball do I accept an error.   Now.
It's routine balls are flying on me and little things like that.   That's just consistency, practicing, playing matches, which I haven't done so much. 
She definitely went for it as well.   She has been playing really good tennis all year.   It's not like I didn't play a good opponent.   She totally went out and went for‑‑ like got her points.   Totally took her chances.

Q.   You talked throughout the year about trying to play your brand of tennis no matter what all the time.   When things aren't working, do you feel like you have a Plan B, or do you have to sort of keep trying your game until hopefully it starts working?
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   Yeah, that's something I think I didn't do in my first match.   I was trying to go for it kind of no matter what; today I actually thought to myself to try to be a little bit more patient.
I think that helped a little bit.   I think I did play a little bit better than my previous match.   Maybe that's something I should incorporate more. 
I don't have to completely change my game, but I can not be completely crazy going for it and relax a little bit, too.

Q.   On court, do you feel like this is still like an enjoyable experience?   I know it's hard to play when you feel like you have one arm tied behind your back.   Has this been a good experience?   Are there positives you can take out of the last two matches?
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   Yeah, there are.   I always love playing.   In the heat of the battle, even if I'm not feeling quite like myself, I still try to compete as hard as I can.   That's what the see the great champions do.   They don't always play their best, but they still fight.   So that's what I kind of try to strive to do as well no matter what.
This week is probably more fun than other weeks.   Atmosphere is amazing.   Walking out on court I feel like the president.   It's so spectacular to walk out on court.   It's an experience like no other.   It's very unique.

Q.   Serena next.   I don't know if you saw any of her match today, but she had a weird one.   Thoughts on what it may be like going in to play her, especially with her coming off that?
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   Yeah, I didn't catch any of the match.   I was practicing.   I saw the results.   I don't know if one match should change my approach to me playing against Serena.   I don't think it will.   I think she's a great player.   Not everyone can play perfect in every match. 
For me, you know, I kind of got killed by the two players in my pool not named Serena, so I think it can only get better from here. 

Q.   You left LagardÃ¨re this year.   Can you tell us if you have a new agent? 
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   Currently don't have management right now.   It's in the process.   May be able to announce something soon, but right now I'm free. 
Single and ready to mingle.

Q.   How does it feel being free?
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   Great.   Yeah, I don't know, feel like maybe I was married and I just got divorce and I'm like, Ahhhh. 
I hope that doesn't happen to me in the future, but...
I understand some songs and some people more now. 

Q.   This is the first time you're playing in the WTA Finals.   After two games, has it overwhelmed you in the sense? 
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   I wouldn't say it's overwhelmed me.   I've been asked a few times about it being my first time here.   That never crossed my mind.   I've done a lot of first things this year.   You have to do everything first at some point in your life.   I just was excited to come here.   I see it as the fifth Grand Slam. 
I wish I could have had better results so far, but it's a great experience.   It's learning.   Hopefully I can be back many more times. 

Q.   Given the struggling to play at your best at the moment, back to back matches, are you 100% sure you'll be able to play tomorrow, or will you assess that at some point? 
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   Yeah, the plan is to play tomorrow.   I'm happy I can play back to back.   It's a bit more like a normal tournament, although not like slam.
I'm just looking forward to the match.   Never say never, but it's probably my last match of the year, so I'm going to just give it my all.   To end with Serena is kind of cool.
