 E. BOUCHARD/J. Goerges
      2‑6, 6‑2, 6‑1 
  
    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please.   
   
 Q.   What changed after the first set?   You were like two different players almost.   
    EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   Yeah, in the first set I felt like I wasn't in the right mental frame of mind, and it just wasn't good enough for my standards.  
    So I just needed to regroup after that, and I real focused and got back to playing the way I need to play, which is stepping in, going for my shots.   
   
 Q.   Were you worried after the first set?     And at the start of the second, was it already that you said, Okay, I'm going to be able to win this set, or it took a few games?  
    EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   For me, I never know if I'm going to win a set or not.   I wasn't worried after the first.   I just took my time.   Just really tried to forget about that I lost the first set and just start fresh.   That's what I did for the second and third.  
    It was important for me to just focus on my game and what I needed to do on the court and not worry about my opponent or the score, things like that.   
   
 Q.   Did she surprise you a little bit in the beginning, especially that serve wide in the ad court?   Were you expecting that?   Obviously you seemed to get on to it after a while.   At the beginning seemed pretty good for her.   
    EUGENIE BOUCHARD:     I wasn't surprised.   I know she's capable of playing really good tennis.   She has been top 20, so I was ready for that.  
    It was really me who wasn't doing what I was supposed to do in the first.   I was giving up too many short balls, no pace, and it's no surprise she's going to take control if I do that.  
    It just wasn't   good enough.   I pulled myself together and started playing the way I know I need to play and I was able to take control.  
   
 Q.   When you say you weren't in the right mental frame of mind, what exactly does that mean?  
    EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   I just went out on the court and of course I was excited to play and everything, but I didn't feel like I was focused on the right things.  
    I was maybe focusing on things I can't control, where I always know I need to focus on one point at a time, not worry about the score, result, things like that.   So kind of getting out of the moment.   
    So for me, I just really tried to focus, zero in, not look anywhere, and just really focus on trying to serve as well as I can and hit as well as I can hit the ball.   
    Once I started really hitting my groundstrokes, I was doing a lot better in the point.   
   
 Q.   Did you really have to go to the bathroom?   
    EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   I did.   I have a small bladder.   
   
 Q.   You just reach the third round, and Schmiedlova, she won against Venus or center court today.   Muguruza is leading Serena now.   Do you feel like the younger generation, it's time for your generation to make some big achievement in this tournament?   
    EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   I think if it's not this tournament, it's coming soon.   I think the younger generation is really starting to put pressure on the top players.   With some results like that, it shows that we're not far off from the great players or the top 10, things like that.  
    I think the game is getting older.   Old players are players‑‑ old, I mean 30 year olds are having some success, but I also feel like some 20 year olds are having success as well.  
    It makes the game really interesting, but I think we're knocking on the door and close to being really good.   
   
 Q.   How would you characterize a game like this, 1 out of 10 in terms of your level of play?     Obviously like a player has sometimes really, really good days and days where they're struggling a little bit.   
    EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   For sure it definitely wasn't one of my best days, but I'm proud that I was able to turn it around.   It was definitely more of a mental win today to get my game back in the right place.  
    So, you know, I would say it was a little bit up and down, but I'm happy that I was able to pull through and stay mentally strong.   
    I have confidence that no matter what happens on the court, I can fight and still give my best and give myself the best chance to win.  
   
 Q.   Do you know what that big break at the beginning of the match was all about?   Did anyone tell you anything?  
    EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   No.   All the umpire told me was she had to take off her leggings.   I don't know if she was asked to or she wanted to, but it was very long and I was very cold.   
   
 Q.   Do you normally look ahead in the draw?   Do you know what's coming in the next round and a few rounds past that?  
    EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   I really don't look at the draw that much because so much can happen.   It's so out of my control that I don't bother with that.   
    I do know my next opponents.   That's all I really look forward to is the next match I'm going to play and that's it.   
   
 Q.   Can you maybe tell us one or two examples of how your popularity has changed in Canada since Australia?  
    EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   The creation of the Genie Army.   I think that was a cool thing.   At home I get recognized a lot more now, so I have to be careful with what I wear.     When I walk out of the house, try to not look too slouchy in my sweat pants.  
    But most people are just so nice and say they're proud of me and wish me luck.   I just really appreciate that support.   
   
 Q.   Is it true you and your sister were named after Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson's children?  
    EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   Yes.   My mom is right over there.   She was probably a little bit royal obsessed, so yeah.  
   
 Q.   Is there any connection with England or Britain in your family?  
    EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   No, I don't think so.   My grandma is Irish.   I don't think there is any direct relation with England.   Just that they're royalty.   
   
 Q.   Has your sister gained in popularity because of your success, your twin sister?  
    EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   I think so, yeah.   I think social media you can kind of figure out who is your sister online.   I think some of my fans follow her and her Instagram posts and things like that.   
    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French?   
   
 Q.   Did you follow the game between MontrÃ©al and New York yesterday?     
    EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   No.   It was 3:00 in the morning.  
   
 Q.   Did you look at the results?  
    EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   Yes, I did.   I'm happy for them, but it's going to be difficult I think.
