THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
 Q.  The last Canadian standing at the Rogers Cup, man or woman.  What did the experience mean to you all this week?  
EUGENIE BOUCHARD: Yeah, I mean, I'll take that honor.  It was cool to get a couple good doubles matches in.  A match is a match no matter what.  It's better than practice in a way.   
Just want to, you know, keep working.   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.   
 Q.  I would like to know how much you appreciated this week in Montreal.  Of course, your presence was a highlight in the doubles tournament.  We saw it with the spectators.  How was it for you?  
EUGENIE BOUCHARD: It was nice that I could stay extra days here to play the doubles.   
 Q.  Yesterday on TV you were not sure of what you were going to do next.  What is your schedule now?  
EUGENIE BOUCHARD: In the next weeks, I have the US Open coming up.  For next week, I haven't decided anything yet.  I didn't have time to talk with my team.  I will make a decision soon.   
 Q.  In between the two sets, the umpire came to see you.  What did the umpire tell you?  I'm curious.  
EUGENIE BOUCHARD: Her coach, you mean?   
 Q.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought it was the umpire.  I didn't see it was the umpire.  
 You said it was nice to stay extra days here.  What was nice?  The crowd, the reactions of the crowd?   
EUGENIE BOUCHARD: It was nice winning matches, to make it to the quarterfinals in doubles, because it's an important tournament, and to stay in the tournament until Friday, To be the last Canadian in the Rogers Cup this year.  All this is nice.   
 Q.  Robert Lansdorp who worked with you, are there chances he will work with you until the US Open?  
EUGENIE BOUCHARD: Yes, there are chances he will.
