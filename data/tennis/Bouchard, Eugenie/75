 P. KVITOVA/E. Bouchard
  6/3, 6/0 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
   
 Q.   I imagine you got a sense of what Petra Kvitova did right to win that match.   I wonder whether you have a sense of what you did wrong?  
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   Well, I first of all have to give full credit to my opponent.   I think she played, you know, unbelievable and didn't give me many opportunities, you know, to stay in the rally or, you know, do what I do.   
So, you know, I think she's been playing well all tournament and was really going for it today.   
   
 Q.   It's really hard to look at it from this standpoint at your age, but part of the growing pains of becoming a champ, it's really hard for a lot of people at a younger age.   Do you see it at all that way or is it too soon?  
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   I think it's a tough road to try to become, you know, as good as I want to be no matter what.   I'm not going to win every single time.   I think this was a good experience for me, my first slam final.   
I'm going to learn a lot from this match and hopefully use it to get much better.   
   
 Q.   About your level of play, how did you feel you played?  
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   I felt like I started well, and, you know, was in there.   But, you know, I didn't feel like I was able to play my game.   She really took the chances away from me and was really putting a lot of pressure on me.   I didn't have that many opportunities.   
But, you know, sometimes your opponent just plays better than you, and that's what happened today.   
   
 Q.   You've spoken a lot about what you would do when this was all over.   What are you going to do now?   What's next in the next few days?  
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   I will take a little bit of time off, much deserved I think.   I've been playing a lot of tennis in the past few months at a really high level.   You know, I'm going to take some time off for the mind and body.   
When I'm ready, going to hit the practice courts again and be really excited, you know, about the second half of the year.   
   
 Q.   You said you learned some lessons out of this.   Any particular lessons at this stage you will pick up on?  
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   You know, it was a big moment walking out onto Centre Court for a final.   You know, I have that experience now.   I know what it feels like.   You know, I hope I can walk out to many more finals.   That's the goal.   
But, you know, I'm going to go back, work on my game, try to get better, because you always need to get better.   
   
 Q.   How would you describe your hunger to win a major?  
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   I am very motivated to win a Grand Slam.   It's been, you know, a lifelong dream of mine.   I feel like I've taken steps in the right direction to achieve that.   
This year I've been close in every slam, so I'm just going to keep going.   
   
 Q.   You said yesterday that you would like to have the princess you're named after in the Royal Box and she was there.   
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   I know, that was crazy.   I did see her in the box.   I'm very happy that she came out.   Disappointed I couldn't put on a better show for her, but I'd love to meet her, of course.   
It's the only person I'm named after.   She's the only one in the world.   
   
 Q.   Did she say anything to you at all?  
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   I haven't seen her.   If she's still here, hopefully I'll get a chance to meet her.   I don't know.   
   
 Q.   Even when it was over there were people standing in the rain on Henman Hill shouting, We still love you, Genie.   These are Brits who seem to have adopted you.   What is it like to be aware so many nations have adopted you?   Do you take that in or block it out?  
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   No, I appreciate it for sure.   Even on court today I felt, you know, some special support from the crowd.   You know, it's humbling to receive all this support.   You know, I just hope I can put on a good show for them and make my supporters proud.   
But, you know, it's really special to hear, you know, that people want me to do well and believe in me.   
   
 Q.   Before this you've had some big moments.   Walking out on Centre Court for the final is a whole different thing.   What was the experience like?  
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   It was very special.   It was different.   We were holding flowers instead of our tennis bags.   The applause was really loud when we walked out.   That's the main thing that registered in my mind.   
I just felt so grateful to be able to walk out on a stage and, you know, have a chance to perform and do what I love.   You know, I hope to experience that feeling many more times.  
   
 Q.   In any way did you feel overwhelmed by the moment or not?  
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   I don't think I felt overwhelmed.   As soon as we started hitting and the match started, you know, I felt a bit more in my element.   You know, I felt, okay, it's just a match.   It's starting.   I'll try to do my best.   
Things didn't go my way, but I enjoyed being on the court today.  
   
 Q.   Can you recall a time when an opponent played this well against you?  
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   I don't know if I can think of like a specific match, but, you know, for sure she was on.   She has weapons.   We know that when she's on, she's very tough to beat.   Especially on this surface.   She's been in the final before, all these things.   
You know, I just have to give her credit.   You know, she deserved to win today.   
   
 Q.   You said on the court when you were talking to the crowd that you don't really deserve their love.   How do you think you're going to react to this?   Are you going to be too hard on yourself or will you be able to take the positives?  
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   I'm always hard on myself.   Maybe a bit too much.   But that's what motivates me to do better.   You know, I never want to be satisfied.   
Of course I'm disappointed with a loss today, but I will, you know, realize how far I've come this year already and appreciate the hard work I've put in and really believe that I can be at the top level of the game.   That will give me motivation.   
So, you know, I think I'll look back and I'll be okay.   
   
 Q.   Can you give us an idea of what you did during that very brief break when the roof was closing?  
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   Yeah, it was a little odd.   I sat down.   I put my jacket on.   Just reflected.   I was in the engraver's room, so I was watching them work, wishing one day, dreaming that he'll write my name somewhere.   
   
 Q.   You were quite composed during your performances on the court, and off the court you've been composed during your time here, even after the result today.   As that match slipped away from you, at the end that must have been pretty gut‑wrenching, wasn't it?   
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   It was pretty disappointing.   I'm never satisfied to lose.   I always expect myself to do well.   
But, you know, if I try my best, you know, try to make things work, even if my game is not feeling great on court, that's all I can do.   
You know, my opponent played better than me today.   
   
 Q.   You mentioned taking time off today, the rest of the day and maybe some...   
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   Yes.   The rest of the day I'm taking off (smiling).   
   
 Q.   Is there anything specific you're going to do?   Will you go out with family?   Go for a meal?   
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   I will, you know, kind of catch up with, yeah, my family and my team.   I don't know.   I mean, I'm definitely going to go back to MontrÃ©al and rest a little bit.   It's been a while since I've been back home.   
But for now, yeah, just not going to think about a racquet for a few days at least.   Maybe a week.   We'll see how it goes.   
   
 Q.   In retrospect, do you think you could have done anything different during the match to turn the tide?   Of course, Kvitova played out of her mind.   Could you have done anything different?  
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   I feel like a few times, you know, when she was a bit off balance and I had a few chances I was a bit hesitant.   
I think in the first set I started okay, but the second set I was a bit hesitant sometimes.   Maybe I would just try to go for those a little bit more.   
You know, I didn't have many answers on the court today.   I think that's the bottom line.   
   
 Q.   Nick is one of the best coaches in the game.   Have you spoken to him and what did he say to you?  
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   Of course I've spoken to him.   Yeah, he said he was very proud of me.   You know, even today and of course the whole tournament.   I'll watch the tape and we'll learn, work, and try to get better.   
But, you know, we're going to take a minute and look back, you know, realize that we've done a lot this year and appreciate that.   Then when it's time to get back to work, we'll do that.   
   
 Q.   Was there a turning point to the match, when you felt like that was it, I'm not getting back into this?  
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   I never think that's it.   Tennis is not a timed sport.   You can always come back, no matter what.   
But, you know, it was hard for me to feel like I had, you know, my game going for me.   It really was one of those days.   But, like I said, all credit to her, because she definitely put the pressure on me and took away my chances.   
But, you know, I was still trying no matter what the score was.   
   
 Q.   What do you think the reaction will be like when you get back home to MontrÃ©al?   A lot different profile than you had 12 months ago.   
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   Yeah, well, I don't know what it's going to be like.   I'm just, you know, excited to spend a little time off, you know, with my family back home.   I'm going to spend a lot of time on my couch.   That's the first goal.   
Besides that, yeah, I mean, also the tournament is also in MontrÃ©al once every two years, so the last time I played I just came off winning the juniors here, which was good for me at the time.   Of course, you know, it should be very exciting.   
I don't get to play often in front of my home crowd, so I hope people will want to come out and watch.   
   
 Q.   You said winning that junior title was the best moment of your career.   At this point as you sit here, a finalist of Wimbledon, making this run, does this surpass that or is still being a champion number one?  
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   That's a tough question.   But I still think my junior title was better than this.   I think, yeah, you know, winning a tournament without losing a match is always something special.   That was a big moment for me.   I appreciate what I've done these past few weeks, though.   
You know, I'm definitely proud of myself for these past two weeks and this whole year.   I think it comes close.   I don't know if I can pinpoint one exactly, but, you know, I like Wimbledon.   
   
 Q.   Do you have any kind of a comfort food or drink that you've maybe denied yourself during Wimbledon that you can treat yourself to now?  
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   Yeah, for sure.   Comfort food is the best.   I don't even know.   I've been eating well recently.   I don't even like want bad food anymore.   You know, when you change your lifestyle, it's like you don't even crave sugar anymore.   
I'll definitely have dessert tonight.   I haven't had dessert in a while, so I'll have some brownie or something tonight.   
   
 Q.   You're going to be in the top 10 next week.   Does it mean much to you or is it just a number?  
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   It means something to me.   It's definitely been one of my goals.   When I made top 20, in the back of my mind I was like, Okay, the next step is top 10.   I'm happy to accomplish that.   
But there's still a lot more to do.   I still have a long road ahead of me to improve as a tennis player.   If I do that well, hopefully the number will, you know, go up and the results will still come.   
   
 Q.   Your sister has posted a picture online saying they were going to make an emergency trip to London.   Did they make it?   
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   I haven't seen them, but I think they're here.   I've had most of the family here already.   You know, I hope they've enjoyed their Wimbledon.   You know, I don't know how much they've enjoyed watching me.   Sometimes it's stressful.   
But I think it's been a good two weeks.   It's always nice to have people, you know, your family who you've grown up with to be with you.   It's definitely special at big moments like this.   
   
 Q.   Is the cruel to make the defeated finalist sit in the engraver's room before the presentation?  
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   Maybe it's a bit cruel.   She just told me to go in there.   I didn't ask questions.   I was in there when I won the juniors.   I got to go in the Royal Box.   They presented my trophy there.   So while waiting, I waited in the engraver's room, as well.   
So I had flashbacks to that time.   At that time I also got a picture with the men's doubles winners.   There was a British man, Marray and Nielson.   So they won.   We were all hanging out into the engraver's room because we were going in the Royal Box.   
I spent a little bit of time in there.   It's pretty cool.   
   
 Q.   Would you rather wait somewhere else, though?  
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   No.   I think it's fascinating.   There are some old pictures on the wall.   You see these trophies.   It's like nothing else.   
   
 Q.   Is that almost a good thing that you were in that room as opposed to somewhere elsewhere your mind would go a little nuts?   Was there a wow factor at all, what just happened?   Did you feel any of that after the match?  
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   No.   I definitely got outplayed, and I felt that way after the match.   But I'm still holding my head up.   I feel like I've come a long way and I'm proud of what I've achieved not only this week but this year as well.   
So, you know, I think, you know, life is good, you know, and I'm just going to keep working.   That's what you have to do, just go back to work.
