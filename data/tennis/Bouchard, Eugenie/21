 Q.  What would you say are the issues you have to deal with your in game at the moment after two disappointing tournaments?  What are you going to be focusing on to improve?  
EUGENIE BOUCHARD: I don't know.  It's been a bit of a struggle.  I'll ask my coach.   
 Q.  What would you say the toughest part is having so much attention on you all the time?  
EUGENIE BOUCHARD: Um, yeah, it's different; it's different than when I was coming up and playing.  Sometimes it's hard to deal with.
