  6‑2, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Are you satisfied with the results in this Australian Open?
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   I'm proud of, you know, how I've improved as a player throughout the tournament.   But I'm never satisfied with losing.   I'm always disappointed. 
You know, I always want to go further and do better. 

Q.   What did you say to yourself when you went down Love‑5 so quickly?
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   I just wanted to get into the match a little bit more.   I felt like she was really hitting her shots.   I was kind of just letting her do all these winners side to side.   It wasn't really my game. 
I just tried to get into the rallies more, try to step in a little bit more, and try to put more pressure on her because she was just putting a lot of pressure on me.

Q.   Were you nervous at the beginning of the match?
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   A little bit.   But, you know, I am before every match, so I think that's normal. 

Q.   Set point down in the first round on Court 15 to this, have you exceeded your own expectations?
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   Yeah, I wouldn't say I exceeded my expectations, but I'm happy with how I did. 
But like I said, I always want to do better.   To me it's not a surprise.   I've been working hard my whole life to do this, play at Grand Slams and do well.   It's not an overnight thing and it's not a surprise to me. 
So I'm just going to go back to the practice courts and keep working hard.

Q.   After 5‑Love down you played pretty even with her for a while.   Any reason you couldn't sort of quite turn it?
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   I mean, I think she played really well.   You have to give her credit.   All of her groundstrokes were like a foot from the baseline and she was very consistent.   Even her serves were really solid. 
I felt like she didn't give me much breathing space, much room to do what I want to do on the court.   I tried to put pressure, but she just played too good at moments.

Q.   A year ago when you didn't have great success here, if someone came up to you and said, Don't worry, you'll make the semis next year, what would you have thought?
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   Good thing I'll be a lot better next year. 
Yeah, I mean, I did lose in quallies here last year.   Last year I still have some good results besides that.   I think, you know, it's just a process.   I learned a lot last year.   I've slowly been making my way up.   I don't want to stop here.   I want to keep going.

Q.   What's the one single best thing that Nick brings to you as a person and a player?
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   I think the best advice he gives me is really related to the mental side.   I think he's really good with that.   He really gets me to focus on the court and, you know, just focus on playing well.   I think that's the most important thing, is trying to perform.   When you perform, the results come. 
But the advice he gives me as well just before walking on the court is, Just enjoy it.   I have been these past two weeks.   I've been enjoying my time on the court. 

Q.   Was today's match different than playing a normal match?
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   A little bit.   I try to think of it as just a normal match, but it feels bigger.   It makes it more important to stay focused.   I came out and I wasn't quite playing very well.   I was missing shots by a little bit here and there.   She really took it to me at the beginning. 
Something you have to learn to really, you know, just get into it, go for it right away.   But I feel I got into the match a little bit, but it wasn't enough.

Q.   Did you feel tighter, more weight on your shoulders?
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   A little bit, yeah.   I'm nervous before every match a little bit, which I think is normal.   But, I mean, it did feel a little bit of a bigger match. 
But at the same time I played two matches on Rod Laver, as well.   I felt like I'd been there and played well on that court.   So I just wanted to try to do the same.   But I had a really good opponent today as well. 

Q.   This is a fairly big deal at home.   Have you been feeling that in any way, been able to sense that?
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   A little bit.   But, you know, we are on the other side of the world here.   It's a bit far.   But, you know, I know my family and friends back home are excited for me.   It's making news a little bit. 
It's just kind of my job, a normal thing for me.   It's exciting to be here, but at the same time, you know, I want to do better and do more.   So it's just kind of like my job.   It just feels normal. 

Q.   Which way do you think it will change your life as a tennis player?
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   Maybe a little bit.   You know, my ranking will improve and stuff, so that's good.   But can't stop, can't rest on results.   I mean, it's really important to keep improving and looking forward to the next tournaments. 

Q.   How excited were you to get a tweet from Justin Bieber?
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   I was excited (smiling). 

Q.   What do you take away from this tournament?   Self‑confidence?   Experience? 
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   For sure.   I feel like I belong in the top levels of the game.   I think, you know, I'm happy with how I've played.   I feel I've been playing well and improving through the tournament. 
Even though I was playing matches, I felt I was getting better as the matches went on, which is a good thing.   I want to build on that and practice and keep raising my level. 
For sure I'll walk away with confidence. 

Q.   Back in MontrÃ©al, did you ever play for the team at the private school you went to?
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   No.   I was just practicing, not playing for the team. 

Q.   There's been a lot of compliments on what you've accomplished here.   Are there any in particular you've heard of from somebody that you respect that left a mark with you?
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   I've been kind of in my own world.   I haven't listened to much outside stuff.   Just been trying to stay focused and things like that. 
I mean, you know, what matters to me most is what my family or my coaches say to me.   But maybe someone will tell me what other people told me, but I don't really know. 

Q.   What is your goal as a tennis player, including winning a Grand Slam?
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   Yeah, I think that's the biggest thing to me, is winning a Grand Slam.   The four best tournaments of the year.   I feel like I made good progress this week, a big step getting close to that goal. 
I'm not there yet, so I have a lot of work to do.

Q.   If you could choose one of the four slams, which one would you most like to hold up the trophy for?
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   I love all of them.   They're all special in their own way.   I won junior Wimbledon, so maybe professional Wimbledon would be nice. 

Q.   Do you think this success will change your life and you will get more endorsements?
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   I mean, I guess you could ask my agent that.   We'll see. 

Q.   Can you explain the gift. 
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   It's an emu.   Her name is Sheila.   I got a gift even though I lost.   Thanks to the Genie Army. 

Q.   Who named it Sheila?
EUGENIE BOUCHARD:   It's her name.   It says it right here (laughter).
