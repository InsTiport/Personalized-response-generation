6-4, 5-7, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What is your feeling after that, getting that first Wimbledon win?
KATIE BOULTER: I'm ecstatic honestly.  It's something I've dreamed of my whole life.  I'm so happy that I could finally achieve one of my many goals I've been trying to pursue.
Q. How do you deal with what could have been a very difficult mental situation going from having been so close, then the third set?  How did you deal with that?
KATIE BOULTER: I think it was really difficult, having a match point, not getting it.  Finding a way is something that is built within me.  I feel like I'm a great competitor on the court.  I'd like to think so anyway.  I think that got me through today.  I showed that, and I showed some guts.  I think I'm pretty happy with it.
Q. A bit of nerves at the end of the second set?  She seemed to really step up.  Did you feel like you could have done anything different?
KATIE BOULTER: Uhm, I think winning your first match at Wimbledon is always going to be extremely hard.  I just tried to do the best I could.  I mean, maybe I could have got that back in in the court at match point.  At the end of the day I got the win and I found a way to win, and I'm really happy with the result.
Q. I presume it made it perhaps more difficult because I know you had a tight match with McHale last year when you won the first set, 5-5 in the second.  Did that come into your mind at all?
KATIE BOULTER: To be honest, it didn't even cross my mind.  I think that experience last year has built me into who I am today.  It didn't play any part today.  I just tried to do the best I could at that moment, close out the match as quickly as I could.
Q. Is Katie Swan a good friend of yours?  Did seeing her get a big win give you extra motivation?
KATIE BOULTER: Yeah, it's great.  We're actually close friends.  We're playing doubles tomorrow.  It's really good all British players are playing well.  It's nice to see her winning.
Q. I think there are five of you in the similar age bracket.  Is that going to be a benefit to you all to push each other on?
KATIE BOULTER: Yeah, I mean, we've been pushing each other for months, years now.  It's great to see that everyone's doing really well.  I can be a part of that.  Hopefully I can lead that group and get higher and have a better ranking.
Q. Pretty close to being British No. 2.  Is that something that means anything to you?  Do you have bigger goals than that?
KATIE BOULTER: I think it's great.  But right now my sole focus is to be better and get a higher ranking, to crack top 100.  I've got a lot of aspirations.  Yeah, I think this week has really inspired me.  Hopefully I can do that coming forward.
