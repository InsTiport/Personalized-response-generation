Q.  Would you say you had some problem because of  concentration today?  
 
JIM COURIER:  No, I think my concentration never been  better.   
 

Q.  What was the book?  
 
JIM COURIER:  Entertainment.   
 

Q.  Was it first time you have used that kind  of-- first thing you have read on court side?  
 
JIM COURIER:  No.  No.   
 

Q.  Tell me what kind of book it was.  
 
JIM COURIER:  No.  It is my little secret.   
 

Q.  What is the theory in reading the book, Jim,  what were you trying to --  
 
JIM COURIER:  No theory at all.   
 

Q.  Were you trying to relax?  
 
JIM COURIER:  Just felt like doing it.  It is an  interesting book.  I felt like reading.   
 

Q.  You weren't wearing your cap; was it --  
 
JIM COURIER:  I left it in the hotel, so, kind of stuck.   
 

Q.  What happened with the game with the 4 match  points?  
 
JIM COURIER:  Well, I didn't win any of them.   
 

Q.  Andre felt-- he said he felt that he had a  chance after you doublefaulted?  
 
JIM COURIER:  He was right.  That is all.   
 

Q.  How would you describe your state of mind at  this point, just in general?  
 
JIM COURIER:  I have never been more focused or  concentrated.  This is the best I have been, and  hopefully if I can keep this up I will be in good shape  come week's end.   
 

Q.  How do you feel about having to play a match  which is meaningless for you?  
 
JIM COURIER:  I am used to it.  I play Davis Cup.  They --  always play meaningless matches.   
 

Q.  But it will mean a lot for the person you are  playing and for the other two people in the group?  
 
JIM COURIER:  Well, I will play my best and whatever  happens, happens.   
 

Q.  Would you feel like you are more concentrated  this tournament than you have been in the last month or  two?  
 
JIM COURIER:  For sure.   
 

Q.  This is a breakthrough, this tournament?  
 
JIM COURIER:  Most concentrated I have been all year.   
 

Q.  And the results don't disappoint you in a  sense?  
 
JIM COURIER:  I am doing everything I can.  Things haven't  been going my way, but you know, I am doing what is  necessary out there.   
 

Q.  Because like when we watched you play your  best tennis in Australia and the French you really  focused; you don't have much talk back and forth with  anybody.  Pretty much into your match?  
 
JIM COURIER:  Different kind of concentration out there.  Different types, but no, I felt pretty good out there.   
 

Q.  That is not essential for you to be on your  game for you to be focused and inside yourself?  
 
JIM COURIER:  Being inward doesn't have anything much to do  with my focus.  I can focus in many different ways.   
 

Q.  There were no answers yet.  
 
JIM COURIER:  What?   
 

Q.  She said last question.  I said, there were  no answers yet.  
 
JIM COURIER:  Oh, okay.
