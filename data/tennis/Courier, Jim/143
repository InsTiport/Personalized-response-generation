Q. Jim, you have practiced very hard this past week before the tournament started.  Did you practice harder than you would have normally for a Grand Slam event?

JIM COURIER:  No, not at all.


Q. About the same?

JIM COURIER:  Just normal practice, just getting used to the courts.  We didn't go that hard, really. We go harder usually before the French, we will go a lot harder, but these courts are going to play a lot faster than on clay.


Q. Seemed like you put a lot of hours in? 
just out here, so you all notice it.


Q. Are you feeling good out there?

JIM COURIER:  Yeah, I feel fine.  Yeah.  Thanks
