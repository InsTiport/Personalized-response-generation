 Q.  Can you train any harder than you did last year?

 JIM COURIER:  I can train harder.  I don't know if it would be,
you know, you can overtrain.  I don't want to overtrain.

 Q.  You trained so hard and finished that much behind Pete,
did that cause you at the end of the year to think what do I have
to do to be No. 1?

 JIM COURIER:  Not really.  I know what I have to do to be the
best that I can be.  Being No. 1 is not in my control.  I just
do what I can do, and you know, I am happy as long as I know that
I am doing what I need to do.

 Q.  Has your game been off to a decent start this year?

 JIM COURIER:  Yeah, not bad.  Played pretty well down in Australia.
 I feel pretty good about it.

 Q.  What do you want to do differently this year?  Technical
things you want to do?

 JIM COURIER:  No, not really.  Not much of anything. I just want
to keep working hard and keep playing and let the cards kind of
fall.

 Q.  Agassi was talking about peak years being 24 to 27.  What
do you think?

 JIM COURIER:  I don't think you can pinpoint everybody's peak
years as the same.  I think people physically and mentally grow
differently than others.  Some people peak earlier.  Some people
peak later.  Only way you can really tell is where career finished
and you can look back and see.

 Q.  Were there times when you just felt physically exhausted
last year?

 JIM COURIER:  Sure.

 Q.  Did they come at any time particular time of the year?

 JIM COURIER:  I was pretty tired after the U.S. Open.  I continued
to train really hard but it was-- I was a little bit more empty
inside; still pushing myself, but there wasn't much coal burning
in the fire there.

 Q.  Got your batteries recharged?

 JIM COURIER:  Just had a nice little break at end of the year.


 Q.  I am told that you brought a house on Fisher Island?

 JIM COURIER:  Yeah.

 Q.  Do you like it in South Florida?

 JIM COURIER:  I love it.

 Q.  Does that mean that you are here often during the year?

 JIM COURIER:  That is my house.

 Q.  Are you out of Dade City except to visit you parents?

 JIM COURIER:  I have been out of Dade City for a while.

 Q.  Except Christmas and Thanksgiving?

 JIM COURIER:  Sure.

 Q.  You used to train at Saddlebrook.  Do you still train
there?

 JIM COURIER:  I still go back and train there from time to time
Pat Etcheberry is there.

 Q.  Who is there to train with on Fisher Island?

 JIM COURIER:  Pate Cramer.

 Q.  Enough players out there to train with?

 JIM COURIER:  I think there are.

 Q.  Can you run down today's match?

 JIM COURIER:  It was pretty clean.  There was not a lot of mistakes
made by either of us.  I thought it was good just a good matchup,
really, both of us played really well out there.

 Q.  Sure.
