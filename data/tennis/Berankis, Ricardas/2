R. BERANKIS/D. Medvedev
6-3, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Looked like a pretty solid performance out there.
RICARDAS BERANKIS: Yeah, was feeling good today.  Really happy with my game today.  I was able to make the whole plan, what I was planning to do before the match.  Yeah, it worked out.
Q. The plan was?
RICARDAS BERANKIS: The plan was to stay as close as possible and not to get in his game, which is to get into those long rallies which he loves.  Actually towards the end, he was able to start doing that, but he was going full power, so it was quite risky from his side.
I stayed against it, yeah.
Q. Were you getting nervous to close it out?
RICARDAS BERANKIS: Yes, of course, you get always nervous.  Plus he made those quite tough shots, I would say.  The whole match he was not making it.  Now with those long rallies, lobs over the center court, it's always tough.
Q. Were you surprised just to drop six games?
RICARDAS BERANKIS: Was I surprised?
Q. Yes.
RICARDAS BERANKIS: I cannot say I was surprised.  Actually I was not really thinking about it.  As I say, I was trying to keep up my plan.  Yeah, nothing else to do.  It gave the result.
Q. How big is this for you?
RICARDAS BERANKIS: Of course, it's big.  You beat top-20 player, it gives a lot of confidence.  That's what I can say, yeah.
Q. Players yesterday were talking about how windy it is out there.  Looked the same today.
RICARDAS BERANKIS: Yes, in the beginning of the match was not that crazy.  But towards the end of the first set, it was already windy.  You can be complaining about the surface or something, but not the wind, yeah.
