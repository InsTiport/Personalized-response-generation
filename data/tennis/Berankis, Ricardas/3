   THE MODERATOR:  Questions.   
  
  Q.  What is it like winning the whole thing?   
 RICARDAS BERANKIS:  It feels very good.  Just unbelievable feeling.  It was actually the third Grand Slam I played pretty well, and I won it, so it feels good.   
  
  Q.  How many times have you played in this tournament?   
 RICARDAS BERANKIS:  Second time.  Last year I played qualifying.  I couldn't qualify.  I lost first round.  This year I won.  Better (smiling).   
  
  Q.  Had you watched him play this week?   
 RICARDAS BERANKIS:  No, I didn't watch him even once.  I saw him only yesterday first time.  I just came on the court and played my game.   
  
  Q.  What was working for you and not the other?   
 RICARDAS BERANKIS:  Today was serve pretty well, consistent, like pretty fast, flat serves.  I think that's what hold me my games, my service games.  I was pretty consistent on the returns.  I broke him once first set, I win the match.   
  
  Q.  You held, then broke him right away.  Were you thinking he was nervous at that point?   
 RICARDAS BERANKIS:  Actually, I think that he was nervous in the first game, that's when I broke him.   
  
  Q.  Were you nervous or not?   
 RICARDAS BERANKIS:  Not really.  I was pretty okay today.   
  
  Q.  Do you think that was your advantage and experience?   
 RICARDAS BERANKIS:  Yeah, in that stuff, yeah.   
  
  Q.  Have you practiced a lot with Federer these past two weeks during the Open?  I know you're practicing with him today a little later.   
 RICARDAS BERANKIS:  Yeah, that's right.  Half an hour.   
  
  Q.  Have you done it before?   
 RICARDAS BERANKIS:  No.  Only in Dubai one month ago.   
  
  Q.  How did that help your game?   
 RICARDAS BERANKIS:  I think it give me confidence, you know, when you see the No. 1 on the other side you're playing yourself.   
 I think that gives you a lot of confidence.   
  
  Q.  Did he ask you?  How did that come about?   
 RICARDAS BERANKIS:  His manager talked to my coach, my manager, decided.   
  
  Q.  Can you describe how it's different to hit with him than to hit with juniors?   
 RICARDAS BERANKIS:  Just different at all.  Just completely different.   
  
  Q.  Completely different?   
 RICARDAS BERANKIS:  Yeah.   
  
  Q.  Because you feel different or because of the way he hits the ball?   
 RICARDAS BERANKIS:  Because there is No. 1, you know, Roger Federer.  Of course, it's different, yeah.   
  
  Q.  Does he hit the ball differently than what you're used to?   
 RICARDAS BERANKIS:  Like he hits the ball solid and fast.  But, you know, he's like the God of tennis right now.  So when you see the other person standing on the other side, of course it's different for you.   
  
  Q.  Do you find it hard to get your game going when you have Roger Federer on the other side of the net?   
 RICARDAS BERANKIS:  First few days, yeah.  First few days, yeah.  But after he treat us like good friends.  We relaxed also.   
 After it was okay.   
  
  Q.  Quite a lot of pressure when he's watching?   
 RICARDAS BERANKIS:  That's right (smiling).  But after it's okay.   
  
  Q.  What are the plans now?   
 RICARDAS BERANKIS:  I'm gonna have a few days off.  After we going to play some future tournaments in California.  After I think I'm going home for one month, then coming back to the States, so...   
  
  Q.  You had some fans that had a Lithuanian flag they were unable to fly.  Could you talk about your connection with them, why they were here?   
 RICARDAS BERANKIS:  Those were a few friends of my coach.  I didn't know them pretty well.  That was the first days.  I met them first time in my life.  They're nice people.  Big thanks for them for coming and cheering for me.  Thanks.   
  
  Q.  Was that the biggest crowd you've ever played in front of?  The stands were packed.   
 RICARDAS BERANKIS:  One of the biggest, yeah.  One of the biggest.
