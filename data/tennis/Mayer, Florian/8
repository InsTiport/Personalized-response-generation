FLORIAN MAYER: Yeah, in the first set, like 3-All. Then I took some pain tablets. I feel nothing. And in the third set, it comes again, and nothing helped. So it was better to retire because I couldn't move anymore. 

FLORIAN MAYER: Yeah, it's the same like two months ago in Stuttgart. I think it's not a strong injury, but maybe a pulled muscle. So when you make a big step on the court, you feel it all the time and you cannot move, so it makes no sense to play. 

FLORIAN MAYER: No. I mean, I played unbelievable match in the second set. I think if the injury -- if I had no injury, I think I had good chances to beat him today. 

FLORIAN MAYER: Yeah. I mean, I like to play some slice, tops, maybe to destroy a little bit the game from the opponent. But it was I think good match in the first two sets. We both played very flat and very hard, so it was good for the spectators to watch a match like this. 

FLORIAN MAYER: Yeah, I think from his shots, it's no problem. Is the best shots I think from all players. But, I mean, he's 34 or 35 years old, so it's maybe tough if it's getting over five sets. But if he doesn't need to move so even, he can play unbelievable. And I think with this crowd here, you never know. I think he has good chances to reach semifinals, and then maybe to win the tournament. I mean, in the quarterfinal now against Federer, it's this match everybody wants to see. It's unbelievable if both players come through to the quarterfinal. The crowd can see a match like this. 

FLORIAN MAYER: No. I mean, for me it was the game of my life to play this court, the biggest in the world, to play Agassi maybe his last year. Nobody knows how long he's going to play. For me I enjoyed very much, and the crowd was very fair. I had a lot of fun today.
