F. MAYER/J. Del Potro
  6-2, 7-5

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Never easy to play a player like Del Potro, a player of the quality of Del Potro, even though he's been off injured.
 FLORIAN MAYER: Of course. I mean, he was injured for a long time, but he won a Grand Slam tournament two years ago, so he's a really good player. 
 I think I played a very solid match today. Didn't miss a lot from the baseline. Yeah, I'm quite happy with my performance.

 Q. One half of the draw has opened up for you with Baghdatis not there. Is it a good feeling for you this week in Sydney?
 FLORIAN MAYER: Of course it's a change for all the players now with Baghdatis gone from the bottom half, so it's a good chance. 
 But tomorrow's getting also a very tough match. 

 Q. You lost to Del Potro for a couple years now. Tell us, playing today, what kind of level is he at, do you think? He's obviously still coming back. 
 FLORIAN MAYER: Of course you could see he's not 100%. His serve is really strong, but from the baseline he missed a lot. I think also he was maybe a little bit tired from his long match Monday. Because when you didn't play for such a long time and you play your first match over three hours, it's really tough. 
 But I really played well from the baseline. I knew when I played my game I had a good chance to win today, and I took it.
