Q. What was Blake doing well today? It's been a while since he's really shown that kind of form. 
 
 FLORIAN MAYER: Yeah, sure, he played very well I think. But, I mean, I made three games against him and that's so bad. I played very bad. Yeah, I don't know what to say now.  
 
Q. Obviously, you were not at your best, but what was he doing well today? 
 
 FLORIAN MAYER: Yeah, everybody knows he's playing good forehand, he's moving very well. Yeah, he played good. I had no rhythm, and, yeah, he was too good.
