Q.  Captain, did Agassi's withdrawal come as a complete surprise to you?
 
CAPTAIN HAGESKOG:  Yeah, we were surprised this morning when we were out practicing the referee came to me and said, Andre is injured and they are going to play with Todd instead. 
 

Q.  Did you take hope from that development?  Were you encouraged by that development?
 
CAPTAIN HAGESKOG:  Yeah, it is a difficult situation for both Todd and Thomas, I think, but, yeah, we were prepared to play Agassi. 
 

Q.  Do you think that Thomas might have experience a letdown after planning to play Agassi and now suddenly he is playing a different guy?
 
CAPTAIN HAGESKOG:  He had never played Todd Martin before, so it was kind of difficult for him, perhaps, yes. 
 

Q.  What are your hopes for the Davis Cup team  next year?
 
CAPTAIN HAGESKOG:  What do you think? 
 

Q.  I would think they would be very high, but I'd like to hear it from you.
 
CAPTAIN HAGESKOG:  Yeah, with all the boys fresh for next year, I think we are going to try to get the Cup back to Sweden.
