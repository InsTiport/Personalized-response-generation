MODERATOR:  Questions, please.  
 
 
Q.  Your first win this year. 
 
TATHIANA GARBIN:  Yeah, since last year because I did an operation.  I stop for a while. 
 
Q.  Where, the knee?
 
TATHIANA GARBIN:  Thyroid.  It was pretty bad.  But then all was good.  After operation, everything was good.  After two weeks, I start again to practice.  Was so hard to restart to play well, to play the match.  It was tough this year.  I start since Sydney was the first tournament after the operation.  It was pretty tough to come back.  But now it's good. 
 
Q.  What was the problem with your thyroid?
 
TATHIANA GARBIN:  I had something on here (indicating her neck/throat).  They didn't know what it was.  Then it was something good. 
 
Q.  Was it a growth of some sort?
 
TATHIANA GARBIN:  Yeah.  They didn't know exactly what it was, but then was like a calcification.  I don't know how to say.  
 
Q.  Sort of a cyst?
 
TATHIANA GARBIN:  Kind of, yeah.  When I went there, when I went to the hospital, they didn't really know what it was and was worry, no, at the beginning?  When they did the operation, they saw it, they say okay.  
 
Q.  Not malignant?
 
TATHIANA GARBIN:  No. 
 
Q.  A little scary?
 
TATHIANA GARBIN:  Yeah.  My parents were very scary, yeah.  I mean, I was okay.  I say, "That's what happen." 
 
Q.  Was it painful?
 
TATHIANA GARBIN:  No.  It start after already one year that I had.  But I was playing well.  I say, "No, I have to play because this year it's important."  I really play good last year.  But then I was so tired, I couldn't play anymore. 
 
Q.  It made you tired?
 
TATHIANA GARBIN:  Yeah, it made me tired.  
 
Q.  So are you taking medication now?
 
TATHIANA GARBIN:  Yeah, I take that.  
 
Q.  Where was the operation? 
 
TATHIANA GARBIN:  In Bologna, where I live. 
 
Q.  Was this in December or November?
 
TATHIANA GARBIN:  In November, middle of November. 
 
Q.  When was the first time after that that you started to practice again?
 
TATHIANA GARBIN:  I start to practice December, beginning of December.  Then I start the first tournament in Sydney. 
 
Q.  Is this your best win, migliore (best)?
 
TATHIANA GARBIN:  Si, it was. 
 
Q.  Did you feel lonely out there?  Every time she got a point, people were cheering.
 
TATHIANA GARBIN:  No, I like when there's a lot of people.  I don't care if it's for me or for the other.  I like to see people over there.  
 
Q.  Why do you think you won the match?  What did you do well?
 
TATHIANA GARBIN:  I run a lot, I think, and I change game a lot.  Maybe she miss because I change game, speed, everything, and I play my best, I think.  
 
Q.  This is your first victory this year?
 
TATHIANA GARBIN:  Yeah, the first one.  
 
Q.  Were you nervous at the end of the first set?
 
TATHIANA GARBIN:  I was a little because I said, "5-3 and I serve.  Now you have to keep it."  The top seed, they don't give a lot of chance.  You have to keep all points, just try your best every point. 
 
Q.  Then you double-faulted. 
 
TATHIANA GARBIN:  I say, "I have to be constant."  Then I double-fault.  "Okay, be concentrate."  That's true. 
 
Q.  What did you say to yourself on the changeover?
 
TATHIANA GARBIN:  5-4, "It's only four points.  I have to think just that.  Four, three, two, one."  Then I made it. 
 
Q.  What were you thinking before match point?
 
TATHIANA GARBIN:  I miss one match point, no?  
 
Q.  Yes. 
 
TATHIANA GARBIN:  Then I say, "Okay, now if I win."  I think the future.  You have to think the present, no?  I did a mistake, but it was, "What I going to do if I going to win?"  I can go to the floor, but no, is okay.  
 
Q.  How well-known are you at home in Italy?  Do you get a lot of attention?
 
TATHIANA GARBIN:  No, no. 
 
Q.  Not at all?
 
TATHIANA GARBIN:  Not at all, not really.  Last year maybe because I improve a lot.  I become maybe 30, 36, something like this.  But in Italy, they don't care about tennis.  They care just football.  That's what I think with Italian, maybe they change idea. 
 
Q.  How do you feel now?  You can win tournament?
 
TATHIANA GARBIN:  I like it a lot.  I don't know, just glory inside.  But I have to be there and stay here, don't fly too much.  
 
Q.  Do you play Federation Cup?
 
TATHIANA GARBIN:  We don't know yet. 
 
Q.  Sciopero (strike)?
 
TATHIANA GARBIN:  Sciopero (laughter).  
 
We want to change a little bit the Federation because we had some problem.  But I hope to play.  If things stay like this, it's very difficult.  They have to change something.  I think the most important thing is to talk, to improve as like player and like Federation.  If we can talk with them, it's going to be good because we can say something that they didn't even know what we need, like this.
