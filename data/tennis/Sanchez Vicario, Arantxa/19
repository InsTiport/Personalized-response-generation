MODERATOR: Ladies and Gentlemen, Arantxa. First question. 

Q. What happened in the second set?

ARANTXA SANCHEZ-VICARIO: I probably relaxed a little bit, and I was didn't continue,
you know, taking the ball, you know, on the top. I maybe went a little bit backwards. She
started attacking better. I lost a little bit my concentration also. Then later everything
went too fast, I was be able to start well again in the third set. 

Q. Were you worried at that stage when she drew level at a set all?

ARANTXA SANCHEZ-VICARIO: Well, I know what I did wrong, so I try not to do it and start
well in the third set. I start be focussed again of the first two games. When I went
ahead, I know she was start thinking a little bit more, I was be able to continue to play
well. Here if you miss two shots, the other play can play well. You have to continue and
not get disappointed. I was happy. It was not an easy match. Always tough the first match
for me. 

Q. John McEnroe was on TV last night saying that the Williams sisters need to learn a
bit of humility. A couple years ago you were on record saying you were unhappy about the
way they went around. What is your relationship with them now?

ARANTXA SANCHEZ-VICARIO: Maybe, you know, I'm not the right person to say it. You have
to ask them. I mean, I don't pay attention how they are right now, so I don't know. 

Q. You don't have any contact with them?

ARANTXA SANCHEZ-VICARIO: I get along well, but that's it. It's not like they're my -- I
mean, they are my friends, but I talk like normal.
