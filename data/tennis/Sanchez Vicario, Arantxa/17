MODERATOR:  Arantxa. 


Q.  How distracted were you by the Cyclops bleeping at the start of your service game?  I think you double-faulted. 

ARANTXA SANCHEZ-VICARIO:  Well, you know, when you concentrating, a beep comes to the court, it's kind of hard.  I tried not to think about it.  Obviously, you know, not so much concentration, I make a couple double-faults.  I just try to keep focus, get into the match, don't think too much about it.  They should work on that, no?
