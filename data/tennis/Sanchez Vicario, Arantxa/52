 Q. Was it as easy as it looked? How do you think you played?
 
 ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO: Well, I think always the first match probably is the toughest
one. I do feel like I played, you know, pretty good. I know I can play better than what I
did today. I mean, I guess I was pushing her and she was not being able to hit the ball
back when she was not in position. I guess it was, you know, kind of easy. It's always
nice to go through. Always the first one is probably the toughest one you can play. Maybe
better the next one. 
 
Q. Does it take a couple of matches here at the Open to get more accustom to the noise
because this is different from the other slams?
 
 ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO: Definitely. I come from a tournament the week before was so
quiet. Now here is a crowd of people moving. It was kind of like, you know, nice to be
back to the grandstand between the years. You have to kind of get used to the distance of
the court, how the people moving. Once you're there, you concentrate, you're on top, just
trying to play well and win the match. That's why I just do my job, get in and get out of
there fast. At the beginning it was kind of hard to go back there for a while. 
 
Q. Do you like your chances here?
 
 ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO: I think I'm playing pretty good. Had a very good season. I'm
just thinking one at a time, that's all. That's doing my best, and what happens happens. I
think everybody has a chance. Two week tournament. In a Grand Slam, anything can happen.
You just have to think first one at a time, finish the first week, then you'll be able to
concentrate for the next one. I feel good, and that's what I need to come to this Grand
Slam.
