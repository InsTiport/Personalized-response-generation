Q. You made quick work of her?

ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO:  Yes, I think that I get into the court really concentrated and after yesterday I was ready to play at night and they cancelled me.  I wanted to play really well today and I didn't need as many shots.  She didn't have, I think, any chance to come into the match.  I just played really well, very deep and moving the ball really well.  I am very happy with the way I played today.


Q. What did you know about her entering this match?

ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO:  I know she had a very good forehand. Trying to run his forehand because it is his best shot.  I knew I have to move the ball so she was not in position to use her forehand.  Then she makes more mistakes and gets the ball in the middle of the court and I hit winners.  I never played her before, but I knew the way I have to play and I did the right thing today.  I am very happy because it has been a great match today.


Q. Thank you.
