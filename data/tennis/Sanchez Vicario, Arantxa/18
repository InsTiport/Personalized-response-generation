 MODERATOR: Good evening. Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario.  
 
Q. Did you think at any time you were going to lose the match?
 
 ARANTXA SANCHEZ-VICARIO: Well, I try not to think about that. Definitely was, you know,
very close. I have to fight back really hard. She was playing very well. I make a lot of
errors, too, but she was hitting very good winners. Definitely I try not to get
disappointed. I almost get to the point of losing when she had, you know, a couple match
points. I just think that when I was down, I probably get much more focused, play great
shots when I need to. After winning the second set, that give me confidence to keep going
to the third one and finally win it. But, yeah, it was tough match.  
 
Q. How do you feel about playing Monica now?
 
 ARANTXA SANCHEZ-VICARIO: Well, it's kind of like a typical match. We play so many times
in our careers. Today's match helped me a lot because, I mean, against Monica is going to
be also similar rallies. I look forward to play her. I have nothing to lose. I have
confidence. But I have to start well, you know, since the beginning with her, otherwise
she doesn't give you many chances. I probably need to serve a little better than I did
than like today, especially at the end of the third set, I started serving a little
better. With Monica, I will also need to be more aggressive. It can go either way.
