MODERATOR:  Questions for Arantxa. 


Q.  How did the delay affect you today with all the weather?

ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO:  Well, it's been a long day.  Fortunately, you know, they switch me the court.  Outside courts are much faster than the Stadium Court.  It's a big difference.  It's not excuse.  I just think I make too many unforced errors today, many more than normal.  My opponent play better.  That's why she beat me. 

Q.  Do you intend to keep playing on next year, the Grand Slams?

ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO:  Who say I'm stopping? 

Q.  I'm just asking. 

ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO:  I'm here, so that's what it counts.

Q.  But next year as well, we can expect to see you back?

ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO:  The year didn't finish yet.  I mean, I'm not say I'm retiring.  That says all, right?  I'm going continue play.
