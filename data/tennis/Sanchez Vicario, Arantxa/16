 THE MODERATOR: First question. 
 
Q. The next round you play Allison Bradshaw. What do you know about her, if anything?
 
 ARANTXA SANCHEZ-VICARIO: Who? 
 
Q. Good question. Allison Bradshaw.
 
 ARANTXA SANCHEZ-VICARIO: I don't know her. 
 
Q. Don't you try to scout your possible opponents or have your coach scout your future
opponents?
 
 ARANTXA SANCHEZ-VICARIO: No, I just thinking first I want to win my match. Next day I
have one day to know who I'm gonna play. Probably maybe I mean I don't know if she's a
wildcard, is she? 
 
Q. Yes.
 
 ARANTXA SANCHEZ-VICARIO: I probably feel that I have one day to know how she plays
tomorrow. But it's -- I mean it's like sometimes it happens that you go to rounds and you
don't know who's your opponent. 
 
Q. You had played Marissa Irvin, right? Do you remember her?
 
 ARANTXA SANCHEZ-VICARIO: Yes. 
 
Q. You beat her, I know that.
 
 ARANTXA SANCHEZ-VICARIO: Uh-huh. 
 
Q. Was that a tough match for you, Marissa, if you can remember it?
 
 ARANTXA SANCHEZ-VICARIO: I don't -- it's been long time. But I mean always you never
have an easy match. You just have to be focus and concentrate and be able, you know, to do
well and win. So I will be ready who I have to play, you know, next match and just play my
own game. 
 
Q. How do you think you're playing here this week?
 
 ARANTXA SANCHEZ-VICARIO: I feel good. 
 
Q. You're winning.
 
 ARANTXA SANCHEZ-VICARIO: I had a tough first-round match, that helped me a lot. Today I
play, you know, much better. I definitely have a good preparation before I come here, and
I've always done well here, you know, I like this surface as well. I just concentrate one
at a time. But I feel good with my game.
