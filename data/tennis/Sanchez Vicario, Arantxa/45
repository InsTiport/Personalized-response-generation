Q.   Arantxa, how do you feel at this point of the tournament?   It has to be better, obviously.
 
ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO:  Well, definitely I feel better.  And today's match shows that I was more focused and more concentrated and I was in control of the match since the beginning; not like the first day that I have a slow start.  But, when the tournament - the matches keep going, I get better and better.  And, I think that, like I said, the first one is always the most difficult one to get in and to get used to it.  And, it was a pretty good match for me.  But, today I felt very confident and I was not missing so many shots and I was, you know, serving pretty well and having the control of the point pretty quickly so she was not having so many chances.  
 

Q.   It didn't look like she played particularly well in the first set.  Do you feel like you really took advantage of what she gave you?
 
ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO:  Well, I think -- obviously I didn't let her play.  That is the difference.  I mean, if you let her go into the match, she can be very dangerous.  I mean, she has very good groundstrokes and, obviously, I was not going to let her play.  So, since the beginning, like I say, since the first game, I was very aggressive, concentrated and taking the control before her.  And, moving her around.  That is when she has much more difficulty to play and causes errors and I make the winners.  So, that is why she was not so much used to it.  Then I missed a couple of shots and it was a little bit close in the second.  But, when I get the break, you know, I start doing it well again.  And, I felt very good, concentrated, and keep going and it was, you know, very good match for me.  I didn't let her get into the match, I think.
