Q. Do you have any comment on your condition?
 
ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO:  I am very happy with the way I played and I feel much better today than I did the first match.  And I played more consistent and I served very well. And she was not be able to come into the match.  I was concentrate and going for the shots, be more aggressive and I did control the match pretty good and I am happy with the way I played. 
 

Q. Do you feel any different between the Olympic games and major tournaments?
 
ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO:  Yes, I think it is completely different.  I mean, Grand Slam, you know, you have the chance to play every year and so if you don't do -- if you do well, then you can try the next year or if it doesn't go well also the next year, but Olympics is only every four years and you prepare probably different for the Olympics.  You represent your country and it is a different feeling for me, I mean, I am happy to be, you know, in my third Olympics and I am looking forward to seeing if I can do the same as I did in Barcelona.  That was very good for me.
