Q. Which dog is that? 

ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO: Mine. 

Q. Roland? 

ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO: He's not here. I miss him. 

Q. You left him at home? 

ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO: Yes. 

Q. New York is not a very good place to bring a dog; no? 

ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO: No, no, I left him in Spain because it's better. It is not
because of New York, it's because I've been a lot of weeks in the States and it was a very
long trip when I went to San Diego, and so that's why he's not with me in the whole tour.
So I miss him. It's nice to see a picture. 

Q. Does your family take care of him? 

ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO: No, my father is taking care of him, so, when I go back I can
see him after that, both of them, actually. 

Q. The dog comes first, then dad? 

ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO: No, dad is here. He just arrived, so he left him with my
sister, but that's why. 

Q. So business as usual today; not that tough of a match? 

ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO: No, she's a player who hits the balls back and she can hit
really good slice, but I think that it was very comfortable match and nice to come back
onto Stadium Court and be comfortable and, you know, play a good match and go, you know,
to the next round. 

Q. Were you a little surprised by Conchita? 

ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO: Well, I -- after the match they told me. A little bit. I think
Ginger is a dangerous player, she goes to the net and she beat her one time. But anything
can happen during this tournament-- but a little surprised, yes. Everybody is playing well
and you really have to play your best, and I was a little bit surprised. 

Q. Arantxa, Tennis Magazine just wrote an article about you and the content pretty much
is: Arantxa is a mystery to the public, American public, and you remain a mystery; do you
feel that way or do you feel people aren't looking enough in your character? 

ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO: Well, I think maybe they know more Arantxa tennis player than
Arantxa personal. So that article was kind of-- there were more things that maybe people
don't know about me, and it was nice. And maybe I'm a little bit of a mystery, but it's
nice to see that people know me more now, and it's great to have this kind of articles and
I think it was very nice, you know, for the public to read and to, you know, maybe other
persons who are close to me also talk about me and I think it was nice. 

Q. If your fans ever got a chance to spend time with Arantxa the person, what type of
person would they find? 

ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO: Well, I think people know me more as tennis player. But
personally, I'm a very open person and I probably have feelings like everybody and, you
know, completely different than I look. Maybe I look-- maybe, not upset, but too
concentrated when I play and then after the court I'm a much more normal person. You know,
I like to spend time with my friends, like a person of my age and so there's a lot of
people who maybe will be surprised if they know me a little more than they do -- than they
know already. 

Q. What do you like to do to relax? 

ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO: I like to read, listen to music, and if I have chances, see an
action movie or -- but read and listen music, relax me a lot and spend time for myself and
it's also very nice. 

Q. Any sports you play just for fun? 

ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO: I used to play soccer, European soccer, and I like to play
golf too, those are my hobbies. 

Q. How is your golf score? 

ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO: No, I just started three months ago. 

Q. Really? 

ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO: Yes, but I always watch it on TV. But I just start playing and
I have a lot of good time because at the beginning I couldn't hit the ball straight, it
was going everywhere, but now I start feeling better. 

Q. Have you met any of the Spanish golf pros like Ballesteros or anything like that? 

ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO: I know Ballesteros and Olazabul and I just thought maybe it
would be good if they give me tips, I can play better. 

Q. You haven't had a chance to get tips from them yet? 

ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO: No, I hope maybe when I go back if I see them. 

Q. You said you like to read, what are some of your favorite books or what books are
you reading now? 

ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO: Well, I like Sidney Sheldon and Agatha Christie and I like
Spanish writers. 

Q. Which Spanish writers? 

ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO: Marcus. Different ones, but I like almost -- kind of -- it
relax me a lot to read.
