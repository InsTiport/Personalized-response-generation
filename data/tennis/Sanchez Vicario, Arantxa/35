Q.  Can you talk about the match. 
 
ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO: I think this match helped me a lot.  I think at the end I start playing pretty good. And I think it is better to have toughest match at the beginning so you get more into the matches, then you feel more comfortable and more confidence for the next one. 
 

Q.  Conditions out there, some of the players said quite windy.
 
ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO: Yeah, they are tough.  Like I say, it is windy for both of us, for both players, so you have to be very patient.  You cannot be very frustrated or anything.  You just have to play point by point, because I think that makes you get more into the match and be more concentrated.  I am just trying to play one at a time and be concentrated and don't think about that.  Just trying to, you know, play my own game. 
 

Q.  Coming back as the former champion over here, any bearing on the way you are playing?
 
ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO: Well, I think obviously this tournament, I like it a lot, because I always have great  results here.  So I am hoping to play, you know, each match better and to be able to get one at a time.  But it will be nice to do well here again, so that is what I am looking for.  And just, you know, playing better and better each time.
