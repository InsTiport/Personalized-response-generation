MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  Was it your wrist you had treated?

ARANTXA SANCHEZ-VICARIO:  I had a little problem.  It was just to prevent because I was getting more pain.  It was not the excuse why I lost the match or anything.  I just needed more tape to support more. 

Q.  How much of a disappointment was it to lose today?

ARANTXA SANCHEZ-VICARIO:  Well, as I said, I didn't play, you know, my best.  I know I can play better.  But I make too many unforced errors.  I let her play with a lot of confidence.  She went for her shots, and she made them.  Definitely I think that with her winners and my unforced errors, I let her, you know, win the match.
