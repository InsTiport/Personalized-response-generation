THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  How does it feel to win three tournaments in a row, especially the big one, Australian Open? 

ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA:  I don't know.  I don't know what to say, I'm so happy.  And I really wonder about that.  I just played well.  I don't know what to say because I thought that I can't win that tournament, but it was too difficult for me.  I felt tired on the match.  So I did it, and I am so happy.  I don't know. 

Q.  Do you know why you got off to such a slow start at the beginning? 

ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA:  Uhm, I was sick a little bit in the first set, and I was dizzy, so I was shaking.  And then I will concentrate on every point.  And I tried to play because I can't (indiscernible) this match so easy because it's the final and I have to play.  I try to play every point.  And then I called the doctor and he helped me a little bit.  So I don't know. 

Q.  This has nothing to do with the bandage that's on your thigh? 

ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA:  Yeah. 

Q.  What is that? 

ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA:  Yeah, I couldn't move on the court so well because it little bit was sore, my legs.  I don't know, I get tape on the leg and it's little bit help me.  But anyway, it's sore and I could not move on the court so well. 

Q.  Is that an injury that you got recently? 

ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA:  Yeah, it's injury.  I got it from the first tournament in Traralgon.  So it has been pain for like three weeks. 

Q.  Did you call for the trainer twice or just the once? 

ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA:  No, just once.  And because I was sick, and I didn't know what to do because I was dizzy, so I was shaking.  I don't know.  Because I was so tired, he help me a little bit.

Q.  How did he help you? 

ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA:  Uhm, just he putted ice on my neck, and then I got the ice jacket and that's it.  I don't know, maybe that's why.  I just -- I just took a little bit rest, and then I tried to concentrate and I will not so much tired and I will try to play well.

Q.  It was the heat that bothered you?

ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA:  Yeah, it was heat.  Maybe because I played not in the hat, like it not covered my head.  That's why maybe.  It's bad, too. 

Q.  That was a mistake, not wearing a hat?

ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA:  Yeah, maybe, probably.  But I could not play in the hat because it's too long and I can't see the ball when I am serving.  So that's why I wearing that. 

Q.  Do you practice in Russia? 

ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA:  Yeah, I'm still practicing in Russia.  But I started to practice in Czech Republic in winter because it's too cold into Russia.  And I was in Czech Republic, and I like there.  So it's good place.  Found good club.  I like there. 

Q.  You play part of the year in Russia, one part in Czech Republic?

ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA:  Yeah, probably.

Q.  Where do you practice in Russia and Czech Republic? 

ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA:  In Russia I practice in Samara.  I was born there.  And in Czech I practice in Ostrava.  It's not so big town, but it's okay. 

Q.  Between the second and third set, she asked for a heat break, or apparently she was the one that needed the break or asked for it.  You didn't leave the court.  Why was that? 

ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA:  Yeah, because I don't think so that it's good for me if I won the set and I have to take a break because, uhm, I can't like relax a little bit.  When I take a break, and I get off from the court, it's not so good for me because I know myself.  If I do that, I will relax.  So that's why I tried to keep energy and keep concentrate, and that's why I stayed in court. 

Q.  How nervous were you today, through the match, before the match? 

ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA:  Uhm, actually I was not nervous.  I don't know.  Because I get to the final, it's good for me.  It's the best result.  So I just played well and I wasn't nervous so much.  Because she is No. 1 seeded on this tournament and she's a good player.  I just tried to play with her well.  I tried to show my best game.  But first set, I could not show that, but then I did it, so I am happy. 

Q.  Throughout this week you were saying you were tired and yet look how much tennis you've played.  Yesterday, three matches, and you won the doubles. 

ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA:  Yeah, I know.  I won the doubles.  And thanks for my partner, she was good, too.  And, yes, I am tired.  But I thought that it's my last match today, so I have to do what I can.  So I did whatever I can, and it was my last match, so I tried to play well every point.  I tried to fighting on this match. 

Q.  It hasn't sunk in yet that you won here, or it has?  You've won the championship in both singles and doubles. 

ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA:  Yeah, for some reason I don't know what to say.  I didn't know who can do that.  But I don't know.  But before quarterfinal, we wanted to defaulted because my partner was sick, and then we started play and we did it.  So I don't know.  I just -- you know, sometimes you cannot play doubles because you have singles tomorrow, for example, and you don't wanted to play a doubles so well because you want to keep energy for your singles.  But I play every match, so I don't care about that. 

Q.  How are you feeling now? 

ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA:  I am tired, but I am so happy that I can't feel so tired.  So I'm not worrying about that.  I am so happy, so I am okay. 

Q.  Have you had lots of phone calls and lots of people wanting to talk to you and celebrate?

ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA:  Yeah, we will celebrate.  I have a friends here.  So we are going to celebrate with them.  I want to have rest.  I really enjoying here, and I am gonna do everything, so I like here. 

Q.  Before you got on the plane, did you have an idea of how many matches you wanted from this trip?  Did you have a goal in your head of what you thought would be enough, would be satisfying? 

ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA:  Oh, I had so many matches.  I know that it's terrible.  It's I don't know.  Like it's too difficult to play every match because you can win the best player, you can lost to someone, I don't know.  And you need to have good things about that.  So it's not just play.  You have to, uhm -- I don't know.  You have to concentrate in every match.  So I don't know. 

Q.  It's an amazing run that you've had here. 

ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA:  Yeah, yeah. 

Q.  Must be more than you even dreamt about? 

ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA:  I tried to plan well and I tried to don't show to my opponent that I am nervous and I am little bit upset.  Every time I try to be, I don't know, in good situation.  Every time I'm saying, "Come on," and everything because I don't want to show my opponent that I am upset because it's helps her.  So maybe that's why it helps me, too. 

Q.  Where are you and your friends going to go to celebrate?

ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA:  We are going to go to have a dinner in their house, home, to watch Federer today, this great match.  And maybe tomorrow probably I am going to the beach.  And I don't know.  I will have a rest. 

Q.  Who are you going for, Federer or Baghdatis? 

ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA:  I don't know.  I really don't know, because they are both good players.  And Federer, it's Federer, you know, and he is the best player.  But Baghdatis good, too.  I saw his matches and it's amazing.  I like his playing.
