   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.   
  
  Q.  What were the conditions like out there today?  Was it difficult to play in?   
 ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA:  Yeah, it's kind of difficult 'cause it's was windy.  It was not sunny.  I mean, the weather was not really good.   
 But, I mean, it's okay.  She felt the same.  We were both in the same like conditions and everything like that.  So I just tried to keep playing well, get the ball into the court.  Didn't pay attention to that, so...   
  
  Q.  You seem to be dominating junior tennis at the moment.  What are you going to do for 2007?  Are you going to continue playing juniors?   
 ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA:  I think, because I have like five tournaments left until my birthday, I mean, WTA.  I have to continue playing juniors this year.  I don't know.   
 I'll try to play more WTA and pro tournaments.  I mean, I have limited of tournaments.  I can't just play them.   
 Yeah, I'll continue be play juniors.   
  
  Q.  How does it feel to win a Grand Slam title?   
 ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA:  Now I feel something that I already felt, like last year.  So, yeah, it's good.  I mean, you know, I was holding this trophy for a second time.  It's really great for me.  I mean, yeah, it's awesome.   
 Actually I expected that.  But, I don't know, I mean, it's going to be difficult for me to win this tournament again because was a little bit of pressure on me.  I don't know.  The juniors so good.  She play really well today, Madison Brengle.  It was tough match.   
  
  Q.  You seemed to handle the pressure well.  Got off the set points in the first one.   
 ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA:  My brother, he's my coach, he told me, and he tells me every time, that I need to just play well, thinking about my game.  He said that I don't need to think about my score.  So I did at the match.   
 She had a set point.  Okay, like that's a match.  Just play well, do your best, show the good game.  Then if you'll be playing good, so you'll see the results.
