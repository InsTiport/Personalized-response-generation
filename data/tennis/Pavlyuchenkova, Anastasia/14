 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. When did you find out about the substitution that you will be playing a singles match rather than the doubles?  
 ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA: (Through translation.) It was known, I mean, 80% was known that I would be playing the second day from the very beginning.   
  
  Q. (Through translation.) You're saving the team for second time. You leveled the score again. Why are you showing such great tennis specifically when playing in Fed Cup ties?  
 ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA: (Through translation.) Sounds like typically I have been playing really badly and now I'm playing well in Fed Cup.   
 No, it's all about motivation, because nowhere else can I motivate myself like I'm motivating here when playing Fed Cup. This is what I'm going to work on this season, because I'm just asking myself, why not play all my matches like I'm playing here in Fed Cup?   
  
  Q. (Through translation.) Did you feel any jitters at all before the match? And was your experience in the previous Fed Cup tie against France helpful in any way?   
 ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA: (Through translation.) Well, yes, I did feel jitters, and because that was supposed to be the decisive match in some way. But I told myself that my opponent is finding herself in the same position, because for her it was also a decisive match.  
  
  Q. (Through translation.) What were the odds for you to also play the doubles match? Did the captain consult the team?  
 ANASTASIA PAVLYUCHENKOVA: (Through translation.) No, I never knew anything about it. I just found out about the doubles combination in the locker room.
