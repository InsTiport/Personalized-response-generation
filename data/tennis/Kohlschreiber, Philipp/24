  4‑6, 6‑7, 7‑6, 6‑3, 2‑1 (ret.)

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Clarify the reasons for retiring from the match. 
PHILIPP KOHLSCHREIBER:   Well, I'm totally exhausted.   I was the last three days almost entire time in the bed.
I had a flu.   I feel pretty bad.   I felt like my body is really responsing bad at the end and I was no energy left in my body.

Q.   You've been in bed for the last two days?
PHILIPP KOHLSCHREIBER:   Yeah, last three days.   Doesn't matter how long.

Q.   Have you not been able to practice at all? 
PHILIPP KOHLSCHREIBER:   Last two days 45 minutes.   That's all.   But I always felt pretty bad.
Well, I mean, everything like the match went, I tried to hang in as long as I could.   Yeah, main thing is that I was just on the court, my body, but no energy, no nothing.
In the end, I also felt really tired and slow in the head.   I felt the right leg is really losing energy, so before I really hurt myself and everything.   Maybe was bad timing, but I was pretty‑‑ it's pretty hard to speak about because, you know, it's my best Grand Slam I played last year. 
I'm for sure the one who is really, whatever you want to call it, angry or sad about the situation.   It's very bad timing for sure.   But it's nothing you can do about it.
