  6‑4, 6‑4, 6‑4 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please.   
   
 Q.   Were there any moments that you thought you might be able to win it when it was going well?  
PHILIPP KOHLSCHREIBER:   Honestly I think the only little, little, little chance was when I had the chance to go up a break in the first set.   I missed quite a good opportunity pretty close.   After that he was, I think, in his mode.   He was winning his service games easier, more chances.  
Overall I think he played just a better match than I did.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel especially in the first set there were opportunities that slipped away from you?   
PHILIPP KOHLSCHREIBER:   You always could find one point where you missed, and overall the whole match he was more in control.   
Like I mentioned, he was winning his service games much easier so always put pressure on mine.   His opportunities were much bigger, and basically I played a good match but not good enough to beat him.  
I think he was too solid.   Novak, you know, he's moving like a ball machine, not giving you easy points and he's bringing too many balls back.   And especially the return, I think I played some great serves but it just came back much harder, and it's pretty tough.  
   
 Q.   Did it seem as though he had a little bit of rust, or did you think he was on his A game today?  
PHILIPP KOHLSCHREIBER:   I don't know if he needed to play his best, best tennis.   I think it's never possible in the first round, but I also don't think that he had a rusty game.   
I think after the draw came out I think he was mentally prepared for stepping it up maybe more than he used to be in the first round, but I think he had a very good game today.   
Also mentally he was strong.   I mean, he's here for winning the title and he showed he's ready for it, I think.
