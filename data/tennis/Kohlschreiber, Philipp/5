6-3, 7-5, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Are you satisfied with your match today?  
PHILIPP KOHLSCHREIBER: It's a tough question.  If you lose, I think you always are not happy, but I have to say that I give everything in the match.  I was running for every ball.  I had good attitude.   
I think I also played good-level tennis, but I also think that Novak played better.  He was, yeah, the better player today.   
 Q.  You forced him to play well?  
PHILIPP KOHLSCHREIBER: I think, yeah.  Like I said, I think we had very tough sets.  I was always first up with the break, which I couldn't hold long enough to make more pressure.  But I think we had great rallies.   
But overall, he was a very strong opponent today.  I think he played his service games very smoothly, and I had to work very hard for my service games.   
 Q.  I think you are quite used to very tough first rounds against Djokovic or Federer.  
PHILIPP KOHLSCHREIBER: So you'd say the draw is not probably done, yes?  Maybe (smiling).   
 Q.  Is it unlucky?  Are you lucky to play on Centre Court?  
PHILIPP KOHLSCHREIBER: I'm lucky that I'm a tennis player.  I don't know.  I mean, of course I'm not happy about the draw, but I take it how it comes, you know.  I trust in everything that is made fair, so why should I be concerned about tough draw?  Nothing.  It's part of the deal.  Sometimes you win; sometimes you lose.   
 Q.  What are you going to do now?  
PHILIPP KOHLSCHREIBER: Holidays.  Just three, four days to leave the tennis, because the last few weeks weren't the best.   
And then I start to practice on clay, and I play Hamburg and Kitzbuhel for my next tournaments.   
 Q.  You are leaving when?  
PHILIPP KOHLSCHREIBER: Tomorrow.   
 Q.  When the tournament starts?  
PHILIPP KOHLSCHREIBER: Yeah, Monday, yes.  Very early.  But what should you do?  I think it's also part -- you sometimes have a chance to be longer in the tournament, which would be of course a great success, but not this year.  This year my opponent was better.
