6-3, 7-5, 7-5
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Just talk me through your analysis of the game today and how you felt you played.
PHILIPP KOHLSCHREIBER: Well, I think it's tough to play against Kevin.  He's a player with a high-risk level of his game and big server, obviously.
I think it was a good match.  Maybe the first set I didn't start it well, but it's, yeah, new court, played a bit different, a bit faster than the outside courts.  Maybe I struggled the first minutes on court, but then I think I played quite well.
Yeah, he deserved to win.  Was better.
Q. He seemed to return very aggressively today.  Were you expecting that from him?
PHILIPP KOHLSCHREIBER: Yeah, for sure.  We played a couple of times, and his game style is always pretty much the same.  He wants to sit in the driver's seat every point, and, well, when you serve that big, doesn't matter if you don't do it every time.  You just have to play four good points.
I think for me unfortunately he played, at the end of the set, always pretty good tennis.  Got broken and had no chance to come back.
Q. He's I think been in the fourth round four times in five years now.  If he gets to the quarters and he faces Roger, do you think someone with a game like him has a chance to beat someone like Roger at Wimbledon?
PHILIPP KOHLSCHREIBER: Oh, sure.  He has a big game.  I think most is self-belief, especially with him.  He's kind of -- I don't know.  We don't speak a lot, so I think he's kind of a guy who he likes to be for himself and for his own team.  So I think if he believes to beat Roger on grass, I think he can do it, because the game is big.  He's serving well.
I think I'm a pretty good returner, but, yeah, maybe Roger is serving better than me, but, yeah, it comes to the close points.  If you have the self-belief, then everything is possible.
