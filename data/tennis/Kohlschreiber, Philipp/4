KOHLSCHREIBER/Pella 1-6, 6-3, 6-4   
(Questions in German)   
 Q.  Tomorrow you play against Chile and you are starting with Nico Jarry, I would like to know how much you know about him, have you ever played against and what do you think about the Chilean team? Thank you.  
PHILIPP KOHLSCHREIBER: First, I think we never played. I saw him, yeah, maybe a few times. He's a very big guy, with a lot of power.   
So, yeah, I have to talk with the coaches, first of all, if I play, maybe he doesn't play, I don't know. It's a decision of the captain. So let's see tomorrow who is going to play. But if I'm going to play against him, we have a lot of information. We will watch some videos.   
And I would say that the Chilean team, of course, had a very strong opponent yesterday, but I think for sure they will give everything playing for their country to win against us. So also for us it is going to be a very tough tie. It's a strong team with a good mentality. And we try to first to do our best today and the same for tomorrow.
