  N. DJOKOVIC/P. Kohlschreiber  6-1, 7-5, 6-4  An interview with:  PHILIPP KOHLSCHREIBER   THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   Q.  Could you describe what it was like, the conditions out there this afternoon.  PHILIPP KOHLSCHREIBER: For sure it was sticky and pretty warm out there.  It's, yeah, especially tough to play against such a strong opponent in these conditions. But I felt like he has also, let's say, some issues.  In the third set I felt I had maybe a little bit more momentum in my energy maybe.  He was also struggling, not moving his feet as good as he could maybe. But, yeah, it was pretty tough to play out there.
