 THE MODERATOR: Questions.   
  
  Q. How happy are you today with the match?  
 PHILIPP KOHLSCHREIBER: Oh, of course I'm very happy. You know the story. It's first clay court tournament, so the first match, you look where you stand. I had quite a long preparation. I arrived last week Monday.   
 So overall I have to say I did everything right. I played a good match today. I felt very good. No, it was a very good start for the clay court season.   
  
  Q. You've been playing here for a week?   
 PHILIPP KOHLSCHREIBER: Yes, almost. Monday, last week Monday. So six days I'm here, yeah, practicing on the courts.   
  
  Q. Do you like this tournament in particular?  
 PHILIPP KOHLSCHREIBER: Yeah, I like it very much. I mean, overall I have always good memories because I always started here the clay court season. I had good success here. I like the tournament. It's very nice. A lot of people are coming. Young people are supporting very loud and strong.   
 Yeah, I mean, also the surroundings, if you stay here, you look up, down, you have the sea, a nice hotel. It's really great. I think almost every player likes it very much here.   
  
  Q. What about your next match?  
 PHILIPP KOHLSCHREIBER: Oh, I hope I can have a revenge. Yeah, I lost in Indian Wells, so three weeks ago, against Verdasco. I hope I can turn around this time the match for my count.   
 But he's very strong. He has a really great season. I mean, it's not much to say about him. He's a strong player, the favorite. For sure I have to give everything to find a really good day to beat him.   
 Yeah, maybe I have a small advantage that I maybe played already one match here. But overall I have to play really good to beat him.
