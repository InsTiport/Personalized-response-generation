K. NISHIKORI/P. Kohlschreiber
6-3, 6-2, 7-5
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How tough was it out there?
PHILIPP KOHLSCHREIBER: Well, losing is always tough, but if you mean the weather conditions, it's pretty sticky out there.  So not too much air circulation.  But, yeah, tough to play, but was also good experience.
Q. What was he doing that made it very difficult for you?
PHILIPP KOHLSCHREIBER: Well, I think he pushed, especially in my weaknesses pretty good, you know, returning my second serve very aggressive, very deep.
Yeah, he didn't make many mistakes.  He pushed me around.  He was too much in control of the game.
Of course, I maybe had not my best day today.  But, yeah, it's another thing you can wish for.  I tried to, yeah, work hard into the points, which is tough.  He was very dictating.
But, yeah, overall I gave everything.  Wished to play a little bit better tennis today, but wasn't the case.
Q. Given that you gave everything, do you feel that walking away or having to walk away from the US Open at this point is all right?  You're able to take something positive from it?
PHILIPP KOHLSCHREIBER: Of course, I won three matches.  I think Kei is just not the best or a good matchup for me.  The way he plays, he's returning very well, doing everything a little bit more solid and more aggressive than my side, myself.
Yeah, I think he's in good shape.  Yeah, it would be a little bit better if I had a better start to make the first serve a little bit more physical.  But it was too easy for him always, yeah.  Start of every set, very easy to get ahead, and I think that pushed him also a little bit better through the match.
