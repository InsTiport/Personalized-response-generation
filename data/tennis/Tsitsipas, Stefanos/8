U. HUMBERT/S. Tsitsipas
7-6, 6-7, 7-6
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. I know you just stepped off the court, but what's kind of your reaction to that match and how tight it was?  What made the difference in the end, do you think?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS:   He played a great game of tennis.  I wasn't very consistent.  I don't know.  I'm just disappointed with the way I played.
I mean, he managed his service games really well, didn't -- the match changed after being 3-Love up in the first.  I felt like he got on the court with more confidence, and he started adapting to my rhythm.
Yeah, I don't know.  It's just really good tennis from him, and I was not confident when I had to play.
Q. You mentioned confidence for you.  How do you see that going into your next tournament?  Does it affect that that much, or do you feel that you'll be able to step up your confidence for your title defense in London?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS:   Right now, I don't know.  I really don't know.  During the second set my Roland Garros injury came back, and it wasn't as bad as at the French Open, but it kind of had me on the edge of things, and I wasn't sure if that's good for me to be out there.
But that's not an excuse, for sure.  I still fought and gave my best out there, despite this thing that I had on court.
I don't know.  I'm sad, for sure.  It's a match and a tournament that I could have done better than last year.
But at the same time, you know, really good for him to be playing good tennis like this.  I think he's born in the same year as me.  I can't wait to face him next time.
Q. Just speaking of Ugo, I know you played him in juniors before but this was the first tour-level meeting with him.  He's kind of on a roll right now.  What do you think is special about his game?  What's he really doing well?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS:   He was controlling his forehand really well during that match.  As you saw, did some amazing passing shots on the first game of the third set, which came unexpected.
He was just creating a lot of opportunities from his forehand side and doing a lot of damage from there.  His serve was very consistent, I would say.  And despite having opportunities where he would serve second serves, I could come in, be more aggressive, it didn't seem as easy as I had it planned in my head.
Q. Looking back, is there anything that you wish you could have taken back over the course of the match?  You were out there over three hours.
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS:   Maybe more concentrated being 3-Love up in the first.  I lacked some of that visualization when I was playing, and I should visualize more when I play and not think during the occurrence of the point.
