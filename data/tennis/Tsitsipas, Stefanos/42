THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for Stefanos.   
 Q.  What do you make of your level out there today?  
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: Well, I was serving well. I had trouble with my return today, which I think made -- not made, was decided in the majority of the match. I don't know whether it was because he was a lefty or, I don't really usually have this much trouble playing lefties, but today I think he was serving well. That was pretty much it. His serve was better than mine and a few points in the tiebreak didn't find, I didn't work out what I had to do and I didn't have a clear picture of how I have to play, which I usually have also much more adrenaline and a rush when I'm in the tiebreak. I like playing tiebreaks. Today, he was just, you know, better decision-making and he did things better than me.   
 Q.  How do you kind of balance -- the first match you were out there supporting your teammates -- how do you balance like the want to support them, but also to conserve energy for your singles match?  
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: Yeah, I tried leaving a little bit early before Mike's match to prepare myself. I have a few things going on with me right now. It's not an injury exactly, but it's an irritation, which I'm trying to warm up as well as possible before my match. So that's why I left a bit earlier. But I'm going to be there in the doubles. I think my, my existence in the box will be important for the boys to pump them up. And although we have lost, it's still important for us to do well in doubles. And, yeah, I think for my brother and for Mike, it's going to be the first time playing together.   
 Q.  It's early here in the year here in Brisbane, how are you feeling about the event? Talk about this being the first time the ATP Cup's been run. So what is it like preparing in the team format?  
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: I like it. I mean, it's good. I mean, surely I cannot picture anything better than this right now. There hasn't been an event which draws so much attention like the ATP Cup, so I don't find any reason to be playing in any other events and not ATP Cup. So for me it's an extra honor to be sharing the court with and giving the opportunity to, as I said, to my fellow tennis players from the same country and giving me the opportunity to witness this and play in a big stage. The ATP Cup was No. 1 priority for me when I, when it was announced, so, yeah.   
 Q.  Could you elaborate on the irritation that you mentioned, which body part it might be, and if you're concerned that it's something that could keep going all the way to the Australian Open?  
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: Can you repeat the question, please?   
 Q.  The irritation that you mentioned. Can you say which body part is it and is it something that you're concerned enough to manage going on a few weeks to Melbourne starts?  
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: Yeah, I'm going to try to work on it. It's in my right shoulder, wrist. Usually when I stop, I had vacation for three weeks in a row and, obviously, had my pre-season. When I switched to the new conditions here from Dubai to here, first practice I had here was a bit irritating. I didn't feel good, to be honest. So today I woke up a bit sore in my arm and I was being a little bit stressed before the match because I didn't know if I'm going to be able to serve, but I served okay. Pretty good, I can say for the standards that I was expecting. So that was the only issue today. But, obviously, my fighting spirit and the soul I put on the court is more important than -- injuries can also affect your performance, but it didn't quite affect it today too much, no.   
 Q.  Could you talk about what it's like to, there's no really easing your way into a season with an ATP Cup. What it's like to start your season against such a top player and face other top players the rest of this tournament.  
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: It's unusual. I don't think you have a match like this as first, as your first match of the year. I don't mind it, it's good to start with the best, playing against the best. It's going to take, for a few players, a little bit of time to adjust and to get used to the conditions, obviously. I don't mind it, it's fine, yeah.   
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you very much.
