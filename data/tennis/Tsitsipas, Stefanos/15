  D. THIEM/S. Tsitsipas
 7-6, 4-6, 6-3
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Tough match out there, three sets again.  What was the difference between you and Dominic today?
 STEFANOS TSITSIPAS:   He dealt with my serve better and took time, stepped back.  Applied more pressure to me on some of the second serves I had early in the third set, and I think that paid off for him.
 Q. How crucial do you think the first-set tiebreak was?  Obviously you had a 5-3 lead there and he managed to nick it in the end.
 STEFANOS TSITSIPAS:   That was the silliest thing that ever happened to me.  I had ball over the net, and I decided to play forehand instead of a smash.
 I don't know what kind of decision was that, but it was very not sure enough.  Didn't take time.  Just rushed.  Didn't take time to think where I want to go and used my strongest shot, and he ended up passing me with a lob and I was in a defensive position afterwards.
 Q. What would you say were the main differences compared to last year's final?
 STEFANOS TSITSIPAS:   Main differences?  People in the stands.
 Q. Following on from that, what do you make of the electronic line calls this year instead of the line judges?  Are there any good points or bad points about it?
 STEFANOS TSITSIPAS:   Yeah, it's accurate.  It's good.  I like it.
 Q. During the past years, you players were saying that there was a fairly significant difference between the days when you're practicing with no crowd and the days when you're practicing with the full crowd.  This year there is obviously no crowd even when you're playing.  Do you notice anything in terms of playing conditions?  Because the O2 can be pretty cold at times.
 STEFANOS TSITSIPAS:   The crowd again.  Sticking to the crowd.  There is nothing else that makes a difference this year.
