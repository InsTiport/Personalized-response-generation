 7-6, 6-3
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Can you just talk through what the last 48 hours have been like for you, finding out that the tournament will be delayed for a day?  And your reaction to that.  What it was like coming on a different court today to play your semifinal?
 STEFANOS TSITSIPAS:   I was quite surprised.  I mean, I didn't know.  I was expecting to play yesterday, and I didn't get to play yesterday.  But there is, I guess, a good reason behind that, and for sure it had good intentions behind it.
 Yeah, I didn't really care.  It's quite strange.  Preparing mentally for the match tomorrow and then getting the call and receiving the information that we weren't playing tomorrow.
 And about today's match, I felt very close first set.  I was a mini break up in the tiebreak.  I had a set point in the first set, 5-4 or 6-5, and I framed the backhand.  Could have been much better than that.
 I mean, towards the end of the second set, I wasn't really there.  That's it.
 Q. What are your feelings about how you've prepared for the US Open now after this week?  Is it good to get a little bit of rest before playing the best-of-five Grand Slam in a couple of days?  Is it tougher having a little bit less rest than you would have had you played the semifinal yesterday?
 STEFANOS TSITSIPAS:   I feel challenged.  I don't really care about getting much rest right now.  I wasn't able to play for so long, so rest for me is the very, at the very last, end of my head.
 I'm enjoying it.  I'm enjoying being out on the court.  I'm enjoying competing.
 Mentally I don't feel like I'm drowned.  I feel good.  I feel like obviously I can get better.  In the next tournament I can do better.  I still have that sharpness and motivation in my everyday routines.
 I really haven't done, in the last couple of years, well in New York, and I would love to this year.  It's one of my favorite cities, and I would love to play some good tennis and I have good memories from here.
 Q. I know you have been friendly with Naomi in the past.  Curious what you made of her statement and what she did and the sort of change she helped create here.
 STEFANOS TSITSIPAS:   Yeah, I texted and asked her what was this social injustice all about?  Because I'm not really watching the news.  I wasn't following at the time.
 I did come across something when the TV was open, when the TV was on.  I saw something.  I'm not quite sure if it was because of that.
 Yeah, and she explained to me what was going on.  So I did understand.
 Q. Do you feel like it's important what she did, the statement she made?
 STEFANOS TSITSIPAS:   The statement she made?  I don't know.  I mean, it was her decision.  I'm not here to judge anyone.  I'm not here to say anything.  There is nothing wrong behind it, I believe.
 Q. In a similar vein, you know what it's like to have to play with distractions and how tough that can be for a tennis player.  Given how much attention Naomi's action brought her and all the discussions it triggered, what do you think of the fact that she won today in straight sets over Elise Mertens?  It's quite an effort, it seems.
 STEFANOS TSITSIPAS:   I wasn't following, really.  I was playing my match.  But really good for her.  I'm happy for her.  She's in a good streak, a good run.  She's playing well.  She's playing well, definitely.
 Honestly, I don't really watch much woman's tennis, but I admire her a lot.
 Q. But having to deal with distractions over a fairly long period, it's kind of challenging.  That's kind of what I was looking at.
 STEFANOS TSITSIPAS:   Oh, on that.  Sure.  I guess for her it means a lot, the incident that happened.  It has big importance to her than some other people, and I do understand that.  It comes as a priority in your life.
 For sure, it's difficult.  You know, I don't know how much connected she was and how much she was affected by that, but for sure it is not easy having to go the next day and play and win, of course.
 Q. Olympic Games in Athens, I think that you were six years old.  Today is the anniversary of the gold medal of Argentina in basketball.  I would like to know if it was inspiration for you during Olympic Games?  What do you remember about the Olympic Games?
 STEFANOS TSITSIPAS:   That's a nice question.  I was, in fact, six years old.  I do remember, because I live next to the sea, I do remember watching the triathlon take place by the beach, and I remember the cyclists and the swimmers and the runners, watching it from my balcony.  I didn't really have a clear view of all that, but I could see something.
 The rest, I was very young.  I don't really remember.  I might have gone to the tennis, but I'm not even sure if I was there.  I'm sure my parents were there, but I don't remember myself watching any of that.
 Anything else?  I remember it was a really great deal for Athens and for Greece.  It was just such celebration, and it took place from where the Olympics originated, and people were really happy and celebrating sports and outdoors.
 The only thing I remember is that it was just a really, like really happy moments for the Greek population.  It left behind some really good memories.
 Q. When did you find out about the pause in play for yesterday, that there was going to be no play?  You were talking about this is something so unusual, and you had to rethink the whole mindset about coming back to play.  What do you do in that sort of situation?
 STEFANOS TSITSIPAS:   First question, I received a phone call -- not a phone call, actually, a text message on WhatsApp group.  That's how I found out.
 And second question, I guess you kind of release and not think about tomorrow.  You are even more relaxed mindset, because you don't have to be there for tomorrow.  You can just practice a little bit, feel your game, and you kind of loosen up a little bit.  So it's not necessarily bad, let's say.  It's good.
