 6-3, 7-5
 Q. Stef, reaction to that amazing atmosphere, big win for Greece against Alex De Minaur and Australia there.
 STEFANOS TSITSIPAS:   Yeah, the win counts very much, and I think it was a great start for me playing ATP Cup.  I managed to stay calm and resilient when I had to and took my chances at the very end of the second set, which was very important.
