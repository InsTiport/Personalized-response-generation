THE MODERATOR: Who has the first question?
Q. Mixed emotions, obviously, tonight. Just a couple thoughts on your singles win and we'll start out with that.
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: Again, please?
Q. Mixed emotions tonight, obviously. You had a good singles win, though. Do you want to talk about what you think worked against Zverev?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: Yeah, yeah. I'm proud of my singles. I don't know, doubles went good as well. I'm very proud of myself the way I played and at the same time I feel disappointed I came so close and, obviously, we're not the favorites, but we could have been the ones that made the surprised today and we didn't, which is such a shame. We played well. Whenever I had to return in the crucial moments I couldn't make a single return inside the court. I tried to stay relaxed and calm but probably my attention was somewhere else and that's in there, I don't know, it feels strange, usually I'm more, usually I go for it, today I kind of like doubted myself and made stupid mistakes I had so many match points to close it at the end, I just, you know, I don't know, stupidity of mine.
Q. What did you think --
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: Couldn't serve, couldn't serve at all, I couldn't start the rally with the first serve and I felt good with my serve, but I don't know, it was just not there when I had to.
Q. What did you think of the atmosphere overall?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: Oh, I mean it was nuts. People loved it. We got a lot of support, more than them, and that's what makes it more by terrible when you have the whole crowd for you it's an advantage and I don't want to say too much, but it is what it is.
