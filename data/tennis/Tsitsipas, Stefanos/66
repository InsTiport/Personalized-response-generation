7-5, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What's your assessment of that result and your week at Queen's?  
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: Happy with the way I played.  Did a lot of things.  I can take a lot of things from that and move on.  I gained some experience and some understanding of the game on grass.   
 Q.  Do you think the two of you will be playing more finals, more latter-stage matches in the future?  
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: If I'm what?  If I'm gonna play more matches on the big stage?   
 Q.  You and Felix.  Do you think you two can have a rivalry going forward?  You're both young enough.  
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: Definitely.   
 Q.  What was the problem with your shoulder?  You took a medical timeout.  
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: I had pain in my shoulder.  This morning I woke up sore.   
 Q.  Do you think that was the after-effects of yesterday?  
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: For sure.  Playing two matches wasn't easy.  Playing a three-set match was really difficult, not just for my nerves but also for my body.  So that was it.   
 Q.  How are you feeling, looking ahead to Wimbledon?  
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: I'm feeling positive.  I just need to think the right way and be physically ready for best-of-five matches.   
 Q.  What's Felix like to play?  You have had some tough matches against him.  How good do you think he can be?  
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: He's the most difficult opponent I've ever faced, and I think it's gonna take a couple of tries to beat him.   
 Q.  Why so difficult?  
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: It is very difficult, because he has one of the best returns on the tour.  He has a really powerful, accurate serve, which is tough to read.   
He's really quick and fast, which is rare to find all of that combinations together, combined.  Big forehand, big backhand.  He can create a lot of opportunities from his backhand, but also, at the same time, he can be very aggressive from the forehand side.   
There's not much to come up with when you play against him.  He's pretty much solid from everywhere.   
 Q.  Does that worry you, the fact you might be competing against him for titles?  
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: It does worry me, because -- I mean, it's upsetting obviously that he's better than me.  I have to accept that he's better than me.  I might never beat him, but if I think that way, just need to wait, years maybe, for that chance to come.   
If not, then not.  If yes, then fantastic.  I'll donate, I don't know, 10,000 for that win to a charity (smiling).   
 Q.  Do you think he can win here?  
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: No doubt about it.  I wouldn't be surprised.  I think he can win Grand Slams, to be honest with you.   
 Q.  He can go deep at Wimbledon this year, do you think?  
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: 100%.   
 Q.  Now he can win, do you think?  
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: I mean, tough to say now, but a few years from now, for sure.   
 Q.  Four games in three days is a lot.  I hope you're taking a break now.  When will you be playing again?  
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: I'll be playing Boodles next week in Stoke Park.   
 Q.  You're pretty higher ranked by Felix by a wide margin.  Why do you say he's better than you, other than obviously the head-to-head?  But ranking-wise you've done a lot more than he has.  
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: He's beaten me every single time we have faced each other:  juniors and pro, he's beaten me Indian Wells, he's beating me here, he's beaten me a couple of times in juniors.  I only beat him in doubles.  I don't even count that one, because doubles is doubles.   
He has the whole package to play big, to beat -- I'm sure if he ever gets the difficult chance to play Nadal, Djokovic, or Federer, he's going to beat them, for sure.  I will not be surprised if he gets wins over those guys.   
We will definitely see him in the top 5.  Maybe not this year but next year or the year after.  I would expect something like this.   
 Q.  How do you beat somebody like that?  
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: You just try to return as many balls as you can.  I mean, serve well.  Play from the baseline well.  And create break opportunities, which I think I have a record on that.  If you combine it with my last match, the last match that I played against him at Indian Wells, I think the breakpoints that I had against him today and in Indian Wells is probably like something like 25.  Didn't win one.  That makes it maybe an official Guinness World Record.  I'm not sure (smiling).   
I'm proud of this achievement, actually.  It's tough to achieve something like this.  Actually, not tough unless you give them away, as I do (smiling).
