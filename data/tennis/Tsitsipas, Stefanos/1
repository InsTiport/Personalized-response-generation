S. TSITSIPAS/R. Bautista-Agut
7-5, 7-5
Q. Talk me through your performance.
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS:   Well, I didn't really have the best start, took me awhile to get used to his serve and pace.  I managed to stay calm, I think that helped a lot.  Then as more the match evolved I started getting more comfortable with my returns and getting the depth of the ball, trying to press with my forehand and that obviously gave me the first set.
I got a little bit lucky 6-5 and that's where I got the majority of my confidence.  After that I felt like fine on the court.
I got broken towards the very end but that didn't stop me from closing it the way I wanted to.
Q. You take great pride in representing Greece and you get really good support out here in Melbourne.  What does it mean to you?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS:   Yeah, it's an honor we share with me and my boys that we share a lot in common and it's been a long journey to come here and I'm very happy that I get to give them the opportunity to play in Melbourne and I'm really looking forward to many more years coming here and getting opportunity to play and learn and just enjoy tennis and this big celebration that takes place in Melbourne or in Australia.
