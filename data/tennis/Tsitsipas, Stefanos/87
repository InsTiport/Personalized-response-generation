THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Talk a little bit about the match.  You had some problems with the heat.
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I had some issues with my stomach.  It started at the end of the first set.  I didn't feel that well.  I felt very full.  It was bothering me during the match, felt very annoyed having this thing.
I kind of couldn't run and perform the way I wanted, so it was really tough to keep up, to keep the level, same intensity.  But I managed to do few things that worked for me in few games.  I didn't give up, which was very important, on some of my service games which were really close.
But, yeah, that was the main problem, the main issue I had.  My stomach, I felt really awkward, yeah, with my stomach.
Q. Some problems with the fans in the third set.  You said to shut up, some other words I can't use in here.  What was that all about?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: I regret doing that.  Well, it was actually -- don't get me wrong.  It was my friend, a person that I did know.  It was one of my friends that came from Australia to support me.  When you're concentrated during a match, you're trying to manage things, go with your tactics, and someone starts screaming from outside, Go to T or wide, it just plays with your mind.
I was really frustrated because he started laughing after this.  Yeah, that happened after.  Yeah, he was just annoying me.  I just replied (smiling).
Q. How was Instagram?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: That was an experience.  All those young people, was inspiring to see all those people work hard, achieve what they have achieved today, created such an amazing brand by sharing photos, stories with people around the world.  I really admire the work that have done until now.
They showed me around the place.  We had an Instagram live with them.  I answered few of the questions of the fans.  The experience overall, yeah, was good.  The tour was very interesting.
Q. Have you gotten any feedback about the fires about your play, inspired people?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: My play?
Q. Your performance.
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: Well, I mean, after the fires, what I managed, the result in Toronto, everybody suddenly woke up, everybody started watching tennis.  They told me grandpas in some villages started watching tennis.  They had no idea about the sport before.  People went crazy.
I really don't know how crazy it was because I'm not in Greece.  I didn't go to Greece.  There was a lot of attention, lots of singers, how you call that, politicians who were tweeting and everything.  There was a lot of attention.
After those fires, I actually helped my friend through a fundraiser.  Then I hear that many big sports clubs in Greece donated lots of money to this cause.  I was very happy to see that everyone was trying to give their best.
Yeah, there was attention.  Let's get back to the question.  There was attention.  I believe after this people are more aware of tennis in Greece.
Q. There's a lot of philosophy in your tweets, life lessons.  Talk a little bit about that.
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: What else can I write about?  That's what comes to my mind.  That's how I use Twitter, to provide let's say lessons to people, give them advice sometimes.  Yeah, this philosophical quotes that I tweet or post, it's amusing, interesting to see.
Q. Quite unusual for your age.
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: I know.  Whatever comes to my mind, whatever interesting fact or whatever, interesting quote.  Sometimes we have a conversation with my team or whatever.  If something interesting comes up while we chat, I'll just tweet it or post it.  That's how it comes.
Q. What would you consider the greatest strengths of your game?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: My forehand, for sure.  My serve.  It was not there today.  I'm going to have to work on it.  My backhand.  Those three are actually really good.  Sometimes either the forehand or backhand are a bit worse, it's a balance.  Sometimes I feel better with my backhand, sometimes I feel better with my forehand.  Today I was feeling really well with my forehand.  I was putting a lot of pressure on him.
Of course, I love coming to the net.  I believe being aggressive, taking the ball earlier, can help me beat good players.  Coming to the net sometimes can hurt the opponent, make him think a little bit more.  I try to come to the net as much as possible because it changes the pace, the rhythm of the game.
Q. What is your opinion about the Greek heritage in tennis history, from Sampras, Baghdatis, Philippoussis, Kokkinakis, Kyrgios?  Do you have some connection with Kyrgios and Kokkinakis?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: Well, Kyrgios, yeah.  I mean, okay, not that much.  Kokkinakis mostly.  We're in the same team, Team M, which is organized by Mouratoglou Academy.  We're a bit closer with Kokkinakis.
I know Philippoussis a little bit.  I've spoken to him in the past.  My dad is a good friend of him.  He actually speaks very good Greek, which is surprising.
Sampras, he's not around tennis at all, so...  No, I don't.  I definitely want to meet him one day.
