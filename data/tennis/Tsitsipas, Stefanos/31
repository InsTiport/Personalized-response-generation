THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Are you waiting to see what the Greek crowd holds for you this year?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: For whom else are they going to cheer? You said about the Greek crowd, if they're going to cheer for me this year.
Q. Are you waiting to see what the Greek crowd has to offer for you?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: Yeah, I hope they come with new chants because I hear the same every single year (smiling).
Q. What does it feel like being back in Melbourne, a happy place for you last year?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: Yes, it was happy until I was about to land and I saw the smoke over the city. I was like, What is this?
First two days here were pretty unusual. I will share the story again with you. I went to practice for around one, one and a half hours. After I practice indoors, I felt really bad with my lungs.
It's getting better day by day. I had a practice session today, as well. It's much different than it was when I first came. Really looking forward to this new challenge that I have in front of me, to show something.
You know, I have great memories from here last year, semifinals, living the dream, playing with so much adrenaline. I really enjoy the crowd, the people's energy here.
Q. What concerns you going forward? We don't know how the air is going to be the rest of the tournament. Is it a problem for you if there are bad days here?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: I don't know. I don't really know. I don't even check the weather forecast. God pray, I mean. I hope for a good two weeks here. The Aussie summer as it is.
Q. Are there any lingering effects from the day when you felt bad?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: I'm feeling okay now, but I was a bit concerned. I was coughing a lot, had troubles breathing for a couple of hours. Now it has gotten better.
Q. In the past month we've seen you and Rafa battling it through in Abu Dhabi, exhibition, we've seen some hard-fought matches in the ATP Cup, which is a team competition. It looks like no matter what's at stake, you guys just give it all. Is there something in a Grand Slam that still makes you do a little bit more, or you just want to win no matter what it is?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: Well, I think the Grand Slam tournaments are events where you try and bring the best out of you, when it comes to concentration, when it comes to playing with energy, good footwork, being aggressive and being consistent point by point.
This exhibition match against Rafa was like, I don't know, top-class tennis. It lasted three hours. Quite shocking for an exhibition. We took it so serious, both of us.
But going into a Grand Slam, a good start is always important, trying to conserve energy, trying to avoid playing long matches. I've been working on this mentally and technically, strategically, to avoid having difficulties in the early rounds.
Q. What is the biggest way you think you've changed in the past 12 months since you were last here?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: I found more balance within me. Before I was very inconsistent with my emotions. I could become in a few of the matches suddenly angry and frustrated. I think - I think - although I had two tantrums in ATP Cup, in Mubadala, I don't know if that really went viral, I was really embarrassed to see myself in such situation. I guess I was just holding everything and it exploded at some point.
I've been really working on this. I think being balanced in my head and thinking in a straight line will help me. I'm going to try it. I mean, I hope it helps me grow as a player.
Also I think balance is important for someone to grow. If you are just one day on, one day off with your emotions, they can cost you.
Q. How do you work on that?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: Well, I've mentioned that before. I also think the people you have around you have a tremendous effect on this. I know what I want. My relationship with these people has been great over the last couple of years.
Also having security in your daily life, knowing that you're secure, you can enjoy every aspect of life, that can create a lot of balance in your head.
Q. You mentioned embarrassment. When did that come?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: Came once in the ATP Cup.
Q. Were you feeling it afterwards, a while after the match?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: During and after as well, after watching the video.
Q. Last year you had a very successful tournament in Melbourne. This year, do you have stress to defend the points, to reach the semifinal or final?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: You know, I really had stress before the Montreal tournament last year, knowing that I did finals in Toronto. After losing, I think it was first or second round, I don't remember, I was like, Why should you be so stressed? There's no point.
Just start fresh, it's a new tournament, don't think of what happened in the past, and try to play your best, compete your best.
I think if you think of it too much, it just ruins your game. So keep it simple.
