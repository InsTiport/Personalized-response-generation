S. TSITSIPAS/P. Carreno Busta
7-6, 6-1
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What are your thoughts on that?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: Yeah, I was tired. I came in the match tired. I was upset with myself a little bit when I was 3-Love, 40-Love up and didn't get the break. I realized I have to save that energy because the heat and the -- it was difficult for me in the physical part. Even in the beginning of the match I felt tired.
I tried to stay calm and not complain too much because I would definitely need that energy for later on in the match. I think I focused on my breathing, focused on constructing the points, staying in the point, trying to make things happen from my backhand side because that's what I felt he played most of the time.
Eventually I found solutions and started being more aggressive with my backhand.
Q. You're in a similar position to last year, winning a title in Marseille, coming outdoors. How are you handling the transition this year?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: For sure it's important for me to have a balance when it comes to what I give out on the court. There are important tournaments coming ahead in which I want to preserve the energy for later.
I'm playing good tennis. I'm not trying to go for too much or too less. I'm not pushing myself to the limits like I did last year. I think I've always learned from that, kind of been more smart in the way I handle certain situations and moments in the match without trying to push myself too much, although that's my main focus point, trying to go all in.
In a way I'm smarter when it comes to this. I'm also happy that I got two-set victories for a very long time. I'm not spending extra hours out on the court, which for sure it's going to help me.
Q. You get to play the same player you played in the semis in Marseille last Saturday, Bublik. Is it tricky playing the same player twice in a row so quickly?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: It happened also last year when I played against Marseille, I played against Hurkacz. Had to play him in the second round here. Kind of the same.
Bublik again, he's a tricky player. He does unexpected things on the court. I just need to be there, do my job the way I'm doing it so far. I'm doing great. I should continue doing the same, handle things the same way, be cautious and know when I have to put the extra effort.
Q. You spoke to your coach before the match. What exactly did he say?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: When before the match? Before I stepped out in the match?
Q. Yes.
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: Tips, advices, like every other coach does. Before you enter the court, you speak with your coach. You don't go to the war unprepared.
Q. You fell down in the last game of the match. Is there any injury?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: No injuries. I don't know what happened there. Quite weird. Never happened to me before.
Q. Did you get a coaching warning?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: I think I did. I don't remember anything.
Q. You didn't notice?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: I don't even remember what my coach told me, yeah.
