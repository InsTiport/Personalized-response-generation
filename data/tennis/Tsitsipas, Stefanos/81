THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Your impression about this match, this roller-coaster match?  How do you feel now?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: Tired.  I want to go to sleep.  That's how I feel.
You feel great after this, after winning such matches, because there has been a lot of effort, really, I mean, hard work.  You know, we were hours on the court fighting, you know, wanting that win.  But, yeah, the one that gets it at the end, I think, is the most happy person on earth.
And, yeah, I'm very satisfied.  I managed to stay calm after getting broken on the fifth set, being a break up.
It was many things happened.  And in general, I'm very, very happy.
Q. How proud are you to reach the final being unbeaten, playing a lot of tight matches, and just how is your confidence going into the final?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: My confidence is all right.  I have one more match to play tomorrow.  I know it is going to be tough, so I'm going to have to be prepared for that.  I'm going to have to be 100%.  And I'm going to, you know, just mentally be there and just give my last effort, give my last everything on that match.
I think it would be a fantastic year-end if things go well tomorrow.
Q. How would you describe Alex's game?  He's very quick on the court.
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: He's very quick.  Yeah, that's his biggest weapon, his speed on the court.  But he has some weaknesses as well.  Not all players are perfect.
So, yeah, I'm going to have to play differently than today.  And press but, you know, not over-press because that's what he's waiting for.  Be wise, be patient on the court.  And, yeah, make him move, make him run.  Come to the net, play good tennis, play clever tennis, play all around tennis.
Q. What does it mean that the rest of the players on tour voted for you as the most improved player?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: It's great.  I didn't expect that.  I mean, I didn't expect that.  I had a fantastic year, but it was the last thing that was in my head.  And when I finally saw it, I was happy that my name was there.  So, yeah, really pleased holding that trophy.
All the hard work, all the effort that I put into my game this year, you know, it's part of this trophy.  So yeah, it feels great.
