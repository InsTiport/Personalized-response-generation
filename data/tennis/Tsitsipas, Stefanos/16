THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. How is the transition going from the hard courts of New York to the clay here in Europe?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS:   In all honesty, hasn't been the best so far.  So, yep.
Q. (Question about Rafa.)
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS:   I don't think Rafa will be struggling much playing here.  Regardless of how he feels, I'm sure he'll find a way.  He always finds a way every single year.
Clay is his surface.  I'm sure he's going to do well.  I will definitely won't be surprised.
Q. Novak Djokovic, what was your take on the default and disqualification?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS:   I have nothing to say on that.  Nothing to say.
Q. You had the bubble of New York.  How is everything functioning in Rome so far?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS:   It's pretty much the same.  I guess not as strict as in New York.  We are still not allowed to go visit the city or see any attractions or places within the city, but for me personally it's all right.
Q. (Question about the bubble.)
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS:   You are allowed to wear, not to have to wear your mask when you're in the courts, which makes total sense to me.  Very progressive from the other side.  All the players have been tested, so that makes total sense.
I guess they don't have people running around you telling you what to do and what protocol you have to follow  every single minute that you're in the bubble.
I forgot to add something else.  Plus the hotel, accommodation, is another level.
