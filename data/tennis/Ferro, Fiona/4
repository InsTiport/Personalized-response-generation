  T. PEREIRA/F. Ferro6-3, 6-2An interview with:FIONA FERROTHE MODERATOR: Questions in French.Q. Second Roland Garros tournament, second French Open.  A good start to the match.  You hit your shots very well on her backhand side, on her forehand side.  Your opponent started to set up a game.  All of a sudden, you were less resistant and then the match turned around.FIONA FERRO: I would say that she was quite stable during the whole match.  I was solid at the start, and then I started to slump physically.  It made the difference.  Then the games were passing by. So when I slackened or when the intensity dwindled, it was tougher me.Q. She comes from the quallies, so it was not one of the best draws because she plays very well on clay.  It\'s totally different to last year because you played against Lisicki.FIONA FERRO: I was quite happy with that draw, because that I had time to set up my game, but you have to be consistent during the whole match, and if you slacken basically you cannot win the match.  It\'s a little bit frustrating, because I think that I could have won the match, but this shows that I need to work more, especially fitness-wise.Q. Has Pierre told you you have to work on your fitness?FIONA FERRO: Yes, I have to work on my fitness.  Before I was not as fit as I was today.  But I\'m quite inconsistent in terms of fitness, so that\'s the way it is.Q. What is your feeling after this defeat?  What can you tell us?FIONA FERRO: I\'m frustrated.Q. Lots of unforced errors on the backhand side, 15 errors on your backhand side.  Why is it so?FIONA FERRO: Usually I can tell you that the backhand is the barometer of the game.  I don\'t make too many errors with my backhand, but she didn\'t give me free points, so I tried to attempt too many things. But most of the time I went to play with my forehand and I was boxed in the corner with my backhand, and it was very difficult for me to run around my forehand and hit a backhand.Q. Physically, why have you slumped today?FIONA FERRO: We are trying to find some solutions to that.  As I told you, I\'m not consistent during the whole year.  I don\'t have a good level to maintain the same momentum, and that\'s a problem to me.  It\'s like lottery.  I don\'t know if I will be at the top of my game or not.Q. Can you compare your level of last year and that of today?  Is there any new changes in terms of ambitions in terms of game?FIONA FERRO: I think that I have made some progress in all compartments of the game, so I can hit powerful forehands, so I have made progress but my approach to the match was different.  Last year I didn\'t know what to expect, so when I stepped on court, I mean, I wanted to win the match today.
