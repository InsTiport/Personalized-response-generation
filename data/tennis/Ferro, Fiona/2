 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Can you talk us through your match today and how you were feeling on the court?
 FIONA FERRO:   I was feeling pretty good.  It was hot today compared to the first round, so the conditions were much faster.  It was tough to return, especially in the first set, because she was serving really well.  So when I broke her, I just kept my serve until the end of the first set and was 6-4 with one break.
 In the second set I was leading 5-2, playing good tennis.  I got a bit tight when I had to finish, but then I could close it out at 5-4, so I'm very happy with that.
