S. KENIN/F. Ferro
2-6, 6-2, 6-1
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. What do you think changed for you and maybe the way she was playing after the first set?
FIONA FERRO:   I think she started to take the ball earlier and play a little bit longer.  So for me it was a bit tougher to react.  Was tough to adjust.  So, yeah, I had a good first set, but then she raised her level.
Q. What was the experience like of being out there in Chatrier at the French Open in the fourth round with obviously smaller-than-usual crowd, but everybody pulling for you?
FIONA FERRO:   It was amazing.  I would have loved that it lasted longer.  But I am a bit sad to lose today.  This is what I practice for, for moments like this.  I was lucky to play three matches on the center court.  It was an unbelievable experience for me.
I will do everything to be back as soon as possible.
Q. During the match Sofia's father and coach moved near to where Emmanuel was sitting.  Did you notice that?  What is your reaction to that?
FIONA FERRO:   I don't really care.  He was coaching a lot, but is not really my problem.  I was trying to focus on my game, on what I have to do.
Q. Have you spoken with Emmanuel after the match?
FIONA FERRO:   Not really, no.  I just went to the shower.  For the moment we haven't talked a lot.
Q. In this age of coronavirus, do you think it's a little weird they were sitting right next to each other?
FIONA FERRO:   I don't know.  I don't know.  In the beginning they had social distance, but then Sofia's father went next to Emmanuel.  I guess Emmanuel wanted to keep the same seat.
