  Q. Tell us how you won?   
 REGINA KULIKOVA: How I won? That's a secret.   
  
  Q. How big is this?   
 REGINA KULIKOVA: I mean, yeah. I don't know how I won. I was just playing. I'm still realizing that I won.   
  
  Q. When you go out to play someone like her, probably something of an icon in your country?  
 REGINA KULIKOVA: Yeah.   
  
  Q. How do you approach a match like that?   
 REGINA KULIKOVA: I mean, it was for me it was very interesting to play her because she's one of the best players and she's won so many titles. I mean, it really was a great match for me.   
 I just I went on the court and I was not thinking about winning or losing that match. I was just thinking about playing my best game, and I was fighting until the end. And that gave me a good success, good result.   
  
  Q. Were you surprised at how well you were able to play against her?   
 REGINA KULIKOVA: Yeah, I mean, yeah. Yeah, it's probably first time we're playing each other. Yeah, didn't have any special tactic, just was playing my game.  
  
  Q. Is this your biggest win ever?   
 REGINA KULIKOVA: It is. It is my -- I was playing first time Dementieva in Wimbledon, one of the top players, so this is my second match with a really top player.   
  
  Q. Where would you rate this one, first or second?   
 REGINA KULIKOVA: Second.  
  
  Q. So Dementieva was first?  
 REGINA KULIKOVA: Yeah, I didn't win, but I lost to her. But just the second match of my career, I guess, top player.  
  
  Q. What, is it something to do with Dubai?   
 REGINA KULIKOVA: Probably, yeah. For sure something, yeah (smiling). Yeah.  
  
  Q. Maybe the magic of Dubai?  
 REGINA KULIKOVA: The magic of Dubai. Maybe it's my place, actually, yeah.  
  
  Q. Quarterfinals against Radwanska. Do you intend to win that?   
 REGINA KULIKOVA: Okay, it's good that you told me. I didn't watch the draw yet. I didn't know who I play next match. Now I know.   
 Yeah, it depends for my game. I don't have any special tactics, but if I will play my game aggressive the way I was doing today, fighting, it's okay.   
  
  Q. Can you tell us a bit about yourself? Where you started playing tennis, where you practice and you train now?   
 REGINA KULIKOVA: I start play -- I was born in Kazakhstan, and then I moved in Russia when I was 7 years old, and I was practicing in St. Petersburg until 15 years old. Then I moved in Italy for four years.   
 Since last March, I moved in Switzerland, and now I'm practicing in the Swiss National Center in Biel, and ,yeah, about one year already. And I have a few different coaches there and traveling sometimes with coach, sometimes with my mother. Yeah, and that's it.  
  
  Q. Where did you learn your very good English?   
 REGINA KULIKOVA: Oh, it's not so good. Come on. I'm worried a bit. I'm worried. No, actually I speak Italian pretty well, so...  
  
  Q. You said you were born in Kazakhstan?  
 REGINA KULIKOVA: In Kazakhstan, in Armaty.  
  
  Q. But your family is --  
 REGINA KULIKOVA: Russian, yes, it's Russian. And my family still lives in Russia. And it's me -- just, I'm traveling around the world, so...  
  
  Q. Where in Russia?   
 REGINA KULIKOVA: In St. Petersburg. So Svetlana is from St. Petersburg as well.   
  
  Q. Did you know her at all or her family when you were younger?   
 REGINA KULIKOVA: No, I don't know her family. I mean, when I was playing Juniors I was watching her on TV. She is a very good player. She's a great player, yeah. And today I was playing her.   
 Like when I won yesterday, I saw I had to play Svetlana. I was so excited about that. Yeah, it was very good experience for me, actually.   
  
  Q. That's one of your dreams came true to play with her today?   
 REGINA KULIKOVA: Yeah, I have few dreams. But, yeah, for sure, it's a big step in my career to beat one of the top players. For sure, I think it's a good start in my career, so...  
  
  Q. In set three, did you believe yourself you can beat her especially against number 10?  
 REGINA KULIKOVA: Yeah. I mean, I know that I'm playing really well. I mean, I've got so many physical problems the last three years and so many problems, and I couldn't play. And I was watching them on TV. Now I know that I can. I can play. I'm healthy, I'm fit, and I can do my best.   
 I mean, I was believing it. When I was 4-1 down in the third set, I was still believing that I can do it. So that was one of the goals that I won today. I was, yeah.   
  
  Q. You said you had four years in Italy and you're in Biel?  
 REGINA KULIKOVA: Yes, in Rome.  
  
  Q. Did you have a sponsor from an early age?  
 REGINA KULIKOVA: No, I don't have any sponsor, no.  
  
  Q. So is it your Parent who's pay for you?   
 REGINA KULIKOVA: Yeah, my parents. Yeah, I've got some sponsors from when I was a child. They helped me a little bit. But I don't have really like big sponsors, yeah.  
  
  Q. Maybe you'll get one?  
 REGINA KULIKOVA: I will, no problem.   
  
  Q. What do you expect for the next match?   
 REGINA KULIKOVA: For the next match? I expect that I'm going to play a good game, and, yeah. To show nice tennis to the people, yeah.   
  
  Q. Did you say when you came this is your first press conference?   
 REGINA KULIKOVA: Yeah, it's my first conference. Yeah, I'm a bit worried, but it's okay (smiling).  
  
  Q. It's been a while since the match was over. Have you had a chance to exchange a few words with Svetlana? Did she say anything in particular?   
 REGINA KULIKOVA: Not yet, no. No, I haven't seen her after the match.  
  
  Q. Will you be worried going back to St. Petersburg now that you beat her?   
 REGINA KULIKOVA: Oh, okay, I don't know.   
  
  Q. You said even at 4-1 after losing the first set, what exactly did you tell yourself? You still believed that you could do it at that point?   
 REGINA KULIKOVA: Yeah, I was still believing. I was a bit tired, and I played qualifying here and two matches in the main draw. And I was a bit tired after the second set. So I start a bit not really good, but she was playing really good from the beginning.   
 Yeah, but I was believing, and I had my chances in the third set. A few chances, and I used them. Then I was really in confidence with myself.   
  
  Q. Best of luck tomorrow.   
 REGINA KULIKOVA: Thank you.
