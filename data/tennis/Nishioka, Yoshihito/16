You were playing on the center court against a top 10 player.  How do you feel and what were your feelings going this match here?YOSHIHITO NISHIOKA: Well, the first set I was very nervous, so that's why it's pretty quick, the set. But after first set a little bit looser.  Then I can play like my play, so a little bit close. I had a couple chances, but he didn't give me like easy points so I couldn't get.  I feel that I had chances, so, I mean, maybe if I play more the top-10 players, if I feeling like more no nervous, maybe I can get a set or I can play more close against top-10 player, I think.Q.

He's also small, not that tall, but he's playing like play aggressive.  Also his defense is pretty well, too.  Like placement is pretty good.  He always changing the ball, like defense.  Like placement is also very good.  So I have to learn about him.Q. You said that your idol was Marcella Rios.  You're training with a Brazilian coach.  What do you know about South American tennis culture?YOSHIHITO NISHIOKA: Well, actually we finish already with Brazilian coach. Well, I mean, it's about tennis or some... About tennis? Well, from Brazilian coach, he say something like, Play bit more aggressive and stay more lower than moving more well. For Marcelo Rios, I like how he's playing.  Like very fun to watch him to playing.  Many dropshot; going to the net; sometimes hit so hard; sometimes like angle shot; he is doing like many kind of play. Also he's small, so that's why I like him then.  I want to play like him.Q. And the Argentinians?  Do you like any?YOSHIHITO NISHIOKA: Argentinians?Q.
