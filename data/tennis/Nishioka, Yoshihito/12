THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  Congratulations on your first win here in Paris.  How does it feel and does it -- is it an indication that you are improving on the clay?  
YOSHIHITO NISHIOKA: Yeah, today is very happy for a win today.  This is first win in Paris.  And last year almost I had a match, but, you know, I cramped the whole body and couldn't take it.   
So I had a bad memory last year, so I'm very happy for a win today, like, the five sets.   
And then I didn't have good results on clay court in this season, but I just believe in myself on playing better on clay, but just can't find a way to win.  So, you know, so just try to keep playing and just believe in doing right way.   
And then today was really tough match.  I had many chances first set and the third set, as well, but I couldn't take it.  And, you know, sometimes it just happen, but I feel a little bit tight and it's not easy situation.   
But I really focus on the match till end and then I find a way to the win.   
 Q.  And the last time I saw you was at Indian Wells where you had that difficult lost to Felix Auger-Aliassime and you had the injury.  How was the process to heal and are you 100% right now?  
YOSHIHITO NISHIOKA: Yeah, the injury is not like big problem.  It's just had a pain like a muscle, and it's just getting so tight.  So that's the reason.   
And then I took a little bit longer, like, three weeks for recovery, but everything fine right now.
