THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. Curious about what the last couple of months have been like for you in Europe.
YOSHIHITO NISHIOKA:   Yeah.  So after US Open I went to Europe season, clay court, and then after French Open back to Japan and then coming back to Europe for hard court season.
After French Open, it's a little bit tough time for me when I back to Japan.  You know, I cannot practice that much, because, you know, the coronavirus.  And also, we have to stay home much as possible when I coming back from other country, outside of country, Japan.
So it's not easy to practice there, and so it's not easy to fix on hard court, but I had a good time in Germany.  After Germany I couldn't play the tournament, so I went to the Paris and also had a good time for practice at National Center in Paris, which is a good time, as well.
So I having good time here.  Sometimes a little bit tough.  You know, it's very tough to stay bubble.  It's not fun (smiling).  But I think I having good time right now.
Q. This is one of the final tournaments of the year.  How different does this feel compared to a normal season right now?
YOSHIHITO NISHIOKA:   Still, I'm thinking to play Sofia, as well.  So maybe final or maybe not, but I hope this is the final tournament.  I want to go back home (smiling).
It's very different.  Usually we can go outside.  We having good time with friends or, you know, we having more fun time without the tennis.
But right now we have to focus tennis for sure, yes, focus on tennis, but we don't have other things.  I think it's very difficult to play and difficult to stay in other countries.
So hopefully it's getting better from next season, but if not, it should be very, very tough time for every players.
