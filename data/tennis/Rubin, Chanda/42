 CHANDA RUBIN:  Hello.

 Q.  Were you nervous?

 CHANDA RUBIN:  Still thinking about it, really.  I think I was.
 I think I was more today, but I just didn't know.  I wasn't even
sure what I was doing; just disappointed but I am still thinking
about it.  I haven't really gone through the whole match.

 Q.  Was it the largeness of the stadium, the crowd?

 CHANDA RUBIN:  Well, no, I don't think it was that.  I played
on center court a few times and I played before crowds.  I just
think it was me.  Didn't have anything to do with the crowd, I
don't think.

 Q.  How did you prepare for the match today; anything different
than you normally do?

 CHANDA RUBIN:  No.

 Q.  Just didn't bring any tools today to work with?

 CHANDA RUBIN:  Just wasn't quite there.

 Q.  Would it have been to your advantage to try to get into
some long rallies just to get into to feel the ball a bit better?

 CHANDA RUBIN:  I think we did.  I think I lost most of them.
 I was definitely-- towards the second set I was thinking, trying
to keep a few balls in play, just hit with her a little bit, but
I just felt like even when I started doing that, just wasn't hitting
my shots and just, you know, didn't really have anything, anything
to hurt her with.  I just felt like I was just out there trying
to rally and keep a few balls in play, so.

 Q.  What did your coach say to you after the match?

 CHANDA RUBIN:  Basically, just came off, so --

 Q.  Did you learn anything out there today?

 CHANDA RUBIN:  I hope so.  I mean, you are always learning, I
think.  I mean, I just -- I definitely think I just need to keep
playing these matches and going out, going after the player and
I don't think I did that today, just what you have to do against
top players.  I think I definitely need to keep playing a few
more when I get into these rounds, so --

 Q.  Thank you.
