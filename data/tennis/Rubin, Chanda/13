THE MODERATOR:  First question, please. 


Q.  Can you guys talk about returning and hitting second serves?  You converted 77 percent of your second serve points.  Your opponents only made 42 percent.  Can you just talk about after missing your first serve or your opponents missing the first serve, you kind of connecting on the next point. 

VIRGINIA RUANO PASCUAL:  We know that we got a very aggressive when we return.  So when we know when the other miss the first serve, we have to keep pressure on her.  So I thought today we do it very good, and they feel this pressure on the second serve. 

Q.  How long have you two been a team together? 

PAOLA SUAREZ:  Like seven, eight years. 

Q.  Seven years? 

PAOLA SUAREZ:  Yeah, seven, eight years. 

Q.  What do you think it is that makes you compliment each other? 

PAOLA SUAREZ:  I think that we know each other too much.  I mean, it's a long time that we play together, and this is good because I can tell her how I feel in the special moment, you know.  And she can tell me the same thing.  I don't know, I think we are a good combination together. 

Q.  How does this compare to your two French Open titles? 

VIRGINIA RUANO PASCUAL:  Uhm, for us this is different, no?  It's hard court.  We know that we have to improve in hard court to play doubles because we feel better the clay.  For me it's different.  I don't know...

PAOLA SUAREZ:  Exciting. 

VIRGINIA RUANO PASCUAL:  Exciting, yeah. 

Q.  What have you guys been doing?  Are you two together off the court?  Have you been doing much? 

PAOLA SUAREZ:  Yeah, we practice with the same coach and we going to take dinner together and everything.  Yeah, we are  -- I think the more important point, that we are best friend, you know?  It is very, very good that we can talk whatever we feel, you know, outside and inside to inside the court. 

Q.  Have you been getting up to much of New York? 

PAOLA SUAREZ:  Yeah, we  -- some days we went around, yeah.  But not too much. 

VIRGINIA RUANO PASCUAL:  Shopping (smiling). 

Q.  When the trophy was put on the table there, were you looking at something in particular? 

PAOLA SUAREZ:  The names.  They are printing. 

VIRGINIA RUANO PASCUAL:  The people that won the doubles.  Big names (smiling). 

Q.  Was that on your mind when you came here, really?  Did you think you were going to win this when you came here? 

VIRGINIA RUANO PASCUAL:  Not in mine, no. 

PAOLA SUAREZ:  I mean, it's a long way to win a tournament.  No, was not in my mind.
