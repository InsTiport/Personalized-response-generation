THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Christina McHale.   
   
 Q.   Great weekend for you and for the team.   Talk about the kind of confidence that the two wins can give you moving forward.   
CHRISTINA McHALE:   Yeah, I definitely think that these two matches will help me for the future.   I'm just super excited that I got my first two Fed Cup wins.   
So, yeah, it was a good weekend for the whole team.   
   
 Q.   6‑0, 4‑0 yesterday, 6‑0, 5‑0 today.   I saw you have one career double bagel.   How much were you wanting it today?   
CHRISTINA McHALE:   I was just trying to stay focused.   I wasn't thinking about the score.   I wasn't trying to get a double bagel or anything like that.   It was just, yeah, taking each game, each point one at a time.  
   
 Q.   You are now in line to represent the United States at the Olympics, assuming all goes accordingly between now and June.   Talk a little bit about your view of the Olympics as a little kid, watching on TV.   Any moments that stand out to you?  
CHRISTINA McHALE:   Yeah, I don't want to get too like excited about it because there's still a lot that could happen with who gets to go.   
But it would be one of the biggest honors and one of the biggest tournaments for me to play.   That would be absolutely amazing.   
The Olympics I remember watching was Beijing, the one four years ago.   It would be amazing if I could make that team.  
   
 Q.   Is there an Olympic athlete in any sport that you would line up to try to trade pins with?  
CHRISTINA McHALE:   Yeah, I think all the athletes.   I don't know now off the top of my head.   I played the Pan American Games last year.   That was so exciting seeing all the other athletes.   All the time it's so individual with tennis.   Being part of such a big group, everyone is wearing their jackets, it's an amazing feeling.   
   
 Q.   You won 10 straight matches.   What do you attribute your success to this weekend?  
CHRISTINA McHALE:   I think our whole team had a really good week.   We prepared really well.   We had good practices.   I think I stayed really focused out there.   I stuck to the plan.   
It was great having Mary Joe there helping me on the court.   Just having the support of the whole team I think helped me.  
   
 Q.   After this run of matches, is it back to individual competition, or team competition in April?  
CHRISTINA McHALE:   Yeah, actually I have a tournament that I have to get to, fly tonight to the Paris tournament.   It starts on Tuesday.   So I have a quick turnaround.   
   
 Q.   I notice both you and Venus left the court in the second set of Serena's match.   Was there any chance she was going to play singles as well?   
CHRISTINA McHALE:   I don't actually know.   I didn't know if that was an option.   
I left in the middle of the first set because I didn't want to get too tired out there watching.   I was watching from inside and cheering her on.
