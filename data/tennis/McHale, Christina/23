 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. What was your plan when you went out there today?   
 CHRISTINA McHALE: I was trying, yeah, to focus on my game to try and use my forehand when I got the opportunity. Yeah, just to like compete really well with her.   
  
  Q. So just get as many balls in play as you could?   
 CHRISTINA McHALE: I mean, with a purpose, yeah. I mean, not...  
  
  Q. Were you surprised how inconsistent she was? I think she had 37 unforced errors.   
 CHRISTINA McHALE: With how inconsistent?   
  
  Q. Yeah, or erratic.   
 CHRISTINA McHALE: I mean, to be honest, I didn't really -- I wasn't really thinking about that during the match. I was just trying to play each point to the best that I could.  
 So, yeah, I haven't even thought about that sort of thing.  
  
  Q. You kind of beat her at her own game. She is good at getting the ball back and waiting for you to make a mistake; you seemed it outlast her and wait for her mistake instead.   
 CHRISTINA McHALE: Yeah, we had really long rallies, so, yeah, I think, yeah, sometimes I was able to draw the error after the long rally.  
  
  Q. Two weeks ago in San Diego, you lost against Radwanska 6-0, 6-1, I think. How did you get rid of that bad memory?   
 CHRISTINA McHALE: I mean, it wasn't really so much like that I had played bad that match; she played incredible. So, yeah, I just moved on. I spent a week at home practicing, and then came here and was back in match mode, yeah.   
  
  Q. This give you a lot of confidence for the future?  
 CHRISTINA McHALE: For sure, yeah. I mean, it still hasn't really sunk in yet because I had to go quickly play another match.  
 Yeah, it's really exciting.   
  
  Q. Does it make the next match important because you want to follow up on what you did today?   
 CHRISTINA McHALE: No, I just treat each match pretty much the same way, or try to. Yeah, I can't be thinking about this match today when I'm playing tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Was it odd playing doubles right away afterwards?  
 CHRISTINA McHALE: Yeah, I mean, the schedule even changed to make us have to play sooner. But I mean, I was excited to just be in the second round of doubles still playing.  
 That was good.  
  
  Q. You're coming up on a time where people are looking at the USTA like who's going to be the next young American star player. I found some information, but tell me how you came up through the juniors and the USTA program to arrive to today.   
 CHRISTINA McHALE: Well, right now I'm training in New York because I live in New Jersey, so it's pretty close. It's at the US Open site there.   
 So, yeah, I spent a little time in Boca at the USTA center, and now I'm back home in New York. Yeah, training in the New York one.  
  
  Q. Can I ask you a little bit about your background? I heard your mother is Cuban, right?  
 CHRISTINA McHALE: Yes.  
  
  Q. But you were born in the U.S.?   
 CHRISTINA McHALE: Yeah, uh-huh.  
  
  Q. I assume that from your family name your father might be like Irish or something?   
 CHRISTINA McHALE: Yeah, half Cuban half Irish.  
  
  Q. Can you tell us a little bit about the story of when your mom came to the U.S.?   
 CHRISTINA McHALE: Sure. My mom and her parents and sister came when my mom was two years old, so she grew up in New Jersey. She went to school here.   
 So, yeah, she's grown up here.   
  
  Q. Who do you travel with?   
 CHRISTINA McHALE: Well, my mom is here with me. Do you mean coaching-wise?   
  
  Q. No, in general.   
 CHRISTINA McHALE: Yeah, my sister was with me in the two California ones, and my mom is here now. So between them they rotate. My sister has to go back to school, so...  
  
  Q. How did you manage to be that calm during the whole match? Seems like you were not so nervous at the end of the match?   
 CHRISTINA McHALE: Yeah, I mean, I just tried not to, yeah, like let the moment get to me. So, yeah, I just tried to focus on how I was going to play the point, not on the outcome. Thankfully it worked.
