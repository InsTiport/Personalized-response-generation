THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   So how did you feel out there today?  
CHRISTINA McHALE:   I felt pretty good.   I think the first set I think wasn't the best tennis from either of us, but I think second set I was able to find my range better on my shots.  
Yeah, so I was really happy to close it out in two sets.  
   
 Q.   You made your first WTA Final earlier in Acapulco.   Talk about that experience, what it has maybe given you.   
CHRISTINA McHALE:   Yeah, that was really an exciting week.   I really didn't expect really to make the finals there, but I was really playing well.   I was really enjoying my time there, so it was really exciting.  
Yeah, I'm just trying to keep up my level of play, try and build off of that week.  
   
 Q.   Are you training in Boca now?  
CHRISTINA McHALE:   Yeah.   I'm training with the USTA.  
   
 Q.   For how long?   I think you were back and forth.   
CHRISTINA McHALE:   Yeah, starting at US Open last year.  
   
 Q.   So what are you gaining from that?   Why do you think that was a good move for you?   
CHRISTINA McHALE:   I'm working again primarily with JorgÃ© Todero who was my coach previously when I was at USTA, and it's just a really good fit working with him.   
There is just a lot of players to practice with down there.   There is a lot of Americans down there practicing, especially on the women's side.  
Yeah, he knows my game really well and he's just really helped me.  
   
 Q.   In a tournament like this, it's just down the road, do you feel more comfortable here because you're used to the heat, humidity, kind of close to home?  
CHRISTINA McHALE:   Yeah, I think so.   Yeah, Indian Wells I had a quick tournament there, so I came down to Boca.   I spent the week there practicing.   
Then, yeah, it was so nice just drive down here.   And, yeah, conditions are similar, so it feels good.  
   
 Q.   You had trained for a while at the USTA and National Tennis Center.   
CHRISTINA McHALE:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Why did that not work out?   Too much of a commute or, New Jersey...   
CHRISTINA McHALE:   The coach had actually moved down to Boca, the one I was working with.  
   
 Q.   JorgÃ©?  
CHRISTINA McHALE:   Yeah, JorgÃ© is now in Boca.   He was in NewYork and now he's in Boca.   That was part of the reason.  
Yeah, it just feels good to be back working with him again.  
   
 Q.   What do you realistically hope to do here?   What do you think can you do in this tournament?  
CHRISTINA McHALE:   I'm really just taking it match by match.   I have a tough match, so I'm just focused on that one.  
   
 Q.   I know your mom is Cuban and there is a huge Cuban community here and everything.   
CHRISTINA McHALE:   Uh‑huh.  
   
 Q.   Do you like Cuban food?  
CHRISTINA McHALE:   Yeah, I love it (smiling).   I love Cuban food.   My grandma, whenever I'm home she will cook me a nice meal.   I'm a huge fan.   
Yeah, my aunt and uncle live down here, so they came to watch me today.  
   
 Q.   Your mom's sister?  
CHRISTINA McHALE:   My mom's sister.   I spent a lot of time growing up here in Miami so it feels like a second home for me.   
   
 Q.   Where do they live in Miami, your aunt and uncle?  
CHRISTINA McHALE:   Near Coral Gables.  
   
 Q.   How do you feel about the way you're playing now since hooking back up with the USTA, and what do you expect later on like towards the end of the year?  
CHRISTINA McHALE:   Yeah, I definitely think I've got my game back.   I got sick like end of 2012, so that really kind of set me back a bit.  
But yeah, I feel like I'm working again with JorgÃ© and he's helped me get my game back together.   I feel like I'm using my forehand well.   Everything is a little bit more structured in my game.  
So, yeah, and just being able to practice with all the girls down there has really helped.  
   
 Q.   What was the sickness at the end of '12?  
CHRISTINA McHALE:   I got mono.  
   
 Q.   Did that affect you?   You stay weak for a while, right?  
CHRISTINA McHALE:   Yeah, I mean, I was able to get over the actual sickness pretty quickly, but then it's like, you know, you just struggle for a long time with no energy.   That's the tough part.  
And then, yeah, just getting like fit again.   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   Is there a special diet that you have now?  
CHRISTINA McHALE:   No.  
   
 Q.   Keeping your energy level high?  
CHRISTINA McHALE:   No, I have kept my same diet that I have always had.  
   
 Q.   Have you heard anything about Fed Cup yet?  
CHRISTINA McHALE:   No.   I just saw on Twitter it was in St.Louis.   I think Mary Joe waits a bit closer to decide.  
   
 Q.   What are your aunt and uncle's names?   
CHRISTINA McHALE:   Idinea and Lawrence Shoot.  
   
 Q.   I‑d‑i‑n‑e‑a?  
CHRISTINA McHALE:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   Last name?  
CHRISTINA McHALE:   S‑h‑o‑o‑t.   
   
 Q.   With the way the state of American tennis is now, like Serena is No. 1 and Venus just won then you won the finals of Acapulco the same week, where do you think everyone stands?   How do you feel about it?  
CHRISTINA McHALE:   I feel like American tennis is for sure doing really well, I think.   Sloane had a really good week last week; Lauren did really well last week; Madison.   
I think we're all kind of pushing each other to, yeah, to try and do better.  
Obviously Serena and Venus are a great example for us.   
   
 Q.   I guess your sister is working in the media center.   
CHRISTINA McHALE:   Yeah, she's working in the media center.  
   
 Q.   What's that like, having her around?  
CHRISTINA McHALE:   She's been so busy that I haven't been able to see her very much.  
She's working long hours, but she's enjoying it.   I think her office kind of looks over the tennis, so she said if she could sneak away for a few moments she was going to try and look over and watch a little bit.  
   
 Q.   Her tennis background?   She played in college?  
CHRISTINA McHALE:   UNC, Chapel Hill.  
   
 Q.   Did you introduce her to Ryan, or how did that happen?  
CHRISTINA McHALE:   They have been friends for a long time.  
   
 Q.   From the juniors?  
CHRISTINA McHALE:   Yeah.
