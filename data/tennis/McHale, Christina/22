 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Christina.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about what was different between last week and this week, especially in her game.   
 CHRISTINA McHALE: Yeah, I definitely think she played more aggressive this time. She was, yeah, like pushing me around the court more this time. I think, uhm, I could have served better today. I think, yeah, that could have helped me out in my service games a little bit more.  
  
  Q. This is only your second quarterfinals of your career. How has this tournament helped you prepare for the US Open?  
 CHRISTINA McHALE: Yeah, for sure, it's been a great week for me. You know, the goal was to get match play here and to, uhm, play against the top players that were here. So I did that.   
 Obviously, you know, I'm disappointed because I still wanted to do better today. But I think it was a good week for me.   
  
  Q. Did you surpass your expectations at all coming into the tournament?  
 CHRISTINA McHALE: Uhm, yeah. Yeah, I mean, the draw I think I had was pretty tough. So to be in the quarters today, it was exciting for me, yeah.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about what your expectations are going into New York next week, what you hope to accomplish.   
 CHRISTINA McHALE: Yeah, I was focused a lot here, so I haven't thought too much yet about like getting ready for the Open yet.   
 Yeah, that will be my focus now, will turn towards the Open.   
  
  Q. Will you look at the draw or just your first opponent?  
 CHRISTINA McHALE: Yeah, I never look at the whole draw. I just look at my first opponent.   
  
  Q. Have you looked at that yet?   
 CHRISTINA McHALE: Yeah. I think I was told I play a qualifier.
