  K. BONDARENKO/R. Fujiwara  
1-6, 6-4, 6-3  
   
  Q. You had a very strong first set, but then things seemed to change for you in the second and third. What do you think changed?  
 RIKA FUJIWARA: Well, I was kind of surprising myself how I played on first set, but that made me a little bit pressure to myself. Because I had to keep that on, to, like, keep playing like that: really aggressive.   
 I think when I was up 4-2 in second set maybe too much pressure, I put too much pressure on me. I couldn't make first serve, and then the things slowly change from this point.   
 So I think just the mental thing. Yeah, I thought I have to change something, but I just have to keep going and keep going forward, keep aggressive. I thought you have to change, that's, I think, the mistake.  
  
  Q. You seemed to struggle with your serve at times. Was this something that you feel let you down today?  
 RIKA FUJIWARA: Exactly. I was struggling from qualification as well, but I think I need to work on it.
