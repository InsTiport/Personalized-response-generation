 THE MODERATOR: Questions.

 Q. You are good friends. Mahesh, you're playing with Leander in Australia. What's the future for you two? Are you teaming up sometimes next year? 
 MAHESH BHUPATHI: Yeah, the door is never closed. Max and me, God knows how many more years we'll play on the tour. We'll take it a year at a time. 
 We've known each other for literally 12 years, growing up on the challenger circuit. I'm pretty sure at some point in the future we'll probably play some tournaments.
