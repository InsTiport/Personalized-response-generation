M. SAKKARI/A. Tatishvili.   
6-0, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How much did you know about her?  She hadn't played in a long time.  I was surprised to see her in the draw.  How do you prepare for that kind of match?  
MARIA SAKKARI: I mean, I checked.  To tell you the truth, I checked her activity.  I show that she last played -- I didn't check the math, but I show that it was 2017.   
You know, it's always tough to play someone who hasn't played in a while because you don't know what to expect.  You see players every week, so you more or less know what to do.   
But I think it's also quite tough for you, you know, to come back after I assume an injury she had.   
 Q.  Have you seen much of her and, if not, are you a YouTube person?  Do you go and search YouTube?  
MARIA SAKKARI: I'm not the one doing it.  My coach does it and then he comes up with the tactics that I have to do.  I just follow what he says.  I mean, I trust him so, you know.  I try to do what he says and what he tells me.   
But I'm not the one, you know, that scouts and watches YouTube videos and stuff.   
 Q.  Because you mentioned YouTube, I just saw that you were in the new Stefanos video.  What was it like starring on camera with him?  That's the first time I've seen you in one of his.  
MARIA SAKKARI: I haven't seen it yet.   
 Q.  It came out during your match.  
MARIA SAKKARI: I don't know.  I have to see it to tell you how I feel about it.  So we were both in Monaco and we drove -- we were in the same flight.  I caught him recording me when I didn't know that he was.  But it's my pleasure and my honor to be in one of his YouTube videos.   
 Q.  In a Slam, I'm curious what do you do, like, on your days off.  Do you stay in the hotel or do you try and get out?  
MARIA SAKKARI: I try not to stay so much in the room because I get sick of it, you know?  You need fresh air.  You need to do stuff.   
So tomorrow I'm going to practice for like an hour, hour and a half and do some stuff with my fitness coach, then go back to hotel, get treatment, and have a nice dinner with my family that is here.   
You know, it's nice to walk around Paris and enjoying most of the time the good weather at that time.   
 Q.  With Nike there's a lot more options for players than usual at this tournament.  There's not as many players in the same outfits.  I'm curious if you picked your combination or if you got to choose totally or if you were given -- because seems that there's a lot of variety.  I don't know if everyone is independently doing it or how much instruction you got.  
MARIA SAKKARI: Actually, I was given two options, so I chose one of them for my match today.  I love it.  You know, I think since I have been with Nike I haven't said, Wow, I don't like this.  I think they're doing a great job and they're picking very nice stuff for us.   
Of course this time is very unique, and we could say that it's quite risky for some players.  But I love it, and I'm so happy to be part of the family.   
 Q.  Your coach is, I think, the same age as you?  
MARIA SAKKARI: Yeah, same age.  Few months older.   
 Q.  What is that like?  Because obviously most coaches there tends to be quite a big age-gap difference.  So is it different?  
MARIA SAKKARI: Well, it is different, I have to tell you, because I always had older coaches.  I never had very old coach.  Last one was my grandfather, so you can -- (Laughing).   
But it's quite nice.  Because, you know, we're very good friends, as well, so we do stuff together.  And I remember in San Jose we were riding the scooters for, like, 45 minutes.  So I wouldn't be able to do it with my grandfather, I assume.   
So it's quite cool.  We can spend time together like friends.
