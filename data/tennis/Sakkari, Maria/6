M. SAKKARI/M. Keys
6-4, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Were your fans a little less boisterous today than they were the other day? Quieter?
MARIA SAKKARI: Yeah, I think it's because -- well, I mean, what I was told is that the court was sold out and they couldn't find, you know, tickets.
But they were still pretty loud when they had to (smiling).
Q. No police this time, though?
MARIA SAKKARI: No, but I think that was a little bit unfair, I have to say for them. I think they didn't do anything wrong in my match to, you know, being kicked out. I don't know what they did later, but actually my previous match they were perfect (smiling).
