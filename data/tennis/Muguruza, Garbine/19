J. BRADY/G. Muguruza
6-7, 6-3, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. There are no easy matches.
GARBINE MUGURUZA: No, I was expecting a tough match. I mean, she's playing great. I think the altitude suits her style with the kick serve, spinning the ball a lot.
But I knew it was going to be hard because I've seen her play and she's having a good run.
Q. What is so good about her game at the moment? Why is she so tough to play?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I think she's confident now. I think her shots are getting in. I think she has a very good serve. Her ball is pretty hard.
Q. How do you feel about your own game today?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, I had so many opportunities. I can't count how many I had. They didn't go my way. I felt like every time I had an opportunity, she was playing well the point, serving big, making winners. I can't count how many I had.
Q. You've still been so consistent throughout the season. That's something to take out of this tournament?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Sure, I think I'm playing a lot of matches and I'm happy that results are getting there. That's what I really want. I'm not thinking to do this every single week. I just want to play matches and matches.
I'm consciously feel like I'm here, but not really concentrate on that. That will come a little bit unconscious.
Q. You played earlier matches earlier in the day. Is there a difference when you're playing later? Does the ball stay low?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I feel like during the day it's a little bit more hot, more windy. I personally like to play earlier in the day. I feel like it's nicer to wake up and go play.
But I know for the crowd here, loves to be at night. You just adapt.
