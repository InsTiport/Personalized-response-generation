A. BARTY/G. Muguruza
7-6, 6-4
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. You are not particularly always playing the week before a slam, but how do you feel going into the year's first slam?
GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I mean, it was a very, very good week, good performances, good matches.  I normally don't play the week before, but I'm taking a lot of positive from this week because a final of course is a final.
Yeah, just starting to think about my next tournament.  I think today also was a very good match.  I think I had probably the final to play, the toughest final, against Ash.  I think she played great.  I think we both did a good match.  Very close in the first set, also in the second set.
Yeah, taking a good positive out of it.
Q. Obviously not the way you wanted to end the tournament, but does this give you good confidence going into the Open?  Great run up to the final, lost only 10 games in your first four matches.
GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I think yeah.  I mean, I think I can use the matches and competition this week.  I think I played well.  So, yeah, I'm going to try to keep it up for the next two weeks ahead of me.
I hope, yeah.
Q. Have you set any goals?  Do you have any expectations what you would like to be able to achieve?  Made it to the final last year.  Any reason to think you shouldn't be able to go as far this year?
GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Well, I don't normally think that far.  I'm only concentrating now on this tournament, it's finished, for my first round which I'm going to be playing on Tuesday likely.
Yeah, I'm not looking too far ahead.  I just have to go round by round, then see where do I end at the end of the two weeks.
