 3-6, 6-3, 6-2
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Can you share with us what the difference between winning and losing tonight was?  Is there anything you might have done differently?
 GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I feel it was like a very tight match.  I felt I had many opportunities.  I had opportunities in the second set to take the lead.  I just didn't convert them.
 Definitely I feel the difference was physically.  I felt today out there very limited by that.  You know, I felt like my body wasn't 100% and I had to deal with pain from many matches.  But, yeah, definitely physically it didn't allowed me to play the way I wanted.
 Q. You wrap up the first part of the season on hard courts leading the WTA in victories, three finals and a title in Dubai.  How much does this do for your confidence as you get ready to prepare for the European clay season?
 GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I think it's been great.  I mean, so far probably my best start of the year, and happy about that.  I take the positive.
 I know right now it is a tough moment, but, you know, in five minutes I'm just going to change my mind and, you know, just look ahead of the clay court which is my favorite surface and, yeah, happy with the way I'm playing.
