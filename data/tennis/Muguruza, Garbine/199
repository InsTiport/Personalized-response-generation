  THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
   
 Q. What are you most proud about being able to make back‑to‑back finals?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I'm very proud because to be in a final, it means that you've been winning a lot of matches before. It was very hard for me after Wuhan to come here, you know, start over again. Well, I didn't have the best taste to end Wuhan with this retirement.   
I mean, I'm proud. I'm proud to be able to keep the level mentally and also to be motivated to want more. I'm very happy of this.   
I had a lot of proof's here to see how motivated I was. Obviously to be able to win these matches, to go through these difficult top players, I think it's great.   
   
 Q. You play Bacsinszky next. What do you expect for that final?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: A final. I expect everything. I know Timea. I saw her today and these couple of days. She's playing good. She's a very intelligent player. All the matches I've played against her have been, Whew.   
I want the trophy. I want it so much so I'm going to fight for it and see what happens.   
   
 Q. Looking back at Wimbledon, you were so excited after every single match. You were jumping up and down, fist pumping, a lot of emotion. We're not seeing a ton of that this week or last week in Wuhan. Is that an intentional change in how you're trying to control your demeanor on the court?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: It's true. I didn't realize it a lot. I'm just feeling so tired, I'm like, My gosh.   
It's true, I'm trying to control more my emotions because I think it doesn't help. When you're out on the court, you have to be like poker face all the time. C'mon, Garbine, don't scream, throw the racquet. It's so hard because I wanted to scream, throw away the racquet, put away the camera. I'm like, Okay, look down, then move.   
I think it is just part of the game. I wish I could develop more things, but no.   
   
 Q. This week you celebrated your 22nd birthday here and qualified for the WTA Finals for the first time. Now you're qualifying for the mandatory tournament in Beijing. Maybe this city will be significant for you in many aspects, right?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, it was. The years before I didn't win a match here. Now I'm in the finals. It's really great to be in really big event for us here in Beijing.   
A lot of thing happens here, yeah. I don't know. I always remember good memories for here, for sure.
