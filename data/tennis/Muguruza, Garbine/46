G. MUGURUZA/D. Collins   
6-4, 4-6, 6-2   
(Transcribed from WTA recorded audio.)   
 Q.  Your thoughts yesterday with the rain delay, knowing you'd have to play twice today, your thoughts going into the match.  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Yeah, I mean, not good because it delays the whole schedule, not only me but the whole tournament.  We always want to play with sun.  Brings good energy.   
Yeah, today is a great day, though.   
 Q.  Going into the third set, having lost the second set, how did you find the strength to win decisively in the third?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Yes, I was just keeping composed.  I was playing well.  She came up and won the second set.  I knew I was on the right path.  In the third set I kept doing the same thing and it worked better.   
 Q.  You play Azarenka next.  Your thoughts?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Good.  It's going to be a good match to play.  Always great to play good players.  Looking forward.
