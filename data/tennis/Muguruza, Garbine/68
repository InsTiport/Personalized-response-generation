S. STEPHENS/G. Muguruza
6-3, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. It was an even match statistically.  The only difference was she defended her second serve at a high number.  You couldn't hurt her second serve.  Do you agree?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, I just -- I don't know about the statistics.  I just know how I felt a little bit.
I think I miss too many shots.  You know, I did a couple of mistakes that I shouldn't have done in important moments, and she was serving good.  I think my serve in general could be better.
Yeah, it's not a big difference, but at the end, the few details went to her side.
Q. How do you feel like you play against American player in center court in Miami?  Do you feel any pressure play in front of the crowds here?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Yeah, I love to play here.  I love this court.  You know, I feel it's like my second home.
Yeah, it's a shame I couldn't go more forward, because I really like here.  Well, next year.
Q. You think having a walkover was some sort of disadvantage, because you only had played one match coming in and she had more than few matches under her belt?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: No, I don't think -- I think I'm pretty lucky that in the first round I had a bye and then another kind of bye, so I don't think it's good or bad.  It's just things that happened.  It's all right.
Q. How do you feel like the weather conditions today?  It's a little bit hotter today, I think.
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: I felt good.  I remember playing here with hotter conditions, so today actually to be in the middle of the day was good.
Q. A little bit off-topic.  You have been hearing the Davis Cup changes proposed by the ITF.  Ideally would you like to see something like that for the Fed Cup, too, where it's a one-week tournament, change the format?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: I don't know if it's the best format or not.  I just think that people should also care about the women's side and not only about the men's side after -- I didn't really think about it, if it's good in the schedule or not, but it's just everybody talks about the men's side in general more.
