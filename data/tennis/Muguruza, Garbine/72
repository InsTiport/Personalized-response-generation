P. KVITOVA/G. Muguruza
3-6, 6-3, 6-4
Q. GarbiÃ±e, you had a great start to the match.  What do you think was the difference in the second and third set?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, I think in the first set she wasn't maybe playing her best.  I think she made a lot of unforced errors right away, so it gave me a lot of advantage.  In the second set it was more what I was expecting, you know, a tough match.  And in the third it was just a little bit more equal.
Q. It felt like you were able to get some pressure on her serve throughout the second and third sets generating some break points and things.  Did you feel like those break points she was stepping up on those points or did you feel like there was opportunity missed there?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Yeah.  I think I had a lot of break points, and I didn't convert them.  I think also because she came out with all those winners.  But yeah, I think if I would have get one of those break points, it would be different.
Q. What's the unique challenge of playing Petra?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, I think she has great shots, so she puts you in difficulties very soon in the point.  She has a good serve.  She has a very good first, second shot, so it's always tricky to find your game or your rhythm.
Q. And do you feel like yesterday since you had the walkover, do you think that had any impact whatsoever?  Did you feel fine today, rusty, what do you think?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, you know, I was lucky there because I have one tough match less, so I was more rested for the match, I guess.  But -- well, it -- just like that.
Q. You said at the start of the week you wanted to get good matches under your belt.  Do you think that you've done that?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, yeah, the objective here is done.  It was to play, to win and get good matches and a lot of competition because it's what I need.
Q. And what happened with the knee?  There was a lot of tape.
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Yeah.  I did a weird movement.  It was very windy, and one ball I did a weird movement with my knee, and I felt some pain, and then I thought about taping it to not make it worse.  So I don't know.  Never had anything in my knee, so we'll see how it reacts after now when I'm going to be cold.
Q. And I know that it's weird because she won but she's going to be back in the Top 10.  Is it good to see her back?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, I think it doesn't matter the ranking she has.  She's always going to be like a Top 10 player.  I understand that now.  On the paper it makes it nicer, but I think if she's 50 or whatever, I think she's always good.  Doesn't matter.
