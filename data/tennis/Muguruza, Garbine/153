  6‑2, 5‑7, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.

Q. Earlier you were saying when it comes to Wimbledon, special service, special ambiance. After a match like today, does it make you think more positively about adding the Wimbledon crown to your French success?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, I think Wimbledon is a very tricky tournament, because the grass sometimes, it can give you surprise. 
I think all the matches are quite more equal. I think I had a very tough match today. 
But, well, I'm going to take the positive side. I think it's good to start the tournament, it's good to get into the grass court. 
I'm very happy about this match. Sometimes you don't win like very beautiful, but you just got to be there, you know, and fight for the match. 

Q. Do you think playing Mallorca on grass and practicing beforehand has helped you here, because it's very similar grass?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Yes, I think every hour you spend on grass practicing, it really helps you, because it's such a different surface. We only got few tournaments to play. 
So it helped me a lot to right away start, change the clay court, right away start on grass. It helps me for today, for sure. 

Q. Also there were rumors that Toni Nadal helped you in Mallorca. I heard this on television. 
GARBINE MUGURUZA: No, I think it's a rumor. I saw him there because he came to see the tournament, but nothing more from that. 

Q. You must have been happy that one Spaniard could beat an Italian today. 
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Yes, I'm happy. Like I said before, sometimes you don't win the most beautiful way. You got to be there fighting and waiting for your chance, especially against a player that bangs the ball. Is a very tough opponent to begin the tournament. 
Yeah, I give my point to Spain. I was looking before. I was like watching the screen, Carla, what's the score? 
1‑0. 
This is not good. So now I'm happy. 

Q. What was your reaction to Spain going out of the Euro?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I was just playing. I went to the locker room. They were finishing. I'm really into my match right now, so... 

Q. You moved to Geneva a few months ago. I would like to hear a few words about the city, if you already discover some places you like. 
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Yeah, yeah, I go there a lot. It reminds me a little bit, like, between Paris and between Barcelona. It has that old small‑town look. I don't know. I think it's cold (laughter). But, I don't know, it has like a charm city. I don't know, I think it's charm.

Q. You find someplace to eat late at night. 
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I got to eat like at 7:30 or 8:00. In Spain, I eat like at 9:30. At 9:30, everybody is closed, leaving. I adapt. I adapt.

Q. What particular details do you find you have to change between Roland Garros and here? What do you particularly work on to change from clay to grass?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, I think just in grass you have less time, less time for everything. You really got to concentrate your first shots, which are going to make the difference. 
It's not like in clay, you got more time. You can survive more. Here you, right away, are in danger if you don't go for it. 
I think it's just more faster. You got be more concentrated. That ball, those three seconds can change the match. That would be it.
