THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  A very good win for you.  How comfortable do you feel coming to Wimbledon so far now?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, didn't look that easy from inside, honestly.  But I'm happy.  I was just, you know, nervous to play first round.  You never know how it's going to go.   
Pretty happy with my performance.  Didn't play my best tennis.  But I wasn't thinking that today I was going to play either.  But happy these tough matches I'm handling well.   
 Q.  You said at the French Open that you were almost relieved to not have this title defense on your mind, everyone asking you about that.  Do you feel more freedom now that's behind you?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I just think I have something less to think and worry.  But I'm hungry, you know, to do well here, to try be in that position again kind of.   
But for sure is just a different situation now that that passed, and I don't have that in front of me.  That's gone already.   
 Q.  How different has it been for you working with Conchita instead of Sam here?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: It's not that different because I work with her during the Fed Cup weeks, and also before in Barcelona she was helping me as well few days here and there.   
It's actually, you know, relaxed and funny because we get along very well.  She knows how to play here.  So I love it.   
 Q.  Do you talk about her run here and winning here?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Oh, yeah.  We were just joking.  We saw a few points with Martina.  I don't know, just a little.
