THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   It was such a big tournament for you.   What was the memory you will bring back to home?
GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I'm really happy with the tournament I did.   I played fourth round here.   It's the first time that I play a lot of matches in Grand Slam.   I'm actually really happy. 

Q.   You had surgery last year.   How do you feel yourself now physically?   You have no problem?
GARBINE MUGURUZA:   My ankle is perfect.   I have fantastic recovery.   I don't feel nothing of pain, so 100% good. 

Q.   What's coming up next for you?
GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I'm going to Barcelona now for like three weeks.   Florianopolis is my next tournament, and then Indian Wells and Miami. 

Q.   Can Agnieszka win the title here this year?
GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I think is possible.   I think she played very good today.   She's playing good.   I mean, she's like 5 in the world.   She can do it. 
I think she has a lot of possibilities. 

Q.   Can you talk about your training situation. 
GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I practice in Barcelona since I was a small girl.   My coach is Alejo Mancisidor.
