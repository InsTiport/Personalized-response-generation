M. KEYS/G. Muguruza
7-6, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Tough match today.  Curious if you were surprised by how well she was able to play on clay?  Red clay is not a surface she has a lot of experience on, really.
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, I felt she was very loose today.  I think maybe because she doesn't like clay.  I don't know.  But I felt she was playing great.  Her serve was good today.
With this kind of weather, she was just hitting really hard and missing very few balls.  She played well.
Q. It looked like in the first set obviously it was very tight.  Did you feel your serve let you down a little bit towards the end of that first set and into the second?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, I knew that I would have to be very aggressive during the whole match.  Madison served really well, so she makes you feel, you know, putting a lot of pressure all the time.  Was only two points' difference in the first set, and, well, it went to her side.  But I'm really surprised how she played today.
Q. How important was this week for you to get to a semifinal here going into the French Open?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: It's good.  I mean, we all want to play as much of matches as we can.  It was a great week for me.  I would like, for sure, to be in the final and win, but I felt really good playing these matches here, so it's perfect for French Open.
