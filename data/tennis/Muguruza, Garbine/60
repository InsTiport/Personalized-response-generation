A. SABALENKA/G. Muguruza   
7-5, 6-4   
 Q.  What made the difference tonight?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Her confidence.   
 Q.  What did you make of her game?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Aggressive.   
 Q.  Despite the loss, isn't it one of the best matches from your side this season?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: This one?   
 Q.  The quality of the match.  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I don't really know.  I think it was just a good match.  I don't know if it's the best of the year, but it was a good fight.   
 Q.  You and Sam both say it's just around the corner in terms of turning things around.  Is this a match, in terms of the performance, that you feel as though that kind of proves that to you or gives you confidence?  Or are you just kind of disappointed at the moment?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: No, I already felt it before.  I don't think this match is going to make me think different.  I was close.  She's playing well.  It went in her side.   
But this match doesn't tell me something that I don't know.
