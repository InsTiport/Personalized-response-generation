G. MUGURUZA/M. Keys   
6-4, 3-6, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How do you think you were able to pull that match out?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, I think fighting and believing that until the last point I have my options.  And I know I had three match points against, but I did feel that I was doing the right thing.   
She was playing good in the important moments.  She was serving better with the match.  I think in the third set she played much better.   
But it was a tough fight, you know.  We both were playing good.  It was tricky with the wind and then the rain delay.  I'm happy that I ended up winning, you know, not giving any point free.   
Especially when you see yourself close of losing and then you turn around, you know, it's a very good feeling to come out and winning the match.   
 Q.  Madison came back from the rain delay very strongly.  How do you feel you were able to kind of turn that around?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: She did.  She came strong.  She did few incredible shots.   
But, you know, that's also her style of game.  You know, sometimes she plays incredible, big serves, big shots, but I knew that no matter what, she's going to play, and I'm there and I have my options as well, because the match is tight.   
And I didn't really care.  You know, I was just, like, Okay, whatever.  I'm going to, sooner or later, have a chance.   
 Q.  It never looked like you started to panic at all during that match even with the wind and the rain delay and the leg and everything.  Is that just, like, kind of how you were feeling today, just really a general sense of calm or confidence, or what do you think?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: I think it was just I was ready for a difficult match.  You know, I played her before and it was in a completely different situation in Stanford.  I felt here more prepared to play.   
I know it was windy in the warmup, I know it was hot, I know it was very dark when I started playing.  So I kind of, you know, just ready for what happened and fight.  Just fighting.   
 Q.  What did you do during the rain delay?  And what's that like as you're kind of just waiting for the weather to clear?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, I went to, you know, to lay down a little bit with my physio, because, you know, I had few issues in the leg at the beginning of the set and went much better.  Relax, I eat some food, listened to some music.   
There is not a lot to do.  It's tricky, because you know that you're going to play again so you can't disconnect at all, but you have to at least relax.   
 Q.  How is the leg?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Is better.  I felt it a little bit during the first set and then during the second set a little bit better, and then I had the time with my physio to work a little bit and it was better.  So we'll see tonight.  I will do everything I can, because I know I'm playing tomorrow probably early, so I don't have a lot of time.   
 Q.  I wanted to check your thoughts.  Have you heard about what happened today in Barcelona?  And have you checked with people?  Are your folks all right?  What are your emotions about the folks in Spain?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: I did check in the rain delay.  I couldn't believe it.  I have been so many times to that place, so many times.  You know, it's like a main street with a lot of shops and people.   
I was very surprised, you know, because you always hear what happened in Paris and in London, and you're, like, Shit.  But now, I have been so many times to this place, it's like my home.  And I feel, like, Shit, I have been there so many times.  So it really shocked me.  Really shocked me.   
So, I mean, I'm just sad for the people that were there.  I feel like if you're in the wrong moment at the wrong time, it can happen anywhere.   
 Q.  Did you find out during the break?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Yeah, during the rain delay.  I'm like, okay, I was listening to music, I checked for news and stuff, and I'm like, Oh.   
I checked with my family.  Everything is okay, but, you know, I don't know.  It's just incredible.   
 Q.  How does something like that affect you when you then go back out on court?  Because obviously it's not great news from home, but you have still got a match to play.  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: What do you mean?   In the center court?   
 Q.  Yeah.  Can something like that affect you when you see it?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: You know, I'm used to put so many things aside to be able to compete.  That's my every day, you know, putting things aside and going out there and have two hours of concentration of tennis.   
I just make sure that people around me are fine.  There is not a lot I can do anymore.  Just support the people.  Be, you know, with them.  But at the end I've got to go play.  And after, we can talk again.  But I have to kind of block it for two hours.   
 Q.  Your next match against Svetlana, another tough opponent that you know pretty well.  Can you just talk through that match a little bit?  What do you expect?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, I expect another tough match.  We know each other very well.  We always have good matches.  I'm happy to play her again.  I think it's always a good match with her.   
I was expecting a tough match in quarterfinals.  Once again, you know, there is not one match that is easy anymore.  I like it.  You know, I'm once again in quarterfinals.  I'm still with chances.  We'll see tomorrow.
