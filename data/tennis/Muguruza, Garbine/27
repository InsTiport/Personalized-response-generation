 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. You have not had great success at the US Open, yet you have been very successful at Roland Garros.  Was there ever a temptation for you this year to bypass coming to New York, staying home to practice on the red clay to be ready for Roland Garros?
 GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Yeah, I mean, it's true that historically the US Open doesn't seem to have a lot of success for now, the first rounds, over the years.
 The decision to come to the US Open I made two days before arriving here.  It was really just giving me the chance to compete.  I really didn't felt quite prepared.  I just said to myself, Okay, I just go, try to compete, see what I can take out of it, just give myself a chance.
 Q. Do you feel Rafa made the right decision or should he have come here with the same thinking you had?
 GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I think it's complicated to make the right schedule.  I mean, is true that some people like to prioritize some surfaces.  It's totally understandable.  It's true that having two Grand Slams in a row, two very different surfaces, it's tricky.
 I can only speak about myself.  Yes, it was a little bit of a rush decision.  I wanted to know also where I am in terms of competition.  It was just a kind of first test.
 Q. You hadn't played her before.  No one has seen her in three years.  What did you make of her game?  What did you see from her?
 GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I mean, for sure it was a tricky round.  I watch her, but long, long time ago.  We never played.  I think she played very well today.  Also a little bit nothing to lose, just go out there and see what happens.  It was just a mix of everything:  having a tricky opponent, just not feeling that expected, the combination.
 I feel like I don't quite find my tennis yet in the US Open in the early rounds.  Yeah, just going to have to wait a little bit.
 Q. You started the match very well, especially on serve.  Was there something that she did adjustment-wise in her return that made serving a little bit more difficult?  Was it so good of a start that it couldn't be maintained?
 GARBINE MUGURUZA:   No, I feel like I started very well.  With the match, I think she started to play smarter.  She did great her game, very solid.  I think I have also took some risks in some moments where maybe I should have thought it a little bit more.  Just details that even if you start leading, you know, the lack of matches, the competition, the flow with the match, right now it's a little bit strange.  That's how I felt little bit also out there.
 Q. I see in a way you don't seem so demoralized after a defeat, you are not really shocked.  Is that because you were more or less expecting that you could also play not at your level?
 GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Well, I came here knowing that I was not going to feel perfect ready.  You normally don't feel perfect, but I knew that the preparation was different.  My decision was a little bit last minute.  I knew that it could go both ways.  I knew that I could go out there and not feel probably super prepared.
 I didn't mind it.  I just wanted to come here, test a little bit myself, see where I am tennistically, physically, and add as many matches as I can to I guess this strange year.
 Q. At the same time did you have the feeling that all these top players missing, the top 10, Pliskova losing, that you had more pressure on yourself?  In a way, many people were considering you one of the top favorites.
 GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I feel that's a good problem to have.  I always feel like I can be one of the players that can hold the trophy every tournament I play.
 But, no, I mean, I didn't feel extra pressure.  Of course, not playing for such a long time, then starting the first tournament in a Grand Slam, I also feel a little bit responsible.  That's not new.  I always feel like that.
 Q. What was going through your mind when you smashed your racquet, then when you saw how badly you broke it?
 GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I mean, yeah, it was a tough moment.  I guess I'm more stronger now, I don't know (smiling).
 Yeah, I'm not a type of player that does that a lot.  I just feel like today out there was a tough first set.  I felt I had it in control, then she played very well and took her chances.  All of a sudden it was gone.
 But, yeah, it's just emotions.  This is individual sport.  I guess there is moments like that.
