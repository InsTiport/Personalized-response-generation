6-3, 4-6, 6-4
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. Can you talk about just today's match.  How did you see the match?  What was the key to keeping that match tight?  Also, how is your leg?
GARBINE MUGURUZA:   So it was a tough battle, as I expected.  Yeah, physically today I struggled.  I think that's the fourth match or fifth match, I think, in short days.  I felt it since a long time also not playing matches in a row.
Yeah, since the beginning I knew today I was going to struggle a little bit, because I wasn't feeling as fresh as I probably wished to face this kind of opponent.  But even though I wasn't in my best, I'm pretty happy with my performance and my fighting spirit.
I think that far from my best, I took her to, yeah, to tough moments and also could have turned it around.
Q. In terms of the leg, what was the shot or movement that maybe the leg or the back, I don't know which it was, but that was affected the most?
GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I struggled to run today.  My body was already this morning feeling so-so.  Yeah, today I had to run, as always on clay court, also, and at the beginning of the match I already felt some pain in my left thigh.
I was, like, Okay, let me rethink how do I approach this match, because, yeah, I'm gonna have to be smart.
Q. In terms of turning around that second and that third set, what do you think was the key there?  Did your tactics and strategy change?  Did you refocus to just execute better?  What do you think was the difference?
GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I think I played well at the end of the second set.  I think she also gave me an opportunity.
I think in the third set she played very well the first games, very well, and she took good advantage of that.
And then I stood behind her.  Even though it looked far in the score, I knew I wasn't that far.  So I always stood behind her, because I know that, you know, things can change and I can grab an opportunity.
At the end, I managed to almost get it equal in the third set, but, yeah, she played well when she had to.
Q. Is it safe to say that this week in Rome kind of sets you up very well for Paris in terms of your preparation?  Obviously concerns over letting your leg heal and getting 100%, but seven days away from Roland Garros, how are you feeling about your game and about your spirit?
GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Yes, my goal is completed in Rome in terms of playing matches.  Of course I wanted to hold the trophy, but played good matches against great opponents.  I had a lot of positives to take of this week, especially coming to a Grand Slam in next week.
So just now a little bit of recovery, you know, take care of my body, because it's another battle and long battle is coming in, yeah, few days.
Q. Is it fair to say you feel a lot better coming out of Rome than, let's say -- because I know for US Open you knew that you weren't fully prepared and made the decision last minute.  Do you feel a lot more, I guess, confident and comfortable going into Roland Garros than you did at the US Open?
GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Yeah.  I mean -- yeah.  At least I played a tournament, I played some matches, good matches, good wins.
So, yeah, compared to US Open, yes, of course.
