G. MUGURUZA/Y. Duan
6-4, 6-0
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Obviously the first set was very competitive.  She is someone who also hits the ball really hard.
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I think, yes, the first set was very equal.  It took me a while.  You know, she was hitting such a powerful shot.  She's very tall.  She hits the ball very strong.  It took me a little bit to be able to feel her ball.
I'm happy I turn it around.  It was a few points difference in the first set, and it could go both ways.  But I fighted there.  After I felt much better.  I adapt more to the match for the second set.
Q. How does it feel to be in the third round of the US Open?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Very good.  I feel like a relief in a way.  Five years or something like this, or three, I don't know, I've been always stuck in this round.  I didn't know really why.
I'm happy that at least I am one more round up, which I still want to go as far as I can.  This is just something funny.  But I'm happy, yeah.
Q. The string of second-round losses, do you feel it?  Second round, do you say, I got past this round?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Is just like, you know, I think about it, like before, I'm once again here, I have another chance, let's try to break this.  But once I'm in the court, I'm just not thinking about that.
Q. What was the day like for you?  You didn't have a match court assigned.  When did you get to the courts and when did you find out when you were going to get onto the court?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: It was a very tricky day because at the end I came very early not knowing what was the situation.  I know my match was to be arranged there, like, in a corner.
You know, at the end we were in the gym like at almost 10.  At the end was the court that was finishing earlier basically.  I'm happy was Grandstand.  Nice court, and it's not that late.
Q. You won in Wimbledon.  You won in Canada.  Is the season to become No. 1?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: All I want is to win matches, and the ranking sooner or later will come.  I try to focus on more winning matches here and try to go forward rather than the ranking because is the first step, to win matches, getting far in tournament, and we see after.
