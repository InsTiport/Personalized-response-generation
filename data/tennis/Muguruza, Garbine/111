G. MUGURUZA/Y. Putintseva
7-5, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.
Q. With each match you look like your confidence is improving.  Would you say that's true?  How are you feeling now?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Yeah, I think it's true.  I think the more matches I play and the toughest victories I think gives you self-confidence, successful feeling out there.  I think it's important with all the three matches that I played that are not easy at all.
Q. What pleased you most about your performance today?  You looked more comfortable on court throughout the match.
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, I'm happy I went out there without kind of fear.  I wanted the match.  I tried to just do what I had to do and keep that during the whole match.  Not thinking a lot, because it's, you know, a lot of thinking in this tournament for me in the matches and stuff, so I try to go out there and block everything and just thinking what I have to do to win.
Q. Next round you face either Rogers or Mladenovic.  Can you break down either matchup?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Yeah, I played Rogers I remember here last year in quarterfinals.  I don't know the score.  I think she likes it here actually.  She plays well.  Mladenovic is having a good year.  She won a lot of matches.  She's at home.  So I think both opponents are going to be difficult, but, I don't know, one I think has a little bit more confidence than the other one.
Q. Are you enjoying the warm weather and the dry courts?  Do you think that that suits your game?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Yeah, I'm enjoying a lot, because I remember last year was very bad weather, and I'm happy to play out there on center court, sunny, and it's beautiful.  It's good to play.  I like also to play first match of the day because you know at what time you start, and you're ready to play.
Q. You are in the fourth round.  Of course you're thinking match by match, but in a slam, it's different.  You have two weeks.  You have a day off, time to think.  What actually starts you thinking of lifting the trophy?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, I remember last year thinking that like when I was in semifinals or something, because I was, like, I have 25% of lifting the trophy.  That's when I started to kind of think about it.
I think this year I'm just really focusing on my next opponent now, hopefully watch a few points and just that, honestly.
Q. When you made it to the Wimbledon final, you were saying making desserts is what used to relax you.  Do you get to do that and is that still the same or are you staying off the desserts for now?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: No, I still do it.  It's tricky, because I have to stay in the house and it has to have equipment.  Here I'm in a hotel, and it's just, for some tournaments, I'd rather stay in hotel and others house.  I know in Wimbledon I will go to the same house.  I know the kitchen, and I know that the owner, the woman loves to bake, so I have everything I need for muffin, cakes, and stuff.  It's just how we spend, basically, our time.
Q. I like cooking.  When I cook, I just imagine to have a TV program about it.  Have you ever thought of maybe having Cooking with GarbiÃ±e or Baking with GarbiÃ±e?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: No, no.  I do this for fun.  No, my mom loves to cook and I just do it, because that was a way of sharing time with her.  That's it.  But it would be terrible.
Q. I have to ask after that, how much do you enjoy bagels and how much do you enjoy double bagels, on and off the court, 6-Love and 6-Love?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: I don't know.  What's the question?  If I like to win 6-Love?
Q. Yeah.
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Yeah, I think it's very hard.  I don't remember when I won 6-Love, 6-Love.  I think maybe never.  But it's already difficult to win 6-Love.  Except Rafa.  He's just having no problem (smiling).
THE MODERATOR: Questions in Spanish.
Q. I suppose you're satisfied after winning this match.  She's a bit erratic, I think, unpredictable.  What would you say?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: I'm very happy with this win irrespective or regardless of the opponent.  It's true that her game is more or less like that I had during the first round, that is, Schiavone.  With good physical condition, I knew I had to be on top of the game.  I had to dictate the game, which is what I succeeded in doing.
Q. You have played three different matches, of course, here, but how would you say you manage pressure?  Do you feel some type of pressure?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: I think that these three matches were quite different.  In any case, there is always pressure during a Grand Slam.
You know that what you're thinking about is moving deeper and deeper.  The first match is the match when I was very nervous.  It was the beginning of the tournament.  But then after this, you have to remain focused and pressure is always something that you'll feel.
But for the time being, I'm trying to focus on the match to come.  I know that everybody says this, but it's true.  This is truly what one has to do.  I should think about my preparation before the next match.
Q. You're talking about your style, your game, your tennis and how you want to be aggressive.  Would you say that 99% of the matches are based on your game, how you play, and your racquet?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Some opponents play more or less my style or my game, but it's the tennis I like, my best tennis.  It's what I have to do to win.  I can't really change my style now.  If I'm against the top players, I must stick to my game, be aggressive, dictate, and survive.
What I want is to play my type of tennis always.
Q. How do you feel physically?  What about your neck and the pain in your neck?  Does that hurt?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: No.  I feel good.  I have played three difficult matches.  And apart from the slight strain and pressure, I feel good.  I have no more pain in my neck.
Q. I think you said that you're perhaps a bit shocked by the way you win.  Is this going to continue like this till the end?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Yes, it's going to continue like this.
Q. Now, you were telling us about your aggressive game and other opponents who are aggressive, as well.  Would you say that you're more aggressive than anybody else?  You had 27 winners.
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: I had played against her before.  I knew she's more of a defensive player.  So I thought if she's going to be defensive, I'm going to be more aggressive.  I didn't have the impression she would be too aggressive compared to Kontaveit.  And therefore, I thought her game would be more defensive.  I would have more time, more time to serve well.
And this was exactly my idea, to shorten the match as much as I could.
Q. A year ago people talked about Venezuela.  Are you worried about the situation in the country, or do you still have contacts with the country?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, it's a difficult topic.  I feel as concerned as I was.  Of course, I discuss with my brother, my family who have stayed in the country, and they tend to tell me negative things.  I live a different type of reality.  The only thing I can do is live my life, ask questions, ask them how they are from here.  From Europe there is not much I can do to change the situation in the country.
Q. I don't know if you know that Goffin was injured.  He more or less twisted his ankle in the tarp.  I think your opponent got angry at a moment in time on the court because there was a flier or an ad on the court, that is, objects on the court that made her moves difficult.
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Four years ago, I think, I hurt my ankle on the court with a tarp, as well.  I was trying to catch a lob, and my ankle was caught under the tarp.
I saw the video.  It's the same that happened to Goffin.  On center court there is a lot of room, so it is quite unfortunate.  But maybe the tarp should be more to the side.
Q. Can you tell us more about the next opponent, Mladenovic or Shelby?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, I played quarterfinals last year against Shelby.  It was really difficult.  I remember that.  I think she plays well.  She's playing well against Mladenovic.  Sometimes I have practiced with her.  She's American.  She has big shots.
Mladenovic this year is very talented.  Her confidence has gone up.  She's had quite a lot of wins.  She is also at home.  So who knows?  Maybe, you know, playing at home is a double-edged sword.
But as far as these two players are concerned, I'll try in any case to dictate the game and play my game.
