G. MUGURUZA/E. Makarova   
6-1, 6-0   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Do you think you can rate this one as one of the most perfect performances of your career?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, I don't know that, but for sure it was a great match.  I'm thinking everything I tried, everything I did was working.   
I think, for sure, it's one of the best matches of the year because, you know, everything you try goes well.   
 Q.  Big picture about women's tennis at the moment.  The appearance is that Serena's dominance is sort of fading out.  Do you feel that?  Do you feel that the gap of you, yourself, to Serena is closing?  What do you need to do to close it even more?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, I think -- yeah, a little bit it's changing.  Obviously I think it's normal.  At some point other players are going to get closer to that spot there.   
I think it's just a matter of time, honestly.  There is a lot of players out there fighting for it, and Serena eventually is going to, you know, go a little bit down because she's like forever there.   
So we'll see.   
 Q.  How far are you from that spot?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, I think I have to already -- I think I have a lot of space already.  I think I need to improve so many stuff to be there, but, well, I'm trying.  I think I can make it.   
 Q.  Do you think you can be one of the favorites of this tournament?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, maybe on the paper, yes, but after, you got to play and win every match to be the favorite, so I guess is an option.  So we'll see.
