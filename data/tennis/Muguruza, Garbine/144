G. MUGURUZA/M. Erakovic   
7-5, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Can you just talk about that match a little bit and whether or not there is any additional concern with the injury and stuff like that.  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, I think it was a weird match.  I felt, you know, a little bit nervous at the beginning.  I think she was playing great.   
I was happy to win the first set, and then I just felt a little bit uncomfortable.  I just thought, take some precaution of what happened in Brisbane and the next days.  I took a medical timeout and became a little bit unfocused to the court, and it took me a couple of games to get into the match again.   
It was good that I can turn it around in that second set, even though I was 4-1 down.   
 Q.  Do you feel the leg at all, like, when you play or is it more mental?  Do you feel pain throughout the match, or is it just, you know, being paranoid about it?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: I think it's kind of both.  I do feel it a little bit.  It's nothing really to worry -- just more mental, because I was nervous, too.   
The match was equal, pretty equal.  It was just more like precaution, I think.   
 Q.  Was there an incident in the first set where you felt it more?  Looked to be going really well, and then a bit shaky.  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: No, there was not like a specific moment where I felt it, honestly.   
 Q.  How relieved are you just to get your tournament underway?  There is a lot of stuff you have to do before a tournament that can be a bit busy, but ideally once the tournament starts, it's just tennis?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: It is.  I mean, with the years on the tour, you know that every time you go to these kind of tournaments, they are very important.  Obviously the first matches are tough, because you're nervous, you have to fight against the doubt of how it's gonna be, and you face sometimes players that you don't play a lot of times with them.   
It can be tricky.  So always the first rounds are very difficult.  So happy.   
 Q.  How much confidence do you take out of winning such a tight first match to sort of build the momentum?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: I think this match was definitely like more mental in certain situations of the match, so I'm pretty pleased, because even though I had a set point against in the first set and then I was 4-1 down, so I had to really forget about that and try to bring the best I had there.   
 Q.  A question about your dress.  How much input do you have with -- obviously Stella designs them, but do you have any input at all, or does it come to you in a box and you put it on?  What's your interaction there?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, I don't really have any, like, opinion in the design.  I do have a little bit on the feedback and how it's going to fit and what we can do better.   
But I think she's pretty good (smiling) to listen my little voice, like, ya, ya, ya, so it's good.
