THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Pretty crazy 24 hours for you.  How did you get the job done in the end?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Yeah, very crazy honestly.  I think I had a second chance probably with the rain and stuff.   
It was a very -- it had everything in the match.  She started playing well the first set yesterday and I think my game was not exactly how I wanted to be of I was missing by a little and then she was not missing at all.   
Then I just forgot about it.  I woke up today and said, Hey, this is not over.  Went to the court, I fight, and I got it again.   
 Q.  Did you know it was going to rain at any point last night, and what was going through you mind when you did get the call and you would be coming back again tomorrow?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, when I knew, it was just, Okay.  So tomorrow is another day.  I am going to figure it out what can I improve.  Even though it was very, very difficult the conditions and the match as well today, I don't know, I found a way.   
 Q.  Next match against Zhang Shuai.  What are your thoughts going into that one?  Played her a few weeks ago.  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Yeah, I remember we played, and it was also very tough conditions and she played very well.  I look forward for that.  I think it's going to be a tight match.  Hopefully I can have the revenge this time.   
 Q.  What's going through your mind in terms of like the physical aspect?  In know in Australia there were maybe some mental blocks about feeling 100% healthy on the court.  How are you feeling right now?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I would say not still there, but that's what I have to deal with.  You're never really 100%.  I know once I'm in Miami, hopefully in the final, I don't know, I'm going to have some days to rest.   
So hopefully I can recover more there.
