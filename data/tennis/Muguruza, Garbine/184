THE MODERATOR: Questions for Garbine Muguruza, please.   
 Q.  What didn't work for you today?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, I think just Andrea did a very solid match.  I think I fight through every point, every game.  But I think she was at a very high level.   
And I guess I didn't play my best also.   
 Q.  Why?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I don't really know.  I think Andrea played really good against me.  She was doing great shots, really working on my serve -- I'm sorry, my return.   
I don't know.  I just didn't find my game.
