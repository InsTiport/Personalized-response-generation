S. HSIEH/G. Muguruza   
7-6, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  A tough match today.  She's obviously a very tricky opponent.  What was tough about you getting into this match today?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Yeah, she's definitely a very tricky opponent, and even more if she plays well.  I think today she played well.   
I maybe could have done things better, but at the end, she deserves to win.  That's really it.   
 Q.  You had a bit of treatment on your foot?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Yeah.   
 Q.  Is it blisters that you have?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Yeah, it's blisters at the end.  I think the surface of the court, I don't know how much heat, it's terrible, very, very hot, and it's easy to get blister and red.   
 Q.  When did they start?  Obviously your foot was already wrapped.  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Yeah, it was already wrapped, but very quick I start to feel a blister was coming, and I rather prevent than having the problem after, and just cover it a little bit more.   
 Q.  Are they the worse conditions you have seen in Australia?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: No, no, I had a more toughest match under the heat previous years in Australian Open, but today was -- it was hot, but I don't think was the hottest day.   
 Q.  How much was your foot affecting you, your movement around the court?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Good.  Yeah, I don't think that was the reason why today it didn't go my way.   
 Q.  Obviously you had a pretty miserable tour with different issues with your body.  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Yeah, I was wrapped and with a lot of taping, but, you know, just to try to make it better.   
I was pretty happy, because I didn't run a lot today, I didn't really felt it.  It was getting to the process of really recovering.  That's it.   
 Q.  Various physical issues you have had in this first month of the year.  Would you like to re-evaluate what you're doing with your physio work or anything like that?  I'm sure you're not happy with the amount of different sort of things that have come up with these consecutive tournaments.  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Yeah, for sure.  I think there is something that we have to do better to be able to start the year in a better way, but for now, I will talk with them, see what's going on.  But I felt today much better, so that's the good news.  Yeah, we will see what we can do.   
 Q.  Where do you go from here?  What's your schedule for February?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, my schedule is going to be play Doha and Dubai.  And I have a good break now to recover, train hard, and get excited for the next swing.   
 Q.  Are you going back to California or where will you be going?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: No, I think I'm going to go to Europe and Switzerland, and I think it's good to rest after -- I have been training a while and training and try to do recover at the same time so that's a little bit tougher for the body.  I think I will take some days off and just go back.   
 Q.  Do you need a bit more time for your abductor muscle that you hurt in Sydney?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Yes, it's going to be better if I don't play and I completely rest.  The issue is recover and play, but I think with some good days now, we will get better.
