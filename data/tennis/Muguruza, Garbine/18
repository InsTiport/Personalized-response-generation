  D. COLLINS/G. Muguruza
 7-5, 2-6, 6-4
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. I'd like to know if you are surprised or not that there are 11 outsiders in the last 16, which is a lot if you consider that there are 32 seeds.  I mean, 11 is a lot.  Do you think is just because is a different tournament, because of the conditions, because of the depth of the women's tennis?  What is your answer?
 GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I think this tournament is very equal, because the circumstances are not easy to play.  I feel like there is a lot of people, a lot of women playing a very high level.
 You can go out any round.  It's about details.  I think the medium level is very high.  I'm seeing players that, you know, some of them never seen before playing incredible level and being in quarterfinals and in round of 16.  Yeah, this is, the level is very high.
 Q. Djokovic said today that he thinks that there should be either the Hawk-Eye or at least no more, with the technological progress, there is no need anymore of linesmen.  He says, Oh, we have seen in US Open it was fine and so on.  What do you think about this?
 GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I don't think.  I mean, these questions, I never really think about this.  I mean, I think it's great there is people.  They can also have a Hawk-Eye, you know, in clay court.  That solves everything.  But I feel it's pretty traditional, and I'm a traditional person.  I enjoy having, you know, line umpires and chair umpire.  And just I like things old way.
 You can put a Hawk-Eye and make it more modern, but I appreciate being not a machine on the court, even more lonely out there just with us.  A speaker that says in or out.
