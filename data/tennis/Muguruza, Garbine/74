G. MUGURUZA/S. Cirstea
6-0, 6-4
Q. Garbine, how did you find that match?  A little bit complicated closing it out but otherwise it seemed like the level was there for you.
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Yeah.  I felt much better today.  I felt much better today than the other day, and definitely in the first set I played good.  She also missed quite some shots that maybe she didn't miss in the second set.  And then I also, you know, it was more equal the second set, and especially at the end.  You know, it's always tough when you have to close it out and the other opponent is playing good and relaxed and it's always tricky there.  But I'm very happy with the performance.  I'm looking to play as many matches as I can.  So it's good.
Q. And you called Conchita down at, what, 5-4 I think in the second set.  I don't speak Spanish.  So what did she say to you?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: It's so great now that it's in Spanish.
Q. I know you're much more relieved that we can't understand.
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Exactly.  No.  You know, it was a good moment, and the other player was playing good, and I figured out that I might -- might be good for me to hear some things, maybe to change my mind or just -- you know, didn't really change anything, but that's why these are on-court coaching for those moments to have the maximum help.  And I think it was a good idea.
Q. And just in terms of -- I mean are you ever going to lose a match working with Conchita again?  I mean it seems like it's working out pretty well so far.
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, yeah, it's working out because, you know, as I said before, we have a great relation, and I know it's working.  I'm sure I'm going to eventually have a match that's not going to go my way.  But so far I'm not thinking about that.  I'm happy that I feel much better also physically.  I think that's the most important.
Q. And during this week with -- is Sam joining the team next week in Dubai?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Yeah.  He's coming to Dubai.
Q. So is it just like daily conversations with him as well?  It's wherever he is to kind of talk through what's going on?  How does the team kind of work now?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, yeah, of course.  Sam, we are every day in contact.  We talk every day about how I'm feeling and the matches and stuff.  He's my coach.  So the fact that he's not here doesn't mean that we don't talk.  Actually, he's going to be very soon in Dubai, and it's going to be good to have the full team.
