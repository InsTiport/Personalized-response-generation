THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
   
 Q. Congratulations on the first debut. Very successful. Did you kind of run out of some steam there tonight?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Some steam?   
   
 Q. Like energy.   
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I don't understand.   
   
 Q. Energy. Did you feel tired?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Oh, yeah. I felt was so hard. I was obviously tired from yesterday from Kvitova, but I think was very tough match.  
Well, I think Aga played very good today. You know, I am just a little bit disappointed obviously to lose. I think was like two or three points the key.   
But I'm happy. I did an amazing effort and I'm proud of how I played here all the matches.   
   
 Q. After the fighting back in the first set and again in the tiebreak, do you think that took too much out of you? Your level seemed to, like your energy level, seemed it dip a bit. Talk about that.   
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Yeah, I think in the first set like I kind of give it all, and then it was hard for me to start the second one.   
But, well, I just wanted to give everything I had, and doesn't matter how long I was going to be able to keep it. I just went out there, and if I die on the court, I die, but at least I go out from there happy.  
   
 Q. What does the last four, five weeks mean to you now that your season is kind of over in singles?   
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, I think it's great. I'm very happy with this month. I think it's proof that ‑‑ you know, after the US Open I felt a little bit down, but I just clear my mind and I came here, and you know, I'm going to do everything I have.  
I'm super happy the way I played. I think it's amazing: Tokyo, Wuhan, Beijing, and here and be able to keep the level and go out there and just have amazing matches.  
Yeah, it's great.   
   
 Q. Do you still have some energy for the double?   
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Yeah, I have. I think one thing is obviously disappointed of the singles and I lost recently, but I think the doubles with Carla, you know, it's worth it to go there and give what is left.  
I am really motivated. It's actually amazing to be in semifinals in doubles, so I have to be really, you know, into it. And I will be for sure.   
   
 Q. You know that in the men's tennis we have been talking a lot of the Fab 4. You know, Federer, Nadal, Murray, and Djokovic. I forgot the No. 1. Not important. Now you're No. 4. Have you thought the possibility next year, Serena, Halep, Sharapova and Muguruza could be the Fab 4? Is that a possibility or not?   
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I have no idea, but, well, it sounds good, huh? Sounds good. Hopefully we keep this four all the year.  
I don't know. I have no idea. In men's it's like stuck there. In women's maybe someday my ankle can be‑‑ you know, it's crazy.   
   
 Q. What did you learn about yourself this year?   
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I learn that I'm able to, in the bad situations, you know, to calm down, and like said before, clear my mind and start from zero. I learn that I'm more strong than I thought in these moments.  
This year is going to be a great experience for me. Hopefully can help me next year, especially in the tough moments that I've lived this year, to go through.   
Yeah, all the matches that I play, all the emotions, you know, just it's not going to be new maybe for next year.   
That's it.   
   
 Q. Do you go straight to the practice courts to work for 2016 or take a vacation? Is a vacation for you just going home? Do you have any style vacation you like?   
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Yeah, well, I was waiting to finish Singapore and think about it, but for sure I will take some vacation.  
Obviously I'm going to go home also but I don't know what I'm going to go do exactly. For sure I want to do something that's is going to forget about tennis for a while and put my batteries on again, and that's it.
