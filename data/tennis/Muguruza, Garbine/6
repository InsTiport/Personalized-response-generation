 W/O
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Obviously with the news of Victoria Azarenka pulling out of the tournament, that means you're now through to the final in Doha.  Can you just give me your thoughts on that?
 GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Well, just surprised.  You know, it's not the classic way to reach the final, but, you know, at the end of the day, you know, I'm in the final, so it's a good sign that I'm in this position.
 Just wishing her to recover.  I saw yesterday that she might be struggling.  You know, I hope she recovers.
 Q. You mentioned yesterday as well about that is what tennis is like, you have a match each day, there is not much time for recovery.  In a sense, how grateful are you for this extra recovery time heading into a big final?
 GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I mean, I think it's good for my body after a few good matches to have a day off and just try to prepare for the last match.  You know, I'll take that as a positive thing and just start thinking about tomorrow's match.
 Q. You've got two potential opponents obviously for the final.  They are currently on court.  The first is Jessica Pegula, off probably the best stretch of her career so far in Australia.  What are your thoughts on facing her?
 GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I think she's playing great.  I think she's right now full of confidence and she's showing it here, as well.  She's in the semifinal.
 So, I mean, it's a little bit unknown for me, but I think it would be an exciting match.
 Q. And the other is a player you know a lot about, Petra Kvitova.  What are your thoughts on that?
 GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I think it's going to be a tough match.  We played here in another final three years ago, so just looking forward for playing that match and hopefully getting the trophy.
