7-5, 6-7, 7-5
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Where would you rank that?  That was quite the battle for you, not only coming back but doing so that way in that third set.
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: It was a battle.  When I saw I was playing Stosur in the first round, I said, Well, I have a tough match here.
And I think she played -- I think she played very well today.  She served like a beast.  (Smiling.)  My (indiscernible) period was at the maximum level, and I said to myself, I'm going to give everything I have.  It took three hours for that battle to see what happens in the end.
Q. When Sam came on the court, what did he say to you?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: He was telling me just to adjust a few things on the court and just try to stay there in the match.  He told me that we both were playing good, and it was just, like, one serve or one double fault or one thing that was going to make the difference.
So nothing really special.
Q. She's very popular here.  You probably felt that with the crowd.
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Yeah.
Q. You have played Fed Cup, so you're used to that kind of stuff, but is it hard or easy to block that support out?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: I love to play in a centre court with this environment.  Hopefully it's with me.  Today it was with Sam.
But I think it's fine.  She must feel, you know, very good out there when all the crowd -- sometimes you can be nervous, because it happens to me when I play in front of my crowd.  I'm, like, shaking, so it's very good environment.
Q. What were you most pleased with today?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: I was very pleased with my game, in general, my mental part.  I think I stayed the whole match at the same level mentally, not getting very frustrated, because it was very tense.
So I'm pleased with that.
Q. In the third set you're down in the scoreline.  You know, what are you trying to tell yourself?  She was playing very well.
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Yes.
Q. You were able to get your game and your rhythm back.  What were you telling yourself to try and get yourself, you know, pumped up?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: I was telling myself, You will have your opportunity.  Doesn't matter if she's winning or she has a break and she's playing very good.
I thought, look, I'm going to have my opportunity if I keep at least fighting.  I'm not going to drop my spirit, now that it's in the third set.  I was just, you know, looking for my opportunity, basically.
Q. When you got that break, it certainly seemed to obviously give you confidence but she was a little bit rattled.  Did you feel very confident that you would take that momentum through?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: In the third set?
Q. Yeah.
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, I suffered during the whole third set, because she did the break in the first game.  I'm, like -- I was very happy when I got back to break and I said, Okay, this is my chance here.  And I don't want to let it go.
So I was just trying to put the ball inside with, I don't know, whatever.
Q. The first match of any tournament is always very nerve-wracking for any player, but even more so when it's the first match of your entire season.  How much different, you know, do the shoulders feel, as you sit there now, than maybe four hours ago before the match?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, in this tournament -- in this match, I wasn't nervous, really.  It's rare, because I'm very nervous all the time, and I, you know, I want to do it so good that sometimes it goes in the wrong way.
But today I was like, I'm not nervous.  I worked during one month very hard, and I'm, like, I'm ready to play.  And I have Stosur in front, and it's going to be a good test to see how was my preseason, how was my level?  And we got the battle.  (Smiling.)
