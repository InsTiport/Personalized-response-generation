  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. How are you feeling physically?  At the end in Rome you were a bit tired.
 GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Yeah, so it hasn't been that long since I finished in Rome.  So just a little of both, trying to work and trying to recover at the same time, which is tricky before a Grand Slam.
 Definitely happy with my run in Rome.  Just getting ready for the French.
 Q. You said in Rome you love sun.  It's not very sunny here.  How does that affect your game, how different this is compared to normal?
 GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I mean, I'm not surprised because also in April I think, when the tournament's normally happen, can be like this also.  I played many years where the tournament was a little bit rainy and gray.  I went well, good.  I'm not too concerned about the weather.
 I know it's going to be tricky.  But I'm excited to be here.  I look at it in a positive way, the fact that they can still make another Grand Slam happening.  I don't really care the weather or the month.  I'm just happy to be here competing.
 Q. You obviously had a great year so far.  How different do you feel now in general compared to a few years ago?  How have you changed in this period?
 GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I think, like everyone, the more experience you have, the more you know how to handle yourself.  Definitely this year it's better than previous years.
 But I don't feel like I've changed.  Just a little bit learning what didn't work, what's working now.  So I think I'm in a good place right now.  Just trying to stretch as much as I can the good tennis.
