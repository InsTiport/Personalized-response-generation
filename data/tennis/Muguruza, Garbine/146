A. CORNET/G. Muguruza   
4-1 [Ret.]   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Do you or the trainer know whether that injury is going to stop you from playing the Australian Open yet?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: No, it will not stop me.  I just felt, like, a little bit exhausted on the court, and I have been dealing, you know, with tiredness and issues with all these hard matches I have been playing, and today I was far from 100%.   
I went out there, I tried, but, you know, Cornet was playing good.  I couldn't match her level today.  I had some pains, and I thought it was more, you know, smart to take care of I my body, especially being the first week of the year.   
 Q.  An injury or exhaustion?  What's the reason?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Yes, I feel a little bit of pain on my abductor and a little bit of fatigue, obviously, with the matches I have been playing.   
 Q.  Is there a sense of disappointment from today, or are you kind of, like, happy with how you performed thus far?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, there is both sides.  Obviously a little bit, you know, sad, because I was very much motivated to be in semifinals and to be able to, you know, maybe reach the final.   
But I'm also very happy the way I played the three matches before.  I'm going to take that, for sure.  Not this match, at all, because I think all of the matches I played here were amazing.   
 Q.  What's the big thing that you learned, like, kind of your takeaway for the week?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, I think that fighting until the last moment and having the right attitude, even though sometimes you feel the match, not sure if it's gonna go your way or not, always have the payoff.   
So I'm going to take with that and that I feel good, in general, with my tennis.
