G. MUGURUZA/E. Kulichkova
6-3, 3-6, 6-4
Q. Congratulations on the win.  How does it feel to get through a match like that?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, there's a lot of reasons.  It's my first match on grass, my first being in actually Birmingham singles.  And it is also tough because the other girl was very, very aggressive, I think extremely aggressive.  And she played three matches in the qualis.  And I felt that, especially in her confidence and the way she was hitting the ball and moving.  And I kind of have to go out there and figure it out a little bit.  But I'm happy that I won the match, even though it was very -- I didn't know who was going to win like almost until the last moment.
Q. Most of the match you were in control.  Was it difficult to kind of adjust with an opponent that takes so much risk?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Yeah, it's always difficult to play somebody that hits two shots and you have like no option.  But I always try to impose my game.  And in grass I think it's difficult because everybody tries to do that, and you don't have a lot of time.  And I think we just go out there and everybody does what they can.
Q. It's nice to see you looking a little happier than when I last saw you.  Just talk a little bit about the adjustment for you as well because all the pretournament you said that you disconnected completely.  How easy has it been to sort of plug -- or how much time did you take off?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, it hasn't been easy, especially the next few days, because I don't know, you always go very kind of happy and to play a Grand Slam, and once it doesn't end the way you want it, you need a few days to recover.  But I did.  I took maybe, I don't know, four, five days or something like that.  And then I start fresh.  You know, I turned the page.  I said finish clay court, start the grass, which I had actually good results in the past.  And I look forward for it to just keep going with the year.
Q. And how much confidence does it give you knowing that you have performed well on grass, you have made your first semifinals on grass?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Yeah.  Well, not a lot honestly because every year I go out there and I'm like how did I play that well last year.  I don't know, I just go out there and try to do my best.  Fight.  And that's it.  Good spirit, I guess, especially when the points are very short and -- that's it.
Q. Did your opponent, her attacking style or risk-taking style, did that remind you of yourself at all?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: No.  I think I'm an aggressive player, but I try to play tennis.  You know, there is a game to play.  It's not just hit the ball and go to the flack or to the -- you know, I try to -- there is a lot of shots.  And I don't know.
Q. A bit more structure to it.
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Yeah, I guess.  Not that straightforward.  Yeah.
Q. Is it the variety that you enjoy in your game?  Does it frustrate you if you don't get that variety back?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: No, it doesn't frustrate me because almost in every tournament I've played this type of player.  But you know, I just grew up playing on clay court, so a lot of strategy, defense, you know, attacking.  But with the years I've been more aggressive and aggressive.  But I like.  I like to play.  You know, it means more shots.  I don't know.  Thinking a little bit also.
