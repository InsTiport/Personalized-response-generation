C. WOZNIACKI/G. Muguruza
7-6, (ret.)
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Did you have any inclination of feeling ill this morning, or did everything happen on the court today?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: No, this morning I felt normal.  I went to the warmup and I -- no, didn't feel like I felt during the match.
Q. (No microphone.)
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, I started normal and then I think like 3-All or something like this I started to feel headache and my stomach, pain in my stomach.
Then kind of went more and more during the match.  When I was getting to the 5-4, something like this, I started to feel a little bit dizzy.  I think was like a kind of heat, the heat effect me like suddenly like that.
Q. Maybe something you ate?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: No, I don't think it's something I ate.  Honestly I take very carefully what I ate and nothing out of normal.
Q. We want to thank you for being here.  How are you feeling?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: A little bit sad now because I'm not feeling very well because I fighted so hard for those two first rounds.
Disappointing to be out of the tournament not feeling well and playing good.  Honestly, I felt I was playing good.  I had a very good level.  I felt good in the match, but not physically well.
Q. Have you felt like this on court before, this sort of sickness?  Is this familiar to you at all?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Yeah, I kind of felt something similar in the US Open last year in the first round; in Australia I felt it sometimes.
But, yeah, it's not the first time.
Q. Feels like some bad luck this year with some injuries and illness.  Do you feel like there is anything you can do to prevent going forward, or is it just bad luck?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: No, I think I'm doing -- for sure I can improve something, I'm sure.  But I think have to figure it out honestly, because I felt it couple of times already.
But also in these conditions it's very hard to feel fresh and 100%?
Q. Are you going to take a few days off to rest in Miami?  What are your plans now?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, for sure take some days off.  I've been struggling a lot with my ankle still.  I felt it today on the court as well.  I think it's needed to rest.  I think my body is asking me to do that.
