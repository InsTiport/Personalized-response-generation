G. MUGURUZA/T. Zidansek
7-5, 4-6, 8-6
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. What do you think made the difference out there in the end?
GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Yeah, definitely was very difficult first round.  I think just a little bit of everything.  Probably staying calm.  I know she was playing amazing tennis since the first set, so I just knew that just have to wait for my opportunities.
So I was just trying to stay calm until I saw the chance, and then, yeah, I went for it.
Q. I know you like to win in straight sets, really simple.  Do you feel a match like this can help you further down the line, that you're kind of match tough?
GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Well, luckily I had good matches in Rome the week before.  Yeah, it's a good win.  In the end, you're out there and it was a tough battle and you manage to get the win, so it feels great.
Definitely a challenge physically with the conditions and such a long match.  But, yeah, I'm happy.  It's always tough the first rounds.
Q. A few of the players are saying that the top 100 is getting better and better.  How much is that making it harder in the opening slam rounds, like the competition is going up and up?
GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Yeah, definitely the level has increased.  Now everyone is more fit and prepared, and physically it's a huge difference compared to probably another decade ago.
You know, it's always like little details at the end between the great players and the good players.  Especially in first rounds, you can always have surprises.  You can always, you know, not feel great.  Then your opponent, you know what?  She's playing great and she wants it as much as you, and you're out.
It's really there is no more a relaxing match or a feeling that you have it under control, because it's really, really the level, it's very similar.
