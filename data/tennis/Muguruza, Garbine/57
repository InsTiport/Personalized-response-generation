6-7, 6-2, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  That looked like a really big win for you.  Talk through how you were able to turn that match around after the disappointment of not getting through that first set.  And what was the most difficult aspect of today's match for you?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I think it was very a good match because we were both playing good tennis.  Yeah, it was tough to lose the first set.  I was losing 4-1, and I managed to come back and be right behind her.  In the end, I didn't play really well, the tiebreak, which was important.  So I was little frustrated there of course.   
I think I did a good job of trying to deal with that frustration and turn it into something positive to be able to start the second set better, and, you know, not making the same mistakes as in the first set.  Yeah, I think it was very important in the second set to feel a little better, to gain a little confidence, and then, you know, have a chance to play the third set.   
But I think it was just a few points of difference.  Especially in the third set, I was coming with great shots, she was coming with better shots.  At the end, sometimes I was winning the points, sometimes she was playing just incredible.  It was a very competitive match.   
 Q.  On those match points down in the third set, right before that, I know you were frustrated, but how did you channel your frustration into those last 20 minutes of the match coming back from a break down and saving those match points?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: You know, I didn't really care that they were match points.  I was just going for the point, going for the shot.  It was risky, but I thought I'm leaving this match with no regrets.  I'm going to go for it, otherwise I'm going to lose because she's playing very good.  Yeah, it's not normal to win a match having three match points against you.  So I'm very happy because it's not every day.  It means a lot for me.  I didn't play a lot of three sets this year.  I think I can take a lot from this match.   
 Q.  Speaking about the field here, obviously you've always been a player that has discussed very openly the depth on the tour.  This tournament has from 9 through 20 here.  Can you talk about how tight and competitive and the quality that you have see with this field that's here.  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I think there is less and less difference, even if it's the second Master.  I felt today I was playing one of the top players, and is, in fact, one of the top players, because I could hear in the result that she did semifinals of US Open.  I mean, the level of the match today is nothing different of what we've seen in the other Masters.  I just want to focus on this last tournament because it's very important.  I know I'm playing all the best girls of the year.  I'm expecting finals every match.
