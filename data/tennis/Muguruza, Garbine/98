B. STRYCOVA/G. Muguruza   
6-1, 2-0 (ret.)   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  I know you had a cold, so today was really tough for you?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, of course it's very tough because actually today is the first day that I come to play.  Since I'm in Beijing, I didn't play at all.   
I don't know, I got a virus in Wuhan.  It's good that I could play on Monday, I had more days to rest.  But, in fact, I couldn't perform today.   
 Q.  You must have known before trying to play it would be tough today.  Did you think about retiring before the match?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I mean, it's the easy way to think, to don't go on the court.  At the end I don't feel that.  I want to feel like giving the last chance, going on the court, just hit few balls, see how I'm going to feel, try to turn things around.  I don't want to retire before the tournament starts for me.
