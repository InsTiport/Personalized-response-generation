THE MODERATOR: Questions please.   
 Q.  Welcome to Zhuhai for your first time.  How do you feel just physically and mentally getting to the last week, last tournament of a long season?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Actually happy after a long season to be in the last tournament.  Happy that it's the last tournament after a long season.  It's also exciting because I've never been here in Zhuhai.  It's a different format.   
Yeah, I think there's plenty of reasons to be happy to be playing here and hopefully get a good win and finish the year with a good taste.   
 Q.  Obviously this year your performance has been hampered by kind of physical problems, injuries to different parts.  You're going to finish the year for the first time I think out of top ten at 14.  How do you maintain your desire and burning inside, keep trying even though you have struggled physically in many tournaments?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, I knew at some point that some ups and downs were going to come, especially with the body, or just it's very difficult to keep for a lot of years the same high level.  It's kind of tricky for everybody.   
I'm just trying to keep the enthusiasm.  I feel I'm a very competitive person, so even though there is tough moments or you feel injured sometimes, I know that the hard work will pay eventually.   
So I'm just going through and trying to improve so I can be better in the next season.
