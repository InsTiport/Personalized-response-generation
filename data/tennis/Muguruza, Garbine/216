      6‑2, 6‑4

    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please. 

Q.   Kristina, when she beat Li Na, she said the match after is a little bit tough.   How tough was it for you to get back on the court after beating Serena Williams?
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Well, today was a very difficult match, after beating Serena and all this emotion, to play on center court and in front of so many people.   It was mentally very hard and difficult to handle, but I think I did it very good.

Q.   What made it difficult mentally?   Like when you say it was difficult mentally, what does that mean?
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   It means that you're playing against Serena, I mean, is like amazing player, your idol, on a big court.   And then suddenly you realize, Oh, I have to play again.   And you're not playing on a center court, I'm playing against another young girl that I know her a lot.
    It's really difficult to handle, all this emotion, yeah.

Q.   Do you think that you're still handling it, or are you now settled for the rest of your tournament?   Because you have a nice opportunity here to make a good run. 
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I think it's all the matches are very difficult, you know, and difficult to handle in a Grand Slam, you know, fourth round, it's special.   It's tough.

Q.   Can you talk about kind of what your life has been like over the last 48 hours since beating Serena?   Take this match aside, but phone calls, interviews?   I mean, how much has life changed for you?
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Well, I went to the hotel directly, and my coach said, Don't touch the mobile.   Leave it in my room.   I said, Okay, I gave him the mobile.   I'm not going to see anything.   Just concentrate, I have another match. 
    Yeah, it's a big win, but you have to continue now because you are still in the tournament.   It was kind of funny. 

Q.   Have you heard about Gulbis' comments today about professional tennis players?   He said he hopes his two sisters won't become professional tennis players because women need to think about having kids and enjoy life.   What is your opinion about these comments?
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I didn't know that.   Well, you play tennis until you want, when you feel you want to make another things, have babies or have a family, then you can do it.   You play until you want to play, so...   That's it.

Q.   What's the sort of tennis background in your family?   Am I right in thinking your brother played a little bit on the tour?
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Yeah, I have two brothers.   They were players.   Yeah. 

Q.   Did your parents play?
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   No, no, no.   They started because they were in a club, and they said, Okay, one day we try to play tennis.   Then they started like this.   My parents don't play tennis.

Q.   Your brothers' names?
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Asier, Igor.

Q.   Is there a feeling in the locker room that the young girl is ready to take over the older players who have won a lot?   Is there a feeling, okay, our time is coming finally?
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Well, I think at some point young players will become like in the top, you know.   So I think now there are so many young players that are playing really good.   Maybe it's time for a change. 

Q.   So do you get your mobile phone back, or does your coach keep it for the rest of the tournament?   What's the deal?
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I have it now, but for sure after, he said, Give me the mobile phone like for two hours.   You can talk to your family, but no one else (laughter).

Q.   Can you just talk about potentially your next match.   I don't think we know your opponent yet.   Mentally going into that match, what do you think?
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Well, it's another difficult match.   Fourth round.   Nervous.   It's tough.   Another match to be concentrated and focused, try to do my game.   I don't know who's going to win.   I will be watching a little bit. 
    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in Spanish. 

Q.   Congratulations on your match.   There is no doubt that the results are up to what you have achieved in Australia.   From Australia to the French Open, have you made great strides?   Are you more powerful?
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I think that I am better mentally, psychologically.   In Australia I played lots of important matches.   I knew this player.   I knew how to play against her.   So I'm improving.

Q.   On the court, you like dictating play, but outside the court, do you dictate play or not?
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   No.   I like dictate play on court.   Outside the court, I'm more calm.

Q.   In life, how are you in life?
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I want to do lots of things.   I can't stay still.   I like having fun.   I like enjoying life in general.

Q.   If you get a good result with Suarez in the doubles, will this have an impact on your decision for the Fed Cup?
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I don't think so.   I don't think so. 
    Carla and myself together, we are quite good, and we will play together.

Q.   An Englishman asked you a question about your mobile phone.   But have you heard about this situation in Venezuela following your success?
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I don't know what is being said in Venezuela or in Spain.   I guess that they have talked about it, but I don't pay attention to that.   I want to remain focused on the tournament.

Q.   Are you prepared to win the tournament?   Because you are one of the favorites now. 
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I don't know.   But you have to believe in yourself.   We practice a lot, and we have dreams.   So from the bottom of my heart, I mean, I believe in my ability to win.

Q.   The president of the Tennis Venezuelan Federation has said to the government that the government should speed up things so that you continue along these lines.   I mean, two countries are vying to get you. 
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I don't think that there is a struggle between the two countries.   They haven't talked to me about it. 
    I want the two countries to show a lot of respect.

Q.   So following the win against Serena, is it true that you haven't read the newspapers, that you haven't watched the news?
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I only read the local Roland Garros newspaper.   I opened my Twitter account, and I have noticed that there were some congratulations, but I don't want to look at that too much.

Q.   You're going to play against Mona Barthel or Pauline Parmentier.   Which players you don't want to play against?
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   On paper, I don't want to play against the opponent who has the highest ranking, but I don't want to look at the draw.   I just want to concentrate on the next opponent.   So I don't watch too far with the draw, because you have too many questions, I mean, going in your mind.

Q.   You are a player who might be one of the favorites for this tournament.   Do you have some pressure?
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   No, this is positive pressure, positive motivation, so there is no pressure for me.
