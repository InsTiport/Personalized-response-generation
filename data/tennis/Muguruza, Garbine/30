6-1, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: First question?   
 Q.  Nice performance today. How different did it feel, this match, compared to the one you guys had in Australia, which was much tougher. It seemed like you had a much better control of everything tonight.  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I feel like every match is different, even if we played before. I feel like the conditions are very different, it's very windy, it's at night, it's late in the day, it's another tournament.   
I don't know. I think that I managed to be smart, to put a lot of balls in the court, to get fast in the court and then just keep playing the same way.   
 Q.  What are you particularly pleased with so far in how you're playing this week in Doha?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, in these couple of matches, both very different, but I was all the time focused, no matter if it's one hour or three. So I'm happy about that because every match is different and sometimes it gets tough here with the wind, so you got to really stay focused.   
 Q.  Your next match you have Yastremska?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Yes.   
 Q.  Yes. Sorry. And can you talk through that match. Obviously, a big hitter, she can take rhythm away, but you have the power to combat that.  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Yeah, she's a big hitter, we played before as well, tough matches. Well, it's going to be probably shorter points, but I'm looking forward to face her. The last time I think it was last year, so, yeah, it's going to be a good match.   
 Q.  Could you talk a little bit about how do you feel on court playing here in Doha and a few words regarding the tournament, please.  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, I feel good. It's a very important tournament for us. I did play well here, I lost in the final I think two years ago, so I feel like my game can be good here. And just starting another year and getting matches and more matches.   
 Q.  I know you're not a big fan of football.  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Yeah.   
 Q.  Either of football -- it's 1,000 days to go for the World Cup Qatar 2022. Do you have some words for the next World Cup here in Qatar and your wishes for the Spain team coming here?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Of course, that's for sure, of course I want Spain to win.   
Well, it's a big construction I'm seeing I think over there. They have a lot of stuff to do. I think it's brand new, it's going to be fun, I think it's going to give Qatar a lot of exposure and a big hit for here. So, yeah, it's a great challenge to make probably one of the best World Cups.   
 Q.  And Spain?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Yeah, well -- Spain?   
 Q.  The national team. Do you believe you still have such great players?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: We have -- yeah (laughing) it's hard for me to follow sometimes, but also I'm a little -- yeah.   
 Q.  Obviously Carla bowed out earlier today from her last appearance here in Doha. I know you guys are tight, but can you talk a little bit and give, I guess, fans insight into kind of who she is as both a friend and a person and a competitor and how much the locker room, I suppose, will miss her?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, you know what, I'm very sad that she's playing for the last year. She's one of the nicest players on tour. She's sometimes I think too nice (laughing) to compete, you know?   
But over the years we have become more friends, like better friends and playing doubles together and living these moments of the Masters and the Grand Slams and just sharing many things that you don't share with other players.   
Yeah, I'm definitely sad she is leaving. And she has so much talent, but I was watching a little bit tonight and she had a tough match, but, yeah, she's going to move on and, yeah, she's going to have a good life.
