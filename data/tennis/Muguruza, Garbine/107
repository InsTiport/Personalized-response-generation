G. MUGURUZA/C. Vandeweghe
4-6, 6-4, ret.
Q. I'm sure you didn't want to win in that way, but how hard is it to concentrate on what you're doing when you can see your opponent is injured on the other side of the court?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, I knew when she felt, maybe she hurt herself or something.  Also she asked for physio before.  So honestly, I just tried to don't think about anything, just keep playing my game, I think was the best option, not to think that maybe the other is one injured or something or not 100 percent.  So I just tried to play my game, tried to stay aggressive, tried to be very concentrated on the serve.  And that's it.  I didn't even realize she was going to retire.  I saw her in the net.  I was like really keep fighting and keep playing.
Q. Even before CoCo was injured, it was looking like it was going to be a really close match.  It was fairly evenly forward.  Did it feel that way to you?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Yes.  Well, we're two kind of big hitters.  I think she's super powerful, and I was expecting that.  I played her two times in grass already.  And I knew her game.  I knew her ball.  So I know that it was going to be very hard, but also very -- very similar sometimes, maybe to each other's game.  You know, we go for the shot.  But I knew I was going to have my chance, hopefully.  I knew that at some point I was just going to go for it.
Q. You got either Ashleigh Barty, who you've never played before, or Camila Giorgi, who you've played twice before.  How do you approach Barty if she comes through, because you've never played her.  Will Sam look to the play?  Do you go and look and see how someone's playing?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, I played her yesterday in doubles, so that gives me an idea a little bit.  And I played her also a long, long time ago also in doubles.  I saw her play these days in matches, so probably I will watch her a little bit now.  She's just super talented.  That's what I felt in the doubles.
And Giorgi I played her already a bunch of times.  I remember I played her last year in grass, and she's Giorgi.  Yeah, she's very fast, strong and, I don't know, very aggressive.
Q. How confident do you feel on the grass compared to what you were feeling when you started on it?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, I feel that I'm doing something good because I'm winning and I'm keeping in the draw alive.  So I'm happy because I came here early to prepare, and I trained -- you know, I put hours there.  So I'm happy that it's working what our team, what we thought was going to be good for the tournament.  So, so far we are proud that it's working.
Q. How much of a thrill is it to make semifinal here and how much confidence does that give you going into Wimbledon?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, the more matches we play, the more you are ready.  Everybody knows that.  But honestly, it doesn't mean that you're going to go far in Wimbledon.  But for sure you feel like I put the hours, I played; I had the competition.  I know these steps.  So the more matches I play here, of course, the best.
Q. So you feel like your game's in a good place?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Yeah, I think so.  I felt it today.  I felt it yesterday.  I just want to keep playing this way because it's giving me good results.
