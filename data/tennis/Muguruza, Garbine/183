G. MUGURUZA/L. Safarova
      6‑3, 7‑6

    THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

Q. Well done. Congratulations. 
    GARBINE MUGURUZA: Thank you.

Q. How does it feel to be for the first time in these Finals, and start winning already first match and now be already No. 3 in the world? Something that you would've expect or something still surprising you a bit? 
    GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, to the first part, I'm very happy to be able to win today against Safarova. You're practicing a lot for Singapore, so you're waiting so much to start.
    Well, obviously to go there and play and win for the first time, it's great. So I feel now more calm, more in the tournament. 
    Well, I always had it in my mind that I could be up there, otherwise it's‑‑ I think you must have it to be motivated, to have goals.
    Well, step by step I'm trying to be there. 

Q. It seemed like your serve was working quite well today. How did you feel about that and what did you feel you did particularly well? 
    GARBINE MUGURUZA: You said the serve? 

Q. Yes. 
    GARBINE MUGURUZA: Oh. Well, yeah, I'm trying to keep the level this month every day, you know. I think I played a good match. I remember the last match I played against her. It was tough for me because I lost. I really wanted to go out of the court and, well, try to win today.
    So pretty happy the way I played with all the circumstances. 

Q. You just mentioned the match at the French Open. How different is your mindset now compared to that match? What made the difference today?
    GARBINE MUGURUZA: I remember that match, and I remember Safarova played very good. She was playing amazing in that week. I was sad because I also played a good match but I lost.
    Well, I just went here and maybe she's not that ‑‑ she hasn't played for maybe couple of weeks. But I definitely played good today, so I think that helped a lot. (Smiling.)

Q. I would like to know if, okay, everyone is dreaming to become top player, No. 1, 2, 3. You probably dream of what, now? Once you get closer, you always hope more and more and more, no? So now is three already a great success? What would change in your opinion if you were 2 and not 1? Does make any small difference?
    GARBINE MUGURUZA: Yeah, well, I have no idea because I've never been 2 or 1, but I think you have to touch the ground and think, If I am three, it's for a reason. I earned that place.
    So I don't know how far I can get in the ranking, but definitely I'm trying to, you know, be there, top, and not only to arrive, to try to stay there.
    So I don't know. I just like to see that I'm doing good things. If I keep going like this, it's because I'm in the right path.

Q. Do you think that you're playing more aggressive now than you were maybe six months ago, or do you think you're more consistent in your aggressive shots? 
    GARBINE MUGURUZA: I think it's mix. I think I'm doing better choices. Try to, you know, wait for the perfect ball maybe to really attack. You have to be aggressive, but in a good way, making good choices. You can be aggressive and play three meters out.
    I'm trying to be more‑‑ I'm working a lot on in my game and concentrated, so I think just better choices. Yeah.
