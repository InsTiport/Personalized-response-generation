6-3, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You were clearly not at your best today.  Can you explain what happened on the court?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, clearly not my best, for sure.  I think today is a very bad day, you know, at the office.  I think Barbora played good, very good.  Also, I didn't play good.   
But, I don't know, I think I just couldn't find the court, my shots.  Yeah.  Didn't really find my game.   
 Q.  Does it have something to do with you physically?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, I felt with not so much energy, that's for sure.  I felt a little bit, I don't know, not moving very well.  I guess also Barbora was making me move.  She was being smart.   
Yeah, for sure, didn't feel quite good at any moment today.   
 Q.  Does it make a difference you're first up on court today playing at 11:00 in the morning?  Do you prefer playing later in the day?  Evening?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, for me, it's okay.  I mean, no problem to play first or last match.  No, I don't think that was important today.
