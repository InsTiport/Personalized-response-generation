  3‑6, 7‑6, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Congratulations on your win today.   Talk us through the match. 
GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Well, I know it was a tough match before start.   I played her two times before and I lost.   I was like, Okay, this time I want to win.   I wants to see what happens.
For me to win this match, I feel like I improve a lot.   When I play against her I really have to concentrate and do my game, because she makes me play different styles and dropshots and long balls. 
So I'm really happy I could like beat her game. 

Q.   What was the difference today? 
GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I think that I was all the match thinking that if I continue, I will have my opportunity.   I was really positive all the match.   I lost the first set.   I was not playing very good.   I said, Okay, I have to continue, because if I start to be negative I will not win for sure.
So I just said to myself, Okay, just try to do it again, and I finally won.

Q.   Did you think much about Martina Navratilova being the coach of her and this was their first match together?
GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Well, I knew that they were going to work together.   I saw her today and I was like, Okay, it's true.   She's here. 
But I really didn't realize that she was watching the match.   I know that she was there, but...

Q.   How did you find the conditions and the crowd? 
GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Really good.   There were some people there like cheering a lot, so it was kind of funny. 
But I really like it when you play these type of the matches and the crowd is like into the match also.   You feel the nervous, the second round against a top player.   It's a great moment. 

Q.   And what are you expecting for the next Grand Slam, for the Australian Open next week?
GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Nothing.   I don't expect nothing.   I just want to play the best I can.   If I do this, I know I will have good results I think.
So I'm not thinking of anything.   I just want to do what I work in the pre‑season, and hoping to win a lot of matches.

Q.   You're still a very young player.   Are you enjoying your time on the tour?   Are you excited about it? 
GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Well, it's difficult to enjoy because you're obviously like intense.   But I really like it.   I'm happy to be another year here traveling and new tournaments. 
This is the first time I'm in Sydney, so finally get to know.

Q.   How is Sydney for you?   Have you had fun here?   Have you done stuff outside of just being here?
GARBINE MUGURUZA:   No time.   I wish I could do it, but we play every day, so it's tough for me to go now and do some sightseeing. 
So, no.

Q.   That's a shame.   It's a nice city.   So what are you hoping to achieve this year generally moving forward? 
GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I hope to first not get injured, because every year I have like moments where I have pain somewhere.
Just be more constant, try to be more regular the whole year, and not to have great moments and bad moments.   Just to be more constant in all tournaments and just try to get better results from last year.

Q.   Do you know who you're playing next?
GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Yes, the winner of Kerber Gavrilova, no? 

Q.   Yes?
GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Okay. 

Q.   So your thoughts on playing either of them. 
GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I know both players.   I played against Kerber before, and Gavrilova in juniors.   Another tough match.   If they're here it's because they also earn it.
I'm just thinking about today.   I had a great match and I want to be happy.   Tomorrow we'll try to focus on another difficult match.
