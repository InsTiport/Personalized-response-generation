A. RADWANSKA/G. Muguruza
7-6, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Appreciate that it's very quick for you to come in.  What do you feel happened out there for you today for you?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Nothing really.  I think we was just playing pretty good the match, but she got the victory, so I don't really know what to take.  I think I could play a little bit better the important moments, but she was coming with amazing shots, amazing dropshots.  It was kind of difficult for me.
Q. Last year you faced her in the semifinals, and I remember you saying in the pre-tournament she just couldn't miss and you were like, Really?  Was it a little bit like that today?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I think court suits her very well.  I think it's just a tough opponent.  Everyone is a tough opponent.  Aga here, like I played last year, I felt like especially her was difficult.
Q. All the players stress how different it is to play a round robin format.  Today you were back with conditions that you had to win.  Do you think that put extra pressure?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: No, I don't really think about the round robin.  At the end you got to go and win your match and that's it.  So I'm not thinking that I have to win to qualify because I want to win anyway.
No.  The good thing is sometimes you lose and you qualify.  For the other side, I'm just thinking I want to win.
Q. When you were practicing on the court and you get here early and you're kind of hitting on it, how were you feeling on the practice court?  Were you hitting the ball well, moving well, and just kind of your opponent got the better of you in the matches, or were you feeling it a little bit in the practices as well?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: No, not really.  My warmup today was not pretty good.  I just didn't felt like other days playing better.
But in the match I felt good.  Sometimes I could warmup I don't feel like playing amazing, but then in the match I'm good.  Sometimes you warm up and you feel amazing and then you play bad.  Doesn't really have to go.
Q. Against an opponent like that who is pretty unpredictable with some of the shots she can hit, how much additional pressure does that put on you?  Do you feel a little more unsettled when you're waiting for the ball to come back because you don't know what it's going to go?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: No, not pressure.  It's so slow.  The way she plays she makes you think.  She makes you vary a lot the game, so you got to physically be more on time, run more.
But it's not pressure.
Q. Agnieszka is not playing and serving very fast.  Her balls are not very long.  What exactly is so difficult in her play?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: She's very solid.  She doesn't miss a lot.  She's everywhere in the court.  She really has a good eye, so she can read where you're going to play and she goes before you're going to hit so she is ready to hit.
Then she comes with a lot of incredible shots and she has a lot of talent.
And, well.
Q. How tough was it to lose the first set in a tiebreak so close and then have to come out in the second?  Did you feel any different?  Maybe lacking energy in the second?  What do you think happened?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: It affect me today because I was 5-4 and I was serving and I'm like, well, you have a good chance here.  And then, well, didn't play my best, she played well, so at the end she got the set.
It's like yesterday, two days ago, the match against Pliskova.  When you have a chance and you don't get it then it's very hard, because it's all about three balls.
Yeah, was a little bit sad.  After that I cannot turn the page.  You always have in the back in your mind that I had that moment.  Well.
Q. Can you give us an idea of what Sammy was saying when he came on?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: He was telling me to keep fighting, not to do anything different, because I was playing good.  I was going to the net.  I was running, fighting.
Just keep fighting basically.
Q. One of the things that Sveta said was that the difference in playing a tournament is that you go into some matches you'll be a favorite and expected to win.  In this format it's so close and you got the top eight players and there is never really a favorite.  Is that difficult to kind of get your head around in this scenario?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I don't think there was any favorite here.  Maybe the one.  But at the end everybody that's here has win a Grand Slam or final, have 20 titles, or all these kind of tennis history.
So maybe Serena is here she would be maybe the favorite because of her story.  I think everybody is very good here.
Q. How are you going to approach your next match?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: How I'm going to approach it?  It's going to be a tough match against Kuznetsova.  I been watching her.  She's playing incredible.
So another tough match.  I'm not expecting anything in particular honestly, just to run a lot.
Q. At subject ever Kuznetsova, are you amazed at how she's been able to qualify?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Yeah.  I'm actually happy for her.  I practice a lot of time with her and she's fighting a lot.  Well, I'm amazed what she's doing and she has still energy after all.
So I'm pretty shocked.
