V. WILLIAMS/G. Muguruza   
7-5, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How tough was it out there, and what do you think was the difference in the match?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: I think she played very good in important moments, and I made few mistakes that I shouldn't.   
 Q.  Did the frustration start to grow at some point towards the second set?  You had the lead only to get pegged back.  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: No, I mean, I wasn't trying to get frustrated, because I knew I wasn't playing my best tennis.  I was just trying to, no, to be calm, to, you know, not get crazy and kind of waiting for my opportunity.  And it didn't come.  In important moments, she stepped up and turned it around.   
 Q.  Do you see any reason why you couldn't play your best tennis this match and the previous one?  The surface, I don't know, the pressure, just feeling uncomfortable?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: I'm not sure.  I think, you know, some years have been very good here.  Some years didn't.  This year I start very well, and then the next matches maybe my level dropped a little bit, but, no, I don't think there is something specific, honestly.   
 Q.  Since this will be at last time that we talk to you before Melbourne, just can you take the moment -- I know that it's hard right now -- but just kind of reflect on your season a little bit and just talk about how proud you are with kind of how you were able to kind of get through some of the tough moments this year.  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: I'm very proud of this year.  It's not going to change.  I knew here that it's going to be tough, the best eight players are playing.  My year has been incredible and best so far.  I improved so many things.  That's what I'm going to take.
