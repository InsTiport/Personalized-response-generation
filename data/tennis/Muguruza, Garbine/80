G. MUGURUZA/K. Bertens
6-3, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Obviously you had an issue with your body early in the match.  Can you tell us what happened?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Yes.  Since the start I felt a little bit my abductor, and I already felt it in Brisbane, so I thought I was going to be much better but in fact came back.
Yeah, I asked for a medical timeout to try and make it better.  It worked.
Q. Had you felt it before you went on court today?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Yeah, yeah.  I have been feeling it already since Brisbane.  But it's getting better and better, and today it came back a little bit more with the match, which is the real competition, and obviously it's difficult.
Q. Is it related to the cramping you had last week?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: No, no, no, no.  It's not related.
Q. Are you worried about how it might flare up over the course of this week and maybe in Melbourne?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: What?
Q. Are you worried that it might flare up?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: What is "flare up"?  Come back?
Q. Get worse.
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Okay.  Hmm.  Um.  Well, I have my team here.  We're going to try to not get worse.  Try to play and not get worse.  It's very difficult, that, because if you keep playing obviously it gets worse.
I don't know.  Let's find a way to make it better.  And obviously I have in mind that next week there is a Grand Slam, but I have to also think in Sydney.  We'll see.
Q. You are the only seed left in the draw at the quarterfinals stage.
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Oh, okay.  I didn't know that.
Q. What's that say about the women's game at the moment?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Um, I didn't know that I was the last seeded player.  Well, I think honestly it's such a tough draw.  Doesn't matter the one who is is 3, 4 or 5, because other players can play very good and beat them.  But shows, like, the level of equality there is.
Q. Why play through, I guess, is the question a lot of people might have if you're already feeling it.  Great to get the win, but what was kind of your mentality through the first set as you were trying to manage the leg and the pain?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Hmm.  It's always difficult when you have the pain and you have to play.  It's always -- I never really get to play a tournament right before a Grand Slam.  I normally choose to, you know -- but I wanted to come to Sydney and play.
I adapt a little bit my game to the circumstances, and I'm happy that I won.  You know, that second set was tough there.  I was close.  But I'm happy to play a match and to win, of course.  That was the point to come to Sydney.
Q. So you're just not stretching out entirely into positions that would hurt the muscle?  Is that what you were doing to stop yourself from getting hurt?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, you know, you always have to adapt.  It's not the first time you do this.  Sometimes you don't need to have a pain.  You just want to do a certain style of game or some tactic.
I figured out that, you know, having a little bit more aggressive, shorter points, that might help me and might help me also for my game.  So it's like a winning situation.
Q. How does it feel to get that first win for the season?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: It feels good.  I was a little bit sad after Brisbane, because I was very close to win the match.  Well, it didn't happen.
Here, you know, it's important, like you say, the first win.  It's not the key, because I have been in situations where you have a Grand Slam and you don't play that good but you go out there and you play very good.  But it's always nice to have some kind of sense of in which state you are.
Q. From your body, how ready for your game is it at the moment?  Do you feel it's in good shape?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: I do feel it's good.  I felt it already in Brisbane in the training and the training matches that I have been doing, too.  So I'm not surprised.  I'm happy the way I felt.  Not about my fitness state, because I feel it's a little bit, surprisingly, I don't know, weird (smiling).  But my tennis is good.
Q. How do you deal with that balance?  You obviously won intense matches here getting ready for next week but not too intense to damage your prospects in Melbourne.
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: It's always difficult.  That's why a lot of players don't want to play the week before, but I think you just have to change a little bit the game style, tactic, a little bit more -- I know it sounds impossible to do it, but kind of more relaxed, as well.  I guess that's what I'm trying to do.
Q. You're playing an Australian in the next round.
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Yeah.
Q. So I guess the crowd will be on the other side?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Uh-huh.
Q. How do you feel about your matching up with either of those ladies?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Good.  I played Stosur more than Gavrilova.  I don't think we have ever played.  But it's good.  I'm going to play an Australian girl here.  It's going to be -- the point for me here was to play as many matches as I can, to, you know, just to go out there and have good opponents, and whoever is going to win is going to be a good opponent.
Q. I guess the crowd will be very into it?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Yeah.
Q. That helps to prepare for big matches where there is that atmosphere?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Yeah, I kind of like when there is a great atmosphere and the people cheer for them.  It's kind of normal.  Believe me, I learned (smiling).  Learned.
Q. Obviously you have won Wimbledon, and the grass season there is a three-week leadup before Wimbledon.  Here there is two weeks, you know, from the start of the season and then it's the Australian Open.  Does that make it that much more complicated, the slam, than others, because obviously you want to get matches to get your season underway, but then a Grand Slam right away?
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: I understand the other ones are in the middle of the season and you kind of already know in which state you are.  But honestly this is something that it has to be in your brain.  You know, you don't need -- you need sometimes to play, but you also need to be confident with yourself, with the work you're doing.
You know, there is a lot of very big players that they don't even play a tournament before, but they don't really need to, because they know that once they're going to go out there, they have it:  lose, win, whatever.  But they don't need to be five tournaments before, trying to see, you know.
Sometimes you need it; sometimes no.  But I don't know.  Depends (smiling).
