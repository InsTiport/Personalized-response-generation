  THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
   
 Q. Can you talk about the end of the match. You looked worried about the ankle. How bad is it?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, I think it was a very intense match at the end of the second. Well, I felt something during the second set and I was worried because it was bothering me a little bit.   
So I said, Okay, I'm going to see the physio to see that everything is okay.   
That's it, yeah.   
   
 Q. Is it the same foot you had a bad injury before?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: It's the other one.   
   
 Q. Talk through the sequence of events of what happened. You felt it, then you kept playing, then asked for the trainer?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Yeah, I felt it at 4 something in the second set. Then in the tiebreak I felt something stronger. So I said, No, no, I cannot wait to get worse. So I just called the trainer, yeah.  
   
 Q. Are you concerned at all about tomorrow and having to play a final tomorrow?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, I think I'll be fine. All the athletes, when you feel something, you know... We'll see tomorrow in the morning. I hope I'm going to wake up good.   
   
 Q. Aside from the injury, talk about the match a little bit. You have to be pleased with how you were able to play and eventually close it out.   
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I'm very happy. I know Kerber. We play really tough matches. I remember the last one in Wimbledon. So I knew was going to be a very physical match.   
You know, happy to be able to win in two sets because I never win against her in two sets. Very good.   
   
 Q. How do you feel about playing Venus in this final?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I think it's a good final. I face her sister in the last final, so is it good to have her again. Williams sisters everywhere (smiling).   
It's good. She's playing good also. She had a very tough match also today. So I think it's a good final.   
   
 Q. Talk about the end of the match. You were 5â€‘3 down. What did you do?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: At that moment I said, Okay, Garbine, play. Be aggressive and see what happens.   
You know, I was very, like, kind of brave. I was like, Okay, come on, let's do it. Let's see these couple of points and see if you can close the match.   
I had a lot of chances to close the match before. I'm like, No way I'm going to lose this set.   
I did it and it was good.   
   
 Q. If you hadn't won that second set, could you have played a third one? Would you have withdrawn?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, definitely I will play. I mean, even if I can walk, I would play. I mean, it's semifinals. I don't want to lose, so I'll try everything. I don't know.   
   
 Q. Was the stress or worry you had once you started to have when you felt pain in your foot, was it more because you were nervous about what the injury might be or was it the pain?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I think it's both. When you are there, it was a very stress moment when it happened, the tiebreak, match point, deuce, breakpoint. So I think everything gets a little bit more 'wow'.   
But I think it was both, yeah.  
   
 Q. Does it still hurt when you walk now?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: No, now it's better.  
   
 Q. Do you remember the first time you ever saw Venus play a match?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I saw more Serena. I saw also Venus. I played against her like twice. Well, yeah, I've seen them a lot actually.   
   
 Q. A lot of people kind of equate their games, say they play the same way. Do you see they play any differently? How is playing Venus different than playing Serena?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I think it's a little bit different now. With the time, it's getting different both. Maybe before they used to play more the same style. But with the time, everybody's getting their own way in their game.  
   
 Q. What do you identify as being different with Venus?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, I think Venus goes for sometimes shorter points, more fast than Serena. Maybe sometimes, I don't know, she wants to play faster, faster serves, first shots. Maybe Serena can be more long points. It makes different things also.   
   
 Q. When you arrived here in Wuhan after everything from the summer, did you expect a result like this from yourself, to make the final? What were your expectations?   
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, I know that the US Open Series was not good, but I practiced a lot before to the Asia. In Tokyo had good feelings. I lost that match, but I went out of the court saying, I have a good level. I was just waiting for my opportunity.   
You know, you come here in a tournament. You obviously have to think, I can be in the final, I can win, even though you don't.   
Sure, I'm happy. It's the final, so it's good.
