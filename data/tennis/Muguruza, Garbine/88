G. MUGURUZA/Y. Duan   
 Q.  So Garbine, first match here, and had to battle for it towards the end, but how would you rate your performance and can you talk through that match a little bit?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I would rate it pretty good.  It's been a while since I am not competing, and I played her actually recently in the US Open, and we had a tough match, and today was quite similar, especially at the end.  It was very interesting.  She was playing better, and took me a lot of match points, but it was just an exciting end.   
 Q.  What happened towards the end?  You seemed to be struggling to close out the match at the end.  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Yeah.  I think it was a combination.  I think she went more for her shots and she made them, and she was serving well.  And I probably did a couple of shots that I could have done better.  And then it was just a battle for her to survive and for me to finish the match.   
 Q.  Garbine, what are you looking for here, because of the way that January went, in terms of getting your season on track?  Is it getting matches?  Is it finding a certain level?  Is it feeling comfortable back on the court, get through it physically?  What do you need out of this tournament?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I'm not looking to feel comfortable in the court.  I'm just looking to compete and to have matches and to play the top girls also and just to be in the competition.  Doesn't matter the feeling or the result, but I want to feel that I'm competing and I'm healthy, and I think that's really enough.   
 Q.  You've played her a few times.  What do you like about Doha as a tournament and the city?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, yeah, I've played a few times.  And actually this year is a year where I got to do a little bit more outside.  And I think it's just so modern and new.  Every time I come here there is like 17 buildings more, and it's impressive.  I think that for us to come here, it's good because they treat us very well, and we have everything we need to play.   
 Q.  I know that you are from Spain like Nadal, but Federer has a chance to be No. 1 again this week.  Do you have any thoughts on how big an accomplishment that is at 36 to make history?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Yeah.  I think everybody wants also Roger to be No. 1.  We would love like one week is Roger, the next week is Rafa, and it's always like that, because for me those are the most players that I watch and I follow.  So we'll see.  They're going to be fighting the whole year, I guess.
