  THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
   
 Q. There were so many milestones achieved with your match today: birthday celebration, WTA Finals place. How emotional was it out there for you?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: A lot of things. I didn't even remember it was my birthday almost, because she told me yesterday. I was so concentrate during the match I really had all type of emotions. I wanted to win bad. Was tough. Was tough.   
I'm really happy. Was a great gift today, yeah.   
   
 Q. Do you think maybe that was the cause for the first set with all of those things going through your mind, maybe it was difficult to focus?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: For sure. I was a little bit frustrated because when you want something so much and you are like nervous and anxious, I mean, it was a way to calm. I know was not a good way, but is the one I found.   
Lucic also makes you play so strong, so fast, if you're not 100%, it's really hard to follow the level of the match.   
   
 Q. Talk a little bit about the racquet break, which was an epic one. It looked like it released you. You were able to play better in the second and third sets.   
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I don't like to throw the racquet. But, I don't know, I was like really frustrated because I was like, C'mon, Garbine, you can do it. My tennis was not there. Was a way to calm down, to think, Okay, start from zero.   
That's what I did. I know was not the best way, but sometimes these things happen.   
   
 Q. Can you talk about emotionally what it's been like the last three weeks from Tokyo, Wuhan to here. A lot of match play, some tight ones, some easy ones. With everything that's been on the line for the last few weeks, has it been tough to kind of control your emotions the whole time?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: It has been tough. I really was motivated to finish the year good 'cause the US Open Series was not that good. So I said, C'mon, last effort, let's do everything I can for this season.   
It's hard. I played a lot of matches â€‘ also in doubles. I think when you're playing good and you're having victories, you kind of won more and more and more. That's why it's happening. I'm pretty motivated to continue here and achieve another great result.   
   
 Q. How is your foot doing? You look like you're moving quite fine. Is it a good surprise for you?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, today I was definitely moving much better. I think with every day that it goes, it's getting better. I know if I don't stop it's not going to recover. I've been doing everything I can. Today I knew I was going to run. Kind of prepare everything. Yeah, I think it's great that it's improving.   
   
 Q. You made it to Singapore Finals. It's your first time to make it into the Singapore Finals. What are your expectations? Have you been to Singapore before?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I've been last year to Singapore in doubles. I remember I was really happy to qualify.   
My expectations? Whew. Right now I'm just very happy to be able to be one of the eight players that did the best year. I think it's one of the goals in tennis. There is bigger goals, but it's a really big one. It's a great achievement to be able to be there. I think is very special.   
   
 Q. Is this at all a relief now that this part of the qualifying process is over, and you can play a little bit more freely through the rest of the tournament, or do you still feel pressure or expectations?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I mean, it's true that it's like a big relief because we were all fighting there. To have already my place there, it's good.   
But I know also that Beijing is a mandatory tournament. It's really important for us. I'm just really motivated, like I said before, to try to finish good. It's great to be qualified. But tomorrow I have another match. It's like, What?   
I'm motivated for tomorrow, to keep this line.
