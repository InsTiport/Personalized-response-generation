6-0, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. That was a good start for the tournament.  Are you feeling confident coming in?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Yeah, was definitely a good start.  Well, you never know how it's going to go, first match always in a Grand Slam.  I'm pretty pleased of my level, and obviously that I was really concentrated during the whole match.
Q. A question about doubles.  Will you be playing more of doubles this year with the Olympics coming up?  Is this on your mind?  If so, do you have some ideas who you will be playing with?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Uh-huh.  Yeah, I'm still looking forward to play doubles.
I'm obviously going to play less tournaments this year, but for sure with Carla for the Olympics.  We are very motivated to try to go.  So we will try to prepare in some tournaments before.
Q. And what about the mixed?  Have you thought about this?  Is it possible with Nadal?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Yeah, yeah.  I thought about it.  Well, I still don't know.  Didn't have the opportunity yet to kind of sit down and see the chances.
But, yeah, I think it's going to be crazy if I play like three modalities, you know, in a week, but for sure it will be amazing.
