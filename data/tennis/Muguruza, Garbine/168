I. BEGU/G. Muguruza
5-7, 7-6, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. I wanted to ask you if in today's match the fact that other favorites have lost -- everybody thought you were going to be the favorite to win the tournaments -- if that affected you somehow?  Did you feel a lot of pressure?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: No, I think that hasn't affected me at any moment.  I haven't thought about that, that yesterday the first favorites lost.  I haven't thought about that.
It didn't go in my head that I had to win the tournament at all.
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the match?  In general seemed like you didn't feel very comfortable out there.
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I think the beginning of the match it wasn't very well.  I think I could have started better, but I managed to come back.  I managed to fight and find my game.
But I think it has been a very good game.  I think she played pretty well.  I played against Begu before and I think that today she played much better than previous times.
I think that she served very well.  I had to fight everything that I can, but just didn't go my way this time.  I think she's done an overall good match.  That's all.
Q. (In English.)   You haven't made it past in stage in your career so far.  How disappointing is that stat, considering it's the biggest tournament in your home country?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, it's obviously hard.  Every time I come here I want to make a great tournament, but every match is so tough.  The draw is very small.
Well, I have to say I'm a little bit disappointed.  I fight a lot today.  Sometimes you don't win when you fight, so, that's it.  Next tournament is Rome.  (Smiling.)
Q. How impressed were you with the performance of your opponent today?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I was very impressed.  I played her before I think like three times and I've never seen her play that well.
But she's in the top level and I think she served pretty good today.  I think her shots were going deep and on the line.  I think she was playing great level.
Q. (In English. ) How do you feel your level is on clay this year?  You've had success at Roland Garros before.  How do you feel your level is going into Rome and maybe going into Roland Garros.
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, I'm just thinking how I go on the court every day.  Well, if I have to lose the match I prefer to give it all and the other one plays a great level.  I think that's the best way to lose, even though it's not good.
But I'm training a lot.  I like clay.  That doesn't mean I'm going to win every match, but I have grown up in Spain and I feel the clay.  I don't know.  I think it every tournament hopes me to get more to my game.
Hopefully I'll improve for Rome and for French Open and then...
Q. (In Spanish.)  Did you consider you let an opportunity go out here?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, I think that every single match is an opportunity.  But, well, you know that day you have a match and whoever plays the best that day is going to win.
Today I felt that she played really well during the whole match.  I fought as much as possible, but she just didn't go down in her level.  I was very surprised by her level today.
Q. What does this tournament have that the main players are falling out of the draw?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, I think if we talk about the seeded players, their matches were not -- you know, they could lose.  That happens very often.  I think in my case Begu played very well many we see this during the year.  The seeded players fall sometimes.
Whoever you play against, they can play very well.  She played very well today.  They can beat you.  So at the end of the day, I think that that number, that doesn't mean anything.
I think that you can lose matches against any player in the tournament.
Q. I saw that you were complaining in the match.  Was the game of your opponent bothering you or was it that you were committing unforced errors?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I think that today I was fighting, I was playing on a good level.  I think I played really good today, especially after the first set I felt quite well.  But I didn't find a formula to make damage to her, to put her level down.
I think she played very well during all the match and I think that has created on me a little bit of strange feeling.  I was playing well, but I wasn't getting there.
Q. You were serving to close the match.  Did you have a lot of pressure on you, extra pressure for playing here in Madrid or was it just bad luck?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, no.  I think that it was not bad luck.  I think that it was very tough match.  It was very tight.  She was playing really well.  I had to give my best.
In those moments of tension, I wasn't able to play as good as I should've.  Well, you're talking about the second or third set?  Second set?
It's been very tight.  I think I played really well.  She played also really good points.  She deserved to win.  That's all.
