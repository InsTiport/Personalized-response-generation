6-2, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Are you happy with your performance today?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I am very happy.  I went through the match, like, very concentrated, looking forward to play.  Was important match.  The last three years, I think I've lost in this round.  Was the first time I go through.  I'm in the quarterfinals.
So I was, you know, very excited about that, and I'm still excited.
Q. You may play Kerber in the next round.  What are your thoughts about that?  How are you going to prepare for that match?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, I'm going to prepare as always.  I know she's the world No. 1, but I played so many times against her.  There are battles every time we play together.  Probably is be one of the hardest match I can have.  But I look forward to that.  No better match than to play against the world No. 1.
Q. Or it can be CoCo Vandeweghe.  How about her?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: We've played a lot, a couple of times.  It's 1-1 head-to-head.  She's a tricky player.  She has a lot of power, full shots, serve, everything.  She can play very well.
Q. Do you feel like you're playing as well as the French Open last year?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Really, I don't know.  I think it's a very different surface.  It's already a long time since that tournament.  I feel that's very far away.  Honestly, I would not compare the level.
Q. If you could get a selfie with anyone famous, who would it be?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Selfie?  I already have it with Federer.  I already did it.  Here actually, like three years ago.
Q. Anyone outside of the tennis world?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I'm not sure.  I probably go with some, like, singer.  I love music.  So probably would go like Beyonce or Rihanna, yeah.
