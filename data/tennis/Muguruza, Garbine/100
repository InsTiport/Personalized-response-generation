THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  This match, Jelena played very aggressive.  You are also an aggressive player.  In the match you didn't hit very much heavy shots than before.  Are you physically not well or are there other reasons?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I mean, I think she played very aggressive.  She had a lot of good shots.  You know, especially in the right moments I think she picked the good ones and went for it.  It went her side.   
I think I was trying to do my game obviously.  It was a pretty close match at the end.  It was three sets and it was tight.  I think she's just playing very good with a lot of confidence.   
 Q.  She can pose quite a difficult matchup sometimes when she's on fire like that tonight.  What are the things you felt you were doing well to keep that match close, get that first set?  What did you think you could exploit from her?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, I just think that today she went for her shots, like before I said.  She served pretty good.  I think she returned very good, as well.  I think was just like you said, on fire.   
 Q.  Are you concerned with the leg at all going into Beijing?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, I've been playing all the matches with a wrap in my leg.  Now I want to (indiscernible) a little bit my body.  I still have a couple days till Beijing, which is very important.  Hopefully I start from zero there and just change the page.   
 Q.  What do you take out of this tournament?  
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I'm happy.  It's just a very tough situation to be, you know, when everybody's playing their best tennis against you.   
But, you know, even though with the conditions and how I felt with my body, I went to do quarterfinals.  I had a tough battle there.  I can't wait to play her again.
