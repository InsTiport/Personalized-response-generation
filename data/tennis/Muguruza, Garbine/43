Q. WANG/G. Muguruza
6-2, 6-0
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Have you been affected by the change of the player, I mean, Qiang Wang replaced Ms. Keys?  What's your opinion about Qiang Wang's performance today?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I mean, these things happen.  I was ready to play a tough match, either it's Keys or Wang, whoever it is.  But, no, I think I played a very tough opponent today.  Maybe she was also a little bit surprised that she was playing and a little bit more relaxed.  I think her performance is excellent.
Q. I have seen that during your training, your ankle was wrapped.  Was that an injury?  If it is, does that affect your performance today?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: No, I've been playing so many years with my ankle wraps.  I twist a lot my ankle.  It's a way of protecting them and taking care of them.
Q. In terms of the change in opponent, did that throw you off at all?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: No, I think I was expecting a tough match.  I know both players, so it was just a quick change of mindset.  I think the performance from Wang today, I said before, was excellent because  maybe -- you know, she's playing great tennis this year.  Maybe she was a little more relaxed.  We played before.  Also was a tough match.  Yeah, I think she's on fire.
Q. You played such a physical and emotional match last night, was it difficult to come down from that match?  It was a late night match and then get up for this match.
GARBINE MUGURUZA: It's always tough because it was a battle.  But I was actually excited.  I was so close to lose yesterday that I was so excited to keep playing today.  You're playing for a final.  I felt a little tired, of course.  It was just my body.  My mindset was ready to fight.  Yeah, I tried.  She was playing incredible shots and not missing anything.
