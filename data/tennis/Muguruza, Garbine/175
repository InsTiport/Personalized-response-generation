G. MUGURUZA/K. Flipkens
6-4, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.
Q. Another comfortable win for you.  Is your confidence growing out there?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, for sure, yes.  It's a great win.  I know Kirsten.  I played against her two times before and I knew it was going to be, you know, like a complicated match, because she doesn't have the common style, you know, of other womans on the tour.
So I'm pretty happy about my performance, yeah.
