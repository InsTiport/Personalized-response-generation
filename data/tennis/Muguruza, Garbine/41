THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Talk through your emotions during the match, how you were able to get through tough circumstances.
GARBINE MUGURUZA: I'm very happy because it was a very tough match.  She played very high level.  At some point just we were both playing great.  So just waiting for any chance in both sides.
Q. You weren't broken the entire match.  How great were you feeling on your serve today?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Good.  I think we both served great.  We kept it.  It was very difficult to break each other.  I'm very happy I didn't get break and that kept me alive during the whole match.
Q. Thoughts on your next match?
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Good.  She's a very tricky player.  She has a lot of talent.  We played many years ago, I think.  So, yeah, looking forward.  Looking forward very much.
