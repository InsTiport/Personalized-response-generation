  S. WILLIAMS/G. Muguruza2-6, 6-3, 6-2An interview with:GARBINE MUGURUZATHE MODERATOR: Questions, please.Q. What changed?  Things shifted in the second set.GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, is difficult to say, no?  The level was very high, the most high level.  So I think the difference was like two points or three points at the end.  I really started playing really good.  With the time, I was playing worst.  At the end I was feeling more tired, and my shots weren't as good as the first set.  I just think she also started to play better.  Serve was very important for her.  So that's it.  Only really small difference.Q. How important was that second game in the third set, the game that went very long, where you had chances to break?GARBINE MUGURUZA: Was very important.  I knew that if I won this game, I would have more chances to win the third set.  Because break her serve, it's difficult.  I wanted to use that opportunity, but I couldn't.  Was very tight, the third set.Q. What makes Serena Williams so dangerous once she gets going?GARBINE MUGURUZA: The hardest part, I mean, mentally she's amazing.  She's world No. 1.  She has the power to be all the match without saying anything, concentrate, waiting for her opportunity.  I mean, the serve, when she serves good, it's really difficult to return.  And then in the back, she's very strong.  So it's very difficult to find the spot to beat her.Q. How happy are you with your Australian Open performance overall?  Do you leave Australia happy?  Are you disappointed today?GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, right now I'm just sad because I lost.  Obviously I saw opportunities to win this match.  But I'm really happy.  I lost with the one I had to lose, to say one way.  I can say, okay, I lost to Serena.  Okay, I did a good tournament.  I improve a lot.  Today I saw my improvements from the pre-season in the match, so I'm happy.Q. Do you feel like there's a younger generation among the women?  Do you feel you're feeding off each other?GARBINE MUGURUZA: Well, I think now is like a change in the generation.  You just have to look the draw and see Madison, Genie and me, other young girls in the third and fourth round.  You see the rankings, the girls from the 90s are a lot more than before.  I think it's time for a change also.Q. Maria Sharapova has not beaten Serena in 10 years.  If you could give Maria any advice from your experience, what would you tell her?GARBINE MUGURUZA: It's difficult to say.  I think Serena has the game to beat also Maria.  Obviously has to be mental.  When you are losing to her 10 years, there is something in your head blocking during the match.  I think maybe improve more the way she plays to beat her.  I think the way she plays is not the way to beat Serena.  That's what I saw in the 10 years.  What can I say?Q. Last year when you lost to Aga, you felt like crying when you came into the press room.  Today you are smiling.  What is the difference?  You're more experienced, more able to handle the pressure, or because of the opponent you lost to?GARBINE MUGURUZA: No, I'm learning a lot of things.  Last year I went out of the court feeling I could do more than what I did in court.  You know this feeling you have, I could have maybe have won a set, this feeling, like bad.  But today I gave everything I had.  I lost, but I'm happy.  When you got off the court tired, but what can I say, she played better than me.  I have to be happy.  I did fourth round.  I lost to the world No. 1.  That's it.
