G. MUGURUZA/P. Parmentier 
      6‑4, 6‑2 

    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please.   

Q.   Congratulations.   How do you feel about all this?   Just kind of a whirlwind, unexpected week and a half for you into the quarterfinals.   
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Well, I feel amazing.   I didn't expect that.   It's a present. 

Q.   Do you feel like you're playing almost with nothing to lose for the rest of this tournament?   You've already achieved a great result and everything like that.   What's your mentality now? 
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Well, I just want to concentrate and keep playing the same, you know.   Of course now I'm very happy what I did, but I want to continue.   I still have to play a lot of matches, you know.   
    So looking forward to my next round. 

Q.   Do you have much interaction with Sharapova at all?   I think you're both IMG, sponsored by them.   Have you ever interacted with her at all? 
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   No, just normal, Hello, how are you.   That's it. 

Q.   How much have you seen her play? 
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I have seen her a lot.   Well, she has been on tour for a long time, you know, so I already had the chance to see her in big matches.   Yeah, I have seen her a lot, yeah. 

Q.   Match seemed to be not so hard for you, not so tough for you.   
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Well, I think it was very tough, because I was really nervous with this match.   I never played on Philippe Chatrier.   It's the first time against a French girl, so I was thinking, Oh, my god.   The crowd is going to support her a lot. 
    I was really nervous.   You cannot be calm.   It's fourth round.   It's very difficult. 

Q.   What were your feelings about this crowd?   It was the first time when you played against such a big crowd? 
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Yeah.   Probably, yeah.   I mean, against?   Yes (smiling).   Well, not against.   I understand that they wanted Pauline to win.   
    But, yeah, it's the first time. 

Q.   So what are your thoughts about your next‑round match against Maria?   Have you thought about it at all?   What do you think? 
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Well, I didn't know I was playing against Maria until the guy went to the court and asked me, You're playing against Maria Sharapova next round.   I thought, Okay, it's a tough match again.   Nothing to lose; everything to win. 
    Yeah, we played one year ago, so it's a big challenge.   

Q.   What impresses you the most about her, her game, when you've watched her play?   What stands out to you? 
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Well, I think she's a great fighter, amazing player.   She has really good shots.   Yeah, I mean, she has been the world No. 1, so it's tough. 

Q.   Obviously we are at Roland Garros.   I'm really interested in your thoughts about grass season.   For sure it's not the best surface for Spain, for Spanish people.   
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Well, I like grass.   I like grass courts.   My game I think is not the style of the Spanish people, so I feel really comfortable. 
    All the matches I have played in grass I felt really good.   So, yeah, I like grass, yeah. 

Q.   Do you think you can this year improve also on grass? 
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Yeah.   Yeah, I think I can improve.   
    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in Spanish.   

Q.   Did the crowd's behavior upset you in your play? 
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Well, before I came on the court, I knew the crowd was going to be on Pauline's side.   
    And it makes sense.   When you've never been on central court and you feel that the crowd is supporting the other player, you feel very, very small.   You think, Oh, my God.   They are all clapping for her. 
    But I tried to take this in a positive way.   It didn't upset me, really.   

Q.   For your next match, whose side the crowd is going to be on, you think? 
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Well, both, but I hope they cheer for me.   

Q.   Sharapova, during her press conference, said that people had started hearing about you, that maybe this was the tournament of your life, and that you defeated Serena.   
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Well, I know it's going to be a tough match.   She's a very, very good player.   I have nothing to lose. 
    So I'm going to do my best and try to enjoy it as much as I can.   I'm going to rise to the challenge.   I'll walk onto court with the mindset that will allow me to win, as I always do for all my matches. 

Q.   What happened inside your head when you defeated Serena?   Things started going very quickly.   
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Well, it was difficult, because after Serena, many things happened.   I tried to focus on every single match, match after match, because obviously people start having more expectations when you win such a match. 
    But with my team, we have tried to set this aside and to remain focused.   I'm very happy so far.   I'm enjoying this victory, and I will think about the next match afterwards. 

Q.   I don't know if players start looking at you in a different way already.   Maybe they respect you more.   Have you noticed anything? 
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   No, no, no.   Nothing has changed.   It's quite normal. 
    I go to the locker room, and I don't look around so much. 

Q.   The first day you talked about Martina Hingis, and you said she was your idol.   What do you think of Sharapova?   Did she inspire anything for you? 
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   Well, she's been on the tour for quite some time.   I have watched her play.   I think there are similar things in the way we play:   We're both tall, we both have very long arms, and she's very aggressive. 
    She's a competitor.   We try to copy the best features of the winning players. 

Q.   You're already in quarterfinals.   Is this going to add something to your career?   Are you going to go to Singapore? 
    GARBINE MUGURUZA:   I just found out that a race existed.   About one year ago I started at 0, and JosÃ© said to me, Did you look at the race?   And I said, No.   He said, Well, you already have 10 points. 
    But between now and Singapore, the wait is very, very long.   I'll try it, but I don't know.
