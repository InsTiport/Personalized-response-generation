THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Nice comfortable win for you today.  How did you feel out there?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: I felt good.  I had an aggressive player in front of me, very aggressive.  I think she goes for her shots, and that's difficult to, you know, to face in a grass tournament.  But I'm happy the way I'm handling the matches, especially those first rounds where I always say it's very difficult.   
Yeah, happy overall.   
 Q.  Do you think you sometimes prefer to play more aggressive players than the ones that are throwing you lots of variety?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: I don't have a preference.  I mean, I'm always adapting to all type of games.  So I'm happy that I'm facing these players very aggressive, because I'm also an aggressive player.   
Yeah, I'm handling pretty good.   
 Q.  Do you think you have a better chance of winning tournament now that Pliskova and Kvitova have been knocked out?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: I don't know.  I'm not thinking that far, honestly.  To say in second round if I'm thinking to win a tournament, it's too soon, for sure.  That's my experience.   
Right now I'm going to train hard for the next match and just be doing that until hopefully I get to the final rounds, and then that comes to your head.   
 Q.  Would you say you're feeling good about your chances of certainly making the second week at this point?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, I don't really know who -- I only know who I'm playing next.  I don't really want to know anything besides that.  Hopefully.  That's what I can say.  Hopefully.   
 Q.  No injury concerns or anything like that?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: No.  So good.
