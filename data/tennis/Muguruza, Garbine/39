K. PLISKOVA/G. Muguruza
6-3, 6-1
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. A tough match.  I wonder how you have gone through it and what are your feelings after the end?  And if that night match with Johanna was something that stayed with you in terms of your physical condition, if that took some time out of your pace during the tournament.
GARBINE MUGURUZA: Yeah.  I mean, it was a very tough match.  I was expecting it.  Pliskova, you have to put a lot of intensity with her.  She makes you be on every single ball.  I struggled a little bit with the heat or the conditions.  I don't know.  I felt it was a little bit heavy today.
But I think she was playing very well and finding her shots, especially with the serve in the good moments.
Yeah, it was a tough day.
