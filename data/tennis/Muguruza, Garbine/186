7-6, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What do you think went wrong tonight?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, I think I didn't -- I'm not really finding my game, so I think I have to rest a little bit and concentrate again and work hard and eventually come back to the tournament to play again.   
I think I'm not really ready to compete.  I need to work a little bit more.  My shots, my fitness.  So we'll see.   
 Q.  Is that something you're feeling in practice or only when you step on the court to compete?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: No, it's in practices.  I have had a lot of physical problems, sometimes the heel -- well, before my plantar fascia was hurting.   
I think I just need to start from zero again and kind of forget these couple of tournaments, I guess.   
 Q.  What's the overwhelming feeling?  Is it frustration, disappointment or now you're able to just say, no, let's look ahead?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: No, I mean, obviously I'm disappointed.   
Yeah.  Well, obviously it's not what I wanted to feel this on court, so -- well, I knew this kind of feeling, it could come, obviously.   
So I'm just not really worried, but I know what I gotta do.  I think I'll take my time to do it.  So I'll work next week, or...   
 Q.  Do you ever recognize that all the other seeds are out of the tournament already, or...  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, I didn't know.  But, I mean, here the surface is really fast.  I can see the top seeds are losing very fast.  So, I mean, doesn't really mean anything to be seed sometimes.   
I don't know.  Something is just wrong here.   
 Q.  You're saying you're not going to go to Doha?  
GARBIÃE MUGURUZA: Well, I don't know yet, but let's see how I feel.  If I'm not 100%, I don't think it's necessary.  So we'll see these couple of days.
