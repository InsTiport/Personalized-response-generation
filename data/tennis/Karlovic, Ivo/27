MODERATOR:  First question, please. 


Q.  Can you just talk about what turned it around for you, you know, in the match. 

IVO KARLOVIC:  In the match, well I started to serve much better.  So I had better chance in the tiebreak. 

Q.  It's hard to probably summarize, but since Wimbledon, have you gotten a lot more contacts from sponsors and from other people? 

IVO KARLOVIC:  From sponsors, yeah.  I am ranked which is the best for me now at the moment. 

Q.  Can you describe what life has been like for you since Wimbledon. 

IVO KARLOVIC:  Well, since, it's been pretty much the same because I was always on the tournaments.  So it's been the same. 

Q.  When you were down 2-4 in the tiebreaker in the fourth set, you seemed to lose your serve a little.  Does that worry you, since your serve is such a big part of your game?  Does that worry you at all? 

IVO KARLOVIC:  Well, I mean, of course it worries me.  But I am trying to stay focused to play as best I can. 

Q.  You seem to take a little step towards the umpire's chair, clean off your racquet. 

IVO KARLOVIC:  Yeah.

Q.  You came back very focused with your serve.  You really gathered yourself there, didn't you?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Yeah, of course. 

Q.  Your ranking has gone up considerably since Wimbledon. 

IVO KARLOVIC:  Yeah, yeah. 

Q.  Do you feel that soon you won't have to be playing qualifying tournaments?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Yeah, I mean, sure.  I mean, it is my goal.  I hope that it will be soon.

Q.  You won the GHI men's singles up in The Bronx. 

IVO KARLOVIC:  Yeah, and in the Hampton as well. 

Q.  Did that really prepare you to come here?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Yeah, sure, because it helped my confidence.  Yeah, it's been good. 

Q.  Did you try for a wildcard here?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Yes. 

Q.  They turned you down?

IVO KARLOVIC:  That's right.  Because, I mean, no.

Q.  Were you surprised?

IVO KARLOVIC:  I mean, no, actually, not much.

Q.  You've done so well at Wimbledon and now here.  What is it about Grand Slams that brings the best out of you? 

IVO KARLOVIC:  Well, actually, I've been playing also in (inaudible).  I don't know, it is also only my form.  I mean, always, it's, I mean, the same.

Q.  Do you feel greater excitement at places like here?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Of course, yeah.  I mean, sure. 

Q.  Did it surprise you how much attention this match got with Hicham, with the crowd yelling, "Ivo" and "Hicham"? 

IVO KARLOVIC:  Yeah.  It's been nice.  It's been good atmosphere. 

Q.  Has Goran been in touch this week?

IVO KARLOVIC:  No, no. 

Q.  Do you think he will?

IVO KARLOVIC:  I don't know, maybe.  Phone call, I don't know. 

Q.  Do you have to do military service still in Croatia?

IVO KARLOVIC:  No.  I...

Q.  It's finished?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Yeah.

Q.  You did some, did you?

IVO KARLOVIC:  No. 

Q.  Do you know that Dmitry also won, the runner up in the GHI?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Yeah.  It shows that the level in the challengers is high.

Q.  Is your family over here?

IVO KARLOVIC:  No.

Q.  Will they fly here?

IVO KARLOVIC:  I don't know, no.  No (smiling).

Q.  Depending how well you do?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Yeah, sure. 

Q.  Schalken next. 

IVO KARLOVIC:  Schalken, yeah. 

Q.  Have you played him?

IVO KARLOVIC:  No, no.  I haven't played him.  I don't know how it's gonna be.  I mean, if I serve good, I mean, anything can happen. 

Q.  How do you plan to prepare yourself for the next match?

IVO KARLOVIC:  I will only practice little bit tomorrow and try to stay focused.  That's it. 

Q.  Do you find people recognizing you now wherever you go?

IVO KARLOVIC:  In the streets, yeah.  Yeah, I mean... Yeah.  My height... (Laughter).

Q.  You're the tallest player ever to play in this tournament?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Yeah.  I guess so. 

Q.  What about Arazi said it wasn't really tennis?

IVO KARLOVIC:  No, I don't know. 

Q.  Said, "We didn't get to hit any balls." 

IVO KARLOVIC:  I don't know. 

Q.  You didn't let him hit enough balls. 

IVO KARLOVIC:  Yeah, I mean, of course because if I try to stay, I mean, if I hit back, I mean, he's much better.  I just try to, I mean, go in front, forehand. 

Q.  Were you surprised when he stood back against the fence to receive one of your serves?

IVO KARLOVIC:  No (smiling).  It's normal, I guess. 

Q.  It's happened before?

IVO KARLOVIC:  It's crazy, yeah, yeah.  It's normal. 

Q.  The weather conditions were pretty bad out there today?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Yeah, sure.

Q.  How did you feel?

IVO KARLOVIC:  It was cold at the end. 

Q.  Uncomfortable?

IVO KARLOVIC:  I was little bit, yeah, tired.
