THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How were you feeling out on the court today?  You seemed sluggish in the first two sets.  
IVO KARLOVIC: In the beginning, it was horrible.  I didn't really feel the ball or anything.  But then as the match was going on, I did begin to play a little bit better.   
Actually in the end, was really good.  But it was late already.   
 Q.  Were you tired?  
IVO KARLOVIC: Tired a little bit.  Also all my earlier matches were in the night.  It was day match.  It was completely different conditions.  It was also little bit windy, I guess.  I don't know.  I just didn't feel the ball at all.   
 Q.  Did you see something different in Nishikori's game since last time?  
IVO KARLOVIC: No, nothing changed.  I mean, if I hit an ace, there is nothing to change.  I don't know about the question.   
 Q.  Are you happy with your performance?  You've had a great summer.  Are you a little disappointed?  
IVO KARLOVIC: No, it was great.  This was my best US Open ever.  I never reached this far.  Always you want more.  It would be better if I played well today.  But didn't happen.   
All in all, it was really great US Open for me.
