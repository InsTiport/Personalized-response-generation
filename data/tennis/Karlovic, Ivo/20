   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 

 Q.  Did the heat take a lot out of you? 
 IVO KARLOVIC:  The heat, not actually the heat as yesterday.  I think because yesterday I was playing a lot and it was pretty tiring.  I was here all day.  I was eating late.  I slept awful.  I wake up with a headache. 
 I don't know, I was feeling really bad on the court today. 

 Q.  Did you feel bad during the match as well on the court? 
 IVO KARLOVIC:  Yeah, very bad. 

 Q.  You had beaten him five times before.  Was there something different he was doing? 
 IVO KARLOVIC:  Four times. 

 Q.  Four times.  Did he do anything differently today? 
 IVO KARLOVIC:  I or him? 

 Q.  No, Mardy. 
 IVO KARLOVIC:  Yeah, I mean, he was playing well.  He was playing a lot better his forehand, I think.  I don't know.  He was playing well I think. 

 Q.  Did he get more balls back on your serve than he usually does when you play him? 
 IVO KARLOVIC:  Well, yeah, I mean, but I don't know how much percentage I had in.  I don't know.  I think it was like really low first serve percentage. 

 Q.  He won over 70% points on your second serve.  Do you think that was the key to the match, him attacking your second serve? 
 IVO KARLOVIC:  Yeah, for sure.
