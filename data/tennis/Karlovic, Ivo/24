THE MODERATOR:  Questions in English, please. 
 

Q.  It was lovely for you to finish on an ace, wasn't it?
 
IVO KARLOVIC:  To finish... 
 

Q.  The match ended, the last main point for you was an ace.
 
IVO KARLOVIC:  Okay, yeah. 
 

Q.  So that was nice.
 
IVO KARLOVIC:  It was good, yeah.  Nice. 
 

Q.  Did you actually enjoy playing the No. 1 seed?
 
IVO KARLOVIC:  Well, I didn't have anything to lose.  So, yeah, I was enjoying it for sure. 
 

Q.  Do you believe he is now an unstoppable force for the title?  He played so well.
 
IVO KARLOVIC:  Well, he plays unbelievable, especially in the crucial points or when it's important.  And that is his great advantage. 
 

Q.  I believe people have described your service as though you're a man "serving from a tree."  How do you describe your own serve?
 
IVO KARLOVIC:  Well, it is an advantage because I'm tall.  But also I've been practicing it a lot, so that's why it is good, my serve. 
 

Q.  You had a terrific tournament.  Very good stuff.
 
IVO KARLOVIC:  Thank you. 
 

Q.  Was it especially pleasing, you'll remember the last stroke you made at Wimbledon was an ace?
 
IVO KARLOVIC:  Well, the stroke, actually it was the... 
 

Q.  Your chip and charge, yeah.
 
IVO KARLOVIC:  The slice, yeah. 
 

Q.  But you left town with a good impression?
 
IVO KARLOVIC:  Sure, yeah.  I mean, I am happy with my result here.  I just wish that I was playing somebody less good maybe (smiling).  Nothing else. 
 

Q.  Is Federer your Wimbledon Champion now, do you reckon?
 
IVO KARLOVIC:  Yeah, yeah. 
 

Q.  You had 14 aces today.  In the last three rounds you had 40.  Why do you think this was?
 
IVO KARLOVIC:  Why?  Well, I am not ashamed.  I also have my ups and downs.  And, you know, I was playing against Roger, who returns unbelievable.  So that's why.
