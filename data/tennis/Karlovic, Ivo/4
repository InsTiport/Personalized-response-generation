6-7, 6-3, 7-6, 6-7, 12-10
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. Today there was 41 aces.  If you remember, it is your top mark here at Roland Garros?  Your record, 41 aces?
IVO KARLOVIC: Oh, no, no, I remember one year against Lleyton Hewitt it was 55 or something like that.
Q. And the top in one single match, how much?
IVO KARLOVIC: 78 in Davis Cup against Radek Stepanek.
Q. So what is your feeling?  Third round, Roland Garros, maybe not expected or...
IVO KARLOVIC: Yeah, it's unbelievable because this year I was struggling with the injury, with the knee.  So I was out for two months almost.
So this is really unbelievable for me.
Q. I'm sure this is a question somebody told you a number of times, but I would like to have your answer.  You're from Croatia.  It's basketball country.  I'm sure you grew up with the likes of Drazen Petrovic, Dino Rada, and the others.  How did you not play basketball?
IVO KARLOVIC: I don't know.  I don't know.  That is what I ask of me every day.  Why?  Why?  No, I'm joking.  I remember when I was young, I was always into tennis more, you know.  I always liked it more and more than basketball, and I remember when I was maybe 13 years old I was practicing basketball, and they really liked me because I was already almost this height almost, and also I could move because of tennis.
So they really liked me, but I didn't like.  That's why.
But now, when I look back, it would be easier, easier, a lot.  I think because this is what I wanted.  And in tennis it's really unbelievable, but it was long and hard journey.
Q. You are oldest since Jimmy Connors to reach third round in Grand Slam.  Can you talk about that?
IVO KARLOVIC: It's the only time when being old is okay (smiling).  So, yeah, I like.
