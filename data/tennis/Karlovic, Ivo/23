THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Ivo, please.


Q.  How excited are you about this week?

IVO KARLOVIC:  I'm very excited because it's my first final of the ATP tournament, so I am looking forward to tomorrow's match.


Q.  Can you talk a little bit about your win over Lleyton Hewitt.  You have played him twice and beaten him twice now.

IVO KARLOVIC:  Yeah, I prefer how he plays on the grass because he stays back and he don't do much winners.  I could play more, and I always have a chance.


Q.  How fantastic is it to know that you can win so many points on your serve?  That must give you such fantastic confidence.

IVO KARLOVIC:  Of course, because on my serve I am always at an advantage.  It is easier than to rally from the baseline, of course.


Q.  You've always been known for your height, obviously, being so tall.  Is it nice to be known for something else, to be known as an ATP finalist?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, I am happy to be in the final, of course.


Q.  What about playing Roddick?  What do you think it's going to be like?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Well, I mean, he plays unbelievable on the grass and he serves excellent.  So it will be a typical match. I am looking forward to it.


Q.  You had a Scotland football team top on.  You have a lot of fans in Scotland.  Did you know that?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Really?  No, no, no, I didn't know.  It's from my sponsor clothes.  Great (smiling).


Q.  Goran will be here for an exhibition tomorrow.  Is that a big help to you?  Will you speak to him before the match?

IVO KARLOVIC:  I mean, of course I hope that before the match I will be able to speak to him and that he will give me some advice how to play against Roddick.


Q.  Do you talk to him much?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Sorry?


Q.  Do you talk to Goran much?  Are you in contact with him?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Well, not as much, no.  Not much.


Q.  We all know that you and Andy have got big serves.

IVO KARLOVIC:  Yes.


Q.  How important, how crucial will the returning game be?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Well, it will be very important because every point on the return could be crucial, especially in the tiebreaks.  So, yeah, it will be important, for sure.


Q.  Where and when did you first play on grass, and what did you think about it?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Well, the first time I believe I was playing actually here.  I believe it was maybe five years ago, something like that.  I was playing quallies, I think.


Q.  What did you think about it, about grass?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Well, I like it because it suits my game.  I like it very much.
