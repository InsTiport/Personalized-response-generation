  7‑5, 2‑6, 7‑6 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
   
 Q.   Very good win for you today.   But your celebration was a little bit muted, maybe not as big after beating a compatriot.   Was that on your mind?  
IVO KARLOVIC:   Yes, because I know him really well.   I know him since he was little boy.   
I mean, I didn't want to go like wild in celebration because that would not be nice, you know.   It is always difficult when you play somebody that you know really well.   
I was lucky that I won in the end.   
   
 Q.   What do you think was the secret today?   Looked like not only are you a great server, but it looked like you were returning well today.   
IVO KARLOVIC:   Yeah, definitely.   Always if I'm able to return good, then I have a lot more chances to win.   
But I was playing really good my backhand slice.   It was playing really low.   Then I was able to run around my forehands with that.   Yeah, I was happy with the way I played and, of course, with the outcome.   
   
 Q.   John Isner was in here before.   He fired 21 aces today.   You had a high number yourself.   How are you finding the courts?   Is it playing the way you'd like it to play?  
IVO KARLOVIC:   Yeah, I like them obviously because I won.   So I like them.   But they're pretty fast.   Maybe this stadium is not as quick as other courts, but I liked it also.
