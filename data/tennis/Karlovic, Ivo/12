R. FEDERER/I. Karlovic
  7‑6, 7‑5, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Obviously crucial point was the first set when you had a set point.   Talk me through the Federer lob.   Was it a good shot?   Did youmistime the shot? 
IVO KARLOVIC:   Well, I don't know.   It is like one in, I don't know, hundred that I'm going to lose that point.   I don't know.   It was really unlucky, you know.
I didn't really expect him to do that, but I was there.   You know, I just, how you say, miscalculate how much on his jump.   It was really unlucky.
Then, you know, if I would have won that, everything would have been different.   But that is life, you know.   Tennis, that's how it is. 

Q.   What was difference between you winning and losing?   Can you sum up the game? 
IVO KARLOVIC:   He won the match point.   (Smiling.)   That's a joke.   Nobody is laughing.   All right. 
I don't know. I don't know.   I would know if I would have won, but I didn't know.   That's one more joke.   (Smiling.)
