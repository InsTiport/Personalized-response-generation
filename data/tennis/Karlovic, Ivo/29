MODERATOR:  Good evening, Ivo Karlovic.  English questions first.  
 
 
Q.  How have things changed for you since beating Hewitt? 
 
IVO KARLOVIC:  Well, you know, it was unbelievable because all the press was after me.  I'm not used to it.  It was a little bit hard, I mean, for me.  But it's okay, I guess (smiling).  
 
Q.  You have sponsorship?
 
IVO KARLOVIC:  Sorry?  
 
Q.  You have new sponsorship? 
 
IVO KARLOVIC:  Well, I was talking to some people.  I must see what is best, what to do.  
 
Q.  Have you talked to Goran Ivanisevic?
 
IVO KARLOVIC:  Today, no, I didn't.  
 
Q.  Have you talked to him in between your games? 
 
IVO KARLOVIC:  No, no, I haven't.  
 
Q.  We hear everyone in Zagreb is proud of you.  Any chance of your parents and girlfriend coming over for your next round? 
 
IVO KARLOVIC:  My girlfriend will come tomorrow. 
 
Q.  Really?
 
IVO KARLOVIC:  Yeah.  So I'm happy (smiling).  
 
Q.  How are you feeling now after your second win? 
 
IVO KARLOVIC:  Well, I'm excited and happy. 
 
Q.  Do you like having all the attention on you or would you prefer not to have it? 
 
IVO KARLOVIC:  Well, it is normal because I beat a No.  1, so it's okay, I guess.  Normal.  
 
Q.  How far do you think you can go in this tournament now?  I understand you've never been beyond the second round before.  It's already new territory.  Do you think you can go a long way in this tournament? 
 
IVO KARLOVIC:  If I serve good and everything can happen.  I expect the best, but I don't know, I mean...  
 
Q.  Do you think you played as well today as you played against Hewitt? 
 
IVO KARLOVIC:  No.  Against Hewitt I played better because I had no pressure and I just play my game.  And then against Baccanello, it was a lot of pressure from everybody, especially me, because I expected to win.  So I was a little bit, yeah.  
 
Q.  How can you explain your improvement here?  This is a big breakthrough for you.  Is it something you expected would happen sooner rather than later? 
 
IVO KARLOVIC:  Well, you know, I have been practicing a lot.  I have a new coach.  I expected to go up, so...  
 
Q.  Have you had much reaction back home in Croatia?
 
IVO KARLOVIC:  Yeah, sure, because everybody called me and it was nice, yeah.  
 
Q.  Have you ever met anyone taller than you? 
 
IVO KARLOVIC:  No, no, I haven't.  
 
Q.  What you do you expect from your next opponent?  I believe it's Max Mirnyi. 
 
IVO KARLOVIC:  He also have a strong serve, and he plays like me, I mean, a serve and volley.  So, I mean, he's going to be tough match for sure.  A lot of aces (smiling).  
 
Q.  You seem to on court today occasionally be getting annoyed with yourself.  We understand you can be temperamental sometimes. 
 
IVO KARLOVIC:  Yes, sometimes (smiling). 
 
Q.  How difficult is it for you to control that side?
 
IVO KARLOVIC:  Well, sometimes if I play bad, I'm nervous, of course.  But I can, I don't know, calm down. 
 
Q.  Goran always said there was a good Goran and a bad Goran.  Is there a good Ivo and a bad Ivo?
 
IVO KARLOVIC:  It is only a good Ivo (smiling).
