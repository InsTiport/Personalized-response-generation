THE MODERATOR:  Ivo Karlovic.  Who would like to ask the first question? 


Q.  It seemed like you played a good match.  You always seem to do well here.  Is it just something about the first round at this tournament you particularly enjoy playing?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Well, it's the biggest tournament.  If I don't play well here, I mean, I ain't going to play anywhere good.  So, yeah.  I've been playing good, yeah. 

Q.  Did you find it difficult with the rain delays?  It must make it hard during the match, starting and stopping. 

IVO KARLOVIC:  Yeah, but I was trying to keep my concentration.  I succeed.

Q.  This time last year you came into Wimbledon ranked 205,  I think, in the world.  You've since gotten up to the 50s.  What has been the big progress in your game since then?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Every week I've been playing with the best players in the world, so I learned a few things, and I improve for sure. 

Q.  Will you be watching the football tonight?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Yes, I will.

Q.  Predictions for a result? 

IVO KARLOVIC:  Well, I will be happy if Croatia wins, even if it's only 1-0.
