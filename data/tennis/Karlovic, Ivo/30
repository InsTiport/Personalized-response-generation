MODERATOR:  Ladies and Gentlemen, Ivo Karlovic.  Could I have the first question, please. 


Q.  Do you already realize what you did?

IVO KARLOVIC:  No.  I mean, I'm excited.  I believe I'm going to realize some other day, I mean, that I win. 

Q.  The first set?

IVO KARLOVIC:  The first, I was completely  -- I mean, I was scared.  After I saw that I can beat him, I start to play more better.

Q.  With your height, we expect you to play basketball instead of tennis. 

IVO KARLOVIC:  Yes.  Well, I chose tennis.  I enjoy it, I mean, to play.

Q.  Did you feel because of Hewitt's recent form, that made him vulnerable and gave you a chance before the match?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Yeah.  Because I saw him  -- I mean, I saw him play last week, and he didn't play anything special.  I was, I mean, pretty prepared to win. 

Q.  In the second set, you were down 15-40 and one service game, Love-40 on the next, you won both games. 

IVO KARLOVIC:  Yes. 

Q.  Was that encouraging to you?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Yes, yes.  I mean, it was a bit  -- it was a little bit lucky.  But, I mean, that's life, yeah, tennis.

Q.  When did you begin believing you could win?

IVO KARLOVIC:  I began to believe the third set.

Q.  In the third set?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Yeah, in the third set. 

Q.  What do you think the reaction will be back home to this victory?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Back home, I mean, for sure is going to be a big story.

Q.  Many people in Croatia were looking forward to seeing Goran Ivanisevic back at Wimbledon.  Can you tell us what inspiration he's been for you over the years?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Well, I mean, he was always my idol, and I always hold him as a God, I mean. 

Q.  Will you be able to speak to him?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Yes, I speak with him just now, before.  He congratulates, and that's it.

Q.  What was it like for you when you were a kid?  When did you start to be so tall?

IVO KARLOVIC:  I was always, I mean, taller than everybody else.  I'm used to it.

Q.  But playing tennis, you must have been particular  -- I know you also play basketball.  Did you stand out a lot?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Yes, always.  I mean, I was higher than anybody else, I mean (smiling).

Q.  Did you like it?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Well, I mean, sometimes not.  I mean, I'm used to it, so...

Q.  What job did you do for your military service? 

IVO KARLOVIC:  I don't know which I'm going to do. 

Q.  You haven't done it yet?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Not yet.

Q.  Are your parents tall, as well?

IVO KARLOVIC:  No.  I mean, average, average.  Maybe I don't know who is tall.  Postman maybe (smiling).

Q.  Were you a big baby? 

IVO KARLOVIC:  No.  I was average.  After, I start to get taller.

Q.  Can you tell us about your family?  Are they from a tennis background?  Are they here today?

IVO KARLOVIC:  No.  I mean, they are not in the sport at all.  I have a sister who is older, two years than me.  She's a psychologist.

Q.  Who was the little boy cheering you along? 

IVO KARLOVIC:  I don't know.

Q.  Was he not a family member?

IVO KARLOVIC:  No.

Q.  What are your parents' and sister's name?

IVO KARLOVIC:  My father, Vlado.  My mother is Gordana.  My sister Anna. 

Q.  Were you surprised by the reaction of the crowd, how much they got behind you very quickly?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Yes, yes, I was overwhelmed.  I mean, I started to get - I don't know how you say - I was all (hip?). 

Q.  Were you in Zagreb when Croatia beat the United States?

IVO KARLOVIC:  No.

Q.  They didn't even ask you to come?

IVO KARLOVIC:  No, they didn't ask me to come.  I was out of the team, not in the team.

Q.  What about your personality?  Do you think you are introverted, extroverted? 

IVO KARLOVIC:  As you all could see and hear, I have a speech - I don't know how to say - difficulty.  But I try to work it and be, I mean, better. 

Q.  You didn't play your best tennis in the first set.  Were you impressed by the atmosphere of the Centre Court?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Yes.  Because it was my first time here against No.  1.  I was a little bit, yeah, scared.

Q.  Which player do you most admire? 

IVO KARLOVIC:  I admire Mr.  Ivanisevic.  I mean, he was my idol.

IVO KARLOVIC:  No.  I'm on the Earls Court.

Q.  In a hotel?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Yes, in a hotel. 

Q.  Obviously, your height makes it easier for you to serve.  That's always been a strength.  What has been more difficult for you because you are so tall?

IVO KARLOVIC:  To move.  I mean, it is my difficulty.  Every day I try to work it, I mean, to improve that. 

Q.  What do you do to try to improve your movement?

IVO KARLOVIC:  Well, physically, some sprints.  I mean, all, with the physical coach I do at home.
