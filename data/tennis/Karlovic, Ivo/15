R. FEDERER/I. Karlovic
  6-3, 7-5, 7-6

 THE MODERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, Ivo Karlovic. Questions, please. 

 Q. Was it quite a shock to be broken already in your second service game?
 IVO KARLOVIC: Well, I mean, he returned unbelievable few shots, and I could not really react on it. And it was also little bit problem with the sun was in my eyes. 
 So, yeah, it was that. 

 Q. You felt better after you took the sunglasses?
 IVO KARLOVIC: Yes, it was easier, because it was right in my eye, sun. 

 Q. Did it affect you psychologically losing that service game? Did you find it hard after that?
 IVO KARLOVIC: No, no, it was not. I mean, he returned unbelievable that game. I could not really do anything much better. Maybe, I don't know -- I don't know really. 

 Q. Can you explain what Roger does differently than other players with your serve? Does he hit it back sooner, or is it clear to you why he can handle it a little bit better than others?
 IVO KARLOVIC: Oh, it is only because he is better than everybody else. That's it. 

 Q. Just better in general, not a specific thing he does?
 IVO KARLOVIC: Not a specific, no.

 Q. Did you believe at one point that you could turn it around or... 
 IVO KARLOVIC: Yes. In the first two, he was playing unbelievable. He did not almost give me any chance. But in the third set, he was a little bit - how you say - he went a little bit down and I started playing better. 
 I had my opportunity in that one game when I could have broke him. But I missed easy volley, and that was it. 

 Q. Was it a bit of a shock to get broken so quickly in the match today, after having served so well?
 IVO KARLOVIC: Well, I just said, dÃ©jÃ  vu (smiling). 
 No, I mean, it was not. He returned well in the beginning. I don't know, after that I could continue everything like before. 
 It was good until the second set at 5-All when he broke me again with some unbelievable returns. 

 Q. What was your level today? Do you think you played a good match? Was it just Roger, or you could have played better?
 IVO KARLOVIC: Well, I mean, I don't know. When I look at it, I did everything right. I don't know. I don't know what else I could do. 
 I mean, every opportunity I tried to hit the best I can. He was just better today. 

 Q. Can you identify any weakness in Roger's game? Is there something you try to exploit or attack about the way he plays?
 IVO KARLOVIC: Yes, I mean, his second serve isn't like unbelievable. It is good, but it could be -- I mean, I don't know. I'm not gonna say it is his weakness, but it is something that I try to attack. 
 But anything else, I don't know. It is no weakness. 

 Q. Did your serve suffer because of the problems with the sun? How did it affect you?
 IVO KARLOVIC: No, I mean, the sun is for everybody, you know. I don't know. Only that first game that I lost my serve was a little bit -- it was like right in my eyes, so I could not hit as good. 
 But after everything was fine. 

 Q. You've played Roger a lot of times now. How well do you think he's playing at the moment?
 IVO KARLOVIC: I mean, he's maybe like best player ever, but on the grass he's, you know, by far best I think. 

 Q. Have you seen a player out there, that if Roger plays like this, you think he can beat him?
 IVO KARLOVIC: Well, this year, honestly no. 

 Q. How is it different to play Roger on grass? You have played him on every surface. How is it different to play him here?
 IVO KARLOVIC: Well, I mean, he don't like when the ball jumps higher, and over here, you know, everything is around his waist because the ball jumps lower. I don't know. It suits his game unbelievable I think. 

 Q. How much of a boost has it been for you to reach the quarterfinals here?
 IVO KARLOVIC: Well, I mean, of course it's a great confidence boost. It is my first quarterfinal in the career. I'm really happy for that. But, of course, you know, after you lose, I don't -- I'm not like very, very happy. 
 But after a few days when I realize that it is a great accomplishment, you know, it will be different probably. 

 Q. Do you have any problem with the hand?
 IVO KARLOVIC: Yes, it was little bit hurting me. I don't know. I just hit a few balls and it started hurting me, but after first set it was fine. 

 Q. Had you ever had no chance in a tiebreak after hitting all first serves in?
 IVO KARLOVIC: I don't know. I don't know. I don't remember. 

 Q. Did you get a sense, maybe even from early on, that Federer was able to read your serves better than other opponents, that he was able to tell where the serves were heading?
 IVO KARLOVIC: Well, I mean, today I was a little bit nervous in the beginning, so I was tossing ball, I don't know, like little bit lower. It was right around my ear. 
 But, I mean, he is what he is, you know. He do what he do best, so I don't know. I don't know. I cannot answer. I don't know. 

 Q. What was it that made you nervous? The fact you were playing on Centre Court, the quarterfinal, or the fact it was Roger on the other side of the net?
 IVO KARLOVIC: Yes, everything, all of the above.
