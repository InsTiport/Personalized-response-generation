 R. NADAL/I. Karlovic
  6‑4, 4‑6, 6‑4, 6‑4 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. You served 28 aces today, but it wasn't enough. How important is that to you, that part of your game?  
 IVO KARLOVIC: I mean, it is my biggest weapon. So of course it's the key to every match.   
 But, I don't know, like all in all it was good week. You know, I had chances which I didn't take, and that's it. That's it.   
  
  Q. Is there another part of your game you need to work on especially?   
 IVO KARLOVIC: No (smiling).   
  
  Q. Can you give us an idea of where Nadal's game is at the moment?   
 IVO KARLOVIC: Well, I mean, he is very athletic. He is playing fast from each angle. And it is difficult against him, very difficult.   
  
  Q. Can you offer a view of him playing against Murray, how that matchup might be?   
 IVO KARLOVIC: I really don't know. I really don't know.   
 I just lost, and I don't really care about it. Sorry.
