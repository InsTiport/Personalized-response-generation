MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

Q. Richard said the other day that you and he, as players who enjoy playing
serve-and-volley here, are kind of in a minority. What has happened to the
serve-and-volley game?

JAN SIEMERINK: That's a tough question (laughter). I think it's a matter of growing up,
the youth growing up, they hit the ball harder. We used to play with wooden racquets. The
guys nowadays don't play with wooden racquets anymore. They hit the ball harder. They
don't seem to go to the net enough anymore because they just hit the winners from the
baseline, then you don't have to go anymore. When we started playing, I mean, we had to
use tactics to come in. Nowadays, they just hit it, they just come in to finish off the
volley. That has also something to do with it. There are probably more different reasons,
but it's hard to think about something else. 

Q. Have you noticed in your time playing that the return game has gotten better?

JAN SIEMERINK: Yeah, the returning is much better. Overall the guys hit the ball
harder. Even for myself, it's getting harder and harder to play my own game because of
this. You see now that the serve-and-volley players, they all have a big serve. If you
don't have a big serve anymore, there's no way you can do well.
