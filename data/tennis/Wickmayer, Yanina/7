 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. You made the semis here and had a really good week. What are your thoughts about how you did this week?  
 YANINA WICKMAYER: Um, yeah, well, I'm really happy about this week. I'm a little disappointed about my semis today, but I had a great week. I'm just gonna try to take the positive with it and try and go this way next week.  
  
  Q. What were you pleased about with your game throughout the week?  
 YANINA WICKMAYER: Um, I was playing aggressive. I was changing pace a little bit. I was serving well. Um, so, yeah, that's just playing my game, and that's what was most positive this week.  
  
  Q. What was tough against Marion today?  
 YANINA WICKMAYER: Well, I just didn't get into the match. I was down 2-Love and never really got the chance to get in. I played good points, bad points. I never really found my level.  
 She's a good player. She made it tough on me. But, you know, I never really got the chance to get into the match. I didn't really feel really good out there.  
  
  Q. Could you tell me a little bit about why you couldn't get into the match?  
 YANINA WICKMAYER: Yeah, good question. It happens sometimes.   
  
  Q. It's just one of those days?  
 YANINA WICKMAYER: Just one of those days, I guess.
