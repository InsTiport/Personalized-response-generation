Y. WICKMAYER/S. Errani
  6-1, 6-7, 6-3

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. You started well, 6-1, then the second set you were having a lot of treatment. Can you tell us what happened? 
 YANINA WICKMAYER: The first set I felt really well. Going on court, I had treatment before, so my back was really feeling well. And then, yeah, I really started playing really well. Played a perfect first set. 
 Second set in the beginning my back was still fine. From 2-All, started feeling really bad. Got really tense again. So I called the physio after the second set, got some painkillers. I think after three games it started working a little bit, so I think that really helped my back. 
 But it didn't really feel well. 

 Q. How did it affect your game? Is it movement or technique on certain shots? 
 YANINA WICKMAYER: Well, it certainly is movement. I don't move really super when my back is hurting. So I move a lot faster when my back is fine. My aggressive game is more easy when my back is loose and everything feels good. 
 Those two points are pretty important in my game. Serve felt pretty good. Just the end of the motion hurted. Serve was okay. But moving into the court was a lot of pain today. 

 Q. Can you fix it up by the next round?
 YANINA WICKMAYER: I think that will be the question. No singles tomorrow is going to do me well. Let's hope I can fix it up by, yeah, the next match. It will be a question. But I think one day off of singles and tough matches will do me good again, so let's hope I can recover enough.
