Y. WICKMAYER/J. Groth
  6-3, 2-6, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions. 

 Q. Obviously very happy with that outcome. 
 YANINA WICKMAYER: Yeah, definitely. When I saw the draw, I know it was going to be a tough first round. She played really well last week. I saw a couple of her matches on TV. So I know she was going to come out there and be a tough opponent. 
 She plays home, so always an advantage. She played a really good match today. I think we both played some good tennis, and I'm really happy about the match. I'm really happy about the way I played. So was a good first round.
