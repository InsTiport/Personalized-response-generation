Y. WICKMAYER/S. Stosur
  6‑3, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How do you sum up that experience, that performance?
YANINA WICKMAYER:   I think this was one of the best matches I've played this year.   I felt really confident out there, and tried to really focus on being aggressive from the first point when she served.   I tried to be aggressive on the second serves, and when I had the chance I tried to move in and move forward and serve well myself. 
Open the court up, make her run, work for the points.   So I'm really happy about the way I played today.
