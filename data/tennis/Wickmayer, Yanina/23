   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 

 Q.  The idea before the match, is the match what you thought it would be? 
 YANINA WICKMAYER:  Well, the idea before the match, I didn't have any idea.  I was so happy to play this match.  I didn't think there was any tactics or stuff.  I just went out there and did my best I could.  That's what I did. 

 Q.  Were you pleased with your level or did you expect more? 
 YANINA WICKMAYER:  Well, the games were pretty close, and I could follow her game.  I think she made a lot of winners today, served pretty well, returned well. 
 But I think in the game, it was pretty close. 

 Q.  What aspect of your game are you most happy with? 
 YANINA WICKMAYER:  Well, I was not serving that well.  But my forehands and my backhands on the baseline were pretty good.  I followed her rhythm during the game.  I think that was my good game today.
