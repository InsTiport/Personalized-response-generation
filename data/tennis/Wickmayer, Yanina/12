  7-5, 3-6, 6-1

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. You served well for the match: 75% of your first serves and you had some momentum going into the third set. After the weather break, it seemed things fell apart. What happened? 
 YANINA WICKMAYER: I think she played a very good third set. She made almost no mistakes and played really smart. 
 I guess I was the one making too many errors.

 Q. Can you talk about all the momentum swings in the match? You both went on long streaks of winning many games in a row. What do you do you think causes that sort of match? 
 YANINA WICKMAYER: I don't know. I guess I started off really well the first set, um, got really tired after that, and she came back and pulled up a great fight; second set I played well; third set I made so many errors.

 Q. Talk about what changes you need to make in your match preparation when it's really hot and humid in order to play a match like today. Is there anything you do definitely?
 YANINA WICKMAYER: We try to recover better than other matches and take care of our recovery the best we can. 

 Q. Does it matter to you whether you play day or evening? Did you request that? 
 YANINA WICKMAYER: I haven't played evening here yet, so I don't know which is the best.

 Q. You saw you played Victoria Azarenka a practice game. Was that the first time you hit with her?
 YANINA WICKMAYER: Uh-huh.

 Q. Seemed like you were getting very emotional and angry at times on the court, you know, with ball kids and stuff. Do you think that ever distracts you during matches? Is that something you're trying to work on? 
 YANINA WICKMAYER: I didn't get mad at the ball kids. I get mad at myself. I guess if things are not going the way you want it to, you get mad sometimes.

 Q. Do you think it's a problem for you more than for most players. 
 YANINA WICKMAYER: No.
