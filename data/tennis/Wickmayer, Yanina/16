  7-6, 1-6, 6-3

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. You could have won the first set. You won the second set but for the loss of one game. What happened after that?
 YANINA WICKMAYER: Well, I think I had my chances in the first set. I started off a little nervous. It was new, playing that court. It was a big match for me, so I started off a little nervous. I think I did a good job hanging in there the first set and finding my rhythm. 
 Second set I think I played great. I really did what I had to do, got aggressive. I got broken in the first game, third set. I think that gave me enough confidence to serve well. I must say she served really well during the whole match, but especially in the third set. She put a lot of pressure. 
 But I try to keep doing what I was doing. I'm glad the way I handled the pressure and the way I handled the match. I think I did a good job. 

 Q. You played her before. How is she playing this time on her comeback? 
 YANINA WICKMAYER: I haven't played her before. 

 Q. Are you more disappointed for the loss or are you happy for the great experience?
 YANINA WICKMAYER: Well, of course I'm disappointed. I had my chances in the first set. I could have served a little better in the first game of the third set. 
 But, I mean, it's a great experience for me and I'm really glad the way I played, the way I handled everything. I think I played a good match. It's good for the future. I know what to work on. I saw what points still need to be better. 
 I felt today I'm really close to playing great tennis. Just a little bit of work still has to be done. But it's great for the future. It's a good motivation for me.
