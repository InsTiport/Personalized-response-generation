  Q.  How do you feel you played today?   
 SU-WEI HSIEH:  I think it's okay.  Just little bit nervous, I think, because from the beginning, because the court, so make me little bit reverse.  But after that, I feel okay, but still have a little bit pressure of her because she's world No. 1.   
 That's a pressure I have from after the beginning, yes.

  Q.  Even six months ago.   
 SU-WEI HSIEH:  Six months ago?  Oh, that's good question.  I don't know.  I just feel the thing is -- what I think is change, I feel like more confidence on the court.  That's all.
