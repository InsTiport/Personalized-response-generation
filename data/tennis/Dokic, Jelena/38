Q.  Was it a good fight for you?

JELENA DOKIC:  Yeah, it was good.  You know, it's always good to win a match at The Championships.  She played well this year.  It's a little bit of a faster surface, so it was a little bit harder to adjust.  I haven't been here for that long.  But, you know, the first set was very tight.  I shouldn't have let her get back in, but I did.  She played well to get to the tiebreaker.  It was a good match for me to get through, winning straight sets.

Q.  Did you rest a little bit the last couple days?

JELENA DOKIC:  A little bit.  I had a day or two off.  I didn't practice very much.  You know, I was a little bit injured after how much I've been playing, and tired.  I thought it was a good idea. 

Q.  How does it feel to play The Championships for the first time, compared with a regular tournament?

JELENA DOKIC:  Well, you have to try not to let the occasion get to you.  You've just got to treat it as a normal tournament.  You know, it's my first time.  It was really good for me to play, especially to win the first round.

Q.  Were you content with the decisions of the referee all the time?

JELENA DOKIC:  Well, I mean, I think we've seen a few complaints already this week.  You know, it's something  -- it's a fast surface.  I mean, I'm sure everyone makes mistakes.  No one's perfect.  You get a bad call.  She thought she got a few also.  You just have to forget about it.
