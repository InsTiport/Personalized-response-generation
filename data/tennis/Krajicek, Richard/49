Q. Richard, this was a very short match. Was anything the matter with your knee or
something? Something wrong?

RICHARD KRAJICEK: No. If there was something the matter, it was more in my brain, I
guess. I haven't played too much tennis since Hannover. And, I just wasn't sharp at all.
Malivai was taking the chances he had to take, but I didn't make it too difficult for him.
Unfortunately I just didn't play the tennis I wanted to play. I felt healthy physically.
