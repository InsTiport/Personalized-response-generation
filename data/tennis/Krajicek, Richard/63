Q. What is your view on the new electronic machines being experimented out there?  How does it affect your serve, if at all?
 
RICHARD KRAJICEK:  I mean, I haven't really noticed it.  I mean -- I don't think we played my match with the electronic line calling, but I have played with Cyclops before, and I think that is good for the serve, but for the rest of the court, I don't have a judgment about that because I never played with it. 
 

Q. How would you assess the way you are playing coming into this tournament?  
 
RICHARD KRAJICEK:  I am playing okay.  In practice I am pretty happy the way I am hitting the ball.  I would have preferred to have played little bit better in my last tournament.  I just won one match there.  But I mean, I was hitting the ball okay in the match today, so that is a good sign. As long as I keep hitting well in practice, I think I will be okay for the match.
