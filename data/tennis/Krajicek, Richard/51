Q.  Is it?

RICHARD KRAJICEK:  I think it is a good idea because the way Agassi played today, it was not so good.  And you think if he feels tomorrow the way he felt today, he is not going to be any better.  So, I think for the crowd it is good that the fresh player who is not sick, not injured, can join the competition.


Q.  You have got a great opportunity at finals at 5-5, Love-30.  What happened, what is your opinion?

RICHARD KRAJICEK:  What happened is that Goran just served every serve as hard as he could.  He served good first serve, 15-30.  Then aced second serve, 30-All.  Then first serve aced.  Then second serve aced.  He served at least an ace  first or second serve.  Most of the time second serve.  I think he hit more second serve aces than first serves.
