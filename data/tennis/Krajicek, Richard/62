Q. You won in straight sets.  Was it an easy match?  Was the weather any hindrance at all?
 
RICHARD KRAJICEK:  First two sets I played very well. Actually at 5-1 in the second I should have won the set 6-1.  Then mine after that I played a little bit less and as soon as I got the break in the third actually I took it a little bit easy. Just kept on holding my serve and on the return games, I didn't try to waste too much energy. Just served it out eventually.  First two sets I played well, and pretty happy with the way I was playing.  The heat was pretty -- it was okay.  Two days ago it was really bad and compared to two days ago it was pretty comfortable today, actually.
