MODERATOR:  Questions.  
 
 
Q.  You had a pretty demanding first set before the match was cut short.  How did you feel out there today?
 
RICHARD KRAJICEK:  Not so good.  I was playing pretty ugly actually.  I started okay.  1-All, I had one or two breakpoints.  I missed an easy forehand.  Suddenly the match just walked away from me.  6-1, 3-1, he had a couple breaks to go 4-1, double break.  I held on there.  The match didn't really change, but at least I was back in the set a little bit.  At least I was hanging in there.  I had a few chances, breakpoints I think at 2-1 to go back to 2-All.  After that, a little bit of a chance.  Yeah, I was really struggling today.  Especially at the net I felt very uncomfortable.  The first set, that's the reason I got broken.  I missed a lot of volleys.  Wasn't a good day at the office until then.  Actually got worse a little bit, completely terrible in the end.  These things happen tennis-wise.  Now what happened with my foot, I don't know what that is.  But tennis-wise, it wasn't a good day.
