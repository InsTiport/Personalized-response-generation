 Q. Carlos said in the beginning of the match he didn't think that he was going to win,
because normally he always loses with you. Did you have the same kind of thoughts? Did you
say, I'm going to beat this guy because it always happens like this? 
 
 RICHARD KRAJICEK: Well, I beat him on clay, so I thought on hardcourt it shouldn't be a
problem. But if I attack him well, then he doesn't have -- he shouldn't have a chance. If
I play well, if I come in well, but, I didn't play that great and he was serving very big.
He didn't give me -- especially in the second set when I was on top of him, because I won
the first set. He just didn't give me too many returns because he was serving so big at
one stage and that was very difficult for me and then, after he won the second set the
match was pretty open, but the first two sets, I think, especially the second set, if he
wouldn't have served so well, I think I would have jumped him more and I would have won
the second set also.  
 
Q. He also said in the fifth set -- he remembered the fifth set of the French Open; did
you also remember that? 
 
 RICHARD KRAJICEK: No, I didn't think about that. That was completely different. This
was a tiebreaker in the fifth, so, no comparison.
