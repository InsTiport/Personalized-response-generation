 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Can you just take us through what happened out there?
 DUSAN LAJOVIC:   Yeah, not an easy match today, especially playing a guy who is not giving a lot of rhythm, serving very good and playing a lot of tricky tennis, and you can expect anything on the court, so you need to be mentally ready for this kind of a match.
 I was able to start good, especially because in the heat I knew that my chances are higher if the match goes longer, and I was able to start with two sets up which was a big advantage for me, and then he was able to clutch the third set.
 But I recovered a little bit my feelings in the fourth set, and I was able to use my chances when I had the chances.  Obviously when he's serving 210, 220 on the lines it's not easy to return so every ball I was on the ball I was able to put in the court and start a point, I think this was the key today on the match.
 Q. You mentioned about the heat.  How did that affect you out there today obviously one of the first hot days we have had?
 DUSAN LAJOVIC:   Yeah, I think in this case it was going to my advantage, because usually he knows to struggle a little bit in the heat, and that's why I was feeling that.  It gives me an edge over him, so I was able to use that in my advantage.
