 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. How are you feeling about the match?
 DUSAN LAJOVIC:   Well, I've got good feelings about the match.  I mean, I played some quality tennis today.  Obviously on the other side I had the guy who is playing really good, and he's probably one of the top guys that stayed in the tournament as a favorite.
 I felt really good on the court, first time in a while.  I mean, the matches that I won, I won fighting and not with the great tennis.
 Today I played a really good match, but I had a little bit couple of games where I lost focus and in basically two points in a game and against the guy that is from the top.  It's obviously not easy when you have to struggle for that kind of games in the end of the sets, and this was one of the key things today.
 So I'm positive after all after this tournament, and I'm disappointed right now, but looking toward future of this season I think I'm in a good spot.
