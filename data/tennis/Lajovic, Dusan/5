 6-4, 7-6, 4-6, 6-15
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. I was wondering if you feel a lack of freedom here since you cannot leave the hotel and if you fear that next year it's going to be the same all the time as it is not something that can be very difficult mentally for the players and for you in particular.
 DUSAN LAJOVIC:   Thank you.  Well, first of all, I think as long as there are regulations from the governments, I think we're going to live our lives in bubbles and I don't know for how long I can go like this, but this has been my sixth, seventh week I think now in a row in a bubble.  I've been half a day at home.
 So it's not easy, but for me personally it's not bothering me so much, I would love to be able to go out, walk in a park or something like that, but I'm in my room watching movies, playing video games, reading books and all the things that I normally do in a tournament.  As the older I get, the less time I spend around the city, maybe in a week I go twice for dinner out.  In this case you don't have these two times, so it's not a big deal.
 But if you go long period of time like this, then maybe you need to say, okay, now I need to rest a little bit.  And as I said, this is my seventh week in the bubble and five weeks before that in a pre-season in Barcelona, Spain where I was also taking care, but obviously there it was a little bit different.  But I'm on the road now for 12 weeks and I still feel fresh and I don't feel bothered by this, so I don't know how the other players are responding to this, but it can be very challenging.
