 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. You were so close today, can you give us your thoughts on how the match unfolded?
 KAIA KANEPI:   It was a tough match, really.  I was looking at the statistics and I saw that we both won the same amount of points.  So it's a bit difficult to lose a match like this, but I think she played really well and sometimes I played really good, then she played really good, yeah, it was a tight match.
