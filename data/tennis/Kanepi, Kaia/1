E. MERTENS/K. Kanepi
6-4, 6-1
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. Unfortunately you didn't get the win today, but still a brilliant achievement.  How are you feeling now that the tournament is concluded?
KAIA KANEPI:   I don't know actually because there is another tournament starting on Tuesday, so I don't really feel that something has ended.  We start playing in same place, same venue.  It's a bit different feeling than after normal tournament.  After you lose, you travel somewhere.
