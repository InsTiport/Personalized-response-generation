 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. .  
  
  Q. Which was tougher for you to deal with, the wind or Vera?  
 KAIA KANEPI: Both. (Smiling. )  
  
  Q. Can you talk a bit more? It seemed like the wind was very tricky today.   
 KAIA KANEPI: Yeah, it was blowing in every way. When I played against Jelena, it was the same thing, so I was a little used to.   
 But today was tough. I just didn't find the rhythm and the control of the ball.  
  
  Q. It looked like you were getting a little frustrated. Were you frustrated with yourself or the conditions? Where did that come from?  
 KAIA KANEPI: No, mostly with myself, but it has happened previous matches, too. So it's okay.   
 Just let it out, and I don't think about it next point.  
  
  Q. You had 60 unforced errors. Do you think that was mostly as a result of the conditions, the wind, or were you taking a lot of chances?  
 KAIA KANEPI: Well, 50/50, I think. I think I can't play wind about everything, so I didn't play as well, too. Vera obviously played very well.  
  
  Q. Toward the end of the second set you came back from losing Love-6 the previous round in the first set. Looked like you had the break points. Were you thinking, Okay, I can pull this second set out and force a third?   
 KAIA KANEPI: Well, yeah. No, I don't thinking like this, because I might pull one match, but I can't pull them all the time. So I still have to start from the beginning.   
 Yeah, but if I have a chance I try to grab it. Just try to play and hang in there.  
  
  Q. Making the quarterfinals of the US Open, how happy are you with your overall performance? Obviously you had some big wins in the third and fourth rounds.   
 KAIA KANEPI: Yeah, overall I'm very happy. I had quite a stable tournament. The matches wasn't so up and down in my game, so I'm happy about my rhythm.  
  
  Q. How would you assess Vera's play? How do you think she played today?  
 KAIA KANEPI: Well, I have watched her before and I know how she's playing, getting a lot of balls back, and when she has a chance she's aggressive. She's top 10. She has to be good.   
  
  Q. What are your plans from here? What do you yourself term as a successful tournament? What are your plans from here on out?  
 KAIA KANEPI: I go home I think for a week, and then I go to Tokyo to prepare. I play Tokyo, Beijing, Moscow, and if I get to Bali, then also Bali.  
  
  Q. What are you gonna take away from your successful tournament here? What do you think was the best part that you learned about yourself making it this far?  
 KAIA KANEPI: The fighting spirit.
