MODERATOR:  Questions.  
 
 
Q.  How do you feel?
 
GUSTAVO KUERTEN:  Yeah, it was a great win, a lot of fight.  I feel very happy right now.  I'm enjoying a lot.  Things were difficult for me.  I had to work out everything I had, you know, my game and my mental performance.  I really feel that I just gave everything that I learn all these years in this match to win.  At the end, was a great payback, just having these great feelings in the court with the crowd, having a tremendous win like this.  
 
Q.  What do you think was the turning point for you during the match?
 
GUSTAVO KUERTEN:  Well, I think didn't really had a turning point.  You know, just the sets were going for one side to the other just because of one or two points, that's it.  I had set points in the second set, too.  After that, I think I start to play a little bit more aggressive, you know, returning a little bit better.  But all the sets was just until the end decided by very little.  We both play great match.  One had to win, so I'm lucky it was me today.  
 
Q.  Do you think your first serve quit in the first two sets? 
 
GUSTAVO KUERTEN:  I lost my serve only once all the match, so I don't think that's a problem.  I lost one serving.  I don't know, 30 games maybe I serve.  It's not bad.  It's good.
