 Q. You must be getting more and more confident. It was another pretty comfortable day
today? 
 
 GUSTAVO KUERTEN: Yes, I play really well. I think I just had a good practice this
morning, was feeling very good on the court, too. So was one of these days things going so
well that you don't have to do more often, just keep playing. 
 
Q. And you felt comfortable physically? No problems, no reactions?
 
 GUSTAVO KUERTEN: Yeah, I mean running -- I had good runs, served well, too. I didn't
have anything that would stop me to go or to do any -- I was able to do everything right.
So it's good to have this feeling back. 
 
Q. And is there any pressure? Do you feel any pressure coming back here as defending
champion?
 
 GUSTAVO KUERTEN: Well, I think I got here in a tough situation, too, my first
tournament since this injury. So I just enjoy having this good time again on court, and
just enjoy more when I'm playing and I think this can relieve my pressure.
