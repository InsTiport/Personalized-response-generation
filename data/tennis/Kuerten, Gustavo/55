THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  In the first set you both had the same number of break points, but you managed to come away with the set 6-1.  Do you think it was the difference in the match and from there it was easy for you?

GUSTAVO KUERTEN: Yeah, I think the result didn't really show how the match was played, you know.  Especially first set, we were playing at kind of same level, but I was able to play better the important points and manage to, you know, play big wins when I need some.  That some time makes a huge difference, like today.
