Q.  You had some troubles last week with your back at Indian Wells.  First of all, how are you feeling today physically?  And second, are you concerned about the number of small injuries that you have been having over the last -- well, since the French Open? 
 
GUSTAVO KUERTEN: Well, I am feeling much better now.  I always have a little injuries, but nobody knows because nobody looks for me before.  After they start to look and now they see.  I am not so strong, so I can play one day and I have to rest the other.  Sometimes I play two days, it is difficult for me. 
   

Q.  How are you going to go into the French Open this year?   Do you consider yourself a favorite again?
 
GUSTAVO KUERTEN: I think not too many chances for me.  It is like 128 guys.  Only one wins.  So it is tough to get into the end.  But I think I have more -- some advantage that I played last year, and I got used to it a little bit. And I feel great playing there. Also, the guys want to beat me now because I am the last champion.  So it is going to be  a different and interesting tournament for me. 
   

Q.  Do you feel a lot of pressure going into the French?
 
GUSTAVO KUERTEN: I don't know.  I think I am not going to die if I lose.  So it is not too much pressure. 
   

Q.  Are you a person who puts himself under pressure easily?
 
GUSTAVO KUERTEN: Well, sometimes I think you have to put a little bit pressure on yourself to try to play better, but you also -- all week we have pressure.  We have to win all matches each day.  So who can handle better this can play better, I think. 
   

Q.  What do you think are the chances of Pete Sampras in winning the French Open?
 
GUSTAVO KUERTEN: The same as mine.  Not too many guys, it is different.
