THE MODERATOR:   Questions in Spanish for Guga.  
 
 
Q.  Did you think at any time you could win the match?  Did you think you could recover? 
 
GUSTAVO KUERTEN:  During the first set, I was not very confident.  I didn't think I could make the right shots.  When I was able to finally break his serve, I felt the match was close to being mine.  When the set was 5-4, I had the points to win, I made errors.  I don't know, I felt more in the game during the second set.  I thought in that set, things were going to be closer to being mine.  But until the end I fought, tried to find a way to recover and win the match until the end, until he beat me.  
 
Q.  When you were 5-4, you had a massage.  What happened? 
 
GUSTAVO KUERTEN:  My right leg, I had surgery.  When I play on these courts, I get tired.  That's why I asked for help, to be more relaxed towards the end of the set.  Tried to calm the situation to see if I had any chance of winning it.  
 
Q.  This is the second year you're in Madrid, and you lose in the second round.  Why? 
 
GUSTAVO KUERTEN:  I don't know.  Maybe the fact of going through the first round makes a difference in a tournament in general.  Maybe the situation is going to be at least until next year.  Next year I'll try to do it better.  Well, this is a very important tournament, so I really want to come back and play well.
