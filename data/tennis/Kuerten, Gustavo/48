THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  Could you tell me a little bit about Mr. Pless.  How far do you think he can go in the future, in the next few years?  How do you think of him as an opponent? 

GUSTAVO KUERTEN:  I think he's playing pretty well already.  Long time ago I saw him playing French Open, he played well too.   I knew match was gonna be like this.  You know, he hit the ball hard, so I got to be ready for that.  And I think I played a good game.  That's why I beat him in three sets.  And he's relaxed.  I think he has potential to go farther than he is.  I don't know how far.
