MODERATOR:  Questions for Gustavo.  
 
 
Q.  I know you only got to play barely two sets, but how would you say you're playing right now?  Are you playing some of your best tennis?
 
GUSTAVO KUERTEN:  Yeah, I'm pretty much  -- I have more confidence in my game.  Win three matches in a row, it's maybe only the French Open, maybe once more, I had three wins in one tournament this year.  So I feeling every match maybe a little bit better.  Just for sure I'm ready to play tomorrow.  I think I was lucky a little bit not playing that much as the other.  
 
Q.  You have such a great one-handed backhand.  What's the toughest two-handed backhand in the game these days?
 
GUSTAVO KUERTEN:  Agassi, I think. 
 
Q.  In what way?  How so?
 
GUSTAVO KUERTEN:  I think is the more consistent with power together.  He place early, take your time out.  At the same time, he's not missing too much.  It's like he's all the time putting a little pressure in the opponent. 
 
Q.  Your LA match was a wonderful display of the one-handed versus the two-handed backhand.  Have you ever wished to have a two-handed backhand like Andre?
 
GUSTAVO KUERTEN:  Every time we play, it's a lot of points like this.  I think especially for the return of service, it will help me in case if I had, you know, two-hands backhand.  At the same time I can reach a little farther than them, you know, at the angles, maybe do it a little better.  You lose a little bit here, you get something there. 
 
Q.  Ever try a two-hander in practice just for the fun of it?
 
GUSTAVO KUERTEN:  No.  I usually play with two hands until 13.  It was my weakest side, so I think it was the right change.
