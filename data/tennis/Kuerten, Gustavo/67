THE MODERATOR:  First question, please. 


Q.  Could you tell us how you feel?

GUSTAVO KUERTEN: Just lost, so I'm disappointed.  I wish I had won. 

Q.  What do you think made the difference in the match?

GUSTAVO KUERTEN: One point only. One point.  If I had won that matchpoint, I would have won.

Q.  What was going through your mind after that?  Did you think then that you kind of relinquished it? Did you still think you were in the match?

GUSTAVO KUERTEN: No, I tried to win until the end.  So that's good I guess. 

Q.  You were 40-love up and Rusedski came back to deuce to break you again.  What were you feeling at 40-love up, you were in control and you lost it?

GUSTAVO KUERTEN: Yes, I lost my focus a little bit.  And it's danger, one point to the other, he was already there.  And I didn't do the right thing that time. 

Q.  You had a lot of supporters, Brazilian supporters. There were also a lot of British supporters out there.  Do you think they played a part at all? Were you aware of the Brazilian supporters out there?

GUSTAVO KUERTEN: Yeah, it's good that I have a lot of crowd with me.  But I think he have much more crowd tonight.

Q.  Greg had a couple of problems with line calls himself.  Did the way he went to the umpire affect you at all?

GUSTAVO KUERTEN: Not gonna change.  I lost already, so it doesn't matter.
