MODERATOR:  Good afternoon, Ladies and Gentlemen.  Gustavo Kuerten.  Questions in English, please. 


Q.  How did you find the grass out there today?

GUSTAVO KUERTEN:  It was okay.  I think probably the toughest thing was my opponent, who is a tough player.  He played well the big points, got a lot of breaks when he needed, you know, the right shot in the breakpoints.  When I had a couple opportunity, he was serving well, too.  I think that was my main problem today on the court.  But I was feeling well, hitting the ball well.  Just probably crucial points there.  If I would have won a couple of them, maybe I would even play better and rise my confidence a little bit. 

Q.  Will you be coming back to Wimbledon?  You've missed the last few years. 

GUSTAVO KUERTEN:  Yes, I think so.  As far as I feel healthy, you know, with some chance to play well and win matches, for sure I will play back.  I always enjoying playing here a couple matches.  Sometimes it's not easy, you know, when you have a long clay court season.  It's just right after.  But I think it's very enjoyable, so I see with good chances me to play more years.
