Q.  Magnus, can you talk about the match?  Norman won. Davide had a hard time coming back after Gaudenzi retired. 
 
MAGNUS GUSTAFSSON:  Well, I think it was, as you said, very important that Norman won.  It would have been a really tough tie otherwise.  I was so nervous when Norman was playing.  When he won, I felt like all the nerves that I had the last weeks just disappeared, almost like another human being out there.  I felt also I was very tired because I haven't been sleeping that well lately actually.  Today I know I'm going to sleep so well (laughter).  Even say worse comes to worse, we would lose the doubles and anything, I know that I've done something for my country.  I just go out there and play very relaxed and have a lot of fun.  I think I was playing pretty good today, but I feel sorry also for Davide, because he never find his  game. 
 

Q.  Can you discuss how important it is to go into tomorrow's doubles match 2-0 up?
 
MAGNUS GUSTAFSSON:  Of course, with Andrea not playing, it's a big, huge advantage for us.  But you can't take anything for granted in these days.  I think that Jonas and Nicklas will be so eager to play tomorrow.  Exactly what happened last year in the final when Pete, when he got injured.  So I think they will be so focused tomorrow, and they will do a great match. 
 
If they win or not, I can't tell, but I'm sure they will do a great match.
