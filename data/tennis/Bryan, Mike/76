   TIM CURRY: We'll open up the floor for questions.   
  
  Q. Patrick, do you see an advantage to the playing schedule that you have with the with James going first?   
 CAPTAIN McENROE: Yes, I see an advantage (laughter). That's the way we like to look at it.   
 No, we never really get too hung up about things we can't control. The schedule's obviously one of them. Both guys will be ready to play. Hopefully they'll play the way they've been practicing all week. We feel good about our chances.   
 We never really read too much into the schedule. The guys are used to playing at a particular time or sitting around and waiting a couple hours for the match to end. It's not something we really worry too much about.
