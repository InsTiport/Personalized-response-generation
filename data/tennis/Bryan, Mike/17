BRYAN‑BRYAN/Fognini‑Bolelli
  7‑6, 6‑1

Q.   Great win today.   One of the best teams of the year.   What did you think you did well today?
MIKE BRYAN:   I thought we competed very well today.   We stayed patient.   The breaks weren't coming early.   They were hitting great serves. 
We were just feeling them out.   We haven't played them for a few years, but I thought we played a really solid breaker.   Got in some baseline rallies, went toe‑to‑toe with them, which kind of raised our energy to know that we could hit with those guys.   They have some of the biggest forehands out there. 
We're really excited to come in here and get the job done in Monte‑Carlo.   It's one of our favorite tournaments.   We always play well because we're in a good frame of mind. 

Q.   It was your fifth title here, and 106th as a team.   A great way to start the clay court season for you. 
BOB BRYAN:   Yeah, it's been a great year so far now that we've won the last two Masters Series.   We're playing healthy.   To beat one of the top teams in the world in a big final, it bodes well. 
We're going to go home for a couple weeks, freshen up, come back to Madrid and hopefully play another good tournament. 

Q.   The first two months of the season, it's wide open with the doubles with some new teams.   It's quite nice, isn't it? 
MIKE BRYAN:   It's nice to see some new blood in the doubles.   Some younger teams are playing well like Sock/Pospisil.   It's exciting for the fans.   It's good to get some good, high‑profile singles players doing some damage in the doubles. 
We're happy with this little resurgence we've had.   We put ourselves in the thick of it in the Race, which is nice, because we started way back.   We're just looking to build from here. 
The big thing is that we're playing well and we have confidence.   The results should take care of themselves.
