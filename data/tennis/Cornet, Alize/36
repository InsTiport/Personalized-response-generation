 THE MODERATOR: Questions.   
  
  Q. How did you feel you got into the match eventually? It was difficult to begin with, then did you feel you were getting into it a bit more?  
 ALIZE CORNET: Well, it was pretty impressive to enter this Rod Laver court against Kim Clijsters. I was feeling a bit stressed the two first games, but I got into the match. I just tried to fight the best I can.   
 Well, I think I could have played way better and she could have played way better, as well. I cannot say I'm so disappointed, but I have some regrets because I think I could have done better in the first set, and I think I didn't believe enough in myself, so that's just a shame. That's all.   
  
  Q. What is difficult about her?  
 ALIZE CORNET: Well, she takes the ball very early. She plays very, very fast and close to the line. Well, she showed today that she was not volleying so well, so I think she has some work to do on this compartment of the game.   
 She plays great. Like she's always fighting from the first point till the end, and she's very consistent, very powerful. So, yeah, for me she's just the favorite of the tournament.
