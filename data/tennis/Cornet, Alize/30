  6‑7, 7‑6, 6‑3 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions for AmÃ©lie.   
   
 Q.   How does that feel going into tomorrow?   What are you thinking?  
CAPTAIN MAURESMO:   Well, I am thinking that we still have two more points to win.   It's very basic on this.  
It's the result for today, that could have been‑‑ we thought it could happen, of course.   
So I think now we were going to look forward to tomorrow's day and see how is everyone and how we can plan the second day.   
   
 Q.   Alize, obviously you won the first set; then it went away.   You were there, but I guess your thigh or something started bothering you.   Tell us a little bit about what went on.   
ALIZE CORNET:   Yeah, just started to have pain on my adductor.   Madison was playing very good.   She didn't let me finish the match.   She was playing better and better in the match, and especially in the third set.   
So, yeah, I was very close to win.   It's of course disappointing, but it's only 1‑All.   Everything is going to be tomorrow, and I hope it's going to be for us.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel you'll be able to play or you don't know at this point?   See how you wake up?   
ALIZE CORNET:   Exactly.   We see how I wake up and we make a decision tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   AmÃ©lie, just talk a little bit about Caroline.   She played unbelievable.   
CAPTAIN MAURESMO:   She played great match.   She played really great match, good level of play from her.   Didn't really let Sloane do what she likes to do and dictate and control the points.  
So it's a pretty exciting thing.   Yeah, looking forward for tomorrow.   She hopefully is in the same spirit.   
   
 Q.   I just wanted to clarify, the injury, is it your leg or upper leg?   
ALIZE CORNET:   Adductor.   
   
 Q.   Okay.   
THE MODERATOR:   Any more questions?   Thank you.
