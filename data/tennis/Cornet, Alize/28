 A. CORNET/A. Barty 
      6‑2, 6‑1 
  
    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please.   
   
 Q.   I'd like to ask you about the relationship between the French players and the French crowd.   I know it can be quite variable at times, sometimes it can be difficult.   Do you feel they are maybe more demanding of the French players than foreign players?  
    ALIZE CORNET:   Demanding, like what do you mean?   Demanding for who?   
   
 Q.   They expect so, so much.   
    ALIZE CORNET:   Oh.   Well, the French crowd was great today.   And I think it depends of how you're behaving on the court, I guess.   
    I think that now is the year the crowd gets nicer and nicer with me.   And I think, you know, you just have to try to call them to make them being behind you by just fighting on every point and just giving them some emotion.   
    I think the French crowd is a tough one, but when you have it with you, it's unbelievable.   When you play on such a big court as Philippe Chatrier, it can give you wings.   
    Today was not a really tight match, but I felt like the crowd was always behind me and feels really good.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel that the crowd sometimes tend to get behind the French male players a little bit more than the female players?  
    ALIZE CORNET:   Yes, I think so.   I think so maybe because the men's French player have more personality, I don't know, more character.  
    But I have the feeling that when there is someone like Jo or GaÃ«l Monfils or Gilles or Jeremy Chardy, you feel like they are really into the match 100%.   When there is the girls playing it's a little bit less.   
    But still, you know, they just expect good tennis.   As long as you play good and give your best, they are behind you.   So it's okay.   The difference is not huge.   
   
 Q.   When, for example, like last week in Strasbourg the crowd being not quite so nice, how do you deal with that?  
    ALIZE CORNET:   During the match, I try to forget about it.   I just try to stay focused on my game and don't think about it, because it's really tough to deal with a tough opponent and a tough crowd, especially when you're home, which is weird.  
    But after the match, it was like really disappointed by the attitude of the crowd.   And really because I didn't understand it.   I had a good attitude on the court, I was fighting, I was trying my best.  
    And for three years that I have been playing in Strasbourg, they just don't like me there.   I don't know how it can be possible, but apparently they just don't like me.   I cannot help it.   I'm trying my best.   
    But of course it doesn't make me want to go back there so much.   It's a shame, because we have very few tournaments France.   So it's a shame.   
    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French, please.   
   
 Q.   How do you feel after this first victory as French No. 1 here in Paris?  
    ALIZE CORNET:   That's incorrect information, because I was No. 1 in 2009 and I won some matches, so I know what it is winning in Roland Garros, being No. 1 in France.   
    But it's different because now I gained an experience.   I played a very solid match.   I felt no anxiety walking on the court.   I just felt I wanted to play, which is very different from last year, first round, when I was very nervous during the entire match.  
    But I just wanted to play my tennis, to play my game, which is what I did and I won in two small sets.   I think I deserved it.   
   
 Q.   How does it feel winning in 58 minutes?  
    ALIZE CORNET:   Strange but good, efficient.   That's what I'm working on at the moment.   I tried to play as short matches as possible.   I try and be the boss on the court.   And winning 6‑2, 6‑1 in less than an hour, that's good.   And it shows I imposed my game.   I'm not just playing marathon matches anymore.  
   
 Q.   But it's also very important for the rest, because your objective is week 2, so you want to save energy.   Do you have this in mind when you walk on the court?  
    ALIZE CORNET:   Yeah.   I guess.   It's the first time I have such high ambitions for Roland Garros, because I know I have the required level.  
    And strangely enough, I'm calm on the court because I know I have huge ambitions, I know I'm a good player.   It's all a matter of confidence and trust.   I have more confidence in myself.   I start the match with authority.   So that's very encouraging for the rest.   It's a very nice feeling.  
   
 Q.   I just wanted to know what you thought about this dancing battle between Monfils and Lokoli, who won.   And why didn't you take part in that battle?  
    ALIZE CORNET:   Because I was at the hairdresser's, and because I couldn't spend all afternoon on the Chatrier, although it was very nice.   But I had Laurent's first dance in front of everyone.   I thought it was very courageous, a bit crazy.   And after everyone started talking about the battle, so did I.   
    But I think it was very nice.   It gives a young image of tennis guys present on the court to have fun, and that's very much in line in Laurent and GaÃ«l's personality.   I think GaÃ«l was much better, but Laurent did well.   
    And there are a few years between them, and that was good for GaÃ«l.   But I'd like to see them again in a few years' time.   
   
 Q.   Laurent overdid it.   He was dancing, making the show, gave a press conference before his match today.   You were successful when you were young.   What do you think about it?   Isn't it dangerous?  
    ALIZE CORNET:   I think he does what he wants.   It was his dream qualifying for Roland Garros.   He's overexcited.   He is everywhere at all times.  
    And when I was young there were people with me who were telling me to focus, but I think it can be good for him because he will play other Roland Garros tournaments.  
    I think he must make the most out of it.
