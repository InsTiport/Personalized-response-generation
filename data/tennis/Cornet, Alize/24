 A. CORNET/K. Flipkens
  6‑0, 6‑7, 6‑3  
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   That must be one of the toughest matches you played.   
ALIZÃ CORNET:   At least one of the longest, yeah, I think so.   It was really tough, because I won the first set very easily, 6‑Love, 20 minutes only.   I was feeling good.   And then, you know, second set was tough.   I got a little bit intense.   
Kirsten played much better after the medical, because I think she was bothered by her knee and then she could run normally.  
So, yeah, still, I mean, I stayed in the set till the end, till 6‑All, and then I'm two points to the end of the match, I cannot make it.   Then I have to play a third set and was 3‑Love down in the third set.   I was like, Wow, how I'm going to turn around this match?   It's impossible.   She was playing better than me.  
I was tired.   I was sweating.   I was dead.     Finally, I made it.   Don't know exactly how, but I think I just kept fighting on every point and it worked out.  
Each time against Kirsten, such a huge fight.   It was the same in the latest match in Wuhan.   It was three hours' match, as well.   I knew what to expect today.  
   
 Q.   It was a very emotional match for you, wasn't it?  
ALIZÃ CORNET:   Yeah, because ‑‑yeah, it was emotional because I proved myself that I could actually, you know, stay calm in the third set, which I didn't do it in the beginning of the second set.   I got really nervous.  
I could come back from a really tough score, and that I could behave very good on the court and still win the match.  
So proved a lot of things to me.   That's why I was, yeah, very emotional and because I'm dead.   I think the emotional level is here when you're tired like that (indicating over her head).  
   
 Q.   What did you tell her or say to her after you were finished?  
ALIZÃ CORNET:   Well, we hugged because we are very good friends, as I said before, and she told me ‑‑she told me, Putain.   It's like an insult in ‑‑no, but, I mean, it's a bad word in French.   It's like shit.   She said, Putain.   She was exhausted, as well.   I told her, What a big match again.   
She said, Yeah, again.   Again, you.  
But she remains a very good friend.   We know what to expect when we play against each other.  
   
 Q.   You said she was a good friend.   Did her injury distract you?  
ALIZÃ CORNET:   No, no.   I think it distract none of us, because when we are on court we are very professional.   And I'm used to play against player that I like.   Then it's all about the match.   It's all about the competition, about winning.  
No, I was not bothered by that.  
   
 Q.   You had three bad calls in the second set and in the tiebreaker.   
ALIZÃ CORNET:   One for sure was good.   Then the other, I don't know.   But I would have really needed my Hawk‑Eye and my challenge on this one.   It was my fault.   I used it too early in the set.   Then when I needed it, I didn't have any more.  
It's very frustrating when you play on center court and have Hawk‑Eye, yeah, it's tough.   But I got over it at the end and I'm very proud of this too.  
   
 Q.   What would you say to the linesperson?   Second‑to‑the‑last one, you were right, it was in.   
ALIZÃ CORNET:   Oh, yeah?   
   
 Q.   It was.   They showed it.   
ALIZÃ CORNET:   They showed?   Oh, my God.   You know what I told the chair umpire?   I told her, When you will see the replay, you will think of me.   You will think of me.  
   
 Q.   It was clearly in.   
ALIZÃ CORNET:   It was clearly in, and it was such a big point.   Well, it's, you know, it's part of the game.   I'm lucky enough to play on center court already.   
I mean, the other courts obviously don't have Hawk‑Eye.   So you have to play with this bad call.   It's part of the game.   Players were playing before us without challenge.  
You still have to keep your nerves.   It's like that.  
   
 Q.   Is that an art form, knowing when to use those challenges?  
ALIZÃ CORNET:   Yeah.   You know, well, for sure it gave me a lesson today that when you use it too early in a set, then it can really screw you.   I will be more careful next time.
