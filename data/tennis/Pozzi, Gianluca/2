Q. How happy were you to play today, at least to have a chance in this tie even though it was decided? 
 
GIANLUCA POZZI:  Quite happy.  At least I had a chance to play my first match in Davis Cup which was 3-Love, it was a big chance.  I was happy to win the match because I wanted to try my best and do as well as I could. 
 

Q. And also to be a part of this occasion?
 
GIANLUCA POZZI:  Yes. 
 

Q. Talk about your feelings about the country being in the final again.
 
GIANLUCA POZZI:  I think it is pretty big for Italy because tennis is not as popular as it was a few years ago and I hope that this will bring few more fans and few more people on the courts in Italy. 
 

Q. Did you have a lot of people calling you yesterday and today?
 
GIANLUCA POZZI:  Not too many because we prefer to stay by ourselves not to have too many people around.
