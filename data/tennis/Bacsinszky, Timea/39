THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   What does it mean for you this period in your life, this period in which you have won two tournaments and now you won a lot of matches in three sets?   Great moment, great matches, and so on. 
TIMEA BACSINSZKY:   Well, it's a great period, I guess.   I mean, I cannot complain.   I still find a way to win matches, so I'm really happy about that, and I'm really proud.
It's definitely the best period of my life.   I mean, even already for two years now I am really enjoying what I'm doing, and I think I show it also on court. 
Even if I would have lost today I would have been really happy.   But my achievements, and, you know, losing a tennis match, it's only a tennis match at the end.   If you walk off the court knowing that you gave your best and you tried to work, make work the other one as much as you could, then, I mean, that's the goal of my every match I play. 
But I'm lucky enough that I'm through this round, and I hope, yeah, I will play a good match in the next round.

Q.   How did you find the conditions outside today?
TIMEA BACSINSZKY:   Well, I think I can call myself a good ‑‑like I adapt myself really well, actually, for already two weeks now.   With the heat of Acapulco, wind of Acapulco and humidity of Acapulco, and later on the freezing weather of Monterrey.   Then the hot weather in Monterrey weather and freezing Monterrey, rain and almost snow in Monterey.
Here, dry Indian Wells with a lot of wind and no wind at the end of the match.   I mean, everything is going on while I'm playing.   So I just tried to adapt myself. 
I don't wait anything special right now.   I just try to, yeah, adapt it, and I do it pretty well I assume so far.   So, yeah, weather here is fun.   It's okay.   I'm going to adapt even if there is a sandstorm in two days. 
So it's okay.
