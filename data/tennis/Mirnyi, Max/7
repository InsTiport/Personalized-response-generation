 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Daniel, this is your third title in Shanghai. How is this one special?   
 DANIEL NESTOR: Well, obviously winning such a close match, seesaw at the end, was nice to win. Beating the team that's probably been the best over the last few months, the most consistent, they won a lot of matches, a lot of tournaments, beat all the best teams. So it's nice to, you know, beat them in a very tough, grueling match. Not grueling, but mentally grueling.   
 They got us pretty good in MontrÃ©al, hometown, so it was nice to get a little revenge.  
  
  Q. What happened after the first set when you turned it around?   
 DANIEL NESTOR: Just strung a few returns together, got up a break. You know, we just put it together, I think. In the first set we both had moments where we were returning well, especially Max, he was returning well the first, I wasn't returning that well. I started to return better in the second.   
 Third set tiebreaker, it's just a matter of a couple shots, a couple lucky shots here and there. But fortunately we held our nerve and won in the end.   
  
  Q. Can you speak about the fact you now have three titles, which is maybe a bit low on the scale of both of you, but how does that carry forward for the next two, three, four weeks?   
 DANIEL NESTOR: Well, I think it's huge momentum-wise because we haven't strung together too many matches in a row. This week we played four solid matches. Confidence always comes from winning matches. So we're not going to, you know, sit back and enjoy this. We're going to play Vienna, Basel and Paris and try to keep them going, hopefully playing our best by London.
