MAX MIRNYI: Yeah, certainly. 

MAX MIRNYI: I think it's more exciting rather than difficult. We come from basically the same country, know each other very well. Any time we play, we're going to bring the best of one another. Today was another example. Fortunately for me, I was able to raise my game level from the tiebreaker on, keep it the same till the very last point. 

MAX MIRNYI: I haven't won a Grand Slam in singles, so I don't know. I feel I'm physically fit; I'm actually quite happy. The more matches I play, the fitter I'm going to get. We still have the finals tomorrow, then I have two more tournaments till the end of the year. I'm going to try to capitalize on that. 

MAX MIRNYI: Well, I never had any doubt about myself. Whether it was going to be this week or last year or next year, I wasn't going to change any of my training habits. My attitude stays the same whether I lose or win tomorrow. I'm going to do my best to win my first title. But, you know, I like my tennis. I enjoy training. I guess it was just a matter of time. 

MAX MIRNYI: Well, my dad and I, we have a different relationship. It goes far beyond just coaching. He's been very supportive of my career ever since I started playing tennis. Up until now, he's been with me through all the highs and lows. We just share a lot between ourselves. Coaching is just a small portion of what we have between us. I owe a lot to him because if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have been sitting here today. 

MAX MIRNYI: First time I came there was in '91. 

MAX MIRNYI: Yes. 

MAX MIRNYI: Well, I feel very fortunate timing-wise because just when I left Belarus, it was right after the breakup of the Soviet Union. Sports wasn't a primary thing there. There was so much political issues that were needed to be solved. Right at that time I was given the opportunity to go to the best tennis school in the world, in my opinion, hit tennis balls, you know, study. I finished high school there in Bradenton. I feel very fortunate that I was given that chance. 

MAX MIRNYI: No. This was just a general high school. I didn't go to college. 

MAX MIRNYI: Well, I have a semifinal match today. There's still a tough two matches. In order to win, I need to win today. I'm just going to look at today's match. David and Martin Damm are tough opponents. You know, it's another tough match. We're going to spend some time now, speak about how we're going to play, try to win this one. 

MAX MIRNYI: I understand. I really don't hesitate much. I learned a while ago the type of tennis I play is very effective. If I do it successfully, it's going to produce results. It's a matter of me just polishing this way of playing. When I capitalize on my serves, my volleys, my aggressive coming forward, it's tough to beat me. 

MAX MIRNYI: No. I think I was a typical junior player at the age of 10, 12, 14. As I was growing bigger physically, people that were surrounding me picked it up quicker than I did, and they were developing this game from about the age of 16, 17. 

MAX MIRNYI: Very much so. It feels as if I can't die. There's always something that I can rely on. Whether it's serving or returning, it just feels like it's out there for me today. I can't really get fazed by the match points or the score. I try to play every point separately and try to win it. 

MAX MIRNYI: It's certainly a good feeling. It's not a dream because I am in control of what I do. I know these guys for a while. I'm not a newcomer to the tour. I've played the tour now for five years. I've had some success in doubles. I've played a lot of these guys in doubles and I've beaten them. I think that's the fact that's helping me to cope with these victories today. I know that I'm capable of beating them. It's just a matter of putting everything together which I'm doing this week. 

MAX MIRNYI: So far in singles, yes. 

MAX MIRNYI: Obviously, the finalists are the best two players in a tournament on a given week. Whoever it might be, it's going to show that these are the two players that are in the best shape for the time being. It's going to be another tough test tomorrow - hopefully one I can come through. 

MAX MIRNYI: No, no, by far. I started growing at about age of 17. 

MAX MIRNYI: Yes. Sort of, say, a late-bloomer (smiling). 

MAX MIRNYI: Mixed doubles actually (laughter). 

MAX MIRNYI: No, singles has been a priority for me ever since I started playing. I've always paid a lot of attention to doubles because it's another good way for me to train my game and develop it to a perfection. It's also another good way of spending time at the tournament when you are eliminated from singles. Having these facts considered, I've always played doubles. You know, I never thought of turning into just doubles player, specializing only in that criteria. I've always played singles. Up until today, I have structured my schedule for the year around my singles. Doubles is just an addition to the whole picture. 

MAX MIRNYI: Well, maybe for the last two years since I've been playing more singles matches on tour, I have been choosing my weeks for doubles. I'm sure that if I stay healthy and physically fit for my singles, I continue to play a lot of singles. I will be choosing my doubles weeks, but I will still be looking to continue to play successful doubles. When I do play doubles, I will try to win. 

MAX MIRNYI: Well, just a good statement for myself. I proved to myself that I am able to play at the top level. It's just a matter of putting, like I said yesterday, these weeks together, play on a consistent basis throughout the year, raise in the rankings. 

MAX MIRNYI: Certainly winning a Grand Slam is something that stays with you for your life. Lleyton and I share that between ourselves. We're respectful of one another. But besides that, when it comes to playing a singles match, when you have an opponent on the other side of the net, that's how I approach every singles match. It doesn't matter what you have in common and what you share. If it's Lleyton, then it's Lleyton tomorrow. If it's Tommy, then it's Tommy. Tommy and I are also close friends. We've stayed at Bollettieri's camp since '91. We both have a lot in common. 

MAX MIRNYI: Well, besides the results, mixed doubles, doubles, occasionally singles matches that I've been beating top players, I'm mainly proud of the fact that I've been fairly consistent. I haven't had many injuries, which I'm happy of. I spend a lot of time off the court dedicating a lot of time to my fitness program and be able to play a full year. There are many characters in this game who are having very high and low results due to the injuries. I wouldn't like to be one of those because, you know, I like the game. If I can prolong it for as much as possible, that's what I'm going to do. 

MAX MIRNYI: It's not up to me to decide. If anything, I can contribute to the fame of the country, I will - whether it's through sports or any other activities. But, you know, it's up to other people to decide what kind of a sportsman I am. I'm just doing what I can. Let people decide for themselves. 

MAX MIRNYI: Well, in a circle of sports, I am. But in a country like Belarus, little by little we are getting a little bit more recognition around the world. But it's still overshadowed by many political problems. Just on a day-to-day basis, there are people living their lives, not thinking about sports or tennis in particular. 

MAX MIRNYI: Well, because I'm due on the court maybe in another 45 minutes. I wanted to get back to my routine after the match, come and see you guys so that I can prepare for my doubles match.
