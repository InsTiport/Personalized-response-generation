MAX MIRNYI: Very difficult, not only that we play a similar type of game, but the fact that he's a lefty makes things more complicated for me. But as the match went on, I got used to it - somewhere of the middle of the second set. Fortunately, you know, things went my way in both tiebreakers. 

MAX MIRNYI: Well, you certainly want a mini break to be the only break you actually need. But, you know, he comes up with the goods. It makes you produce better tennis. So I guess that's what we're out here for. It was great to see a good crowd here tonight, you know, to present this type of tennis in front of them. 

MAX MIRNYI: It certainly makes it more exciting to play. You have some kind of special cheering going on there. They've got their songs down, so it makes it very exciting. You know, especially for myself, I was very surprised having that fan club during the week on one of the outside courts. It was quite amazing. 

MAX MIRNYI: I feel good. You know, the more matches I can get in, it's better for me. That way I stay match fit. It's the most important thing for me. I have another hour or so before I go on. I'm just going to rest a little bit, get some food in me, look for another victory.
