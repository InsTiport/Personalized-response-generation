      6‑3, 6‑0, 6‑0

    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Has anyone ever played better against you?
    MARCEL GRANOLLERS:   Well, when you play against No. 1 of the world, is difficult match, no?   I think he play very good.   I didn't play of course a great match.   I didn't serve good.
    At the end, it's very easy match for him, but I have to be positive and thinking about I made a very good tournament here.

Q.   Is it possible to play well in the fourth round after having played five sets first round, second round, and third round?   It was going to be hard to be ever have a chance today, I guess. 
    MARCEL GRANOLLERS:   Well, even if I go three matches before in three sets, is difficult to beat Nole, no?   It's very difficult match for me. 
    I was trying my best, and I didn't play my best tennis today.   But I think he play very good.

Q.   What did you think about the atmosphere against Smyczek?   He was saying it felt a little like Davis Cup.   Did you agree with that?
    MARCEL GRANOLLERS:   It was a nice match, no?   I think we both was fighting a lot in the court, and was really nice atmosphere with the crowd.   I was really happy after the match, no?   Was 4‑1 down in the fifth and then I come back, and I was very happy.

Q.   What do you think about his potential as a player?
    MARCEL GRANOLLERS:   He play very well, no?   I think he's playing right now very good.   Solid, very solid player.
    For sure in the future he will play better, for sure.

Q.   Nole won the first 25 points today on his serve.   Was there something he was doing especially well on that? 
    MARCEL GRANOLLERS:   No, no, it was not easy to play today.   It was windy, and I didn't feel very good on my return.   (In Spanish.) 
    THE MODERATOR:   He couldn't play better.
