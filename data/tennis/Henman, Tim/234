Q. Toughest draw you could have got?

TIM HENMAN: I think so. Sort of after playing poorly last week sort of would hope for a
slightly easier match to feel your play into the tournament and get a win under your belt.
It is tough for both of us. We practiced together, I think, on Friday. Talking about the
match itself I think all credit goes to him. I think he can play probably much better than
that because everything I seemed to do, he had an answer for it. Hitting the big serves at
the right time and he still came up with some very good returns, passing shots, basically
took advantage of all those opportunities. It a little bit patchy. But I think at times,
yeah, I was serving probably as big as I could serve. At times -- I think in the first
service game - I don't know how many points we played, - but I probably made 75% of my
first serves and I was down breakpoint. I know he returns well, but I thought the way he
returned some of very good first serves, it was a big for him.
