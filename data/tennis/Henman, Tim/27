 Q.  Did you think you were on to something as you broke him as he was serving for it? 
 TIM HENMAN:  Yeah, I mean, I was beginning to change the momentum.  Obviously Andy had dominated the early part of the match and got himself into a good position. 
 But, you know, at that stage I was going to throw caution to the wind and just go with my shots.  I actually played some good tennis then.  After having the set point in the second set, you know, it would have been good if I could have got it to a set all and seen what had happened in the third. 
 But, you know, certainly wasn't my best day.  Wasn't to be on that point. 

 Q.  Are you kicking yourself after that set point?  You just get it and try to do what's possible? 
 TIM HENMAN:  I mean, yeah, that's what you want to try and do.  But obviously missing a shot that's pretty basic, you know, it's a shot that I shouldn't miss, wouldn't normally miss.  To miss it on a set point was pretty costly. 

 Q.  Do you see any changes in his game since you last played him in Basel? 
 TIM HENMAN:  I mean, yeah, he's definitely come a long way since then.  You know, he's much more experienced.  He's adding to his game, you know, getting a little bit more aggressive.  I think he's a lot more confident. 
 He's obviously having a good couple of weeks the last few weeks.  Sure he's going to be keen to keep building on that.
