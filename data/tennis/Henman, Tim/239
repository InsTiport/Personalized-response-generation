Q. Well, Tim, you must be very happy with the match win.

TIM HENMAN: Yeah. I was very pleased. I wanted to try to concentrate on my own serve.
The first couple of games I thought were important, then I started to create a few
opportunities on his serve and then I took them. Very pleased with the way I played.

Q. Tim, how much have you actually played since Telford?

TIM HENMAN: I hit with Courier yesterday for an hour and a half. That was the first
time I played in two weeks. So, to come out and hit the ball as well as I did today was a
big bonus. It was sort of a nice surprise for me.

Q. How much is the money a motivation in this tournament?

TIM HENMAN: Don't get me wrong, I prefer to have the money than not have it, but it's
not the reason why I play the game. I've always said it's more my hobby than my
occupation. It is nice to play in a tournament like this where there are obviously huge
amounts of money at stake, but I don't think the way I played today - it wasn't as if I
was just focused on the money. I was just happy to get on with things. And, I'll be
looking forward to playing the winner of Krajicek and Washington.
