 NICOLAS KIEFER: Whether I can remember a situation like the one today, yes, exactly one
year ago. My first match here went similar. Today it was as hard. I am always happy if I
win a match like this. It is good for your confidence. 
 Yes, I had to invest a lot of energy, but it paid off. I gave everything and also
tomorrow I will give everything. 
 I worked a lot on my physical fitness, maybe this was the decisive point today. I don't
know. 
 The No. 1 in Germany, I don't really care. The better player is always ahead. I don't
really care what the others do. If I win, I am happy. If I lose, I know what I am missing.
It is my aim to be at the top in the world, not in Germany. That is not important to me. 
 Last year I played extremely well. I didn't expect this myself. This year I was
sometimes better, sometimes worse. I have to find a balance. It needs some time and then I
will get there. 
 I haven't thought about the match tomorrow. Now I am going to play doubles first a
strategy for the match tomorrow. I will think about it tomorrow morning.
