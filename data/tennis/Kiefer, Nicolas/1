 Q. How frustrating is it to play against someone like Fabrice when he is having such a good day like today?
 NICOLAS KIEFER: I knew from the beginning what would happen and what can happen. I've played against him many times. I knew my plan what to do. This time of course he played very good. I didn't have my best day, and he always had good answers.
