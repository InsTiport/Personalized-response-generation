MODERATOR:  Questions. 


Q.  Talk about the match?

NICOLAS KIEFER:  I started very good the match, I was up 7-5, then 1-Love.  I started feel weak.  I was freezing.  Next moment, it was very hot.  I got a headache.  I didn't see the ball so straight.  I started thinking, "What's going on now?"  I took a medical time out.  But it didn't help.  I had to retire. 

Q.  Have you ever felt this bad before during a match?

NICOLAS KIEFER:  No.  It was the first time I had to retire because of weakness.  I had no strength anymore.  I was very weak and I couldn't see the ball straight.  I decided to stop.  But was the first time.  I don't know why. 

Q.  Was it the heat, do you think?

NICOLAS KIEFER:  No.  Normally I have no problem with the heat.  I played in Washington.  I played Cincinnati this year.  Cincinnati was very hot, every time over 100 degrees.  I don't know. 

Q.  What were your expectations coming into this tournament?

NICOLAS KIEFER:  Well, I prepared very good.  I was here one week already.  I practiced very good.  I felt strong.  Also this morning I felt okay.  But then finally something happened in my body.  I got a little fever, big, strong headache, problems with my ears.  Everything came together.

Q.  What are you looking forward to next?

NICOLAS KIEFER:  Well, now I'm going to go home, have a rest, make a couple checks.
