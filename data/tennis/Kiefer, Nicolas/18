THE MODERATOR:  Questions in English, please. 


Q.  Germany is a phenomenally enthusiastic nation.  With the end of Boris and Steffi and Michael Stich, do you feel quite a substantial amount of pressure on you to perform and live up to their sort of fill their shoes? 

NICOLAS KIEFER:  What is "substantial"?  Again, make it easier, the question. 

Q.  Oh, sorry.  Really, just that at the moment, Germany is used to a huge amount of success at Wimbledon, and clearly a lot of that expectation now rests on your shoulders.  Is that a difficult burden to bear? 

NICOLAS KIEFER:  Well, I have to say that what they achieved, Boris, Steffi and Michael, I think we can't do it anymore.  Boris won with 17 here, he just played great tennis his whole career, especially here in Wimbledon. For myself, I had one great year here, '97, I played my first time here.  I played quarterfinal, was my start of my career. And all of a sudden in this year everything came up to me.  I couldn't focus that much on my tennis.  I didn't know how to play anymore.  And then time by time, I took my time and played my tennis.  I focused on my tennis. For sure, everybody compares us, me to this time.  And the spectators from ten years ago, they are still the spectators now.  They want us to win every time, every week.

Q.  With Tommy Haas' exit today, you are now the sort of pretty much the sole hope?

NICOLAS KIEFER:  No, we have a couple more players.  It's sad that Tommy had to retire because of his back injury.  But still we have a couple more players, like I know that Rainer Schuttler won.  Maybe we can win a couple more rounds, but we have to go step by step.
