THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  You seemed very frustrated out there.  What were you frustrated about today? 

NICOLAS KIEFER:  No, I mean, I had big expectations.  I mean, I played so far a good tournament.  Also, I'm long time in the States.  I had many good wins, also a lot of confidence.  Well, I went out there, started very good.  But then I had one, two bad service games.  He played very smart game today.  I didn't get so many chances.  I was expecting to get more chances but, as I said, he played very good game.   I'm disappointed that I couldn't make it, what I did last few matches. 

Q.  Did he bother you at all with his movement?  He's a very quick player. 

NICOLAS KIEFER:  Yeah, but I'm also quick, so I know how he's playing.
