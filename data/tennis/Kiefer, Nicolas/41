MIKI SINGH:  First question, please. 
 

Q.  Congratulations, you just beat a No. 10 seed.
 
NICOLAS KIEFER:  No. 10?  Yeah, it was perfect for me.  Every time first match of a tournament is not easy. I'm happy to win. 
 

Q.  Any other future goals planned as you're facing MaliVai Washington next?
 
NICOLAS KIEFER:  I hope that I can beat him.  First I have to play.  I know he was injured, and he didn't play for a long time.  I think he's motivated, so it's not easy. 
 

Q.  Is this your first time coming to the Palm Desert?
 
NICOLAS KIEFER:  Yes, first time. 
 

Q.  How do you like it?
 
NICOLAS KIEFER:  Very good. 
 

Q.  What is wrong with your knee?
 
NICOLAS KIEFER:  I fell on my knee.  It's just to protect it a little bit.  I ice it.  Then I can play on it more tomorrow.  
 

Q.  Were you aware that your opponent was having some physical problems?  He took a time-out.  Right?
 
NICOLAS KIEFER:  He was injured, and he took a time-out.  Then? 
 

Q.  Didn't he ask for a time-out when he was preparing to serve for the match in the second set?
 
NICOLAS KIEFER:  I don't know.  He was up 5-2 in the second set.  I saw that he had some problems with his back.  I came back to 6-5.  I mean, he tried to win.  Then he won the second set.  Then the third set I was a little bit better than him.  I think that's not the reason, because of his back.  I played at the beginning of the first set and the end of the third set, I played very good.  Maybe he had some problems.  I don't know.
