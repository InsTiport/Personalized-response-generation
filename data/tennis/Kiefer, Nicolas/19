ATP: Questions, please. 


Q.  You saw the replay I believe from this ball which you obviously didn't like.  What is your opinion now after seeing the replay?   I don't know if you saw it.

NICOLAS KIEFER: Well, I mean, if it would have been  5-0  -- if it would have been 5-0 up or 5-0 0 down, then it would have been okay.  But he was up 4-3, I had a breakpoint, was my second one and I was standing there, I could hit the ball, but then the linesmen said "out" so I didn't hit the ball.  Then the umpire said that I didn't want to hit the ball.  So now I think if he sees in the replay he knows that he is wrong, but he is also just a person like me and like you, so this is tennis, it can happen and it happened.  But that is not the reason why I lost.  Fabrice played very good tennis today.  I had a couple of chances.  I made a couple of chances, but he was just too good.  Agassi tried to blow him off the court yesterday.  I tried to play a little bit slower and sometimes a little bit faster, but I couldn't find the right solution.

Q.  Amazing how much he returns.

NICOLAS KIEFER:  Well, he is returning very good.  He is running like a rabbit or something like this.  He is very quick.  So I have to hit every ball not only one time, but 10, 15 times.

Q.  Wears you out?

NICOLAS KIEFER:  It doesn't matter if it's any other player, the ball is over, but Fabrice, it is not over.

Q.  It wears you out a little bit?   Cost a lot of energy.

NICOLAS KIEFER:  Sure, especially I was down 3-Love in the second set and I had a great break, I broke him and this   -- it cost a lot of energy, this break.  After this game I had my chances.  I felt quite good but also I -- my legs, they are going to be a little tired.  Then he start playing very good again.  I made a couple of easy mistakes, but his tennis I have to play a little risky against him.
