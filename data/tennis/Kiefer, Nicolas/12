THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 


Q.  When you see the number of players in the tournament from Germany, France and Spain more than the US, then you see five Belgian men, more than Australia has, do you think there's a shift taking place in the power centers of tennis more to Europe with the men? 

NICOLAS KIEFER:  Good question.  I mean, I didn't check how many Germans are in the draw, how many Swedes. 

Q.  10 Germans, 12 French, 14 Spaniards, 9 Americans. 

NICOLAS KIEFER:  So we beat the Americans? 

Q.  Yes. 

NICOLAS KIEFER:  Good.  No, I think you say we have 10 Germans in the main draw, it's great for the German tennis.  Few times people say German tennis is down.  Okay, we have many players around a hundred, but good young ones.  I mean, they qualify here.  What can I say?  I think it's great we have so many people in the main draw. 

Q.  Surprised that there are more from all these smaller European countries than the US? 

NICOLAS KIEFER:  Germany is big. 

Q.  Not compared to the US. 

NICOLAS KIEFER:  Well, US is not in the whole world.  I mean, US, you have so many sports.  You have basketball, you have American football, you have all the other kinds of sports.  Germany is soccer and tennis.  I don't know if this is the reason.  I mean, still, also players who are injured, who couldn't play for a long time.  For example, James, he wasn't that lucky, but now he's on the way to come back. 

Q.  Do you think the development systems in Europe?

NICOLAS KIEFER:  Great.  You see we have 10 players.  12 from Spain. 

Q.  Why? 

NICOLAS KIEFER:  Why?  I mean, I can only talk from Germany.  In Germany we have like one center from German Federation in the south of Germany, one in the north of Germany.  Of course, if there are 10 players in the main draw, everybody is happy.  If there are only six, the question starts, "Where are the rest?"  At the moment we should be happy we have 10, but maybe next year we have 15, or maybe less.
