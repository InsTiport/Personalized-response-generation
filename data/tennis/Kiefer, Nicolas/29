 MODERATOR: Questions for Nicolas.  
 
Q. Can you talk about what it's like to play a countryman in the first round?
 
 NICOLAS KIEFER: Here at Wimbledon, it's nothing special for me. I play every year
against somebody from Germany. What should I say about this? I play each opponent I have
to play. I go on the court and try to beat them.  
 
Q. Are you feeling that you hope Germans do well or is it very individual?
 
 NICOLAS KIEFER: Here, especially this year, it's a little bit unlucky that one of us
has to go. It's not good for German tennis.
