MIKI SINGH:  Nicolas' second straight win over Rafter in as many weeks.  He'll play Greg Rusedski in the next round.  First question. 


Q.  This is a player which obviously suits you?

NICOLAS KIEFER:  You mean, he's one of the top players.  Against top players, you want to win every time.  I mean, he's playing very good.  He's serving very good.  He has very good volleys.  Hit good returns.  Today I returned very good.  I like to hit great shots.  When it was important, I had them.  I'm happy about this. 


Q.  What has Bob added to your game?

NICOLAS KIEFER:  He gives me some advices how to play.  I mean, I try to do it.  Today I could do it.  That's it.


Q.  What about up here (indicating head)?

NICOLAS KIEFER:  We are working mentally, physically, everything.


Q.  Two days ago, Patrick was clearly irritated with you after the match at Indian Wells, had some comments to make about how fiery he would be, how up he would be for this match.  He was not happy with you after Indian Wells, he said.  Did you sense the friction out on the court today?

NICOLAS KIEFER:  I mean, it's normal he's not happy because he lost to me.  He doesn't want to lose to me a second time.  I beat him a second time.  It's perfect.  For him it's not so good.


Q.  Do you feel like you had a problem with him at Indian Wells?

NICOLAS KIEFER:  No.  He's a nice guy.  I have no problem with him.  Since then, he doesn't talk to me so much.  I mean, I play my game.  I try to beat him.


Q.  Do you like the court here, the atmosphere?

NICOLAS KIEFER:  Yeah.  It's a very nice court.  It's a little bit slower than Indian Wells.  I mean, it's a nice atmosphere.  Spectators are great.  I like the sun. 


Q.  Any other added incentive to beat him other than he's a top player?

NICOLAS KIEFER:  Yeah, for sure.


Q.  Other than the fact he's a top player. 

NICOLAS KIEFER:  He won twice the US Open.  I beat him twice now.  I can see that I can beat all these top guys.  Maybe in the future, I can win a Grand Slam, too. 


Q.  The upcoming Davis Cup against Russia, you're in good shape.  We have Safin playing very well.  How do you see this match-up?

NICOLAS KIEFER: I think it's very close because it's just three days, and we have to be in top form in these three days.  Yevgeny is playing okay.  He lost here first round, but in a very tough match against Vince Spadea.  He's playing good indoors.  Also Safin is playing very good.  We have to make three points.
