THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 


Q.  How did you pull up after the win?  How are you feeling after that win? 

NICOLAS KIEFER:  I mean, after a win, you feel always good. 

Q.  Body-wise, fitness-wise. 

NICOLAS KIEFER:  No, fitness-wise there's no problem.  Everything is so far under control. 

Q.  You had some injuries in the lead-up to this tournament, haven't you?

NICOLAS KIEFER:  Yeah, of course.  Just today I was much better.  I focused much more on my game, not so much on my ankle.  It helped.  Especially when I played my game today and I didn't let him play his game.  No, I felt much more comfortable than last two matches. 

Q.  How do you feel your form is coming together now?  Two long matches. 

NICOLAS KIEFER:  First of all, gives me a lot of confidence.  I'm happy that I can put some different things together in my game, what I was working on.  I mean, especially today I was very happy with my serve.  I was serving very good.  Also from the baseline, I was playing much more aggressive.
