 Q. This is your first time at the Open, right? 
 
 NICOLAS KIEFER: In seniors, yeah, I was in juniors. 
 
Q. How do you find it, particularly after winning two?
 
 NICOLAS KIEFER: I like it if I win, it is okay. It was good here, not so hot, nice
conditions, good weather. 
 
Q. I assume that you are satisfied with your game?
 
 NICOLAS KIEFER: Yeah, I mean today I played very good game. We had some tough games.
First set at 5-4 he broke me. Then I broke him back. I break him at 5-4 second set. He was
at 3-2 in the tie breaker. It's not easy, but I took my time. I played good. 
 
Q. What kind of an influence has Boris had on you?
 
 NICOLAS KIEFER: I mean, I learned a lot from him, we practiced together. He gave me
some good advice how to play, what to do better. I think it was very good for me. 
 
Q. But he's more of a serve and volleyer and you are a serve and baseliner.
 
 NICOLAS KIEFER: You mean he plays very good serve and volley? 
 
Q. Yeah.
 
 NICOLAS KIEFER: Sometimes I try to play serve and volley, especially today. I also
could play from the baseline. I don't care how I win, I just want to win. 
 
Q. Were you playing for Boris's Mercedes team before?
 
 NICOLAS KIEFER: Yeah. 
 
Q. Could you talk a little bit about that system, and do you feel that the German
tennis young players are becoming strong because he's still involved with the Federation?
 
 NICOLAS KIEFER: I think it's good. He practices with young guys, gives them advice how
to play. I mean now what we have in Germany, I think it is normal because the years before
it was a good time for German tennis because of Boris. And he won many tournaments, Grand
Slam titles. It's not easy to play it like him. 
 
Q. Do you think it's going back to that because Boris has such involvement still? 
 
 NICOLAS KIEFER: I hope maybe I'm one of these guys, but it's takes a little bit longer. 
 
Q. You are either going to play Tommy or Kafelnikov, have you played Haas in any kind
of a major tournament?
 
 NICOLAS KIEFER: Yeah, I played him. 
 
Q. Are you looking forward to playing against him?
 
 NICOLAS KIEFER: Why not? If he wins, I have to play him. If Kafelnikov wins, I have to
play him. I can't choose. 
 
Q. What would you say would be the biggest thing that Boris taught you when you got to
practice with him? Now that you are coming into your own, what would you say was his
biggest influence?
 
 NICOLAS KIEFER: Mental, and also my game. That's secret. 
 
Q. Without giving away the secret, can you kind of give us a little piece of a clue?
 
 NICOLAS KIEFER: If I give you a little piece, it is still a secret. 
 
Q. You said mental thing?
 
 NICOLAS KIEFER: Yeah, on the court, how to do better, how to practice.
