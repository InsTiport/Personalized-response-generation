GREG SHARKO: Questions for Nicolas. 

Q. What was the problem with the ankle?

NICOLAS KIEFER: No, it was no problem. 

Q. No problem?

NICOLAS KIEFER: No.

Q. But it seems like you couldn't run very good today.

NICOLAS KIEFER: I mean, I didn't play my tennis. There was no problem with my ankle. It
was just the tape was a little bit too tight. 

Q. Obviously you don't like to play against Fabrice. 

NICOLAS KIEFER: I mean, he's a tough guy to play against. I think I never beat him. One
day hopefully I can do it. 

Q. You were ahead of him in the second set, suddenly he broke back. The last two games,
it seems like you couldn't hit the ball properly, made so many mistakes. Was there a
special reason for that?

NICOLAS KIEFER: The whole game I didn't hit any ball quite normal. I served very bad.
Yeah, it's sad that it happened here in a Super 9 tournament. 

Q. You don't have any physical problem?

NICOLAS KIEFER: No. 

Q. What do you think you have to do to beat him?

NICOLAS KIEFER: Play much better.

Q. Tactically?

NICOLAS KIEFER: I was home, I didn't play tennis for two weeks. I was sick, I was
laying in the bed, had no practice. I came here without practice. Played every day one,
two hours. That's it. I need better preparation.
