Q.  Nicolas, today your match against Bohdan, were you surprised at the result?  How did you feel that you played today? 
 
NICOLAS KIEFER:  Last year I played against him. Three sets.  I didn't play so well.  He played okay.  I had a lot of chance.  He was better today.  I didn't play so good like yesterday. 
 

Q.  How did you learn from the beginning of the tournament and this particular match of the game on clay?
 
NICOLAS KIEFER:  From these two matches? 
 

Q.  Yes.
 
NICOLAS KIEFER:  I mean, what can you learn?  I didn't play my best tennis.  Monday against Mantilla, I played I think very good.  I think it was my best match on the clay court.  Today, I had a lot of chances.  I was up a break, 2-Love.  I don't know what happened.  But it wasn't my day.  
 

Q.  Is it difficult to keep the same level on this surface?
 
NICOLAS KIEFER:  Yeah, sure. 
 

Q.  So it's different than like fast surfaces where you can keep the same level?
 
NICOLAS KIEFER:  Center court is a little slower. Court 1 and Court 2 are a little bit faster.  But that's not real easy.
