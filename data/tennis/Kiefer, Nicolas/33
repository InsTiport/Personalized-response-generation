GREG SHARKO: First question for Nicolas. 


Q.  What were you thinking when he came back in the third set?  Were you starting to feel a little bit nervous?

NICOLAS KIEFER:  Not nervous.  I knew it's really a big competition against him because he never gives up.  He's fighting for every ball.  I knew it's going to be tough.  I mean, I was happy that I made the break.  But he played very good then.  It's good for me that I won. 


Q.  Big relief when he double-faulted?

NICOLAS KIEFER:  I mean, maybe he wanted to make a big serve.  But that's his fault.  For me it was perfect; I didn't have to do so much.


Q.  How do you think you've been playing so far this year?

NICOLAS KIEFER:  I think quite good.  I mean, I started very good in Australia, and then in Dubai, and also Rotterdam and London I didn't play bad.  I just had some tough draws.  I think I played very good.  So far, so good.  It's okay.


Q.  Was it Safin that beat you in Rotterdam?

NICOLAS KIEFER:  No, Rusedski.


Q.  One silly question.  Why are you now not wearing a hat when you play?

NICOLAS KIEFER:  Why? 


Q.  Yes.  You had your very short haircut; you now have a full head of hair. 

NICOLAS KIEFER:  When my hair is short, I have to wear a hat, otherwise I get a sunburn.  Now my long hair is protecting everything.


Q.  I wondered if you sort of grew out of it in more ways than one.

NICOLAS KIEFER:  Again. 


Q.  Were you wearing it before as  --?

NICOLAS KIEFER:  When I want to wear a hat, I wear it.  When I don't want, I leave it. 


Q.  What are you working on particularly with Bob Brett at the moment?

NICOLAS KIEFER:  I can answer that very short:  on everything.  I mean, I play a lot from the baseline.  I practice a lot from the baseline.  Also physically I did a lot.  I think I can see it in my match, in my game. 


Q.  How do you feel Patrick is playing at the moment?

NICOLAS KIEFER:  I think he's playing very good.  You could see it today.  His serve is very good.  He moves very good at the net.  I mean, that's his game, serve and volley.  He had some very good shots today.  Some part of his game I had very good returns and I could pass him. 


Q.  Was that the biggest key then, your returns?

NICOLAS KIEFER:  Yeah, I think so.  And also passing shots.


Q.  Have they sorted out what's going to happen about the doubles team for your Davis Cup match?

NICOLAS KIEFER:  We have a lot of solutions. 


Q.  Have they come to one yet? 

NICOLAS KIEFER:  No, not yet.


Q.  Do you have any particular views on what might be best?

NICOLAS KIEFER:  First of all, I play Indian Wells and Key Biscayne, then it's Davis Cup.  I mean, we have Goellner playing.   I can play with Goellner.  I can play with Boris.  Boris can play with Marc and Marc can play with David.  We can do a lot.
