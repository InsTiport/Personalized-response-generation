MIKI SINGH:  Nicolas is a 6-3, 6-2 winner over Mariano Puerta.  Second round he'll meet Patrick Rafter. 


Q.  I'm from San  Diego.  There's a tennis pro there who's quite knowledgeable who thinks you have maybe the smoothest two-handed backhand in the tournament.  Would you agree?  He is giving you a compliment.

NICOLAS KIEFER:  I mean, it's a compliment for me.  I think my groundstrokes are very good at the moment.  I practice a lot from the baseline.  Today I didn't make so many mistakes.


Q.  Have you strived to make your backhand smooth?  He says it's so smooth, your backhand. 

NICOLAS KIEFER:  Yeah.


Q.  Have you worked hard on making it smooth rather than jerky, I guess?

NICOLAS KIEFER:  I don't make it just like this (indicating).  I happens, just happens. 


Q.  What kind of shot do you give yourself against Rafter?

NICOLAS KIEFER:  I think it's not easy because he serves very good, has very good serve and volley.  I need to cover good returns.  I have to serve very good.  Then in the end, maybe I can beat him. 


Q.  Have you played him before?

NICOLAS KIEFER:  No, first time.
