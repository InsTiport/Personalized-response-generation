THE MODERATOR: Questions in Chinese.   
 Q.  How pleased are you with your performance today?  
LU JIA-JING: I played pretty well today and before the game I made an analysis on my opponent and today I served well. I played her before and my expectation is to play my best as much as I can, so I'm happy with my win.   
 Q.  Considering that you're an older player, how do you make adjustment for your physical energy in the game?  
LU JIA-JING: Yearly we trained much more than a game and yearly we play one game in a day, so I think my age is not a problem for me. Many top players like Serena and Roger, they also played quite well at an older age.   
 Q.  For many Chinese players like Wang Qiang and Zhang Shuai, like those two players, they played pretty well when they were older. Do you think Chinese players have these kinds of pattern to play better at a relatively old age?  
LU JIA-JING: Yes, for athletes of our generation in China we started to play tennis a little bit later than those from other countries, so our professional careers started also a little bit late and I think we got more experience when we played more years. But for the next generation of tennis players in China, we have more resources and training programs internationally, even coaches from abroad, so I think they will have a bright future.
