Q.  Are you glad the season is over once and for all? 
 
EMILIO SANCHEZ:  Well, for me, I think because of the way I am playing, play was over two or three months ago when the U.S. Open was finished. Even if I play all these tournaments and I try my best, this surface is always very difficult for me and for my game, so that was -- it is not that stressful as the hardcourt or the claycourt season for me.  
 

Q.  Any other questions? 
 
EMILIO SANCHEZ:  Thanks.  Merry Christmas.
