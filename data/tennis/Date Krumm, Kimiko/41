Q. How did you learn to use both hands on your return?
 
KIMIKO DATE:  I am left-handed and I learned to play right-handed.  So because I am left-handed, she can hit well with the left hand, too.

KIMIKO DATE:  And I also practice -- 
 
THE INTERPRETER:  She ask me to tell you that she wasn't real serious when she practice the left hand.  She practiced both hand. 
 

Q. How far can you go in the tournament?
 
KIMIKO DATE:  Because there has been some Japanese players who has been to best 16, but there hasn't been anybody who has been to best 8 and so for the first goal for me is -- being best 16, but now because I am best 8 I'd like to go as far as I can.

KIMIKO DATE:  I have beaten like Arantxa Sanchez, Sabatini, Mary Joe Fernandez. 
 

Q. Were you surprised by today's win?  Did you expect it?
 
KIMIKO DATE:  I thought that if I play my best I know that there is a possibility to win, so it wasn't a big surprise for me.
