 Q. Do you feel any pressure by being a hero in Japan?
 
 KIMIKO DATE: It would be a lie if I don't -- if I say I don't feel any pressure, but
right now him trying not to think about it too much. 
 
Q. How about the first set today, did you just get off to a slow start or was it
adjusting to the way Florencia plays?
 
 KIMIKO DATE: The reason why I lost the first set is because I knew that she was a tough
player and she be picking up balls, so I tried to hit the ball earlier and at an early
stage to adjust to her style. 
 
Q. You are going to be playing Brenda Schultz next. What do you know about her and what
do you think about the match?
 
 KIMIKO DATE: I know that she is a tall and a big server so the point is on my return
games and also how I can keep my service games.
