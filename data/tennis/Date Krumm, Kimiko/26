Q.  Kimiko, you made some mistakes at some times when you could have taken over the match.  Can you talk about those a little bit and why that happened? 
 
KIMIKO DATE:  (Through translator)  When it was 3-1 in the first set, I felt the pressure that Steffi was No. 1 and I had to play much better in order to get that point, but I lost -- I made a mistake.  
 

Q.  Did you have a particular strategy?  What was your strategy going into the game to try to beat Steffi?  We watched you move her side to side on the court.  Did you have -- were you looking at her backhand or were you trying to get her up to net?  What was the strategy that you were playing against? 
 
KIMIKO DATE:  (Through translator)  I try to play at the net as much as possible, but there was less than I thought.  For Steffi, I tried to hit it to her back as much as I can and then go up to the net, and also hit to her forehand.  If it goes in deep, I hit to her back.  I wanted her to run back and forth.  That's what I tried.  
 

Q.  What do you have to do to reach the top five in the world -- top three? 
 
KIMIKO DATE:  (Through translator) To get a better serve and to play at the net, play the net, volleys.  
 

Q.  Are you saying that your bad serve was the reason for losing in game?  You broke her service I think five or six times. 
 
KIMIKO DATE:  (Through translator) I was serving pretty well at the whole tournament, but for today it wasn't as good as I thought.  I prefer returning much more than serving, but in order to get into the top five or three, I have to get a much better serves.
