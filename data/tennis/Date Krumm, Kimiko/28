Q.  Kimiko, were you surprised that Jana didn't come to the net more when you played her tonight

KIMIKO DATE:  Last time I played her in Wimbledon she didn't come to the net that much.  So I was expecting her maybe to stay at the baseline more.  So I wasn't surprised.


Q.  Were you worried about losing the first game today, the first set?

KIMIKO DATE:  It's been a while since I've played a match.  And during these past weeks, I've been playing better than the past months.  So I wasn't worried.


Q.  Do you feel like this surface suits your game as well?

KIMIKO DATE:  Generally speaking, I like to play indoors.  And the surface is not too fast.  So I think it suits my style of tennis.


Q.  Probably you will meet Mary Pierce, probably.  What do you have planned to fight her with?

KIMIKO DATE:  Well, I don't know if I play her yet. So I'll think about it after the match is decided.  But when I played her a couple of years ago in the Australian Open she  just attacked me and beat me.  So I'm just going to try not to let that happen again.
