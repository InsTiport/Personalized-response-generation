  Q.  It wasn't until the 6th service game that you held serve.
 Why did you have trouble holding serve against her today? 
 
 KIMIKO DATE:  I do prefer receiving than serving, but I think
that I served very well today, but Conchita played much better
and that is why I couldn't keep my service games.

 Q.  You had beaten Conchita, I think, the last four times
you played her.  Why did she play so much better today?

 KIMIKO DATE:  Well, Conchita is the top player and I have to
play 100% or more better than that to beat her and she could play
that well in the four matches when she beat her, but this time
in her first set, she lost all her games and it was harder to
come back again with her own rhythm.

 Q.  Was there anything you changed mentally or physically
in the second set to make it closer?

 KIMIKO DATE:  I don't think -- I don't think -- I didn't play
that well today, but when she got into -- got into her second
set and when they were rallying and they are at the last point
she couldn't -- she misses and that is how she  couldn't get all
the points she wanted and that is how she lost a couple of games
in the second set too.

 Q.  Was there a particular weakness in your game today, particular
thing you were having trouble with?

 KIMIKO DATE:  There isn't nothing special that she felt that
she wasn't doing good today because the point itself wasn't as
bad as the score, Love-6, for instance, she doesn't think she
didn't play that well today.  She did what she can. I guess Conchita
played a little bit better today.
