Q.  Kimiko, congratulations.  Were you surprised, being down five match points that the match went as it did? 

KIMIKO DATE:  Yes, I'm surprised because I didn't remember how many times I saved match point.  I thought it was a lot, but I didn't know it was five.  Today the concentrating is very, very good, so I could concentrate on playing. That's why I play very well today so I could save five match points. 


Q.  Gaby in the semifinals; could you comment on playing Gaby in the semifinals tomorrow? 

KIMIKO DATE:  First of all, I have to get rid of exhaustion and then try to make a good condition as well as today.  I played with her several times and I just, now, I just think about I want to play as well as I played today. 


Q.  Can you summarize your match play today, how you played today? 

KIMIKO DATE:  I was very good concentrating, so the first set, I tried to play very well, that's why I -- little bit missed the hit.  And the service was good, return was good, but the key point was concentration.  I could concentrate very well today, and also strategy was very successful today. 


Q.  What does she feel the chances are for her to win the tournament now?  Do you feel you can win the tournament?  What are your chances? 

KIMIKO DATE:  It's very difficult question to answer.  If I can play as well as I played today, and also, I have to play my best tennis if I want to win this tournament.  So, it's very, very difficult, I think.  And also, physically, I'm very small, so physically very difficult, but I try to do my best.
