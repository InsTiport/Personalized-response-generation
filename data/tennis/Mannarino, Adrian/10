7-6, 6-2, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.   
 Q.  We get the impression that you had a problem with his slice backhand.  What was the problem for you?  
ADRIAN MANNARINO: Well, he was a problem, yes, but not with that.  He served well, very well.  I had a lot of trouble returning the balls, first or second balls, during the match, and his forehand is very fast.  You can't really see it coming.  He had very few bad ones.   
He's a player who puts you under extreme pressure.  He serves very well.  I felt I couldn't make a mistake in my serves.  But as soon as you give him time in the forehand, you know that you're getting a cannonball, and it's hard to negotiate.   
 Q.  Generally how did you feel today?  
ADRIAN MANNARINO: I didn't feel very good on the court, but it wasn't a bad day, so to say.  It was an average day, let's say.  But he's a player I always have trouble with.  Whether you're on a hard surface, grass, or clay, he beat me on all surfaces.  The fact that it's in the French Open, I don't think it was an added problem.   
He's just a player that has beat me, I believe, in the four, five last matches we played together.  He's a bit stronger than I am, and today I didn't manage to play the very good match I would have needed to play if I wanted to win.   
 Q.  You came to this Roland Garros with a new status, because people know you better than before.  Does that make a change?  Could you feel it on the court?  
ADRIAN MANNARINO: No, not necessarily, because in the French Open you're always very well supported as a French player.  The fact that my ranking is slightly up over the last year doesn't mean I have changed the status.  Clay is not a surface that I'm very much at ease with.   
It's another Roland Garros that ends a bit early, but that's the way it is.  It's frustrating not to have been able to enjoy the public, the Paris atmosphere longer, and that's it.   
 Q.  We saw you several times trying to return and not complaining but not managing to control the ball the way you wanted.  Would you say this was due to the weather?  
ADRIAN MANNARINO: No, I don't think the weather was a major factor.  He has a very good serve, and with a good rebound, I often have trouble returning his serve.  Either I take it from far and the ball was high and it was difficult to negotiate or I had to take it earlier, I tried to take it earlier.  But it had a lot of energy after the rebound and it was difficult to control.  So I didn't manage to really find the right area to return the ball.   
And on his side, he served very well when necessary.  I had a break point at 4-All in the beginning of the second set, and he had almost only good first balls, and it was difficult to return.   
 Q.  You say weather didn't play a major role. Obviously clay is not your best surface, but when it's wet like that, it's a disadvantage for players who are not that powerful, let's say.  
ADRIAN MANNARINO: I'm not a super-powerful player, and it's true that in heavy conditions like that, there was a lot of clay on the court, and it was even more difficult for me to put him in a difficult situation.   
He, on the other side, had more time to prepare for his forehands and defend with his backhand.  But weather is something I have no control over, so you had to make due with the conditions.  I didn't manage to do better than he did, at least.
