M. RAONIC/A. Mannarino   
6-1, 7-6, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French, please.   
 Q.  Hi, Adrian.  There was one set that was tight and the other two sets were not tight.  For one set you were really in the match; for the other two you were not.  
ADRIAN MANNARINO: I tried to do my best during the whole match, but he returned very well in the first and third sets.   
In the second set he had a sort of bad patch.  He didn't return so well.  When he returns in the court most of the time his returns are deep, so I had to defend even after my first serve.  He played very well in the first and third sets.   
Then in the second set it was tight; just a matter of a few points.  I could have taken the second set, but he was the better player and there is no doubt about it.   
 Q.  So you still have good intentions on clay?  You still want to tame this surface?  What did you learn today?  
ADRIAN MANNARINO: I haven't learned anything.  I can play well on clay if I'm eager to make efforts, but I don't want make lots of efforts on this surface.  So with Roland Garros, with the French tournaments, most of the time I enjoy playing them.  When I'm willing to play well I can get good results.   
Of course, I mean, the results are not top caliber results, but that's the way it is.  Haven't been that good on clay, but that's normal.   
 Q.  In order to recharge your batteries you could avoid playing on clay.  
ADRIAN MANNARINO: I think that I can play as well on clay as on hard courts.  I could have played very well in Monte-Carlo and in Bucharest.  I could have won those matches in those tournaments.  These were tight matches.   
So I don't need to skip the clay court season.  You can score points.  Maybe next year I will be more inspired in terms of my schedule.   
 Q.  Raonic, he has a very good coach, especially with Moya who is a clay court specialist?  
ADRIAN MANNARINO: When you server at 200 kilometers, whether on clay or hard court, it makes a difference.  Raonic is a great server and he returns even better, as I told you.  He has more time on clay than on hard surfaces.   
There is a negative side to his game.  He doesn't move very well on clay.  But he has a lot of firepower, so I think that Raonic can be a very dangerous player on clay.
