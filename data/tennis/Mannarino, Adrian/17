V. TROICKI/A. Mannarino   
6-4, 3-6, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.   
 Q.  Of course, that loss hurts.  How did you let it go?  Your season was tough, too.  How can you explain that?  
ADRIAN MANNARINO: It all was a matter of one point.  This is tennis.  It happens sometimes.  I'll try not to do the same thing next time.   
 Q.  On your two match points in the third set at 5-4, what did you have in your mind?  Were you tense at the end of the match?  
ADRIAN MANNARINO: Of course at 5-4 in the third when you serve for the match, it's always tense.   
I tried to do the same thing as I had done before, but with the tension it didn't work.   
 Q.  What do you think of this season?  How do you see next season?  
ADRIAN MANNARINO: You can see this in two different ways.  The first way is just to see it as that I played a bad match.  You know, sometimes you go to the locker rooms being enthusiastic, but here it was really bad from the beginning to the end.   
Now, I'm going to finish the year at an acceptable ranking between 50 and 60.  It is encouraging, knowing that when you play bad you still are at that level, but I'm extremely disappointed with that season.   
 Q.  Would you like just to forget this and start on something new?  
ADRIAN MANNARINO: Well, during the season you don't wonder about those things.  You just play.  But now the season is over, and I'll take time to think about all this and see what is best for me for the next year to come.  I'll try to be a better tennis player.   
 Q.  The results were not up to your expectations, but did you enjoy playing or was it really an ordeal from beginning to end?  
ADRIAN MANNARINO: No.  When I play so badly, it's difficult for me to enjoy tennis.  You know, if the only thing I have to do every day is my job as a tennis player and when I play that bad, it's tough.   
But it's up to me to change things, to make efforts, to improve my tennis.  But of course if I make efforts and things are not going better, at least I'll be satisfied with doing everything I can to improve.
