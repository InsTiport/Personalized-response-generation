H. ZEBALLOS/A. Mannarino   
7-5, 6-3, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.   
 Q.  Well, I think you started well and then, afterwards, it went wrong.  So what's happened?  
ADRIAN MANNARINO: Well, no.  I think -- I think it wasn't good from A to Z, but he was even worse to start with.  And then, when he started playing a bit better, he was on top of the game and that's all.   
 Q.  I think it was difficult for you with the break points, and you made double faults and drop shots that failed.  Is that because you didn't trust what you were doing?  
ADRIAN MANNARINO: No.  I think that I've not played enough matches recently, and I was playing not as well as he was.   
 Q.  Sometimes I have the impression you were not playing your full tennis.  Is that your feeling?  
ADRIAN MANNARINO: I couldn't find my landmarks.  I couldn't play such a match without my landmarks.   
 Q.  What next then for you?  
ADRIAN MANNARINO: I don't know.  I don't know.   
 Q.  Are you eager to leave clay?  
ADRIAN MANNARINO: No, not necessarily.  It's the way it is.  No choice.
