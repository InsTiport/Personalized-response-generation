 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Can you just take us through what happened out there today.
 ADRIAN MANNARINO:   You want me to talk about the match?
 Q. Yeah, if you could just talk about the match.
 ADRIAN MANNARINO:   Well, I think it was a good match.  I played a good level of tennis.  Conditions were really good, no wind, cool weather, good court, and everything was there for me to play my best tennis.  I'm really happy with the way I was playing.  It was really consistent.
 Also I think that my opponent was -- he has the type of game that suits me well.  He's giving a really good pace, and I was just moving well around the court and trying to defend as good as I could.  I also think I've been serving quite well in the key moments.
 No, it was a good match for me.  It was tough.  The score looks not that hard, but I think that was a really close match.  It could have turned around really quickly, so I'm happy that I was able to leave the court quickly.
