THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. Just how does it feel to be into your first Slam quarterfinal?
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: It's amazing.  I played great match.  She's a tough player.  So I'm just happy to be through and happy with my game.
Q. You've been in great form coming into this tournament.  So were you expecting something like this or hoping for something like this?
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: No.  I mean, you can't expect you're going play quarterfinals in Grand Slam, but I played some tough matches.
And I'm just happy with my game.  And I'm just -- yeah, really happy.  (Smiling.)
Q. You moved to Prague to train when you were 15, I think, and you were going there alone.  Can you talk about this choice and how it changed your life?
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: Sorry.  What?
Q. I read that you went to train in Prague alone when you were 15.  Can you talk a little bit about that?
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: Yeah, so I'm not from Prague.  I'm, like, two hours from Prague.  So I left my family there and go to Prague alone, and I'm still there practicing.  So I don't know.  I think it changed my life, but it was good.
Q. Very often when we see teenagers on the tour they have lots of ups and downs and maybe they're not so composed on court, but you seem very composed, very comfortable with your surroundings.  Can you talk a bit about why you think that might be the case that you're so comfortable?
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: I think I had tough last year because I was pretty new, like, to the tennis and to, like, pro scene, so it was tough for me.
But now I have found big team and great coach, so I think that helps me a lot.
Q. You play with a lot of variety and a lot of the drop shots and also topspin forehand.  Just how did you come to play like that and who taught you that?
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: I started to playing with one coach in my, like, city where I was born.  And he just play that on me, and I just learned it.  And, yeah, I just keep playing until now.
Q. Has anyone ever told you to hit fewer drop shots?
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: No.  (Laughing.)
Q. There's a long line of Czech left-handed players from the past.  You know, Martina, and now recently retired Safarova, and Petra.  What is it about Czech tennis that produces all of these left-handed players and how much of an inspiration are they to you?
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: I don't know.  I watch Petra when I was young, and I remember when she won Wimbledon, so I was looking up to her.
And, yeah, it's just great we have so many players.
Q. What do you think about the other teenagers that are approaching the tour or showing here at Roland Garros all their skills?
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: Like the young girls or --
Q. Yeah.
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: Yeah, I mean, I think there's a lot of teenagers now in the last 16.  So I think it's nice to see new generation playing so good matches.  I think the girls are playing pretty good, and it's just nice.
Q. Tell me if I missed it earlier but who were your idols growing up?  Who did you model your game after?
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: No one.  I was just watching Petra when she won Wimbledon, and I love Roger, but I don't have idol.
