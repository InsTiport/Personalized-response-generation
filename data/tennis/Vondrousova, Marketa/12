7-6, 2-6, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Kiki said she was getting very frustrated.  How did you take advantage of that?
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: Yeah, I fight for every ball.  I was running a lot.  So I think it was a great match.  Yeah, it was so tough for me, but I'm happy to get through.
Q. What did you think of the crowds?
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: It was amazing.  It was amazing.  We get a lot of support.  Both, I think.  I think they really enjoy it.  So was I.  It was very good for me.
Q. What do you think happened in the second set?  How were you able to turn it around the way you did?
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: I think she get better and I did some mistakes, but I was just trying to fight.  I was a break down in the third set, so I came back and I think that was the main thing.
Q. She's played so many matches this summer.  Have you had a chance to watch any of it?  What was your game plan going in?
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: I didn't actually saw any of it, but I knew she's gonna play good.
I was just trying to play my game.  I think she played really great tennis, but, yeah, I think it was my best match so far (smiling).
Q. What are you most pleased with about your game at this moment?
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: I think I played really aggressive and, like, the main points.  Yeah, I run a lot.  It was really tough for me, but, yeah, I just try to fight every point.
Q. You have a lot of variety in your game.  Are there any shots that you feel are especially working right now?
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: I think dropshot (smiling).  That was, I think, very hard for her, because she was getting tired.  Yeah, I think that was it.
Q. Many players are very superstitious.  Are you?  And if so, what sorts of things do you do or try to avoid on the court or before a match?
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: I think I don't have any.  I don't know.  I really don't know.
Q. How happy are you with this result after a really tough spring?  Does this give you even more motivation going into the next part of the season?
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: Yeah, I didn't have best season, but I think this is coming back for me.  This is my life result, so I'm very happy.  I think hard work has paid off.
Q. Some players, the transition for them, junior to the pro, would be very tough, especially on the financial part.  Have you ever faced this kind of problem in recent years for you?
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: Yeah.  Yeah, I know this is happening, but I had sponsors since I was, like, 14.  It helped me a lot.  So I didn't have problem with it.  But I know it's happening and it's really tough for us to, like, pay everything and coaches and stuff.
Q. You had such a tough loss last year.  How different of a player are you now from then, would you say?
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: I think I mentally get better.  I'm a year older, that's maybe the thing.
Yeah, it was a very close match last year.  Yeah, it was very close match this year, so I think I'm just mentally better.
Q. A year older, but still now the youngest player to make the second week of a slam.  Could you have dreamed of these results when you started playing?
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: Yeah, for sure, it's like a dream.  I'm very happy for it.
Q. Your thoughts on the next match.
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: I don't know.  I just need to rest and I'll play my game.
