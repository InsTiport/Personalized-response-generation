(Transcribed from recorded WTA audio.)   
 Q.  Talk us through the match.  Obviously tough opponent, but you already beat her earlier this year.  
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: Yeah, it was on hard, so it was different.  I just play great match, I think.  I was just really enjoying myself out there.  The crowd was amazing.   
I'm just very happy with the win.   
 Q.  How did you cope with the conditions?  Obviously rain all day yesterday, playing two matches today.  
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: We played yesterday like 30 minutes warmup, then it rained.  Yeah, it is as it is.  I just want to keep playing my game.  I'll do my best to do it.   
 Q.  Thoughts on playing Kasatkina?  
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: We played once also this year.  Yeah, she's a great player.  I'll talk with my coach and then we will see.
