Q. Obviously a disappointing result today.  What didn't work for you today?
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: I think she's a great player for grass, so I think she played a great match.  And I'm having some troubles with my hand, so that was, I think, also the key for the match, because she played my forehand and it hurt, so I think she knew that and she played it clever.
