THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions, please.
Q. Obviously you probably would have liked to have won, but your first Fed Cup match, you seemed to get more confident in the second set.  Talk a little bit about the experience.
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: Yeah, I was a bit nervous in the first set.  But then I just tried to play my game.
She played very well today.  Yeah, I think the second set was pretty good.  But, yeah, she has a better end.
Q. Not even two years ago, you helped the Junior Fed Cup win over the USA.  How is the Junior Fed Cup different from the Fed Cup experience?
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: There is much more people here.  Yeah, everything is like bigger and everything.  So, yeah, I think that's very difficult for me.
But, yeah, I just try to be confident and everything, just tried to play my game.
Q. You had to play eight matches last week.  It was hot out there today.  Were you a little tired or anything like that?
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: I'm here a week, so it just get better.  I don't feel so tired.
Q. How much would it mean for your next match tomorrow to still mean something?  I'm sure you want that to happen.
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: Yeah.  I'm just trying to stay focused, just be calm.  I think I can play better than today.  Yeah, I just hope it can be good.
Q. You've played a lot this season.  I think you've won maybe 40 matches or something, ITF.  Does it worry you that maybe you're playing too much?  Do you think you need those matches?
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: I played a lot of matches.  I think I am pretty confident, and a bit tired.  But I'm just enjoying this week.  I'm just happy that I can be here and play.
Q. It was your first time playing Coco.
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: Yeah.
Q. What did you think about her game?  What did she do maybe to bother you or that you weren't prepared for?
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA: She plays very well in the first set.  Yeah, I just can't do much.  She has a great serve.  I think that was a big reason for her to win.  Yeah, I think she play really well today.
