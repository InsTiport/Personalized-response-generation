I. SWIATEK/M. Vondrousova
6-1, 6-2
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. Tough luck, can you just talk through the match today.  Was that just too good from her or did you find the conditions difficult to play through?
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA:   Also but I think she was so good today, she didn't give me much chances, so I think she was just better.
Q. How tough was it, I mean I know you were trying to problem solve but was there anything that you felt like you, if you had done better you would be able to kind of get her off her game a little bit?
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA:   I don't think so.
Q. Was it tough for you to approach this tournament, even though you had the good experience in Rome, the really good tennis you played there, did it still bother you to have some pressure maybe in your mind being a finalist last year, was that hard for you?
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA:   Yeah, and also it's kind of different from Rome here, so it was kind of tough, but I think she just played very good today.
Q. There is nothing you would do different if you had the chance to play again, this same situation?
MARKETA VONDROUSOVA:   No, I don't really know what would I do better.
