 6-1, 7-5
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Can you please talk us through your match and how you were feeling on the court today.
 MARKETA VONDROUSOVA:   So first set I think from my side was very good.  Then I think she starting to playing well.  Also I did some mistakes.  I had, like, 1-3.  She had a set point also.  That was kind of luck because I think she did double-fault.  That was my luck.
 I started playing well again.  Just happy to be through.
