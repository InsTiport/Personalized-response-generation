THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How are you feeling physically right now?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I'm fine physically.
Q. What made the difference in the end?  Seemed like you were playing particularly well in the third set.
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I didn't win any of the match points.  I had an opportunity.  I didn't get it.
Q. What did you make of her play at the end?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: She plays very well, very aggressive.  She serves big.  She plays very well.
Q. How tricky was it in the stadium, given the very strong winds?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, it was definitely tricky, but I think for both of us.  It was a little bit of a gusty wind.
Yeah, I had my chances, and I didn't take them.  I lost the match today.
Q. What did you make of the delay?  Did you know it was going to rain last night?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I guess you never really know.  But it was fine.
Q. Is it just too soon to really process all of this?  What is going through your head right now?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I'm just ready to go back.  It's not the most fun part.
Q. Any particular problem with your leg?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No, it feels good.  It feels fine.  Physically I feel good.
Q. After being injured a little bit, did it feel to be good to be back out on the court?  Does it give you more optimism heading into the rest of the US Open Series?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, my body feels good, so that's a positive.  That's for sure.
Q. With the delays, having to come out today on a Thursday to play your first match, do you think that had any affect on your performance today?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No.  I think it was the same for both.  We were both delayed.  We both came out here.  Same conditions for both.  It was fine to be out there today.
Q. How do you feel after a loss like this in your first match of a tournament?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I feel like I would have felt after the finals:  it's obviously disappointing losing a match like this when you have the opportunity.
Q. Any thought on the injury from last week, any concern?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No.  It felt very good, so I'm happy with that.
