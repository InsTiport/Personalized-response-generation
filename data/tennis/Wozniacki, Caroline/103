6-3, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How do you assess your performance today?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: You know, she played really well.  She served really well, returned deep.  She was going for the lines.  It was going in.  You could see she had the confidence.   
Hats off to her, she played better than me today.   
 Q.  You know a lot about her game.  Did she surprise you today in any way?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I'd never played her before, so you don't really know until you've played them before.   
But she played really well.  That's what I can say.   
 Q.  How do you feel in your game, given where you are in coming back?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I'm looking forward to the season.  It's a better start than last year.  We just have to go from here, go back and grind and then come back and play again.  There's lots of tournaments ahead.  That's what I'm looking forward to.   
 Q.  Do matches like that sort of put a mark down, they make you realize where your game is?  Is there a positive in it?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: You know, I think it's never positive when you lose in a slam.  But, yeah, she played well.  I think if she keeps playing like this, then she has good chances against Serena.  Obviously Serena is a champion, has won so many Grand Slams.  She's been in tough positions.   
But I think Johanna is playing on a very high level right now.
