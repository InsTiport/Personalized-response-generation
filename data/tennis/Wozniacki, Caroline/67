6-2, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How do you feel about your match today?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Happy to be through.  It was not an easy match.  Maybe on paper it looks easy, but it wasn't.  Tricky lefty opponent with a lot of confidence.  I'm just happy to be through really.
Q. Do you feel good about your game?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, I feel pretty good.  I think it's a good start.  Hopefully I can progress from here.
Q. Are you aware of the other results in your half of the draw today?  Opened it up.
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No, not really.  I never look at the draw, to be honest, so I don't really know who is up next.  I saw a couple of results.  But, yeah, I don't really follow too much, to be honest.
Q. Do you know much about your next opponent?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Who am I playing?
Q. Fett?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I've never played her before.  So, no, I don't.  I guess I'll have to do some scouting and see how she's playing.  Yeah, I don't know.
Q. Can you tell us a little bit what the wedding was like in New Orleans.
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: It was a lot of fun.  I had a great time.  That's all I'll tell you.
Q. Serena gave you a nice shout out in a piece she did in Vogue.  What are your thoughts when you learned about all the troubles, medical issues, she went through after giving birth?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Honestly, I'm just happy she's doing good now and the baby is healthy and everything is good.  It's the most important thing.
Obviously it's scary when everything doesn't go smoothly.  You wish for everyone just to have a smooth pregnancy and everyone be healthy.  When it doesn't go that way, you just hope for a quick recovery.
