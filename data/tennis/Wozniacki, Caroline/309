  7-5, 6-0 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Well done.   
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Thank you.  
  
  Q. That was an up-and-down match until you got on top. Why did it switch backwards and forward like that?   
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Um, I was up 4-1 in the first set, and I had some chances actually to close out the set a little bit earlier, but, you know, she started to play really well. I made a few mistakes and she came back. She had the set points there, and I managed somehow to turn it around.  
 In the second set, I just knew it was important for me to start off well and try to get the first couple of games.  
  
  Q. Once you did that, was it mental that you were on top?   
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah. I believed now that this was my match, and now I just had to try to close her out so that she didn't get the believe back.   
  
  Q. Can you speak about the final against Kim, please.   
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: To be honest, I haven't thought about it yet. I'm just enjoying myself right now. I'm in the finals of the year-end Championships. I'm happy about what I've achieved.  
 Tomorrow is going to be a tough one. Kim's a great player. Yeah, it will be the last match of the season for me, so a little bit exciting as well.   
  
  Q. After you played her in the US Open, did you have a debrief afterwards to assess what you had done right and wrong?  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, I mean, I did. I talked about it and I went back on the practice court and practiced some things that I thought I could improve. You know, I try to improve all the time so I'm better next time on the court than I was the previous.   
 I just enjoy myself. Tomorrow I know it's going to be a tough one, but I'm going to give my all.   
  
  Q. Are you aware of what happened to Kim on the way here today?   
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Well, I heard. I had a few questions before on the court I think, and they told me that she had a small car accident.
