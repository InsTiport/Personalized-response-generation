C. WOZNIACKI/S. Williams
  6‑4, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Was it the match of the year for you?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Um, well, yeah, I think so.   I mean, Serena is a great champion and I have very much respect for her.   For me to go out and win against her ‑‑ I have lost the three previous times. 
I thought I played a very good match out there.   I'm very pleased about the way I was able to also close it out.
Q.   Were you surprised?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Surprised by? 

Q.   To have won Serena Williams for the first time. 
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Obviously I always believe I can win when I go out and play.   I never go out to a match and a say, Okay, I'm gonna lose this one. 
I believe in myself and I believe in what I can do.
Q.   What made the difference today compared to the three past matches?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I think I served well today.   I think my first serve in particular was good.   First time I played against her I had match points and lost 7‑6 in the third, so I knew that, you know, I had to╩do something or I had to serve well to close the match out, because she wasn't going to give me anything.

Q.   Your backhand also was very strong today.   You were stepping in and getting some, you know, winners.   Do you think that's an improvement from the past?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   No, I think it's always been pretty good.   I think in general I'm pleased about the way I played.   I didn't make too many unforced errors, and I made her run. 
I served well, and, then, you know, when Serena's serve is on fire it's difficult to do something about the first one.   I tried to put pressure on her for the second serve.
Q.   She said she was only playing 20% of her game.   Do you feel that?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   You know, I╩‑‑ I don't really╩‑‑ to be honest, I just play.   You know, I play against an opponent, and as long as I win, I really don't mind, you know, what's happening on the other side.

Q.   Were you surprised that at one point you had more aces than she did?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Oh, did I?   (Smiling.)
Well, that would surprise me, yes. 

Q.   Can you tell us what your father said when he came out and talked to you?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   He just said, you know, Just go for it.   Don't think about the score.   Just, you know, if you make a mistake, doesn't matter.   But don't just put the ball back, because you won't have a chance. 
So you need to just try to make her move and play it deep.

Q.   Was 5‑2 for to close.   She never break you in all the game.   What do you... 
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I knew she was going to step up.   I could tell that she really was motivated in that game, as well.   You know, she made some good returns. 
We had some rallies, I lost the game, and I was like, Okay, next one, next one.

Q.   Thanks God you have the second opportunity. 
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Yeah, exactly.   That was nice.

Q.   You have been sort of flying under the radar as of late.   Has this been helpful that you're no longer No. 1?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Yeah, I don't mind.   I mean, I can see now that the draw I have had has been pretty tough.   I mean, I could have met Clijsters but I played Wickmayer, who also played some very good tennis.
And then Serena in the quarters and Maria in the semis.   It's not easy, but I'm just pleased.   I just take always one match at a time.   I just play.   Any court is the same. 
If people talk about me or not, I mean, to be honest, as long as I win, I'm happy.

Q.   You talk about winning giving you more and more confidence and how important that is to you.   How much confidence is a straight‑set win over Serena Williams give you?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Well, it definitely gives you confidence.   Hard work always pays off, so, you know, I just keep going, keep working hard, and there's always room for improvements.
I'm just excited I can always improve my game.

Q.   For Maria next what do you have to focus on in that game? 
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   To be honest, I'm so happy I have a day off tomorrow.   I can actually relax a little bit, practice once, and then enjoy Miami.   And, to be honest, I definitely╩‑‑ again, she's a strong player, you know.   I have been playing well lately and hitting the ball hard.
So I need to make her move.   That's the most important thing, I think.

Q.   Do you think you're being underestimated right now?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   No.   I mean, I don't think so.   Well, definitely not more than I have in the past.   I mean, you know, I think especially media ‑‑ sorry, no offense ‑‑ but, you know, I have just had the╩‑‑ just a lot of times, you know, she does make many winners, you know, how can she win when, blah, blah, blah, they always mistakes.
But, you know, I don't mind.   I play to win, and that's all.

Q.   I saw your boyfriend.   Do you feel nervous if you see he's looking at you?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   No, I enjoy it.   I like it, and it was nice that he drove back down, because he wasn't here for my match against Wickmayer because he had to go back and practice.   He just drove up just before the match, which is nice.
His family and his caddie was here.   It's always great to have the support.

Q.   You moved very well also and you looked very fit. 
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Thank you.

Q.   A lot of players say they're feeling tired.   You look so fresh out there and you play like a No. 1.   How did you feel?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I feel good.   Um, you know, I always work hard.   I always do a lot of things to keep my fitness up and to try to prevent injuries. 
I think, you know, that pays off.   Obviously it's very tough to have two big tournaments one right after another.   But at the same time, I'm just╩excited to be in the semifinals in this big tournament.

Q.   Do you think she was more nervous than you today, tonight?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   No, I don't think so.   I don't know. 

Q.   You have obviously won a lot of tournaments and gotten to No. 1 for two years in a row and all that stuff, but you had never beaten one of the Williams sisters before.   In women's tennis, does that feel like an important accomplishment to have on your rÃsumÃ?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Well, I think it was important for me, definitely. 
You know, Serena has won so many Grand Slams and so many tournaments, something that I would love to achieve one day.   So to beat someone like her that I know that never gives up is definitely something that means a lot to me.
You know, there are some players if you lead 5‑1 in the second set, okay, you know that you pretty much have won the match.   But against someone like Serena, you know that you need to fight till the last point.
