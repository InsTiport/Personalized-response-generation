C. WOZNIACKI/S. Rogers
  6‑1, 6‑0

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.

Q.   Another compelling performance.   How can you rate your match today?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Yeah, it was a really good match out there today.   I felt really comfortable and confident.   I served really well, returned well. 
She's a tough player.   She has some big shots out there.   I was able to just neutralize them and play my game. 

Q.   Your next opponent is either Serena Williams or Lucie Safarova.   What can you tell us about both of them?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Well, they're both great players.   Obviously Serena has all the experience.   She has a big serve.   She takes the ball early.   I would need to try and make her move, try and open up the points, serve well myself. 
Lucie is a big lefty player.   Again, good serve, good returns.   She tries to play aggressively.   So really the same thing:   I really just need to try to make her move, try to dictate the points. 

Q.   You talked earlier in the week about the work you've done on your serve and return game.   What specifically have you done to improve those areas this season?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I've just served a lot and returned a lot really (laughter).   You kind of just get that feeling; you get in the zone.   You know that you can pull it out when you need to. 
I think that's really the key, just repetition, repetition all the time. 

Q.   Last couple of weeks you've made a huge change in your game, suddenly gone up.   What do you put it down to?   Confidence, a change in what you've done?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Honestly, I've always really felt confident and comfortable on grass and hard courts.   It's definitely the surfaces that I feel the best on.   I've done really good results here, the US Open Series, as well before.   It's tournaments where I feel at home and I like to play at. 

Q.   How would you compare the state of your game now and when you were No.1?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I get that question quite a lot. 
To be honest, I think I always improve and I keep improving my game.   So also I'm more mature.   I make smarter decisions out there. 
At the same time, you know, the women's tennis keeps improving as well so you need to keep stepping up.   It's getting tougher.   The girls are hitting harder, making less mistakes. 
It's all about keep improving and keep moving forward. 

Q.   Serena has kicked into another gear.   She was having a tough time the first half of the year.   When this happens are you like, Wow, or do you say, This is Serena, this is what she does?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I'm not surprised.   This is Serena.   Everyone has ups and downs a little bit in our careers. 
But, you know, Serena is obviously a great champion.   She's an unbelievable player.   You can see that with how many Grand Slams she's won, how many tournaments she's won. 
You know, it's never a surprise whenever she's doing well.   She's ruling the court. 

Q.   Outside of Serena, who do you see your biggest challenger here in MontrÃ©al?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I don't know.   I mean, my next match could be Serena or Lucie.   Right now I see them as my biggest challenge because that's the next match I'm playing.
