   THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Is it meaningful to clinch the US Open Series? Does it say you're playing well or is it nice to have that bonus money waiting there?  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No, it's just a great feeling. It means I've been playing really well. Look at this beautiful trophy. I didn't know I'd get one of these. It's really nice. I'm just happy about that.   
  
  Q. Are you glad to have the day off or would you prefer to get another match?  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Well, I feel sorry for Flavia, about her injury. I'm happy I have the day off. I can relax a little bit. I can come back tomorrow strong and rested.   
  
  Q. Last year you spoke about applying to Yale. What happened with that?  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, I wanted to apply to Yale. I wanted to actually apply this year, but I was so busy with so many things.   
 I'm still trying to figure out if there's a way that I can study one subject or two. We'll have too see.  
  
  Q. On an online basis, obviously?  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah.  
  
  Q. Why does that interest you?  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Because I like doing something off the court as well. I think it's nice to have something nice to think about than just the tennis. Yale is a great school, so it would be an honor to be a student here.  
  
  Q. Do you have classes or courses in mind that interest you?  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Definitely something with business and management. So I would have to look into that.   
  
  Q. Just to figure out what you're going to do with all your career earnings?  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Well, that would help, definitely.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about how much you've improved your game the last couple years, what areas you think you've really made major steps in.   
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Well, definitely I think the fitness part has improved a lot. I think I'm in a great shape at the moment. I think the experience, I've gotten more matches under my belt. And I think that, yeah, you know, after being on the tour for quite a few years now, I know what it's like. I feel really comfortable.   
 I have some favorite tournaments where I feel great and play well.   
  
  Q. This being one of them?  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Definitely (smiling).   
  
  Q. Any thoughts on tomorrow night's match against Elena?  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Well, she's a great player. She's been on the tour a long time, experienced. It's not going to be easy. It's going to be a difficult match, but I'm looking forward to it.  
  
  Q. Have you looked at your US Open draw yet?  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I never look at the draw.  
  
  Q. Never look at it?  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No.  
  
  Q. Is there anything you consider your strength right now when you're on the court?   
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I think I have quite a few strengths. I think, you know, definitely the part that I'm fighting, I'm always a fighter, I never give up. I think that's a big strength to this.   
  
  Q. Can you address the off-court aspect of glamour in women's tennis, the importance of that, how much you enjoy that side of it.   
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Well, for me fashion, dressing nice, has always been a big part of my personality. I like to stand out and be different.   
 I think I'm lucky that I have my own collection together with adidas and Stella McCartney, that I'm the face of that line. That makes it a little bit special. I think it's feminine and comfortable at the same time. Then I don't have to think about the clothes when I'm on the court. I can focus on the tennis. I think that's a great feeling.  
  
  Q. I think it was this time last year that the Stella McCartney aspect came up.   
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: At the US Open, my first tournament.  
  
  Q. At that time you were saying you didn't have that much involvement; you hadn't met her at that stage. Have things taken a step forward with that?  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Definitely, yeah. I mean, I've met Stella a few times. I mean, I talk to her and give her feedback. Definitely the collections that are coming now are very suited for me. Also that brings out my personality, as well. The way I like things.   
 I think Stella is a great designer. She makes great things. It's nice she listens and wants to learn.   
  
  Q. Is it important to be both feminine and a great athlete?  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, I think so. I think for me it is. I think it's great that you can be both. I think it's great that women's tennis is so fashionable.
