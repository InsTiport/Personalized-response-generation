  2-6, 6-3, 6-2

 Q. So what happened out there with you today? 
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Um, I don't know. I just didn't -- you know, I didn't play my best game today. You know, it was tough out there. It was my first real match this season. 
 You know, I didn't really feel as comfortable as I thought I would and she played well. Just better than me today for sure. 

 Q. You seemed to have control of it in the first set. What happened after that? 
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, I mean, you know, I had control over it, but it didn't feel like, you know, I was really dominating too much. 
 You know, I tried to do everything to make myself feel better on the court and to, you know, try to play more aggressively and everything.
 Yeah, just didn't go my way today. That's the way it is sometimes. Next week is very important to me, and hopefully I can do a great result there. 

 Q. How does this affect your preparation?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No, I'm just gonna go to Melbourne and practice there and try to prepare as well as possible. You know, I'll just stay positive, and yeah, just go for it. 

 Q. When did you arrive in Sydney?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I arrived yesterday. Yeah, so I mean, I arrived yesterday from Hong Kong, and maybe it's not the best preparation I could have. But, I mean, I felt like I was playing well, and in Hong Kong I played some good matches. 
 Just, yeah, sometimes you don't play your best and you just need to get the best out of it. Unfortunately today it didn't go on my way as I wanted it do.

 Q. How to you feel physically? Did you feel sluggish at all?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Actually I felt pretty okay. Yeah, I mean, hopefully I'll feel even better next week. 

 Q. You must have some pretty high hopes for 2010 after last year. 
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, I mean, I feel like I had a really great year last year. Hopefully this year I can continue rising in the rankings and keep improving. 
 You know, I really feel positive about this year. Hopefully it'll be a good year for me.
