C. WOZNIACKI/N. Petrova
  6-3, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Did you watch the Copenhagen match last night? What do you think about it?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yes, I watched it. I don't remember. (Smiling.) 

 Q. What went wrong?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I watched it. Well, I think Chelsea played very well yesterday, I have to say. Copenhagen you know, they didn't really have any chances, to be honest, to actually just finish it off and try to go after the goal or anything. 
 They played, they played, and then they got taken the ball away from them. So really, Chelsea was just a better team yesterday.

 Q. So your chances of winning the next tournament are better than their chances of getting past Chelsea, right?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Well, I think so. I think it will be tough, you know, to play against Chelsea at home and either win 2-0 or 4-1. It's tough, you know. It will not be easy.

 Q. Are you in good shape now after the virus?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: You know, I'm feeling much better. I'm just taking it one day at a time, and hopefully tomorrow I will be feeling even better.

 Q. This tournament doesn't seem to be turning out good for seeds. Five seeds have lost in three days. Is it a good signal or bad signal?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I don't know. I just focus on myself, and I try to win. We have to see. I mean, there's a lot of good players here, so it's not easy to win, so I just keep my focus on myself and on my matches.

 Q. How tough is your opponent tomorrow, Pennetta?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Very tough opponent. I've played her quite a few times, and always tough matches. So it's not gonna be easy, but I'm looking forward to it.
