 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Caroline. 

 Q. You had difficulty in the second set returning serve from the deuce court. Why? 
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: You know, she's a very good player. Yeah, I don't know why I had problems from the deuce side. I guess her serves were just difficult to take. 
 You know, like I was trying my best, and, you know, I was really trying to win. But she was just better than me today, and credits for her.

 Q. Were you a little too concerned about returning and having your backhand side opened up for her?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: You know what, not really. I was more, you know, thinking on grass, you know, it's always tough to return the serves. 
 But I was just trying to keep my focus on my own game. I didn't really try to focus on her game, what she was going to do. 
 I was trying to, you know, stay aggressive and, you know, don't make too many unforced errors. But, you know, she was just good at the right moments. 

 Q. It's not unusual to see a young player handling another opponent's injury. Was that a factor today?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No, not really. I don't think so. I mean, you know, I just focused on my own game. I just think that, you know, in the third set we had a lot of long rallies and, you know, she just managed to win them. 
 And, you know, like I said before, I was really trying to do my best. And in the first set I was playing really, really well, you know, and pressuring her a lot, and just came a bit too far behind the baseline in the second and third set. 
 Then she could go in, you know, and win the games afterwards.

 Q. What tournaments in the U.S. will we see you at?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Probably New Haven and US Open, because now I'm staying in Europe now before the Olympics.
