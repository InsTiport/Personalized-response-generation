 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. How is your right leg, and did it affect your play at all?  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Uhm, it's okay. I mean, I just felt it a little bit. I felt it was just better to protect it just in case, but it's okay.   
 No, I mean, it didn't affect the score at the end, the score.   
  
  Q. Where do you think you lost it today?   
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Uhm, I mean, I had my chances, especially in the first set leading all the time. Had my chance for 5-2. I didn't take it. Then she started well with the new balls.   
 Yeah, I mean, it turned around a little bit. I tried to hang in there. But, yeah, didn't go my way today.   
  
  Q. Has she got very solid groundstrokes?  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, she has. She's taking the ball early and hitting pretty hard.   
 But, yeah, need to go back and work and come back stronger.   
  
  Q. What do you take out of this tournament? It's the first one of the year and there's a long way to go.  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, there's a long way to go. There's a long year ahead of me. Now I'm going to go and practice and work even harder and come back stronger hopefully.   
  
  Q. Li has beaten you the last two occasions. What does she have that you find difficult playing against?  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I don't know. I had chances in both my matches and I didn't take them. Against her, you need to just play on your highest level the whole match through and keep concentrated and keep a lot of balls in play.   
 Today I was playing well at some points, less good at some others. I need the consistency.   
  
  Q. So for you all Grand Slams are important, but what do you think Australian Open?  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I think it's a really nice Grand Slam. It's a Grand Slam where it's very relaxed, but still the atmosphere is really nice. It's a nice place to be.
