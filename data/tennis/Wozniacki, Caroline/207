C. WOZNIACKI/E. Candela
  6‑0, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How did you find the conditions out there today?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I found them quite slow actually, I have to say.   I think the practice courts are a little bit faster than that court. 
But, yeah, I mean, it was good to play.   No wind.   A little cloudy.   Perfect to play tennis in really. 

Q.   You were playing with an unbranded racquet you were trying out.   What were you playing with today?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I'm still under contract with Yonex.   We're just trying a couple of things.   We've always been tinkering with the racquet a little bit and just trying to get a little bit more power and a little bit more spin and control at the same time.   That's really it.

Q.   Were you playing with a Yonex racquet today?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I mean, it's unbranded.   So I'm still under contract with Yonex.
