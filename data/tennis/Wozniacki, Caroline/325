C. WOZNIACKI/C. Gullikson
  6-1, 6-1

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Score line is 6-1, 6-1. You're the No. 1 seed. What was your feeling coming in? Were you nervous? What was it like coming in tonight?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Well, it's a great feeling. Actually I didn't feel too nervous. I was just happy to be out there and get to play. We had waited for a long time. 
 It was nice to get out there and know that the crowd was still there to support us.

 Q. And your game?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Well, I'm happy to be through to the second round. The first match is always tough. You never know what to expect. A new tournament. 
 I'm just happy to be through.

 Q. What is it like to get to wait till 11:50 to get on the court?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Well, definitely it's a long night. The matches before on the center court were so long. I don't think there was even one match two sets. So no one expected that. 
 But, you know, it was nice. A win is a win, so it doesn't really matter what time I get on. As long as I win, I'm happy.

 Q. What did you do before? Have to warm up, cool down? 
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I warmed up and then I just went to the locker room, got ready, relaxed a little bit, watched Rafa's match. Yeah, then I got ready again and I went to the gym and ran a little bit.

 Q. Did you watch his whole match? 
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I didn't really watch it too much. I just watched a little bit. Then I read a magazine. I saw a little bit more. Just to keep my focus both on and off the court.
