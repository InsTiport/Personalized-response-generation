B. ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA/C. Wozniacki
  6‑1, 1‑1 (ret.)

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How is the wrist? 
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Well, I felt it during one shot.   I hit it against the wind and hit it late and I felt it in my wrist.
I've had it before so I kind of know what it is.   It's kind of painful every time I had to hit a backhand, so, yeah, I think it's‑‑ I didn't want to do it worse before Melbourne as well, so I'm just going to try and get some treatment on it and try and get ready for next week. 

Q.   When you said it's something that's happened before, is it something you typically get over fairly quickly? 
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Yeah.   I mean, it usually is.   It's something that comes and goes a little bit.   But with some treatment and ice and stuff like that, usually goes away.

Q.   Did it hurt last week at all?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   No, not at all.   It was a new thing.

Q.   (No microphone.)
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Then it was just she taped it up and it didn't really make a difference taped or not taped.
I just felt like it was getting a little worse, so I felt like I wasn't going to win the match without being able to hit like a proper backhand.   I can only do it worse, and that's really too negative.   I thought it was better to get treatment and see what's happening.

Q.   Overall you should be okay for the next week?   You're hoping that?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Yeah, that's what I'm aiming for. 

Q.   How long will you stay in Sydney?   Will you go to Melbourne and get treatment there?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Most likely leave to Melbourne tomorrow. 

Q.   Are you concerned it may keep you out?   A bit worried? 
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I still have a week to go, so hopefully it'll be fine.   We'll see how it feels tomorrow.   Hopefully it's going to feel better already tomorrow.
I'm confident that I'll be fine to play in Melbourne. 

Q.   Regardless of the wrist, you feel like you've had enough matches?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Yeah, definitely feel like I've had enough matches.   I feel like I've had some good matches last week and made it to the finals.
I feel like I've gotten enough match play. 

Q.   Still with one week to go to Melbourne, what are your thoughts right now? 
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   What's my thoughts right now... 

Q.   About the wrist. 
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   My thought is just that I need to get some treatment on it.   Again, just take it day by day how it feels.   Hopefully it'll take a couple days, a few days, and it'll be fine.
