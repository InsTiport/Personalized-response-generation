THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   That was all fairly quick today.   
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Yeah, it was.   It was nice.   You know, I got a fast start.   I broke her and got that second break.   It was good.   
   
 Q.   Feel good?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I do.   I do, yeah.   I really enjoy the grass.   I'm happy to be into the next round.   
You know, it's never easy whenever you have to finish halfway through your match and then start off the next day.   But I'm pleased about the way that I just managed to stay focused and get a good start out there.   
   
 Q.   Talking about next round, what do you know about your next‑round opponent?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I don't really know much about her, so I'll have to have my team do a little bit of research and some scouting.   
   
 Q.   You know nothing about her at all?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   No, not really, no.   I know how she looks like.   
   
 Q.   Tall?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Yes.   
   
 Q.   Long hair?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Blonde.  
   
 Q.   You know her background?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   No.   
   
 Q.   It's quite an interesting story.   
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Okay.   
   
 Q.   Yesterday's papers.   
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I didn't read yesterday's papers.   
   
 Q.   She got ditched by the LTA about five or six years ago as a teenager and made her way on her own.   
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Okay.   That's good for her.   
   
 Q.   Full of fight.   Full of fire.   
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Perfect.   
   
 Q.   You had a disappointing result at the French which came very shortly after your very public breakup.   Did that affect your play at the time and how have you managed to bounce back?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   To be honest with you, I feel like I've answered that question a lot of times.   I answered that at the time of the French Open.   
Right now we're at Wimbledon.   We're a month already past that.   
Right now I'm feeling good and I'm playing well and I'm excited to be here and playing on the grass.   There's no better place in the world to be these weeks.   
Hopefully I can play another good match tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts on the way the World Cup is unfolding and to what degree have you had a chance to take it in?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Yeah, I've been following quite a bit.   I'm very surprised about the level of the teams.   I think that the level is very high.   There's a lot of the teams where I thought they have no chance and all of a sudden the games have unfolded in a different direction.   
I think it's been interesting.   Unfortunately, Denmark didn't qualify.   That's always something that I love to watch, especially when your own team is playing.   But I don't really have a favorite team this year.   I'm kind of going game by game and seeing who I support.   
But, you know, I think it's going to be another few interesting results these days.   
   
 Q.   You mentioned some teams have surprised you.   Who are some of those?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Costa Rica, for example.   I was very surprised about how good they were playing.   
I watched a game Iran against Argentina.   I was so surprised how well Iran was playing.   I know they lost 1‑0 in the end.   It could have gone both ways and they had a lot of chances.   
In general, I think most teams have been playing very well.   Australia I thought played very well.   They're not a country that is really well‑known for their football.   I was very surprised about their fighting spirit and how well they're playing.  
   
 Q.   What is your sense about what the World Cup means to the world?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Well, it's obviously a huge event, a lot of people are following it.   You can see it on the big screens everywhere.   Obviously it's a sport a lot of people follow.   
   
 Q.   You talked this week about moving on and finding a new man.   Have you considered Internet dating?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I think I'm not that desperate.   To be honest, you know, I'll just see what happens.   I'm perfectly fine being single at the moment.   
It's pretty hard to sweep me off my feet.   It would have to take someone very special.   You know, you never know.   I guess when you least expect it, it's going to come.   
Right now I'm just into my tennis.   And playing here, it's great.   That's what I'm focused on.   
   
 Q.   You seem to have a great admirer in Feliciano LÃ³pez?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   You noticed?     
   
 Q.   He told us.   He said he watched two of your matches, likes you, admires you, knows your dad.   
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   He's already making his way in through my dad (laughter)?  
   
 Q.   Then he followed you on court today.   
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Yeah.   I noticed he was on the sidelines in Eastbourne.   No, he's a great guy.   Playing well.   
This is very awkward (smiling).   
   
 Q.   What does your friendship with Serena Williams mean to you and in what ways has she mentored you recently?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Serena is a great girl.   She is an amazing friend.   She's always been there for me whenever I've needed her.   You know, the other way around.   
It's great that you have such an amazing competitor, very professional athlete.   After everything that she's achieved in her professional career, as well, that she finds time.   She wants to help out a friend who needs it sometimes.   
You know, it's just nice to have good people around you.   
   
 Q.   What do you think the perception is of her?   The public sees her as the competitor on the court.   What's the reality?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Well, the reality is that, you know, she's an amazing person and a great friend and awesome competitor.   
   
 Q.   In what ways?   What makes her so amazing as a friend?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   She's loyal and she's there for you when you need her.   She's fun to hang around.   That's something that I think is very important in a friend.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel the rain delay helped or hindered you?   What did you think of your opponent's performance?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I think I was, you know, leading yesterday.   I kind of wanted just to keep going.   
In the end of the day, it started to rain, it got dark.   I finished it off quickly today, which was nice.   
Yeah, I mean, I guess I would have liked to have finished it yesterday since it would have been nice to have a day off today.   But on the other hand, you know, I won and that was the most important thing.  
I thought she started off well.   She's a good competitor.   She never gives up.   She's always trying to run every ball down.   For me, I just managed to keep my head cool.   I played aggressively today and tried to step into the court.
