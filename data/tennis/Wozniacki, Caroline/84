THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. We were talking to Angelique Kerber earlier about being No. 1.  She was talking about the pressure of being No. 1.  You obviously know what that's like.  Is it in some ways for you quite liberating to come here and not be No. 1, not have the pressure and expectation that goes with that?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No, I think everyone wants to be No. 1.  I think there's pressure on you whether you're No. 1 or No. 5 in the world.  You know, you have pressure.  It's all about how you handle it.
I enjoy it.  I enjoy having a target on my back because it means you need to keep playing better and improve and keep working hard because everyone is looking forward to beat you.  You know, it's what she trained for.
Q. You've been here 11 years to Wimbledon.  You've seen the pageantry, how the community enjoys this event.  For you as a player, do you take more interest in restaurants or other shops in the village if they show a welcoming spirit toward other players?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I think, honestly, I have my favorite, like, maybe three, four restaurants, and those are the restaurants I go to in the village, the restaurants I've gone to for years.  I love the food.  You know, I think you kind of just feel at home at those.  I don't experience too much -- experiment too much.
I like what I like.  I know what works for me.  That's what I do.
