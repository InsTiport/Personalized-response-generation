  4‑6, 6‑2, 6‑3 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Congratulations entering the semifinal.   We know that today you have a very tough match.   How do you comment on your match today?   And the second question is tomorrow we know you will meet Eugenie.   How will you prepare for tomorrow's match?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   It was a tough match today.   I was just happy to be able to pull it through.   I knew that it wasn't going to be easy.   She has really been playing well this year in general but also this week.  
 I'm really pleased to be through to the semifinals.   I'm just going to go back and get some rest and not really do too much before tomorrow's match.  
   
 Q.   After you were a set down early on, how did you feel at the end of that set?   What was going through your mind?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Last time I played her, I lost the first set, as well.   I knew she's a fast starter and she definitely had the confidence as well from winning against Sharapova the day before, so I just told myself to keep fighting and keep going for my shots.  
Yeah, then that kind of went my way.   It was good for me.   
   
 Q.   There are some reports in the States saying you forgot your check after the US Open.   Are you going to make a special effort to pick it up if you get through to the finals?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   It's a little easier when you play WTA events, because I think the money just gets wired to your account.   So there is no worries for me forgetting it here (smiling).
