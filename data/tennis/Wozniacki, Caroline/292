 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. So is Steven Gerrard going to warm up in a Caroline Wozniacki T-shirt before his game tonight?  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Do you think that would look good?   
  
  Q. I don't know. I think maybe you want to send him one and get it signed. See what happens.   
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, I haven't sent him one, so probably not.  
  
  Q. Have you met him before?  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Well, I've been to a Liverpool match before, and I met some of the players.   
 Yeah, I was really happy that Nasser from the Qatar Tennis Federation was able to get me a signed shirt for me.  
  
  Q. You just need to learn how to speak in the accent now, and then you'll be fine.   
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I know.  
  
  Q. I wanted to ask you a question about your next game. Shahar Peer yesterday, after losing to Marion, said if she carries on playing like that, she'd be the No. 1 player in the world. What do you make of that?  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No, I mean, I'm sure that she played a great match against Shahar. You know, I didn't see the match, so it's difficult for me to say, but to be the No. 1 player in the world, you need to play like that every match. You know, that's why there's only one.
