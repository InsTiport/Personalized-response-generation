 S. WILLIAMS/C. Wozniacki
  2‑6, 6‑2, 6‑4 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Tough loss today.   How do you feel about your preparation for the Open?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I think I'm well‑prepared for the Open.   I've gotten a lot of matches these last few weeks.   In general I'm very pleased about the way I've played.  
I'm excited for the US Open coming up.  
   
 Q.   Are you playing New Haven?   
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Yeah, I'm going to play there.   
   
 Q.   She was able to break you eight out of nine times.   Was she able to get a better read compared to last week?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I just didn't serve well today.   Didn't get many first serves in.   When I did, they weren't placed very well.   It's frustrating, because you lose a set 6‑4 in the third and you only hold serve once.   
I actually broke Serena three times in the set.   I don't think that happens very often to her either.  
So, you know, you feel like you're there and my all game was there.   I was fighting.   I was running.   I was trying to take the ball early.   I was returning well.   
Then my serve comes around and I can't seem to hold serve.   It's frustrating thing when you're out there on the court.  
   
 Q.   What were some things that your dad was talking to you about during the coaching session that kind of got you to where you could get to 6‑4 in the third?   
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Well, he just tried to give me a few pointers on the serve, things to remember.   Kind of kept telling me that I need to stay aggressive.   I need to stay closer to the baseline.  
That was really it.  
   
 Q.   Were you distracted at all when Serena, the trainer came out to see her?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   No, not at all.  
   
 Q.   Along the lines of your success in breaking her so many times in the last set, what do you attribute that to?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   That's obviously a very positive thing, because Serena is known for the best serve on tour.   So to be able to break her that many times is a very positive thing.  
Obviously hurts a little bit even more because I feel like my serve is good as well, so I should be able to hold serve more times.   It's kind of, you know, bittersweet feeling I suppose, because I just seemed to kind of lose the rhythm a little bit on my serve in the second set.  
Yeah, then when I had second serves ‑‑   obviously she was returning well, but then when I have second serves I was pushed back straightaway.   She was in attacking mode.   That makes it kind of hard.  
   
 Q.   What were you pleased with with what you did today?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I was very pleased with the way I was fighting.   My returns worked good.   Got a lot of returns back and deep.  
I was pleased in general about my game.   The only thing I wasn't pleased about was my serving.  
   
 Q.   You two got to No. 1 playing very different styles of tennis.   Do you think there is still room for both styles to be successful on tour, at the top of the game?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Well, I think so.   You know, obviously Serena is a very strong athlete and she's going to have a different game to mine.  
But at the same time, I think what we both do and try to do is take the ball early, try and push‑‑ try and stay close to the court and try and make the opponent run, you know, go for the winner when we can.   
I think in that way it's a little similar.   Obviously she just has more power than me.   She has a huge serve.   I usually have a decent serve, just not today.  
First set I served pretty well, and then it went downhill from there.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel more clarity on court now?   I know there were times you were trying to be more aggressive and didn't seem to have as clear a game plan as maybe the last couple weeks.   
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I feel good.   I know what I want to do out there and I know what brings me success.   That's kind of what I want to keep doing.  
   
 Q.   You mentioned some specific things that Serena is very good at.   Does that mean that your preparation for matches with her is any different?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   No.   I have a game plan out there that I want to play.   I want to make her play my game and she wants me to play her game, so that's how it is.  
But it's not different.   I know that I'm up against a great opponent and player, so I know it's not going to be easy.   
Usually I know that if I break her once that's great.   Today I broke her quite a few times and still that didn't help me.   (Smiling.)  
   
 Q.   When you talk about just having a substandard serving day, do you mean percentage?   Power?   Placement?   What exactly does that mean to you?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Little bit of both.   You know, the percentage was lower and I think I didn't place it as well as I have in the previous matches and in MontrÃ©al.   You know, I got a lot of great serves in, put her into defense straightaway, and today I didn't manage to do that.   
You know, I knew that she was going to be aggressive on my first serve.   That puts a bit more pressure on ‑‑ sorry, on my second serve.   That put a bit more pressure on my first serve.   I was serving pretty well, as I said, in the beginning, but then I kind of just lost a little bit of timing.   Then trying to work my way back in, it's hard, you know.   
   
 Q.   So aside from the disappointment in your serving today, you were happy with the other aspects of your game today?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Yeah, I think I can be happy.   I ran a lot of balls down and made her play that extra ball and was aggressive when I could and tried to move forward and mix the pace up a bit.   I felt comfortable out there.   Felt pretty good.  
It's a positive sign going into the US Open.   
   
 Q.   Did you feel like she was going for more on first serves today compared to MontrÃ©al?   
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   No.   She always goes for it.   In MontrÃ©al I had games where she aced me three times in a row.   I was like, Okay, next game.  
So I felt like I got more returns back in this match.   
   
 Q.   You've been a fairly popular sort of dark horse pick already for the US Open.   People think with this form you've shown you can make a good run there.   Do you feel that?   
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I play well, and I think to beat me you have to play very well.   So just to have wait and see what's going to happen.   
But I always believe in myself.   I feel good.   I feel good on these courts.   New York has been a good place for me in the past.  
   
 Q.   How are you feeling on match play?   Still confident you want to go through with playing New Haven next week?   Feel like you've had enough?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Well, I've had a lot of matches these couple of weeks.   I'm good with playing New Haven.   I'm going to use it as even better preparation, you know, get hopefully a few matches in.  
We just have to see.   I'm taking it more as a few things that I just want to keep working on and take it from there.   I'm not in stress of getting a lot of matches.   I've got that, so I'll do my best.   
That's really it.   If I win, it's great.   If not, then I have more time before the US Open.   
   
 Q.   Are they going to have you run around in the bulldog costume again?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   No.   That was sweaty and smelled pretty badly.   That's not going to happen again.
