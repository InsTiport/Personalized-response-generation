 L. SAFAROVA/C. Wozniacki
  4‑6, 6‑4, 7‑6 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Tell us a little bit about ‑‑it seemed like it was close, obviously, and then the tiebreaker, you know, how it kinda got away from you there.   
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Yeah, it was a close match, and, you know, I had three match points in the third set and I didn't take them, and Lucie served three very good serves.   
Of course it's very disappointing right now.   Just need to move on and try to do better in the next one.   
   
 Q.   Talk a little bit about your schedule from here.   Are you going to Dubai?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I don't know.   I haven't thought about it, really, to be honest.   
   
 Q.   Are you satisfied now with how you're playing, or do you think you're looking kinda to find form and tinker with your game, or...   
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Well, you know, obviously it doesn't matter how you play.   As long as you win everything, it's great.   But you can play fantastic and lose matches.   That doesn't really help you.  
You know, I just hope I can win some matches in Dubai next week, do better than here.   And of course right now it's disappointing to have lost 7‑6 in the third, because you feel like you had your chances.  
You know, I guess it's tennis, and once in a while you lose, sometimes you win, and you just need to go with it.  
   
 Q.   Sounds like you're a little bit confused.   You're not totally sure why things in the last few weeks aren't kinda working for you.   Is that accurate?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Well, to be honest, I haven't played the last few weeks.   It is my first tournament since the Australian Open, and I played pretty well there.   
I'm not confused.   To be honest, I just want to get out of here, because it's not really fun to be here when you've lost a match like that.
