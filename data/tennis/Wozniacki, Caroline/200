C. WOZNIACKI/S. Stephens
  6‑3, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please. 

Q.   This was kind of an odd match today.   What are your thoughts on how you played?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I just tried to keep playing aggressive and trying to make her run.   We had a lot of long rallies and long games, but I just managed to keep my head cool and just keep fighting, even though I lost that one very long game in the beginning where she was serving.
But in general, I'm pleased to be through.   Going to be a tough match the next one. 

Q.   What was the difference between the first and second set?   Obviously looked totally different.   Over an hour the first set and second set went just like that.   What did you change after the first set?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I think I stepped into the court a little bit more and took the ball a little bit earlier and forced her to make a few more mistakes.

Q.   And obviously Serena again tomorrow.   Talk about that. 
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Yeah, Serena is a great competitor and an unbelievable champion.   She's won so much. 
For me, tomorrow I have so much to play for because the Championships are coming up and I'm trying to grab a spot there.   I really need to win tomorrow to have a chance.
We'll just to have to wait and see what happens.
