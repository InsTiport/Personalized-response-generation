C. WOZNIACKI/C. Garcia
  6‑3, 6‑0

THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.

Q. Can you talk about your match tonight. 
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, you know, it was nice to get it done in two sets and pretty quick. Garcia is a young, good player. I knew that she was going to go in and try to be aggressive from the start. 
But I ran a lot of good balls down and managed to play pretty well. 

Q. You're playing Petra in the semifinals now. Talk about that match, what you expect from that. 
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, it's going to be a tough one. I always have tough matches against her. She's playing well. She's going for her shots. She's playing with great depth in the court. 
I'm just happy to be in the semis and take it from there. 

Q. Were you fatigued at all coming into today?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No, I was fine. I was good. I went for a run this morning. Felt good. 

Q. You've been wearing the bandage on your knee. What, is it a knee pad?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No, it's been bothering me for a while. I'm probably going to wear it for a long time still. Once I'm wearing that, it's feeling pretty good. 

Q. In the second set you only dropped one point on your serve. 
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I know (smiling). 

Q. Do you remember having such a dominant set?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, I remember the point I lost. I remember it was a volley. I think it was the last game, last service game of mine. 
But at that point I actually didn't know that I hadn't lost another point on my serve. Yeah, I was happy with that. It was a much better serving game today than it was yesterday.
