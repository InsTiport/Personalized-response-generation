  C. WOZNIACKI/A. Petkovic  6-3, 6-2   THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   Q.  You've gotten to know the Grandstand pretty well this week.  All three matches there.  Do you like that court a lot?  How has it been playing for you?  CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, I love this court.  You know, the atmosphere's really great there.  The crowd sits really close to you.  I think it's an amazing court to play on. When I saw the schedule, I was really happy with getting another match there.  I obviously love playing in here on Arthur Ashe, but if I couldn't get in there, I think Grandstand is a great place to be.   Q.  Did you have to flip a coin today to decide who got to wear what?  CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No.  We're playing basically night session, so I was like, I will wear my night session dress.  We'll wear something that doesn't look quite alike.   Q.  Straight sets again.  Do you feel you're rounding into form now that you're getting deeper and deeper into the tournament?  CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, I think every match I kind of get into a better groove out there and I'm playing better.  It's nice to be through to the fourth round again. It's going to be another tough one, but I'm excited about it.  I'm looking forward to play another match.
