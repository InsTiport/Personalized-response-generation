C. WOZNIACKI/L. Davis
6-1, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You had the match pretty much well in hand. Davis kind of came alive in the second set at the end. What was going through your mind?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Not much. Just trying to stay focused, take one ball at a time. She's a good player, so I knew she just wasn't going to let it go easily.
Q. You're the defending China Open champion. Do you feel any extra added pressure coming in with the title?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Not at all. I think it's an honor to be here having won the title. It's a great place to be. I'm just happy to be back on the court at the tournament where I won last year.
Q. Next round McHale. What is your strategy?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I've had tough matches against McHale in the past. She can play really well. It's important for me to stay aggressive and play my game.
