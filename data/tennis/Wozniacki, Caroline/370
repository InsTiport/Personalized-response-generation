   THE MODERATOR:  Questions.   
  
  Q.  Your first experience on center court.  How would you sum up the game?   
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:  I mean, I thought I was playing well today.  Ana was playing well also.  She won the important points.  I had two set points in the second set.  I didn't take them.   
 I mean, Ana, she's really playing well and I know that she's gonna go far in this tournament - further than she is.  I wish her all the best.   
  
  Q.  What was the difference from the first and second set?   
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:  I think that Ana was maybe making a little bit more mistakes, but I was also -- I wasn't that, yeah, nervous, so I was playing more my game.   
 Yeah, I just was thinking about every point and didn't think about the score.   
  
  Q.  What happened towards the end of the second set when you served for it?  Did you get nervous?  Did you tighten up?   
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:  Actually, I didn't get that nervous.  I think I was just unlucky.  I don't know.  Yeah, I think I was just a little bit unlucky, yeah, at the important points.   
  
  Q.  Can Ana win this tournament?   
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:  I think so.  She's playing well.  I think she has a chance.   
  
  Q.  This has been your best Grand Slam tournament so far.  What do you take from that?   
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:  I mean, I'm very happy that I made the fourth round.  Of course, I wanted to win today as well.   
 But I'm very happy, and I think I've got a lot of good experience that I can take with me for the next matches and for the next tournaments.  I think I raised my game, as well.   
  
  Q.  To have this much success at your age usually leads to good things in tennis.  How do you feel about your future?   
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:  I feel positive.  I think that I play some good tennis and that I am improving a lot lately.  I feel like I can play well, and I think I showed today that I can play with the best players, as well.   
 So I think I'll just take a step at a time and still keep practicing and improving.  Hopefully in the next couple of years I'll be higher in my rankings than I am now.
