S. WILLIAMS/C. Wozniacki
  6‑0, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   The way Serena is playing, is that as good as she's played for a number of years?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I think so.   She's hitting the ball really well, playing aggressive, not making many errors. 
So, yeah, I mean, she's definitely playing well. 

Q.   In terms of your own Olympic experience, how have you enjoyed it?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Uhm, Olympics is always a very special tournament.   You know, I think it's too bad that the site was so far from the Olympic Village.   Also I think it would have been fair for everyone‑‑ I'm saying I like to play on grass‑‑ fair for everyone to play on hard court, it would have equaled it out a little bit. 
Also I think, yeah, to play it at Wimbledon, come back at Wimbledon, of course it's special.   It's special also that Wimbledon bent their rules and their traditions by putting the Olympics here. 
Also I think it would have felt a bit more as an Olympics if it would have been at another place, at another site. 

Q.   Being out here at Wimbledon, as you say so far away, did you feel at all maybe detached from the Olympics?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Yeah, a little bit.   I mean, you feel, you know, that you're separated from everyone else.   I mean, but, yeah, that's the way it is.   You're walking around with the colors of your countries.   That way, of course, it feels like the Olympics.   With the name of your country on your back. 
At the same time, it's not the same as, for example, in Beijing, where you could just walk basically front and back from the site to the Olympic Village. 

Q.   In terms of your plans for the next few days, is it a case of going straight to MontrÃ©al now?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Yeah.   It's quite a long flight.   It's just about trying to prepare for the hard court season coming up.

Q.   Do you feel disappointed you won't get a chance to watch any of the other Olympic events?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Of course, I would like to have gone out and watched some of the Olympic events.   Again, we're so far away.   While you're playing it's very difficult because the schedules don't come out until very late.   You're far away.   So you really need to make sure you're not playing first up.   You know, you don't really know. 
Yeah, of course, I would have liked to go and see some events.   But, you know, hopefully in four years.
