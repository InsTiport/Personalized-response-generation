  6-0, 6-4

 Q. It's been a busy day. How did it feel?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: It felt good. I won both of my matches, so it felt good. It's been a busy day, but it's been a good day. 

 Q. How do you feel about playing on grass now, and what's your experience on grass? Of course you won the juniors and so forth, but how do you feel about grass compared to other surfaces?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I've always felt good on grass. That's always been one of my favorite surfaces. I enjoy coming back here every year. Yeah, and so far, so good. 

 Q. I read that your family has a very diverse sporting background. Which sports did you play seriously with a coach apart from tennis?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I did a lot of things. I was playing football, I was playing the piano, I was swimming a lot, I was playing handball, I was doing gymnastics.

 Q. How good were you in swimming?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Swimming actually I was pretty good. I had to choose in the end between swimming and tennis.

 Q. Do you remember any times?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No, I just -- I mean, I was swimming until I was like maybe 10, 11. 10 maybe. I mean, I was good. Yeah. 
 I mean, in the end always the competitions were on the weekends, and I had to choose. And my swimming coach was getting upset with me that I was choosing the tennis instead of the swimming. But I thought that was more fun. It's the right decision. 

 Q. What is your connection with Poland at the moment? 
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I mean, I have my -- one of my grandmothers there. I have cousins. Yeah. 

 Q. Do you go there, or --
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Sometimes, like once a year maybe. Not so often. 

 Q. Do you think it's good for young tennis players to do a variety of sport, or they should focus more on tennis from an early age?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No, I think it's important that the person decides what they think is fun, what really interests them. 
 For me it was very good. I tried all different kinds of sports. And also you learn the coordinations, a lot of new motions, and you develop your body from a very young age, and I think that's very important. 

 Q. In Denmark there's a Finnish tennis coach, Reino NyyssÃ¶nen. Have you ever met him, Reino NyyssÃ¶nen? He used to have his own tennis camp near Copenhagen. 
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Are you sure that's near Copenhagen? 

 Q. Yeah, near Copenhagen.
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No, I've never heard, no.
