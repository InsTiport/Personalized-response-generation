C. WOZNIACKI/P. Martic
7-5, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. First set was pretty tight.  A lot of deuce games.  Second set went a little bit quicker.  Was there something that went better the second set that wasn't going the first?  I notice your serve was stronger.
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, I think I served a little bit better in the second set.  But honestly, I thought she played well.  I was just trying to stay focused and tried to, yeah, run a lot of balls down, try to mix up the pace, be aggressive when I could.
Q. You're actually trailing in the head-to-head against Anett.  What will you do to get a W in the next round?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: It's a new match.  I'm going to try to do my best, try and stay aggressive.  That's really it.
Q. How do you deal with the external expectations and pressure after you get the Grand Slam?  Maybe they want you to win more.
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Honestly, I don't really think about anyone else.  I just think about myself, what I want to do.  I try and work hard to be the best player that I can be.
Q. I think you said before the start of the tournament, it's a long season, everyone is tired.  Two straight-sets wins.  You must be tapping into something that's working for you, keeping you energized.
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, I think everyone is trying to fight for Singapore.  I'm just here to try and qualify, try and do my best, try and go as far in this tournament as I possibly can.  That's really it.
You have to stay on top of it.  You have to stay focused.  I do my best every match.
