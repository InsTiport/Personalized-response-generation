  2‑6, 6‑1, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Discouraged or frustrated or both?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   No, more like, you know, I was trying everything.   I was just making so many errors, and I don't really know where they came from.
I think I was just tired.   You know, it's been a long week for me, and, you know, the first set I was playing pretty decent.   You know, I was on a roll.
But start of the second set I made a few stupid mistakes on important points.   All of a sudden I see myself going down, and, you know, I was really trying.   I just couldn't.
You know, it's one of those days where I was really pushing, and then I was trying to play a little harder, a little deeper, go in or stay back and just did not work.

Q.   Kind of the week of illness finally caught up with you, do you think?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   You know, I definitely think it's taken a toll on me, and I'm still pretty pleased with my week considering everything that has been going on this week.   So, you know, unfortunately it wasn't enough today.   It was just like the air of the balloon just kind of went off.

Q.   You're going to Doha next?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Yes.

Q.   Initially you weren't, right?   You got a wildcard.   Any reason why you weren't going to play it and change your mind?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I'm playing, so it's all good. 

Q.   What kind of medication have you been on?   Serious stuff or just chemist, pharmacy stuff?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Just all like pharmacy stuff, cough things, like cough syrup, Tylenol, aspirin, Advil, lozenges.   Yeah, few other things.   It's been quite a bit. 

Q.   You rattle now, do you?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I think I will take a day off tomorrow from both the medication and the training.   Hopefully that will give me that little boost.

Q.   I told you it should have been whiskey. 
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I know, right?   I'll have to listen to you next time.
