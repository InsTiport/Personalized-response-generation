C. WOZNIACKI/K. Koukalova
  6‑1, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You've been on a roll for a couple of weeks.   How do you explain your recent success?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Yeah, I always like to play on hard courts.   You know, it's my favorite surface.   I've been playing pretty well lately.   MontrÃ©al has always been a good place for me, winning here a few years ago. 
I'm feeling good and hopefully I can keep going. 

Q.   Do you feel that you have the support of the crowd here?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Yeah, definitely.   You know, it's always an amazing crowd here in Canada, and definitely in MontrÃ©al after winning I definitely have a big support here. 
It's really great to be back.   I'm really excited for this week. 

Q.   Do you have a chance to go around the city?   What do you do here?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   We went down to the old city, St.Paul Street, all there and around.   Went out there eat there.   Tried quite a few different restaurants.   Went to a steak restaurant called Gibby's.   We went to a Polish restaurant and Japanese.   I've been running around the park here.   Yeah, just kind of enjoying.

Q.   What are your goals for the rest of the season?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Honestly, I just want to try to win as many matches as possible and take it from there.

Q.   Do you feel you're still far from that No.1 that you held a couple years ago?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   To be honest, I don't think about it.   I just keep playing.   I enjoy playing.   I focus on the match I have in front of me. 

Q.   I don't want to be rude or anything, but do you feel that your head is free now that everything is over with all those stories about your split‑up?   Do you feel you see clearer and your head is free?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   To be honest, I've moved on.   You know, I would like everyone else to move on, too. 

Q.   Your next rival is Shelby Rogers, who beat Eugenie Bouchard yesterday.   You've never played her.   Do you know a little about her?   How do you approach that match?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   To be honest, I don't know much about her.   I know how she looks like, but I don't know much about her game. 
So I will definitely have my team, you know, kind of tell me how she plays.   Yeah, because then obviously I have to focus on myself and what I want to do out there. 

Q.   Is it a good thing that you don't have to face Eugenie Bouchard or not?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I don't really care, to be honest.   Whoever was better on the day won.   Tomorrow's a new match.   Doesn't matter who's on the other side, I have to play well to win. 
Obviously Rogers must have played really well to beat Genie.   Obviously with the whole crowd, as well, for Eugenie, you know, it wasn't easy. 
But for me tomorrow, it's a new match.   Doesn't matter who's on the other side.   I'm going to try and win. 

Q.   I know in the recent weeks we've noticed several changes in your game.   How much do they help you to achieve whatever you wish to achieve?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I always try and keep improving, keep doing better.   Obviously I feel like I've been serving and returning well these last few weeks, few tournaments.   I feel like I'm on the right path. 
Obviously that helps me then, you know, going on to the rallies.   If you start off the points well, it makes it easier for the rest of the game.

Q.   Not having to face Eugenie in the next match, do you feel it will be an advantage for you to have the crowd on your side instead of having it against you?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   It really doesn't matter.   You know, I've tried everything.   I've played so many matches before.   In the end of the day it doesn't matter who's on the other side.   I'm just excited to get another match. 

Q.   Would you pinpoint something that's different from your success recently?   Did you change something specific that you would say?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Not really.   I mean, I've always liked to play on grass and hard courts, so I've always had pretty good results on those two surfaces.   I feel like I get more out of my shots, you know, on these courts. 
So, yeah, I'm just taking advantage of serving pretty well and returning pretty well.   So those definitely are two things and factors that has helped me these last few weeks.

Q.   Yesterday were you concerned at all with everything that went on here with the power failure?   Was there something funny that happened to you?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Other than after the match, I went to go into the shower, it was so dark, I couldn't see anything.   Then the water was freezing.   So that was a quick shower. 
But other than that, not much.   I mean, I was outside most of the day.   When I got back to the hotel, the power was on over there, so that didn't really change anything.
