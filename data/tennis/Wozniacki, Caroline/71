C. GARCIA/C. Wozniacki
0-6, 6-3, 7-5
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Still three really good matches heading in the semifinals.  What do you think made the difference in the end?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I think I got a little bit unlucky.  You know, I think it was the small margins that did it today.  I feel like I should have won that match, but it is what it is.
I'm going to prepare for the semifinals and then go from there.
Q. Does having that next match make it easier to maybe shake off this result?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, I mean, it's just annoying.  You feel like you're out there for a while and you just wanted to win it.  But in the end of the day, it doesn't really matter.  I can go out to the semis tomorrow and start afresh.
Q. At what point do you think the momentum of the match changed to Garcia's side?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I don't know.  I mean, I was up 5-3 in the third, so I don't know if the momentum switched or not.
You know, I had the chance to serve it out and I didn't.  That's really it.
Q. She was a late qualifier to the tournament.  I'm curious what you have made of her improvements and how much better she might be playing this week or in the last few weeks?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: She played well today.  You know, hats off to her.  She played well.
You know, we'll see what happens next year.  She obviously had a few good weeks at the end of this year.
Q. We're still not 100% sure who you will play, based on the standings, either Karolina or Venus.  What are your thoughts on either of those opponents?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Well, either way it's going to be tough.  You know, both are playing really aggressive tennis and playing really well.  So either way, I have to play my best tennis to win (smiling).
Q. What did you make of the crowd atmosphere?  Seemed like they really got into the match.
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah.  I think they were rooting for her a lot, because obviously they wanted to get her back into the match and get a match going.
