C. WOZNIACKI/T. Pironkova
6-3, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How pleased were you with the standard you produced?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I was happy with the match today.  She's a tricky opponent.  Definitely wasn't easy.  So I was happy to get the win.
Q. Do you feel like you defended well particularly?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, I thought I played aggressive as well, defended where I needed to.  Yeah, it was a good match all in all.
Q. Were you a little bit worried you might be taken off for light if she had won the second set?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I was trying not to think too much about it.  I knew it was going to get dark out there.  I was trying to keep my focus and trying to win in two sets.
Q. Are you looking ahead and thinking --
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I never look at the draw.  I never know who I'm playing.  So next round I know I'm playing Kontaveit.  That's the only thing I know.  I don't really look forward.
It's a tough match.  I haven't had any easy matches here this week yet.  It's only going to get tougher.
Q. With Kontaveit being a big hitter, are you going to be looking to move her around?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Of course.  I need to serve and return well.  That's basically it.  That's what I need to focus on.
Q. Given you reached the final in Eastbourne last week, you must be delighted with how the grass season is going so far.
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I feel like I'm hitting it well.  I'm pleased so far.
