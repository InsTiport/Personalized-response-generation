  4‑6, 6‑0, 6‑3 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Your all‑around game looks to be in pretty good shape.   
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Yeah, I'm feeling pretty good.   I feel like I have been playing really good tennis.   I'm really pleased with it.   
   
 Q.   There was that moment of course in the second set with the line judge.   What exactly happened there?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Well, she said I went over the line with my heel and went down with my heel on the ground or something.   I'm, like, Well, it's kind of difficult to jump when you're heel is pointing towards the net and you put your foot down all the way through.   You know, that's not possible.  
I know that I moved my foot a little bit, but it is allowed to be in the air or whatever you want to call it when you hit it.  
That's why I didn't quite understand why there was a foot fault there.  
   
 Q.   But you reacted with quite some venom after that first set by winning that second set 6‑Love?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Yeah, it was a good set for me.   I played well.   I'm really pleased with the way my game is at the moment.  
   
 Q.   What was it you actually said to the line judge?   Because there was stuff flying around on Twitter that you said she just wanted to feel important, the line judge.   Is that what you said?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I mean, yeah, I mean, I don't see a reason other than that why you wanted to call a foot fault on a second serve that isn't a foot fault.  
   
 Q.   Have you spoken to the line judge since?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   No.   
   
 Q.   You've not played Jamie, I understand, since juniors.   Do you remember?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   No.   
   
 Q.   She said she played you when she was a junior.   
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Oh, really?   Okay.   
I'm not sure.   I mean, I have played so many matches.   I don't remember.  
   
 Q.   Do you know much about her?   Have you had a chance to watch her play?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I have watched her play a little bit, yeah.   She's a strong player.   She's young.   She's been playing well lately, serving well, trying to take the ball early, pretty good volleys, as well.   An all‑around player.   I think the grass suits her game.  
   
 Q.   What is it about here that you're so successful?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Why she is?   
   
 Q.   No, you, Eastbourne, why do you think it's a good tournament for you?   
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Because I like the grass and I think the grass really suits my game.   You know, it's a really nice tournament.   The atmosphere is good.
