G. MUGURUZA/C. Wozniacki
  4‑6, 7‑5, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Do you think you let it get away?   Why did it get away from you?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I had quite a lot of chances.   I won the first set; was up in the second.   I had breakpoints in I think the three last games she was serving.   Not the last one, but I had chances to get away there and probably close the match. 
You know, sometimes it happens, you just don't take your chances.   I don't think I did anything particularly wrong.   I thought she played some great tennis, as well.   It was just a bit unlucky. 
Obviously you can always look back and say you could have done this or that, but yeah. 

Q.   Do you sense she's at the young, starting phase where she's fearless and maybe not worried too much and hitting her shots?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Yeah, definitely she's a good player.   She has beaten good players before.   She's on a roll.   I think we'll see a lot of her in the future definitely. 

Q.   Do you think Agnieszka Radwanska has a game to beat Muguruza?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Honestly, I haven't thought about it.   You know, when I'm not in the tournament anymore, like it sounds rude, but I don't really look at the games anymore.   I just try and focus on myself. 
I think both are good players and it will be a good match.
