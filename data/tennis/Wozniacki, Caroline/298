C. WOZNIACKI/A. Chakvetadze
  6-3, 3-5 (ret.)

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Did you have any idea that she was struggling earlier in the match? 
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No, I didn't. You know, suddenly I just see her collapse on the court. I really didn't know what happened, and so I went over to her and, you know, I just wanted to know what was going on. 

 Q. Do you know what was going on? 
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Well, I could see that she collapsed, and then I could hear that she was saying she felt dizzy. So I was figuring out that she wasn't feeling great.

 Q. Were you aware before the match that she had been sick this week?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No, I was not.

 Q. When saw her collapse, what was your first reaction? Must have been a bit of a shock.
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: It was a shock. It was scary. Because, I mean, she's a good friend of mine. Doesn't matter, but to see someone collapse on the other side, it's not a nice sight. 
 So I just wanted to make sure she was okay and that she -- and to get the doctors and everyone out as soon as possible.

 Q. Was it right to continue after the collapse, do you think?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Well, I don't know. It was up to her to see. It's difficult for me to say.

 Q. Did she say anything when you guys hugged at the end of the match? 
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No. She just said, Sorry I couldn't finish.

 Q. Really? 
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah. But...

 Q. Is that the most sort of shocking or scary experience you've had in your career so far being only 20? It was a bit of a surprise. 
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Well, it was a surprise. I've been injured a few times with the ankle where I just had to stop as well, and I know how it feels. It's not nice to retire from a match. I've been feeling sick as well in a few matches.
 But, you know, it's what happens sometimes. Hopefully she can just rest up and feel better tomorrow.

 Q. How much of a dampener do you think it put on your performance today?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Well, you know, it doesn't matter. Hopefully she'll be feeling good tomorrow, feeling better. I'm through to the next round. I will try to do my best there.

 Q. Why were you struggling so much in that second set after doing so well in the first?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Um, I think in the first set I really didn't get into the game too much. She was making a lot of mistakes and I didn't get the rhythm. Suddenly she just start to go for it. 
 I think it just -- yeah, you know, I just needed some time to get back. I started actually to play better towards the end of the second set. Yeah, unfortunately, yeah, that happened to her. 

 Q. We don't often see you throwing your racquet around. 
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No. Um, yeah. (Smiling.)

 Q. Do you have a temper then? I've never seen you have a temper before. 
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Well, I think I have one. I'm a perfectionist. I want to play well. Of course I'm giving my best, but sometimes that's not happening. You know, just usually I just try to keep it into myself. But today I was like, It's better just to get it out. 

 Q. I take it that's not how you want to win any game. Would you have preferred to perhaps come back in the second or seen it out in the third? You don't want to see an opponent retire. 
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No, of course not. I never want anyone to be ill or injured. But, you know, I think it was better for her to retire today if that's what she was feeling, she wasn't feeling well enough, then it's better not to risk her health.

 Q. Was it a bit unfortunate to be deprived of a good early test by the way the second set was going? 
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No. Um, what was the question? 

 Q. Were you left with the feeling, like just an unfortunate feeling of maybe being deprived of a good early test in the tournament?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No. I'm through to the next round. I'm going to do my best there, and we'll see what's going to happen. 

 Q. Tomorrow's opponent, what do you think about the match tomorrow?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I don't know who I'm playing.

 Q. Morita. 
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Okay. Girl same age as me; played a lot in the juniors, a lot tough matches. She's been playing well this week. It will be interesting. 
 Hopefully I can play well and get my game going well.
