C. WOZNIACKI/E. Dementieva
  6-1, 6-1

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Perfect start? 
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Very nice start, definitely. I'm very happy to be through this first match. It's always tough to start a new tournament. Against Elena, I knew -- we have had so many tough matches in the past. It's nice to get this one. 

 Q. You're used to it, you played here last year. Coming from other tournaments, coming to this one and going back outdoors again, is that a tough thing for you?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No, not really. I mean, I've been here for a few days already and been practicing. 
 So, no, I didn't find it tough really. 

 Q. Bit more of a general question. At what point in your career did you think, I can be the world No. 1? 
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I don't know, I've always believed in myself. Since I've been a little girl that's been a dream and something I've been aiming for. 
 I don't know, I just always believed it was possible. I knew it was going to be tough and I knew that it was about hard work and good choices. 

 Q. So since so since you were a girl?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yes.

 Q. Dementieva Wozniacki is a big match. Were you disappointed by the number of empty seats?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I actually thought there was quite a few people there. I thought it was a good atmosphere. 
 When you're on the court, you're really just focused on what's going on in the court and not so much what's going on off the court.
 Of course you feel when you're the fan favorite, when the people are for you, and that always helps me a little bit and gives me that extra push in the right direction.
