  6-0, 6-7, 6-4 
  
  
  
  Q. Talk a little bit about how you feel after that match, coming through with a big win.   
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Oh, I mean, I feel great that I won, I mean, even in these conditions. I'm feeling better now. I got to cool down, getting some massage. The medical staff is helping me, the physio, the doctors, everyone. So that's really great.   
 Yeah, I'm going to do everything tonight to recover to be ready for tomorrow.   
  
  Q. As far as the key to the match? The first set was 6-0. She came back. What pulled you through? What do you think was the difference today?  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I really think I should have finished it off after being up 6-Love, 5-2. I had two match points. The line umpire called one of them out, then she challenged it, and it was just in. I wasn't happy about that.   
 But, I mean, afterwards, she just started to play really good, really aggressive. In the third set, I just knew I really had to go for it. I don't remember, I think it was like 2-2 or what was the score when I got cramps? 3-1. When it was 3-1 for me, I got the cramp in my leg. From there, it just got worse and worse.   
 I have absolutely no idea how I pulled it through, but I'm very happy about it.   
  
  Q. Moving forward, things that you're going to be doing tonight to get ready for tomorrow?   
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I'm gonna do everything I can to get ready for tomorrow. I'm just going to do everything what the physiotherapist and the doctors are saying: drinking a lot of fluids, eating some good food, stretching, get some massage, get some ice massage, take a salt bath, everything.
