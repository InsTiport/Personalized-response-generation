J. HAMPTON/C. Wozniacki
  6‑7, 7‑5, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Just the sort of workout you needed before Wimbledon?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Obviously I would have loved to have won today.   You know, it would have been worth it to be out there for three hours.
But, you know, I thought actually we played a very good match.   Also, you know, the wind that was there, you know, it was so difficult.   But, you know, I had my chances.   I didn't take them, and, you know, she played very well, I have to say.

Q.   Did the short break at 5‑4 make any difference to you?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   5‑4 in the second? 

Q.   When you came out to serve for the match. 
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I don't know.   I mean, I had 30‑Love, and again, should have taken it, really, but didn't take my chance today.   Hopefully if it happens again at Wimbledon I'll step it up a notch.

Q.   The weather today seemed to affect your game quite a bit. 
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Of course, yeah, it did, both of us.   It was very difficult.   The wind was swirling around.   You didn't really have an idea if you were playing with the wind or against the wind because it was just going around and around.
It was difficult, but I think we did it very well out there, both of us.

Q.   There were 14 breaks of serve today, 8 on your serve.   Was your serve giving you some struggles?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Did it look like it gave me struggles? 

Q.   Was it more because of the wind then?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I haven't seen the stats, but, you know, I think I had a lot of high first‑serve percentage, and, you know, I thought I served really well.   But, you know, again, it's difficult in the wind and she returned well, and, you know, we both served and returned well.   It's not like it's easy out there.

Q.   Overall, how are you feeling ahead of Wimbledon?   Decent week here.   A few matches after a tough clay season?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Yeah, overall I'm feeling good, I feel happy to be on grass.   I feel like my game is where I want it to be.   Hopefully at Wimbledon I'll do well.

Q.   What is it about Eastbourne that keeps you coming back?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I just like the atmosphere here, good practice court and good facilities.   It's a very nice tournament.

Q.   Will you come back next year?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I hope so. 

Q.   Have you seen the Wimbledon draw?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   No, I haven't seen it yet.   It was like, You know what?   I don't really care at the moment.   (Smiling.)

Q.   Have you had a chance to get out of the hotel and look around Eastbourne?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   If I have what? 

Q.   Have you had the chance to go out of the hotel and look around Eastbourne?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Yeah, a little bit.   But after being here, I don't know, nine, ten times, you know, I kind of know the city pretty well and know which places I like to go to.

Q.   Any particular favorite places you like to go to?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I like the Thai restaurant just right here around the corner.   I like the Italian, Mozzarella Pomodoro, what it's called. There is another Chinese restaurant that's good down the street.
Different.   I just like a little bit of variety. 

Q.   Are you heading back to London today?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Yeah.   Heading out tonight in a couple of hours.   Just going to pack up my stuff and get ready to go. 

Q.   Wish you well for Wimbledon. 
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Thank you.
