 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Excellent seven days and finally this. What went wrong today?  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Well, Vera is playing a very good match. She played at a very high level.   
 I had my chances, had quite a few breakpoints. I didn't convert, and then I lost the match.   
 But, you know, I really tried to do my best out there. I was fighting. You know, today Vera just played better than me.  
  
  Q. Is it possible to know what was the small little difference between both players today? Because it was so tough and so tense.   
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yes, it was very small things that does it. At this level you need to take the chances that you have.   
 It's a final. I really did my best today. It wasn't enough. Still, it was a pretty good week where I've been sick and still made it to the finals.  
 Today I felt actually much better. You know, I'm just happy to have been in the finals and another good week for me.   
  
  Q. You lead 2-love in the second set. You looked to go in front of you, but she come back.   
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, she came back. That's what happens. We were fighting for every point, every game, and it was close, but it went her way today.   
  
  Q. You have been playing nonstop since the start of the season. Do you think you need a break now?  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Well, I'm playing Indian Wells and Miami, so I'm looking forward to these two tournaments. Right now I'm just gonna take a few days and take it easy, and we'll see what happens.
