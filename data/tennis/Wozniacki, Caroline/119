C. WOZNIACKI/S. Stosur
6-2, 6-1
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Looks like you're hitting your stride finally after the rains of Birmingham.
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah.  No, I feel very comfortable here, and I really enjoy playing here.  I have always played well here.  It was a good match for me out there today.
Q. How much confidence -- we spoke about it briefly in Birmingham about the ankle, but you seem to be back on key?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, I feel good.  The ankle is feeling good.  As long as I'm stable and moving well, it feels good.
I'm pleased with the way I have been playing.  You know, the first match I played quite well, but today I feel I played even better.  Hopefully there is more tennis to come.
Q. Were you surprised by the score?  You were playing a top player, so you don't expect to win that easily, do you, normally?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No.  No, but in the end of the day, you know, some results might look easy on the grass but it never is.  You always have to focus and take advantage of the break points you get.
Yeah, I mean, Sam is a big server, so I was really pleased about the way I was able to return today.
