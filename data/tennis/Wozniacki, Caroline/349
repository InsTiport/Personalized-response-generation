  Q. Obviously not ideal, but looks like you may be through.   
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, I mean, I feel so sorry for Victoria really, because I know how she's feeling. It's never fun to pull out with an injury, especially in such a big tournament.   
 But, of course, I'm in the semifinals and I'm happy about that. I've also been fighting on the court. But, I mean, yeah, again, I feel really sorry for Victoria.   
  
  Q. And obviously a bit of a change of mindset now, having thought you may not be there, now you have to prepare for a big match tomorrow.   
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, I thought already I was going to lie by the pool tomorrow and relax and start my holidays. But suddenly, yeah, I'm in the semifinals, so it's a big change.   
  
  Q. I'm not sure who you play. Would you mind breaking down both girls.   
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Serena is a great fighter, world No. 1. Yeah, she's playing really great. Big champion.  
 Venus, as well. She's also a fighter, playing well. I mean, I need to be a hundred percent to have a chance to win. If I'm playing like I did today, then I don't really see a positive on it. Hopefully tomorrow I'll feel better.   
  
  Q. Physically hour by hour you're feeling better?  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I'm feeling better, yeah, every minute that's going. But still, yeah. Hopefully a miracle can come. Get a good night's sleep and I'll better good tomorrow.
