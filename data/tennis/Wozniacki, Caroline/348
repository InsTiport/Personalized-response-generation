 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Caroline, please.   
  
  Q. This match was very sad for you today. Can you explain how you experienced it?  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, I mean, I didn't have anything left. I couldn't play like I wanted to. I had some pain in my stomach muscle, as well, so I couldn't serve.   
 Yeah, it was tough. If you're not a hundred percent, it's tough to win.   
  
  Q. After the two three-setters you played, would it be disappointing if you didn't advance?   
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I definitely feel like I deserve to get past and make it to the semifinals. But, I mean, I did everything I could. I fighted [sic] the best I've learned. I mean, if I don't get there, it's just bad luck. It's the way it was supposed to be. You know, I still have many more years in front of me. So hopefully I can make it another time.   
  
  Q. You have your thigh iced now. Is that the hamstring that's sore from last week or something different?  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No, it's still the hamstring. I also have my stomach iced. I mean, then yesterday didn't help. I mean, my body is just tired now. After this tournament, hopefully I can get a few more matches here, but if not, I'm ready for a vacation.   
  
  Q. You knew before the beginning that you would not be able to play at a hundred percent?  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No, I really wanted to play a hundred percent. In the warmup today I started to feel the stomach muscle. I didn't think it was going to affect me this much.   
 But, I mean, yeah, I did as I did. I gave a hundred percent, the most I could. Yeah, just wasn't enough.   
  
  Q. Will you follow the match between Azarenka and Radwanska?  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, definitely. Now, I hope that Radwanska will win because if she wins I'll get through. For sure, I'm going to be cheering for her.   
  
  Q. Is it special because all three of you are friends?  
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, definitely it's special. We're all three friends. Usually I wouldn't cheer for any of them, because they're both my friends. But now in this situation, I think it's normal that I'll cheer for Radwanska.
