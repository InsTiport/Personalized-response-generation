C. WOZNIACKI/B. Bencic
6-2, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. In the first set, started a little rough.  Called your coach out.  Things seemed to turn around for you.  What was the advice he gave you?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Basically just gave me a few pointers on the serve.  He just told me to just try and take the ball a little earlier.
Q. You had some tough battles against her in the past.  What do you think you maybe did differently tactically this time?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I don't know.  It's been a while since I've played her.  I think a lot of things have happened since then.  I think I just stayed really steady and I tried to stay really focused.  That was really it.
I tried to not really think about the past matches, just think about this one as a new one, new experience, a new stadium.  That was really that.
Q. I have a fashion question for you.  You wore that green dress at the opening ceremony.  I'm wondering, how did it arrive to you?  Was it a special designer piece just for you?  How did you like it?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yes, it was a Chinese designer from here.  I tried out a few different options.  I chose this one.  I thought it was very pretty.  I got to keep it, which was very nice.
So, yeah, I really, really thought it was pretty.
Q. You have the day off tomorrow.  Do you have any plans?
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Just practice and relax.  No big plans.  This time of the year, I'm just trying to stay relaxed and energized.  That's really it.
Yeah, I think we've been hanging out with Angie a lot downstairs in the hotel, just talking.  My dad has been there.  The whole Polish crew kind of have been hanging out, so that's been nice.
