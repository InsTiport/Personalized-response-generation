  4‑6, 7‑5, 6‑2 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Your wrist obviously had treatment.   It was strapped and everything else.   How serious or not serious is it?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I hope it's not serious.   You know, I could feel it today, especially in the third set.  
But I'm going to go get it checked out tomorrow, and hopefully it's okay.  
   
 Q.   Did it play a big part until the third set?   As the third set went on, was there a lot of pain?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Well, I could feel it definitely.   Let's just hope for the best.   
I should be completely fine for Australian Open.  
   
 Q.   It just came on during the match, the wrist injury?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Yeah.   I started feeling it more and more during the match, yeah.   
   
 Q.   You've had five matches now since the start of Perth.   How to you feel going into next week?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   It's nice to get some matches.   I always feel like I play better when I've gotten a few matches under my belt.  
So, yeah, you know, I hope that I'll be playing well in the Open next week.   
   
 Q.   You've been denied the chance to kind of stop Kvitova in the final.   You were on course to possibly meet her there and save your No. 1 ranking.   Is that something you're disappointed about or you're not fazed?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   To be honest, I don't think about it.   The most important thing is to be healthy and be able play and play well.   
I mean, what happens happens.   Doesn't matter.  
   
 Q.   What did you take from tonight as a learning curve?   Are you going to take positives?   What will you work on over the next few days?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Yeah, you always try to see positive things and what you could do better and try to work on these things.
