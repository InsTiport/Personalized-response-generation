  6-3, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Seeded No. 1 on center court; a good win to start with. What is your assessment? 
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Definitely. Gisela is a tough opponent, especially in the first round. She changes the rhythm quite a bit. So it's tough to get there and play your own game. 
 But, no, it's the first round. It's always tough. I'm really happy to be through, and through to the next round.

 Q. Match must have given you a lot of confidence then. 
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Well, definitely. You know, I'm feeling good. I'm feeling like I'm in a good shape. Happy to be through from the first round. 
 I'm looking forward to play the next one. 

 Q. How were the conditions out there?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: It was a bit windy out there. But, you know, you really had to have a look where the wind was blowing. 
 But it's the same for both of us. 

 Q. They called you Sweet Caroline in the newspaper the other day. Do you know that song? Are you familiar with it?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yes, I am. They played it quite a few times in the U.S. when I have been going on and off the court. It's a good song. I like it.

 Q. Are you familiar with the works of Neil Diamond, the singer?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, I know him. Well, I don't know him, but I know who he is (laughter). 
 Yeah, I've listened to a few of the songs. But Sweet Caroline is definitely the one. I actually have it on my phone as well. 

 Q. As your ring tone?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No, not as my ring tone, but in my music library, yeah.
