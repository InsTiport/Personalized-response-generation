 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. You must have been happy with your game today. Could you tell us about it. 
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, I was really happy. And I had a tough opponent today, so I was really happy to get through. And, yeah, I felt like I was feeling confident on the court and comfortable. 

 Q. Does it feel different coming to this Grand Slam after making the final of the U.S. and your ranking is up to 4? Do you feel more expectation from outside?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I don't know. I always just look one match at a time and I want to win and that's my goal. Then, you know, I don't really -- I try not to put more pressure on myself than I already do. 

 Q. Are you working with Darren Cahill at all, or is your dad still your main coach?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: My dad is still my main coach. I mean, Darren is still helping out sometimes. He's a great guy. And, yeah, he comes with some good input sometimes.

 Q. You're playing the German girl next. 
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Okay. I didn't know. 

 Q. What do you think about her?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: She's a good player. She has a good serve and she's an aggressive player. 
 It's going to be another tough match. Hopefully I can pull it through.

 Q. Do you know her from your time together on the tour?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, I know her pretty well like a girl, but I haven't seen too many of her matches. But I know that she, yeah, can play on a really high level. 

 Q. Are you surprised to be as advanced with your tennis at this age, or were you expecting to do this well so early?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No, I didn't expect to do that well this early. 
 But, I mean, I'm really happy about the way things are going. And I've been practicing hard, so I'm really, really pleased about, yeah, the way I'm playing. 
 Hopefully I can just keep playing better and better. 

 Q. Any areas of improvement, any particular areas, that you need to get better at, do you think? 
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, I've been working on my net playing, so that's what I've tried to improve.
