  6-2, 6-1

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. You had beaten her a couple times this season. How was today's match different for you?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: It was much different. I mean, today I didn't put a lot of balls in the court. I mean, she was, you know, playing pretty good.
 I mean, just I didn't really feel it today. That was different. To beat a player like her, you need to play really well.

 Q. Seemed like you struggled on your serve a little bit. I believe you got broken seven times. Can you elaborate on that?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, usually I don't get broken seven times in the match. That was something new for me. I was struggling a little bit with that.

 Q. Is this something that bothers you coming out of this match going forward, or is it easy to put behind you?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I mean, always bothers you, especially now when you just lost. But you need to put it behind and you just keep practicing. You know, there's next tournament. 

 Q. How surprising was it for you just getting broken like that?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I mean, I didn't really think about it too much during the match. But, you know, I didn't get a lot of games overall, so... 
 I mean, it was just frustrating that I couldn't play the way that I wanted to.

 Q. Was there any point where you thought you might be able to get back into it, or was it just an uphill battle the whole way?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: I was trying, but I think I was battling more with myself just to try to put more pressure on the ball. As long as I didn't put pressure on it, she was there. 
 I mean, I just was making too many unforced errors as well. 

 Q. You've beat Elena twice in Charleston and Miami lately. Was today a different Caroline, different Dementieva? 
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: Yeah, I was different today. I mean, I didn't play my best game. I mean, she was playing well. I was making too many errors. That's the thing. 

 Q. What advice your coach give you when he came twice or three times in the match?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No so much. Just telling me just to keep fighting and trying to, yeah, get the rhythm and get into some longer rallies.

 Q. Did she surprise you today with something?
 CAROLINE WOZNIACKI: No, I mean, I knew how she was playing and everything, so I don't know.
