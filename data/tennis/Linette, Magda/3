THE MODERATOR: Questions for the Polish team.
Q. How many of you have played in the Fed Cup prior?
MAGDA LINETTE: All of us.
Q. Can you talk a little bit about this venue, being quite different from the other reason views where you've played.
MAGDA LINETTE: I played before in Israel, in Eilat, which is also next to the sea.  But it's obviously not this beautiful.  I'm really enjoying.  I believe my team also.
We are very happy we can be here.  We're just enjoying and we try just to practice as good as we can on the tennis court, and then we just try to enjoy everything else out of the court.  We really like it.
Q. What do you think of the matchups, keys to victories this weekend?
PAULA KANIA: It definitely is going to be a great atmosphere in the team.  Yeah, we had a really good practice week.  I hope this is going to work in this weekend.
But the key is, like I said before, just atmosphere, like playing your best tennis, just to give your best.  Actually, I cannot say anything else.  It's always pretty much the same thing, so yeah.
