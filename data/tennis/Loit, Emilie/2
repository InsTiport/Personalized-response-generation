Q. It's the first time you have played Lindsay. What is your impression of her? 
 
 EMILIE LOIT: (Through translator) I played about four or five Top-10 players, and Lindsay is the one who impresses me the most, the most impressive one. She's got a great serve. She serves at an amazing speed. Probably two aces per game. You just feel pressure all the time because she's always there, even if you put the ball in the court. I'm amazed by the speed.  
 
Q. What do you think of her chances to win this tournament? 
 
 EMILIE LOIT: It's two weeks. I don't know how she will be in two weeks. Thanks to me, she might not be too tired today, so it will help.
