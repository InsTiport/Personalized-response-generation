EMILIE LOIT: Yes, it's the best match I've ever played on a tennis level and feeling level. I was playing on the center court. The public was great, so I really had a great moment on the center court today. 

EMILIE LOIT: I was believing in it from the beginning. I played well the first set. I even played very well in the second set. It was very close. On the two match points, I really went for it. I really thought until the end, why not, that I could do it. 

EMILIE LOIT: Yes, I remember. Today I was feeling so good on the court that I thought that anything could happen. So, yes, I tried this shot, like I tried a lot of other shots. It worked well. It was just a question of feeling at that moment. 

EMILIE LOIT: Yes, a little bit. But also slice is my game, so I knew I was going to play this way. I tried also not to play with too much power and make too many mistakes, to keep her playing the rallies. I thought also the fact that being left-handed could bother her. 

EMILIE LOIT: Yes, I liked it because it was cool, and also the surface suits my game very well. My topspin forehand bounces very high and it takes my slice very well. I really like the surface here.
