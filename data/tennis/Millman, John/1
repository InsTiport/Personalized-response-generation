J. MILLMAN/M. Pervolarakis
6-2, 6-3
Q. Can you talk about the win?
JOHN MILLMAN:   Look, I was expecting a really tough match, and it wasn't smooth sailing.  Last year I played my opponent in the same competition, and he really took it to me, so I thought I was probably a little bit more prepared this time around and just happy to get a bit of court time because it's so important after probably a bit of a disrupted start to the year.
Q. Can you talk about playing for Australia?
JOHN MILLMAN:   Yeah, look.  This is what it's all about.  It's my favorite thing putting on the green and gold and playing for your country, whether that's in the ATP Cup, Olympics or Davis Cup.  I love team competition.  Probably started off as a kid when I was playing school tennis at churchy and now I get to represent my country.  It's really special, not just to be around the boys and the team setup but to really be able to identify with the rest of the Australians cheering you on.  It's a really special and humbling experience.
Q. Speaking about the fans, it was the last game and you're 40-15 down.  How big of an impact were the fans?
JOHN MILLMAN:   Yeah, 15-40.  Look, it's obviously probably just a -- it's the toughest thing when you probably haven't played for a little bit, haven't been under those match pressures for a while and you're serving it out.  Played probably a couple little loose points early on but managed to execute towards the end there and get through with the win.
You know, I'll use that going into the Australian Open, which I'm really excited about.
