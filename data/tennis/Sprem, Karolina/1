THE MODERATOR:  Karolina Sprem for you.  
 
 
Q.  Unlucky today.  Looked like you were struggling a bit out there.  Was the right ankle playing up?
 
KAROLINA SPREM:  No, my ankle was perfect.  I didn't feel like today I was a little bit tired, but what can I say?  She was too good for me today.  She was serving too good.  Too good.  She was moving on the court, return too good for me today.  I just can congratulate to her.  She was really great player today on the court.  I was feeling when she was standing on the court that court's too small for me, I didn't have space really to play, so...  
 
Q.  Obviously, you'll take a lot of memories from this Wimbledon.  What has been the highlight was probably beating Venus.  You hope this will help you to build for the future now?
 
KAROLINA SPREM:  Of course, one great week is behind me.  But I didn't expect that I will do so much on the Wimbledon.  I'm really happy. 
 
Q.  Lindsay, she's kind of almost slipped into the semifinals unnoticed now.  Do you think she's got the game to go all the way again and perhaps reclaim the title?
 
KAROLINA SPREM:  If she will playing like today, unbelievable, she can win this tournament, that's for sure.
