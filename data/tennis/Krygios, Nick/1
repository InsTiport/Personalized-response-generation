THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Looked like a load of fun right from the start.  You seemed to be really enjoying it.  
DESIRAE KRAWCZYK: Yeah, no, it was definitely fun.  Someone is a little disappointed.  No, it was definitely fun playing with him.  We had a great crowd.  It was good.  Tough loss.   
NICK KYRGIOS: I had a lot of fun.  I definitely wanted to play mixed this year.  You know, I knew that in singles, if I got a tough draw like it happened, I was just able to be around the grounds and play another match.   
I had a lot of fun today.  I thought it was pretty high level.  Yeah, it was a lot of fun.   
 Q.  When you stopped at the desk I think it was the first time you stopped talking, wasn't it?  You seemed to be nattering for hours.  
DESIRAE KRAWCZYK: I don't know, you can answer that.   
NICK KYRGIOS: I guess you kind of have to.  I'm just kidding.  She's all right.   
 Q.  You said crazy bossy.  
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah.  No, I didn't.   
DESIRAE KRAWCZYK: Wow.  Bossy?  Seriously?  I just call plays.  You're -- wow.   
NICK KYRGIOS: She played awesome, I thought.  She was really good.   
DESIRAE KRAWCZYK: Thanks.   
 Q.  Is enjoying tennis more important to you, games like tonight, than perhaps some of the other stuff?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, for sure.  I think that's the most important thing.  That's why we play.  I didn't want to, you know, come off like a creep when I asked her.  I just genuinely wanted to play.  You know, just have a lot of fun.  I take these losses harder, though, actually, than I do in singles matches.  I just love doubles a lot.  I wanted to play.  It hurts to not win.  I really wanted to win.   
 Q.  Would you feel more responsibility, it's not just you going to lose, you lose as a pair?  
NICK KYRGIOS: For sure.  I'm always up for the team environment, too.  I love it.   
DESIRAE KRAWCZYK: It was good.   
 Q.  Your version of how Nick approached you, creepy?  
DESIRAE KRAWCZYK: It wasn't creepy.  I was just caught off-guard.  No, he just asked a random question, Do you want to play mixed at Wimby?  I was, like, Sure, why not?  Thought it would be fun.   
 Q.  You said it was a great crowd.  The energy Nick brings, have you ever experienced anything like that before?  
DESIRAE KRAWCZYK: No, he's definitely a big name.  Everyone wants to come watch him.   
NICK KYRGIOS: Drunk guys, like, hitting on you the whole time.   
DESIRAE KRAWCZYK: Yeah, they were like seagulls, like, Des, Des, Des, Des.   
No, it was definitely fun.  I didn't have to do much on the serves.  It was great.  It was a lot of fun.  Thanks for playing (smiling).   
 Q.  Do you see a time in the future perhaps when you're a doubles specialist?  
DESIRAE KRAWCZYK: He could be really good.   
NICK KYRGIOS: Man, I don't know.  I could see myself maybe, yeah.  Maybe one day.   
 Q.  Take the stress of the whole singles thing out of the equation?  
NICK KYRGIOS: I don't think so.  Not any time soon.  I mean, yeah, if I keep playing basketball, my body is going to break down soon anyway.  I won't have much choice.   
 Q.  Curious, how did your body come out of Wimbledon?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, good.  I had about eight-and-a-half hours of match play in three days just from singles, so my body is actually feeling okay.  I'm going to get a good rest tonight.   
DESIRAE KRAWCZYK: Are you?  Full of shit.  Full of shit.  Sorry for my language (smiling).   
NICK KYRGIOS: Eat up and stretch and make it an early night.   
DESIRAE KRAWCZYK: I'm sure they all believe that.   
 Q.  What did you make of Jennifer and Marcus out there today?  
DESIRAE KRAWCZYK: Yeah, they were good.  I mean, I thought Jenny played it really well.  She stepped it up.  Served well.   
I think we just -- minor points here and there on the return serves kind of got us in trouble.  Yeah, it was a lot of fun.   
NICK KYRGIOS: They played well.   
 Q.  Sometime during the match, can't remember when, you shouted out, You're the weakest link in the match.  Can you remember that?  
NICK KYRGIOS: It's called, at that current moment, it was called a joke.  Have you heard one of those before?   
 Q.  Yeah.  
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah.   
 Q.  Can you tell me about it?  
NICK KYRGIOS: That's the joke.  You obviously didn't get it, did ya?   
 Q.  Apparently not.  
NICK KYRGIOS: That's not my fault.   
 Q.  Without the tennis, will you still stick around Wimbledon for a little bit or will you, after tonight...  
NICK KYRGIOS: I'll probably hang around the next couple days.  I have a couple friends still playing.  I'm not sure what I'll do from here.  I've got to organize what my plan is going to be.   
As I said, just have to be all the right things, be professional, recover the next couple days and get some good rest.
