SESTINI HLAVACKOVA-STRYCOVA/Hsieh-Siegemund
6-4, 6-7, 10-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How does it feel?
ANDREA SESTINI HLAVACKOVA: Yeah, it's awesome.  I think it came at the best time.  Our score other than clay courts was not that great.  This week we really worked on many things.  I am so happy how it worked out in the final because it could have gone either way, in semis and in the final.
Q. What changed for you in New Haven now that you're on the hard courts?  What did you do different this week?
BARBORA STRYCOVA: We tried to work on some things, little things, for us that make huge difference.  It wasn't so much about, like, tennis, it was more about being on court all together, these kind of things.  It's more mental than tennis.
We did it very good in four matches.  We improved in that.  This is the result.  We have to still work on that, but we are on a good way.
Q. You started playing together this year, recently?
ANDREA SESTINI HLAVACKOVA: Yeah.
Q. How did that come about?
ANDREA SESTINI HLAVACKOVA: I was set up for a full season.  Doubles was my only game now.  I lost my partner after a few tournaments.  I was looking.
Barbora was up for playing with me.  We kind of started, like, in Madrid, let's say.  We said that we going to go for a full season and we'll see how it goes.  We going to have fun and try to win the big titles.
This is our first title.  It's such a good feeling.  I hope we will take it for the rest of the season and maybe bring some more.
Q. Barbora, you played a former partner of yours today.
BARBORA STRYCOVA: Yeah.
Q. Tell us how you approached playing with them versus playing against them?
BARBORA STRYCOVA: We played one tournament, Indian Wells.  We won it.  It was really random because I was set up with somebody else.  We said at the last minute, Let's play together, because she doesn't have anyone.
She's such a great player, she's such a nice girl.  To play against her, I don't like it so much because she's such a tricky one.  She can put every ball back.
Yeah, but we kind of found a way today.  I'm very happy because it's not easy.
Q. Even though you won Indian Wells, you never considered remaining partners with her?
BARBORA STRYCOVA: No.
ANDREA SESTINI HLAVACKOVA: I was already there (laughter).
BARBORA STRYCOVA: It is like this (smiling).
Q. Are you partnering for the US Open?
ANDREA SESTINI HLAVACKOVA: Yeah.
Q. How are you thinking about US Open now that you've won this one?  Full of confidence?
ANDREA SESTINI HLAVACKOVA: I think very, very happy with the way we competed here.  We are ready to bring it to the first round.  This is as far as we look, first round.  It will be very tough match.  I don't know who, but will be very tough.  It's Grand Slam.  We will just compete as hard as possible.  We'll give it all and we'll see.
Q. Who is more competitive between the two of you?
BARBORA STRYCOVA: We both are in a different ways.
ANDREA SESTINI HLAVACKOVA: (Pointing to Barbora.)
BARBORA STRYCOVA: Me a little bit more.
ANDREA SESTINI HLAVACKOVA: We were doing exercises together one wall to the other, till the beep go, you have to go again and again, till the rest of the girls stop because they can't.  You can guess who won.  She will die before she loses.
BARBORA STRYCOVA: That's true.  I try hard (smiling).
