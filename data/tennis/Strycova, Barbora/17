BARBORA STRYCOVA   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
 Q.  What do you think made the difference out there today?  She's obviously a different sort of person to play against.  
BARBORA STRYCOVA: She played the right game against me today, and I kind of -- at the beginning, I felt pretty good.  But she played high balls and drop shots, and I kind of tried to step in, but I didn't feel it today.  It was the worst day of the all -- the worst match of the all.   
So I have to give her a credit, because she played the right technique against me, but I didn't respond, and I didn't do anything special.   
 Q.  With her, you know, getting excited or animated sometimes in the match, is it hard to stay focused?  Is it hard to stay in your mind?  
BARBORA STRYCOVA: I mean, yeah, I think she needs it for her game.  And she kind of do it on purpose to give the opponent that she -- to, like, get out of the rhythm.   
But sometimes it's tough, but my coach told me before the match that I have to focus on myself, which I tried to do.   
But she screams sometimes hard and sometimes for the balls where I'm like, This is just weird.   
But I guess she needs it, and she plays well when she does that.   
 Q.  Overall, happy with your tournament here?  
BARBORA STRYCOVA: I am very happy.  Of course, I'm disappointed of the match today that I lost it actually myself.  She didn't beat me, like, that she was killing the ball or that I didn't have any chance.  I'm just disappointed that I didn't do anything special.   
But overall, if someone would tell me I would play fourth round here, I would be surprised because I didn't have the best streak before coming to play this tournament.   
And I am a grateful that I could play these matches.
