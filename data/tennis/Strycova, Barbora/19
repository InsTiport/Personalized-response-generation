A. CORNET/B. Strycova   
6-4, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  Was this just one of the days where you felt nothing is going your way with the let courts and close balls?  Did you feel this way?  
BARBORA STRYCOVA: No.  No, I didn't.  It was just one of the days where -- I would not call it one of the days.  I was just playing bad and I was not -- I had so many break points, and I didn't do it.  And I had so many chances and I didn't do it.   
And also I had some easy balls to go 5-2, then to go 3-0, and I didn't do it.  So that's why it ended up like this.  And if you have so many chances and you are not able to do it and you are kind of, like, thinking about it and it's getting worse and worse.  And at the end, it's just looking like that you're playing bad.   
But you bring it to yourself, because the chance is staying in your head, because I was thinking about it, which wasn't right.
