B. STRYCOVA/A. Ivanovic
7-6, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Why do you think you won that match today?
BARBORA STRYCOVA: Why?  Because I believed myself.  And I changed a little bit some things before I went on court, because I lost the previous matches against Ana, so I had to change a little bit the return.
I was trying to be aggressive because the conditions on this court is really fast, so you have to also play a little bit quick not to spin all the time the balls.
So that was working well, and I think I was returning also very well.
Q. That first set was the crucial one, wasn't it?
BARBORA STRYCOVA: Yeah.
Q. Did that give you the extra confidence?
BARBORA STRYCOVA: For sure.
Q. Down 5-3 in the tiebreaker?
BARBORA STRYCOVA: Yeah, I was 5-3 down.  I was playing very good four balls in a row.  I told myself when I was 5-3 down I was playing a little bit like didn't believe that I can do it, so I changed that.  I played very well the last four balls.  That gave me so much confidence for the second set.
Q. What's it feel like being in the semifinals?
BARBORA STRYCOVA: It feels great (smiling).  Yeah, I'm happy about it.  I'm happy the way I play, and.
I'm playing Caroline tomorrow.  She's a young gun (smiling).  I'm looking forward for that.
Q. Have you played her before?
BARBORA STRYCOVA: I played her last year in Australian Open.  I won that match, but it wasn't easy.  Totally different conditions here, so we will see.
Q. Played her the first round, right?
BARBORA STRYCOVA: Yeah, first round against her, yeah.
