W. OSUIGWE/C. Liu   
6-4, 6-7, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Give me your thoughts on the match.  
CLAIRE LIU: I think we both started out a little nervous in the beginning.  I think I capitalized on those nerves earlier, so that's how I went up the break.  And I think she just started playing better, and I rushed a little bit.   
I mean, overall she played a really good match.  I just tried to hang in there.  Got a little lucky in the second.  Yeah, she played really well.   
 Q.  Were you surprised about how well she did play?  
CLAIRE LIU: Not really.  I was expecting it.  I mean, I beat her, like, fast at Easter Bowl, but that was on hard.  And I knew she would learn from that match.  So I was expecting her to play well, and she did.   
 Q.  Anything that you did that quickly you'd like to go back and do differently now?  
CLAIRE LIU: I think making some of my overheads, because I probably made one out of, like, a bunch.  She was, like, lobbing me and I couldn't make an overhead.  So definitely that.   
 Q.  What about the variety of your shots?  You looped some.  Then you drove some.  Do you think that that perhaps could have helped you more if maybe you sliced on your backhand or anything like that?  
CLAIRE LIU: Yeah, I think -- I mean, I think it's hard to slice against someone who hits it really hard or, like, if it's really high, because we both like to change the pace.   
So it wasn't me changing the pace and my opponent just stopping.  She did the same thing, and I mean, I sliced a few.  She played really well.  And, I mean, other than, like, a few points she deserved it.
