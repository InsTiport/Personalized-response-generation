Q.  Your emotions before the match, nervous energy or how did you feel?
 
ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Well, actually I was a little bit nervous because you know I am playing Lindsay and she's American, we are playing center court.  I was a little bit nervous, so I didn't start so well.  
 
Q.  What do you take from a match like this?
 
ANNA CHAKVETADZE: I never played against her so I think it's a good experience for me.   
 She's No. 1 in the world, I guess, it's always good to play against players like her. 
 
Q.  Feel like you missed any opportunities?
 
ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Well, no.  
 
Q.  What did you see out of her, anything in her game that surprised you?
 
ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Well, she served pretty well today.  And mixed serve.  Good returns.  So that's why I made a lot of doublefaults because she going   -- she hit every ball from all my serves, so it's tough to put it in when you know that she going to hit so hard next ball. 
 
Q.  What has this week been like this for you? 
 
ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Well, it's good result for me because it's my semifinal at a WTA event, so I am pretty  -- I am happy that I played here.
