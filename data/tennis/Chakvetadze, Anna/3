  A. CHAKVETADZE/A. Mauresmo
6-3, 3-6, 6-1

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. The tape on your leg, just preventive?
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: It was just for support. Just protection. Didn't bother me. 

 Q. Seemed like a good first set and good third set tonight. 
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Yeah, I lost a bit concentration in the beginning of the second set, then I felt I started to play better. But it was too late. Already she was up like 5-1. I won two more games. 
 But I am still pleased with the third set.

 Q. Is there something that made you lose your concentration in the second set?
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: No, I don't know why it was like that. I hope it wouldn't be again like that. 

 Q. She thinks if you work on that part of your game, potentially No. 1 can be in the future for you. 
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Well, that's my goal. 

 Q. Do you still feel that's part of the game you need to work on?
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Yeah, definitely. 

 Q. How about the overhead?
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Oh, my gosh. I just lost the ball in the sky. I don't know how it happened. Just was not that difficult shot, you know. 

 Q. A couple weeks before you'd played; a couple weeks off. 
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Yeah, I was practicing in L.A. with my coach. I feel much better after that. 

 Q. Feel like you're getting better match by match right now?
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Yeah, definitely.

 Q. Last year you had a great season. How were you feeling last year at this time compared to now? Can you compare? 
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Yeah, every year is different. Of course I thought that I gonna play better this year than last year, but unfortunately it didn't happen. 
 I still have some time to show good results, and I look forward to that. 

 Q. Do you remember the last time you swung and missed at a shot like that? Doesn't happen very often, I take it. 
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: No, not really. I just remember last time my hair got stuck in the racquet. That's it (laughter). 

 Q. Did you feel more pressure going into the season compared to what you did last year?
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: No, not really. I just lost my confident [sic] a bit, yeah, in the first of the season. I had two injuries in one month, and it was tough time for me. 
 But, as I said, I look forward to get in the shape again. 

 Q. What were the injuries?
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: It was my rib and abdominal.

 Q. When was this?
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: When is Dubai? 
 THE MODERATOR: March. 
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Yeah, right. 

 Q. A couple injuries this year?
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Right. 

 Q. You had to overcome nine double-faults. Do you take some confidence you were able to do that or are you disappointed in yourself that you had so many?
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: No, of course I should serve better tomorrow definitely because I think Wozniacki plays more aggressive than AmÃ©lie does. Have to put more first serves in. 

 Q. You're 7-0 in finals. What's the reason for that?
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: I have no idea actually (laughter). I just play very concentrate during all my finals. And I hope it will be the same tomorrow. 

 Q. Is this the first of the finals where you've been the older player?
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Oh, come on. I'm not that old. I'm only 21 (laughter). 
 Yeah, there are a lot of players who are like younger than me, three, four years even younger. We have Russian girls who are four years younger. 

 Q. I mean in a final. 
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Yeah, she's a good player. So I look forward to play her. 

 Q. Have you ever played her at all?
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Actually, I never played her. 

 Q. Are you pleased to get to the final?
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Yeah, of course I'm pleased. But I look forward to take the title. 

 Q. Were you having problems with the sponsor thing on your shirt? I thought you had an injury, but is that what you were tapping down?
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Yeah, because I wet. It was sticking off. It didn't bother me actually. I get used to it. 

 Q. What is your coaching situation? You're with Lansdorp?
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Yeah, he gonna come to New York. He didn't come here this week because he couldn't. But I'm here with my dad. And things are going really well with Robert, and I like to practice with him. 

 Q. Are you still advised by Carlos Rodriguez?
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: No, not any more. 

 Q. I read somewhere you had Georgian roots. Do you have any family still there?
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: My dad does. 

 Q. How are things going down there? Does your father keep in touch with anyone down there?
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Yeah, he keeps in touch. I think we're not here to talk about politics. Our family is feeling okay. They're living in Tbilisi, the capital. They're feeling fine.
