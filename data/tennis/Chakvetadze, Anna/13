   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 

 Q.  Did you feel bad right from the start of the match? 
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE:  No, I felt okay.  And I actually felt that I'm ready to finish the match, you know, and I'm ready to play to the end.  And I start pretty solid 3-Love up.  And then suddenly I felt that, like, point by point, my power's going away. 
 So, and it was really long rallies, you know.  And I felt that after I lost first set, you know, I felt that I'm not ready physically to finish the match.  And it's a pity, because I felt that I am in good shape, but just, you know, physically I just can't run.  And I just can't finish the match. 

 Q.  This is the same kind of flu bug that you had from San Diego? 
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE:  Yeah, it's still the same thing.  And, I mean, I've been practicing for just an hour every day, and I felt it's okay. 
 But I actually didn't run that much on those practices.  I just, you know, just played from one place, you know, didn't run.  Just crosscourt and served.  Didn't do that much. 
 That's why, I mean, if I know that I was not able to finish the match, I would never go out to the court.  Because it's happened -- I mean, it's very, very pity for me because I have to defend semifinals here.  And I like this tournament, and it's just very sad. 

 Q.  Do you have any concern going into the US Open? 
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE:  Yeah.  Hopefully, I have one - more than a week to rest, you know.  And hopefully it will be okay. 

 Q.  How about the fact that you won't be getting in, I guess, matches now going into the Open.  Do you feel comfortable still? 
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE:  I'm feeling sick.  That's it (smiling).  I mean, you never know how you're going to play in a week. 
 Right now I'm feeling that I'm playing okay.  I'm on my rhythm.  I feel my serve.  And I'm just, as I said, not ready physically. 

 Q.  I'm sorry.  What are the symptoms you're feeling, nausea, light-headed? 
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE:  Yeah, headache, a little bit dizziness and can't really breathe well, you know.  And I have cough which was bothering me during the match.  All cold symptoms.
