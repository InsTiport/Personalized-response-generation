6-3, 6-3  
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions.   
  
  Q. Talk about the match. What was working well for you today?   
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Well, score is 3-3, but it's still pretty tough. I think we played more than one hour. In the games, it was really, really tough. Deuce all the time. A lot of breakpoints.   
 I think it was a good match. It was a little tough conditions. It was too hot. Like in the beginning of the second set, I felt a little dizzy. But then I was fighting till the end. That's why I won.   
  
  Q. How does it feel to be in the semifinals?  
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Well, it's great. I used to be in semis here two years ago. So I said it's my goal, to be in semis again. Now I look forward to take the title.   
  
  Q. Where is your game right now? Do you feel you're playing as well as you can?  
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Well, of course, you always feel that you can do better. But I'm pleased with the way I'm playing right now. It's much better than it used to be.   
  
  Q. Would you rather face a veteran like Mauresmo or someone younger like Szavay?   
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: They both are very different players. They will have a tough match today. I'm ready for both of them.   
  
  Q. Do you think this tournament gives you an advantage heading into the US Open?  
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Yeah, because I didn't play Olympic. I didn't play tournament before. So is a good thing to play some match here before the US Open starts.   
  
  Q. When it is hot like this outside, the conditions are tough, you felt dizzy, what do you do? Is there something you take? How do you get through it?  
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Yeah, you should just drink more. I actually put some ice, which helped me a lot. Put some ice on my neck and arms. It helped me a lot.   
  
  Q. Despite the heat, you did seem to have a lot of intensity in that match. Did that have anything to do with the fact this was a rematch?  
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Well, you know, that match which I lost to her, I was completely other player. I remember I was up all the time and I lost.   
 Today it was fight in every game for every point. She's a good player. It's a good win for me.   
  
  Q. How does it feel to be part of this new wave of young tennis players that seem to be taking over right now?  
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Well, it's every year some girls from new generation are coming. I'm not the youngest one I think. If you see my opponent, she's three years younger than me. Also some girls who are three or even four years younger.   
 It's tough, you know. You have to prepare yourself that somebody new will come all the time.
