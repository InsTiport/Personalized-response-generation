  N. VAIDISOVA/A. Chakvetadze  
4-6, 7-6, 6-3  
   
  Q. This is a question unrelated to today's match. Do you have any nicknames? Have you been known by a nickname at any stage in your career?   
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Yeah, I have, Chak or A Chak.   
  
  Q. Can I ask where you think it went wrong for you today?  
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Well, I think it was a pretty close match, all the sets was pretty close. I broke the first one, broke her serve the first set.   
 Then in the second set, in the tiebreaker, I think in the beginning she made two net balls, you know. It was very disappointing for me.   
 And I think also she had a lot of lucky shots in important moment, like a lot of net balls. And the last set also: 5-3, deuce, net ball again.  
 No, it's good for her. She's a good player and she deserve definitely this win. You know, maybe I didn't use my opportunities in the second set. But still, she served really well today, and it was tough to return.
