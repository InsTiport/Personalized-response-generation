3-6, 6-4, 6-1

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. You're up a set and then a break in the second, what happened from there? 
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: I think I just didn't recover from yesterday match. Finished quite late. Played three sets and didn't really sleep well. 
 I just didn't have power especially in the third set. I think it's quite important reason if you are not able to run and fight on the court, then you gonna lose the match. 

 Q. First game of the third set you missed a few kind of easy forehands. 
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Yeah, because I was tired, I didn't move that well, and that's why I was hitting so many unforced errors. 
 But Caroline is a great player. She doesn't hit that hard, but she plays consistent. So against her I should play quite aggressive and not do like so easy mistakes like I did, especially in the third set. 

 Q. Can you talk about moving back into the top 10, what this tournament has done for your confidence going into the US Open. 
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: Well, yeah, it's done a lot I think. I won quite few matches. I'm actually pleased with my game - not today. But if I compare it to one month ago, it's much better. So I look forward to play the US Open, the most important tournament obviously is coming in two days. I hope I will stay fresh for my each match. 

 Q. What was the reason that you failed to recover quickly enough? Is it because you haven't played enough matches in the past few weeks? 
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE: You know, the Grand Slam is much easier because you have a day off. I'm not going to play doubles. Hopefully it will work well for me next week.
