Q.  As you were traveling around to various challengers, trying to get into the main draw of a regular tournament, did you ever think once you got here you would beat a Grand Slam champion?

ANNA CHAKVETADZE:  No.  It's like too much, you know.  Actually, I playing quallies every time.  And 25,000, every time quallies, and 50s. Every time I had to pass quallies, and then playing main draw.  It's so difficult.  I'm so exciting that I beat Myskina today, but she played not so well.  But I'm happy that I won, you know. 

Q.  We have a saying in this country.  "Pay your dues."  It means in order to get to the top, you have to work from the bottom.  Is that what you did with all these challenger tournaments?

ANNA CHAKVETADZE:  Actually, I'm like 200 almost, so I don't think about it, you know.  Maybe now I will be top hundred.  I'm so happy that I will be. 

Q.  What was your emotion when you won? 

ANNA CHAKVETADZE:  I couldn't believe that I could win.  I just wanted to play my game, you know.  I couldn't believe.  Now I still don't believe that I beat Myskina, and she's like first in Russia.  She won Roland Garros.  It's unbelievable. 

Q.  When you did win, you clapped your hand over your mouth as if, "Oh, my God, I won."  Is that what you were trying to convey?

ANNA CHAKVETADZE:  Yeah, because I couldn't believe.  I tell you.  Like two sets, it's unbelievable for me.  That's great. 

Q.  I don't know many things about you, could you tell me your tennis story.  You grow up in Russia.

Q.  Some of your family teach you?

ANNA CHAKVETADZE:  No, no.  My mom wants.  We go to like try to play.  Actually, I played piano.  Then my mom said, "You want to try tennis?"  I said, "Yeah, it will be great."  Then like I try.  I said, "Okay, let's stop with piano, I want to play just tennis." 

Q.  In Spartak club like many other Russian girls?

ANNA CHAKVETADZE:  Yes.  It's like Myskina and Safin.  Everyone is from there.  But I practicing in Valeri (ph).  Myskina now is practicing there also.  And Bovina also.  It's very good club.

Q.  What kind of a piano player were you?  Were you a good piano player?

Q.  At the French Open final, one of the great days for Russian tennis, the two Russian players playing each other.  Did you have a chance to watch that match on television?  If you did, did you think to yourself, "I wish I could be up there one day doing that"? 

ANNA CHAKVETADZE:  No, I never thought like this.  I didn't see the match.  I don't remember why.  But I knew it was like so easy Myskina won.  I never thought that I can beat her. 

Q.  Myskina is said to be particularly intent when she's playing other Russian women, reportedly tries her hardest against other Russian women.  Were you aware of that when the match began?

ANNA CHAKVETADZE:  You know, I just remember the time she played not so good in Olympic Games.  She had 5-1 up against Henin-Hardenne.  Then she lost against - who - Molik.  They both are Top 20, so I never thought that I can won against her. 

Q.  Is it a dream come true for you?

ANNA CHAKVETADZE:  Yeah, I can say that. 

Q.  What is the next thing for you?  What do you want to do?

ANNA CHAKVETADZE:  To be Top 10.

Q.  Do you know who you play next?

ANNA CHAKVETADZE:  Daniilidou. 

Q.  So many errors today.  Do you think she didn't have her game with her or perhaps she was trying to hit too much because you were doing so well? 

ANNA CHAKVETADZE:  I don't know.  We will see.
