   THE MODERATOR:  Questions.   
  
  Q.  Where do you think the match got away from you?   
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE:  I just played horrible.  I mean, I didn't expect it will be such a turnaround after this first set.  You know, just couldn't put the ball in the court.   
 It's very disappointing match for me.  I mean, I didn't know what did I do, you know.  It was very tough condition because it was very windy.  I just couldn't handle with that wind.   
 But I'm very disappointed the way I played today.  I mean, I didn't want to, you know, just win in straight sets or something like that, but at least play at least maybe more than 50% that I can.  But that didn't happen.   
  
  Q.  Can you point to any reason why that didn't happen?   
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE:  Well, if I would know why it happened, I would just play better.  But it didn't happen, so I don't know why.   
  
  Q.  When you took that ten-minute break between the second and third set, where you able to regroup a little bit?   
 ANNA CHAKVETADZE:  It didn't help, as you saw.
