      6‑4, 5‑7, 6‑2, 6‑0 
  
    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in Spanish.   
   
 Q.   Really, you played much better than the final between AthlÃ©tico and Real.   You played on the center court.   You played a big player.   What did you feel during this match?   
    GUILLERMO GARCIA‑LOPEZ:   Well, first, thank you very much.   This match is very illustrative of the season I just had.   I'm very relaxed, and matches go very well.   I think I'm not as overwhelmed by emotions as I used to be, and that's the way I would talk about my season so far.   I play my game at my level.   I fight on every point.   
    At the end of the match, someone asked me what happened when I lost the second set.   I said ‑‑my answer was:   Well, I thought about it, I thought that's what happens, and then I got back in the match.   I changed nothing, I played my game, I was solid.   I started playing faster.  
    I had my foot on the accelerator 80%, and when you play this kind of player, they try and destabilize you, but he did not manage because I felt very strong today.   And I think at the end of the day what made him lose is that he was not so strong mentally, whereas I felt very comfortable.  
   
 Q.   Did you at any time feel that the match was yours, that you were going to win it?  
    GUILLERMO GARCIA‑LOPEZ:   Winning?   Well, when you're 6‑2, 5‑Love the last set, you feel a bit nervous, but you really want to finish the match.  
    But he also had a very powerful serve.   At 4‑1 when I realized that he was serving with new balls, I was a bit worried.   That's when he played very strong shots, 4‑2, maybe the match is going to be suspended and we will resume tomorrow, and it's going to be another story.   But when I started ‑‑when I was at 5‑0 in the third set I felt more comfortable.  
   
 Q.   Did you have a strategy?   Because you played him in Madrid, if I remember well, and did you feel the match would be suspended?  
    GUILLERMO GARCIA‑LOPEZ:   Yes, I did, because I could see the clouds and it was getting dark and we were 4‑Love, 30‑Love.   He could have won the game, we would have been at 4‑1, and then if there is a suspension and we have to resume the next day, I started thinking quite a lot about it.   
    But I followed my tactics.   His backhand is wonderful, so I tried to adapt.   
    But I didn't fear playing his shots.   I tried to break his rhythm.   I tried to vary the height of my shots.   But he's a very good player.   He's got all different shots in his racquet, so you have to adapt.  
    But I played well.   I changed the rhythm.   I made him run quite a lot.   And I was very careful with his first serve, because his first serve is very powerful.   That's what he likes.  
    So you have to be very solid.   Change the rhythm at all times, and it pays.  
   
 Q.   Would you say this victory is more important than the one against Nadal in Bangkok?   And what's the influence of Ferrer in your career?  
    GUILLERMO GARCIA‑LOPEZ:   Well, I think Nadal ‑‑ and I have a huge respect for Nadal.   I have a huge respect for Wawrinka.   But Nadal was at a very high level, so it was a great match.   Back then, the match was far more difficult than today.   
    As for my relationship with Ferrer, last week we were together.   We went to see a bullfight together.   We're great friends.   We have always had a very friendly relationship.   
    When I arrived at the tennis academy when I was 18, Ferrer was setting the example for all of us.   It's true that in the tennis academy, he was my role model.   He was the player I aspired to become.   
    I realized that I had to be myself, but I want to thank him from the bottom of my heart, because he guided me.   It's important for a young guy to have a role model, and I also worked a lot with Samuel Lopez, the coach who is coaching Nico now.   So Ferrer and I have a very good relationship.   We go out together, no problem.  
   
 Q.   You played the biggest champions, Nadal, Djokovic.   What's the difference with Wawrinka?  
    GUILLERMO GARCIA‑LOPEZ:   I think Stan had a very good start this season.   He was not as high in the ranking as the two others, but he progressed quite a lot.   
    But I think it was ‑‑mentally, the difference is in the heads.   Nadal, Djokovic, they are so strong mentally.   I think physically Wawrinka is just as good as them, but I think he's not as strong from a mental perspective.   I think this is what makes the whole difference.  
   
 Q.   You said that Wawrinka has improved quite a lot.   Some players would ask other very strong players to coach them, but would you say your relationship to Ferrer allows you to improve as much as Wawrinka for the rest of your career?   
    GUILLERMO GARCIA‑LOPEZ:   Well, having Ferrer as a coach would be fabulous, but I don't know if he'd have enough time to spend weeks with me.   I must say that Diego and I work very well together.   Over the last years I have improved quite a lot with him, because I too went through a difficult period.   Thanks to Diego I built myself‑confidence and the player I used to be, I'm calmer on the court, more relaxed.   
   
 Q.   You just won a beautiful win.   Now you're going to win Mannarino.   Do you know him?   What do you think of him?  
    GUILLERMO GARCIA‑LOPEZ:   Well, I was just told I would play him next round.   We all know each other a bit.   He is a French player, a lefty, full of talent like all French players, and this should be a highly disputed match.  
    I think that on the circuit, on this tour, we all have many opportunities.   You can win many players, you can be defeated by many players.   I'm quite confident that I've seen Adrian Mannarino play, and I must say that this is going to be a tough match because he's a very good player.  
   
 Q.   So a bit like Rafa, he's a lefty?  
    GUILLERMO GARCIA‑LOPEZ:   Absolutely.   If you just relax and say, Okay, great, I won my first round, then you may be in a difficult position.   Tonight I'll sleep well, but I don't want to rest on my laurels, because I didn't win the final today, as Marcello said.   There is still many matches that I need to win, so you don't want to rest on your laurels.
