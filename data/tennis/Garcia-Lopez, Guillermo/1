    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please.   
   
 Q.   You've been having a very good clay season playing with a lot of confidence, but what happened today?   What did GÃ¤el do to your game today?   
    GUILLERMO GARCIA‑LOPEZ:   Well, you know, when one player is playing good and the other, like me today, for example, is not playing at the level that I been playing the last weeks, the different is sometimes it's too much at this level.  
    But anyway, I think he played really solid when he has to be solid and really aggressive when he has to attack me, no?   So everything is going good for him, no?   
    And he put one more ball and one more, one more, and, you know, makes me in my mind many, many problems, because I don't know what to do:   to stay in the baseline, you know, pass ball with him, or attack him.  
    But I had the chance to play a fourth set, so that's a good, positive thing for me.  
   
 Q.   Is he a more complicated player on clay?   Because you beat him on hard a couple times.   Is he able to use his speed?   
    GUILLERMO GARCIA‑LOPEZ:   Yeah, maybe it's easier for me to play against him on hard court because my shots, if I play one shot, one good shot, he has not the chance to put one more ball in, no?   
    Here on clay, he puts one more and one more, one more, and I run.   But, you know, sometimes on hard, sometimes on clay, and you have to play in any surface.  
   
 Q.   Is he capable of winning a Grand Slam?   
    GUILLERMO GARCIA‑LOPEZ:   GaÃ«l?   
   
 Q.   Yeah.   
    GUILLERMO GARCIA‑LOPEZ:   Well, he has to play really good, because the guys who play well on clay this season, like Nadal or Djokovic ‑ even Murray is playing really good ‑ he has to play like today against other players better than me.  
    If Wawrinka won a Grand Slam at the beginning of the year, why GaÃ«l cannot win?   
   
 Q.   Many think he's the best athlete in tennis.   
    GUILLERMO GARCIA‑LOPEZ:   Well, no, he runs a lot; he's flexible; speed.   
    So maybe, but everything I think is in the mind, no?   Look at Nadal.   Nadal is‑‑ I mean, everybody in top 100 is physically ready.   They are preparing really good.  
    But in the mind, everything is here.   
   
 Q.   How would you describe his mind?   
    GUILLERMO GARCIA‑LOPEZ:   Nadal or...  
   
 Q.   No, GaÃ«l.   
    GUILLERMO GARCIA‑LOPEZ:   GaÃ«l, well, you know, you cannot expect normal things.   Sometimes he's playing unbelievable; sometimes, you don't know why, he's not playing or he's not doing anything.  
    It's a difficult mind.   I don't know.   Nadal, if you compare with Nadal, Nadal is always, you know, positive, doing everything, fighting.   
    GaÃ«l, of course always, but you cannot expect sometimes good things or change sometimes.
