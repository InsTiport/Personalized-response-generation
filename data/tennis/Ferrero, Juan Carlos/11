J. FERRERO/G. Simon
  1-6, 6-4, 7-6, 1-0 (ret.)

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Tell us your reaction to the way the match ended there. 
 JUAN CARLOS FERRERO: I had to. I mean, I start horrible, the match. I don't know why, because I wake up normally and I warm up well. 
 So I went to the court, you know, to be ready in the first point, but I wasn't.
 Second set I had to recover and start to think to play a little bit different, because I was doing a lot of mistakes all the time, no putting first serves in. 
 So I have to change my mind a little bit and focus in the things I had to.

 Q. Could you tell us a little bit about your summer and your resurgence. You look like the player we saw the last few years. 
 JUAN CARLOS FERRERO: Uh-huh.

 Q. What's different? 
 JUAN CARLOS FERRERO: I told you the other day, physically I'm completely different. I'm feeling great on the court, so I can play a lot of rallies as long as it is. 
 I recovered well after matches, so that's the big difference in maybe couple of years.

 Q. Has your game changed at all the last three or four years?
 JUAN CARLOS FERRERO: Not really. I try to be aggressive all the time, and that's the way I want to play almost every time.

 Q. How frustrating has the last couple of years been? How rewarding has it been?
 JUAN CARLOS FERRERO: Yeah, but I don't think it's the time to remember that.
