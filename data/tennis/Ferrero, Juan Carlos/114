ATP: First question, please.


Q.  You were so impressive up to the semis.  It looks like this tournament was yours.  What happened today?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I don't know, with Portas he played so good in the final, but pretty solid, but when I had 3-Love in the fourth all the -- I thought I am going to win.  But finally I lost and I am a little bit sad. 

Q.  When you won nine games in a row, what happened, what happened at that moment?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I don't know what happened exactly, because I did nine games and I played unbelievable games and then maybe I relaxed a little bit much because I was 3-Love in the fourth and then he played so solid all the time and the fifth I was too tight, I have a problem with my abductor and I feel too tired.  Then he played so good the fifth set also. 

Q.  The crowd seems to goes on your nerves, this maybe was as well a little bit of affected your game or concentration.  I could see you watching in the crowd at these kids....

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  No, only four guys all the point, every 30 seconds he said:  "Portas, Portas," but, you know, with all the time finally I shout them, but no more.

Q.  Is there a reason for your loss today or is  --

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  These guys?  

Q.  No.  No.  I meant another thing.  If the loss today of you fits a result of the 17 games in a row.  Perhaps you have been too tired now?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I think the reason for I lost was when I went 3-Love in the fourth and I lost the set, you know, I lost so much confidence and I was tired and I think everything less to win the match.

Q.  Are you going to be able to play next week in Dusseldorf?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I don't think so because right now I worked with the doctor to see my abductor.  He said it is very strong to play for tomorrow morning. 

Q.  You withdraw for the whole week or just for the match tomorrow?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I don't know.  I don't know exactly the situation.  I have to see right now. 

Q.  What is your state of mind tonight?   It is a big disappointment because you lost the final or well, I mean, I am sure it is but --

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Right now it's a big disappointment but this night  --

Q.  Yeah, but --

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I am very happy for these two weeks.

Q.  You still have 15, 16 matches.

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yes. 

Q.  Can you recover to make a good challenge for the French Open, do you think?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yes, I am going to stop -- if I can stop three or four days I think I am going to be very good in Roland Garros.  Why not.
