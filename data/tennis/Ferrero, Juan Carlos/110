MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  Can you talk about the tiebreaker, what was going through your mind in the fifth-set tiebreaker?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  In the fifth? 

Q.  The fifth set tiebreaker. 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  You know, the first point was very important.  I had some backhand very easy for me to do the point, and I didn't do.  Then I broke my string.  You know, 3-1, 4-1.  Is difficult.  I had some pressure at my service.  I think he play better than me the last tiebreak. 

Q.  Did you get nervous?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  No, not nervous.  I was more aggressive than him maybe, and I did some mistakes maybe.  I think was the key of the tiebreak and of the match. 

Q.  Did you just feel like things weren't going your way then?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Maybe.  I feel tired.  I feel I had many chance to win this match.  But finally I lost.  You know, I have to see in the future. 

Q.  Is it harder to take this loss, knowing that he's a Spanish guy?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yeah, is tough.  He is 19 years old.  He's coming playing very well.  He won Todd Martin and some guys here in the US Open.  I think he's playing so good.  He had to play so good to win me today because I was playing good the last two matches, and I had many confidence to play this match.  Finally, he played better than me in the final tiebreak. 

Q.  How well do you know him?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yes, I know him a long time ago, like three or four years ago.  I play with him some doubles.  Two years ago we play the futures in Spain together.

Q.  How much better is his game now?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I think he's more stronger than the last year.  I think is the key that he's winning more matches.  I think he's playing with more confidence.  He doesn't have fear to anybody.  I think he thinks he can play with anybody.  I think is important to play in this tournament. 

Q.  This match will help that?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yeah, of course.  He played with me many times, so... I think he has less pressure than me because I am 21, he's 19.  He has less pressure than me.

Q.  He wasn't nervous?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I don't think so. 

Q.  If you make a balance between the last three times you played here, what you have accomplished this one that you could have done?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Last year I did fourth round.

Q.  As far as your tennis, I mean, has it changed anything in your game?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  No, not really.  Maybe service.  My service, I improve my service a lot. 

Q.  Do you think your first serve kind of quit on you in the last two sets?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yeah, yeah.

Q.  Was that the key maybe?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yeah, maybe, yes.  But, you know, I feel great.  I think I played good.  I was very positive all the time, you know. When I was losing the match two sets to one to him, you know, I was with the head very tall, go up, try to go up all the time to try to play better.  Finally, tiebreak in the fifth, and many chance to win.  So I try all the time to be positive all the time.  When you are losing two sets to love, you have to try to win these matches.  I think it's important to be all the time in the court. 

Q.  The pressure of being in the Top 10, you're looking desperately to win a major tournament like a Grand Slam, is that a pressure?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  No, I didn't feel the pressure, but I want to win some Grand Slam.  But I'm really younger.  I'm 21, so I have a lot of time to try to win some Grand Slam.  So I'm going to see in the future. 

Q.  How do you think he will do against Andy Roddick?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I didn't see the match against Corretja.  Maybe he play so good to win this match.  I don't know.  I think both players has 19 years old.  I think Andy maybe has some more pressure because he's in-house with his people, and Tommy is playing good with a lot of confidence.  I think he's going to play so good with him.  Maybe some many chance for to win.

Q.  Tommy's serve is tough to return. 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yeah, he improve a lot, as well.  Last year he serve normal.  This year, the service of him all the time.

Q.  Has he gotten bigger, stronger?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yeah, maybe stronger.
