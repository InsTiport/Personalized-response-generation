  THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Juan Carlos. 

 Q.  How do you analyze the match?  Where do you think that Lleyton played maybe better? 
 JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I think was pretty close match - both sets.  When I finished first set, I think, you know, the first-serve percentage was the same, the winners was the same.  Was pretty close, only he won one more point than me in the first set.  It's difficult to say what he did better than me. 
 Second set, of course, the only game I played bad in the whole match was the first game of the second set.  It was very important to the end of the match. 

 Q.  I guess it also demonstrate for a tournament like this, the draw is very difficult, to have a match-up like that in the first round. 
 JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yeah, it's pretty difficult to have it.  There is a lot of tough match in the draw, in the first round.  Obviously, mine was the toughest one.  You know, it's like this.  We cannot do anything for it. 

 Q.  I was also wondering, what do you think changed in the game of tennis in the tour than when Lleyton and you were No. 1 in the world? 
 JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I don't know.  Maybe basically we are stronger than before.  I don't think many things changed a lot.  But physically, of course, we are getting stronger. 

 Q.  You feel that you have to be like physically in better shape to compete at that level? 
 JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yeah, I think so.  To be fit the whole year, you have to be very strong because we play a lot of tournament, you know, week by week.  We play a lot of matches. 

 Q.  It wasn't as demanding a couple of years ago? 
 JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  No, was the same, but you could choose what tournament you play.  Now you have to choose which tournaments you play to get a lot of points.  It's important. 

 Q.  Is the calendar stronger than it was two or three years ago? 
 JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I think is a little bit stronger, yeah, yeah.  I think so. 

 Q.  Has Lleyton's game changed at all? 
 JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  No, I don't think so. 

 Q.  Same player? 
 JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yeah.  He serves good.  From baseline I think he doesn't do a lot of mistakes.  You have to win the point, every point.  You know, you have to be very aggressive all the time and be very solid and do no mistakes at all because, of course, you going to lose easy against him. 

 Q.  What are your plans leading up to the US Open?  Cincinnati and then off? 
 JUAN CARLOS FERRERO: Cincinnati and then off, then US Open. 

 Q.  New Haven is not in that mix?  Cincinnati straight to the US Open? 
 JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I never played New Haven.  I think these two tournaments are important, and then maybe three or four days of practice strong, then try to be fit for the US.
