THE MODERATOR:  First question, please. 


Q.  What happened today?  How disappointed are you? 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I think he played really good.  In the first set I had 2-1 with break, you know, and I didn't take the opportunity to go through to the set.  But, you know, is tennis.  I lost 6-3.  Then I try to give my best all the time.  I did a lot of mistakes with my backhand today and was strange for me because normally I didn't do.  And, you know, I think I could win the set with love-30, 5-4 in the second set.  Then the tiebreak he start very good and I couldn't come back.

Q.  You have beaten him three times, right, on clay?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yeah. 

Q.  Did the surface make a big difference? 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  No, because I won him one time in Scottsdale on hard court. 

Q.  He seemed to be kind of attacking your forehand a little bit, too, with those short angle backhands.  In the tiebreaker you had two forehands you missed.  Did he put a lot of pressure on your forehand with those short angle shots? 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  No, because I knew that he plays like this all the time.  I won him three times.  So I think he plays better than me today, and that's it.  I couldn't give my best with my forehand and also with my backhand.  I, you know...  You can do it very well, if the other one knows the place very good, you lose.

Q.  It seems like it was a physical match, a lot of long points, a lot of running. 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Uh-hmm.

Q.  If you got to the third set, did you feel maybe you had the upper hand if that happened? 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Maybe, I don't know.  I don't know how he feel if he lose the second set.  But of course if I win the second set, I will feel better and, you know, physically I was okay.  So who knows? 

Q.  Did you feel like there was a lot of support for you today?  It's a largely Spanish-speaking crowd out there.  Do you like playing here? 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yeah, I like play here.  I saw a lot of people, a lot of Spanish people.  And also he is from Chile, so, you know, was from the both sides.
