MODERATOR:  Juan Carlos Ferrero.  First question, please.  
 
 
Q.  How does the grass feel?
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  It's good.  Not bad.  I just practice five days, you know, in grass, synthetic grass.  I came here and I start to practice on Saturday morning, and that's it.  I think sometimes when you less practice, you play better (smiling).  You never know.  But it's okay.  It's not so fast.  It's okay. 
 
Q.  Not so fast?
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Nice to come back to the Centre Court winning, because the last two matches I played there I lost, so...  
 
Q.  Does it feel any different at all from the last two times you played it? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I don't know.  Maybe the opponent.  Didn't push me all pression (sic) like Rusedski or Morrison with the serve maybe.  I played more comfortable, you know, with not too much pression (sic), you know, playing good from base of line.  Was okay for me.  
 
Q.  How long did you take off after the French Open before you hit a ball?
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Until Wednesday, last Wednesday. 
 
Q.  You had 10 days with no tennis at all?
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yeah, nothing.  Because I had to do some - not some - a lot of things in Spain.  You know, I had to go to Valencia, Onteniente, Villena, to see everybody.  So I had to go as well to Italia two times. 
 
Q.  Happy time?
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yeah.
