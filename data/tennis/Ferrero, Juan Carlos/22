   THE MODERATOR:  Questions.   
  
  Q.  It was a big match.  Did you expect it to be that difficult?   
 JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Always play against David is difficult.  He doesn't do a lot of mistakes in the court.  Physically he's very complete, so is very difficult to win against him the points.   
 You know, you have to fight all the time.  I knew before the match that it's going to be difficult.   
  
  Q.  Do you think the fact you know each other so well made the match so close?   
 JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yeah and no.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I think we both play good level, so it's the reason it was everything close.   
  
  Q.  You know his style of play very well.  He knows your style of play very well.  Do you think you were anticipating or knew what to expect from each other too much?   
 JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Sometimes yes, but I think is not the key of the match to win or lose.   
  
  Q.  How do you think your game was out there today?  How do you think you'll progress in the tournament?   
 JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I think I played a good match today.  I didn't serve as the other days, but the rest I think I played a solid match.   
  
  Q.  Do you think he'll have plenty of time to recover for his next match?   
 JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Of course, yes.  It's 24 hours.  More than 24 hours.  He will be fit again for sure.   
  
  Q.  Looks like it's going to be Novak.  How do you think he'll go against him?   
 JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Every match they play was close.  I think the two times they played Novak won the match.  I don't know.  David is playing good tennis.  I give him some chance to win.
