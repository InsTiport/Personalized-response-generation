MODERATOR:  Questions for Juan Carlos.  
 
 
Q.  What happened today?  It was a very difficult match? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  You know, today was a day that I play bad.  I didn't feel very good the ball.  I lost the first two sets 7-6, 7-6.  All my confidence go down because I had also lost two first sets.  Second set, 40-15 with 5-4, I had so many chances.  I was playing so bad in the third.  I start with a break.  My confidence start to go very down.  Finally my mentally was not so good to win. 
 
Q.  Were you tired against the match from Fabrice before?
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  No, no, I didn't feel tired today.  I feel all right.  If I won the first two sets, I think that I win the match for sure.  But losing the first two sets 7-6, 7-6, it's very tough to come back and try to win again.  Tennis is like this.  
 
Q.  Did you feel the conditions today were different from the days you played before?
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I think so.  
 
Q.  More difficult for you?
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Today was a little bit cold, different from the other days.  The first time I play in the night, you know.  It's not easy for me.  But, you know, also for him.  He played very good.  He stayed in the whole match with so many winners, with his service and forehand.  He didn't miss the ball.  I think he played a really good, solid match.
