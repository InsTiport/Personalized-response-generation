THE MODERATOR:  Questions in English, please. 


Q.  It was a very quick performance today.  Obviously, you're coming into form quite nicely.  Your form is very good. 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO: Yeah, my form, yeah.  I think it's  -- my form is the best form on clay court, I think so.  I come to win Barcelona and Estoril, and I am with a lot of confidence with to play on clay court, and I feel so good on clay court right now with my performance on forehand and backhand.  I serve so good today and all the week, and I think it's  -- I have a lot of confidence with my serves right now and I think it's gonna play so good with my serve in the semifinal. 


Q.  How much stronger physically do you feel now than you did this time last year?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO: I feel more strong, you know.  I feel better in the hard matches, in the third set and long matches.  I think I show in the final with Barcelona with four hours and ten minutes in the fifth set.  So I think I am not tired in the third set in a lot of matches, and I think is the difference on the last year. 


Q.  Do you feel that maybe you're saving energy now for a long match maybe in the final?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO: Yeah.  I feel so all right and I don't think I am gonna be tired in the semifinal or in the final.
