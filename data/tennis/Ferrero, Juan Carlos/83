THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  What happened at 5-1? 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I don't know.  I don't know exactly, you know.  In the tennis, you never know what's gonna happen.  With 5-1 and set ball, for me, was incredible then to be 5-4 and 15-all.  So was incredible for me.  I had to be concentrate because was very difficult to be 5-4 after 5-1.  So finally I think I could win the set.  In the second set, was better.

Q.  Did you feel tired? 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  No, no, no, no.

Q.  At the end of the first, was it physical?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  No, I was speaking with my coach, and we are thinking that, you know, we didn't know what's happening. 

Q.  Talking about tomorrow...

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Tomorrow is gonna be difficult. 

Q.  Are you surprised the way he's playing on clay this year?  Second, what makes him so difficult to play even on clay? 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  He won Hamburg last year, so he played very well in clay court last year.  So he's playing right now very good also because he came from Munich, winning a tournament.  And, you know, for tomorrow I'm gonna try to play very aggressive all the time, you know, try to return his big serve.  And, you know, is the first time we gonna meet in clay court, so we gonna see what's happen. 

Q.  What do you think could be the key of the match on clay? 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I don't know.  I don't know, you know.  He's playing very good in clay court as me, you know, as the Spanish, as the guys that are playing good in clay court.  So I don't know, I don't know.
