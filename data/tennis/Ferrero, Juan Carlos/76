THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Juan Carlos. 


Q.  Is it sometimes good to have a scare when you're down a set, come back, and be able to rally?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yeah, I think sometimes it's good to take a rhythm.

Q.  Special day, the first day of the US Open.  Tonight we have Pete Sampras retiring.  Your thoughts on Pete calling it a day here, his retirement?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  You know, I think is a time to retire to Pete.  I think he won the last tournament here.  He played the last match in center court.  You know, I think if he think is the time to retire, he has to do it.  I think he won enough tournament.  You know, he was one of the great player, you know, winning a lot of Grand Slams.  He did a good job, so I think is enough.

Q.  The atmosphere here, the way you're playing, the surface, are you confident?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yeah, I think everything is okay.  I think I'm playing a good tennis.  You know, I'm in a great form.  You know, the atmosphere here, it's very nice.  You know, I have my family, girlfriend, friends.  I think I have everything to try to play good tennis. 

Q.  On the ranking system, do you think it's a good system if somebody can be No.  1 without winning a Grand Slam, or do you think you should win a Grand Slam to make up part of being the No.  1?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  You know, I think is the same.  You know, to be a No.  1, you have to get very good results in Grand Slams.  Maybe not to win, but you can play very good in Masters Series.  It's also very difficult to win a Masters Series, as a Grand Slam.  But I think will be better to win a Grand Slam to be a No.  1.  So maybe the ranking system, it's a little bit of a mistake.

Q.  What do you think about Andy Roddick's jumping out of airplanes? 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Airplanes? 

Q.  He parachutes.  What do you think about that?  Is that something you would ever do?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I did in Spain two years ago.  It's nice.  I think if he likes, why not? 

Q.  You and Roger and Andy have a good chance to be No.  1 after this tournament.  Do you think anybody has a better chance than another? 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  No.

Q.  You're all about the same?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I think we have a tough draw, you know, each one.  We have to win a lot of matches to be a No.  1.  Somebody has to lose first, and then you have to take the chance to be the No.  1.  We have to try to be very concentrates, all three.

Q.  One last funny question.  Who is the best-ranked left-handed player now?  Do you know?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  No.

Q.  Lopez. 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Lopez? 

Q.  You didn't think of that?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  No, I never think about it, no.
