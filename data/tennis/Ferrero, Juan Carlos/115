ATP:  Questions, please.


Q.  How can you explain this run of 16 matches on clay unbeaten?  Not only that, but you are improving with every single match.  Every match has been better.  You have lost fewer games, et cetera, how can you explain that?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I don't know exactly, but, you know, I am playing good from 16 matches ago, so I am playing better than the past matches, but I am with a lot of confidence for that I am playing good, so today I played unbelievable.

Q.  How do you think Albert played?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Well, he played normal, but always I did winners for every side and I think he can't do more.

Q.  Were you surprised by the fact that given that your other two both went to three sets, that this one was -- this one was straight sets?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I played with him in Barcelona and we did three sets, but today I played so good and only 6-1, 6-2.  I played with a lot of confidence with my forehand and I put winners for every side of the court, so no more history today.

Q.  Surely you must feel yourself a big favorite going into the French now?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yes, of course, I feel so good for to play Roland Garros and I want to go for to win the tournament.

Q.  Would you prefer Hewitt or Portas in the final?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I prefer Portas because he is a Spanish player, but I think Hewitt won the first set 6-2 and I think he is playing better than Portas this first set, but Portas is playing good, maybe he is going to change the match.

Q.  Hewitt said yesterday that he thought he had an outside chance in the French.  What dangers do you think he can pose to your game should you two meet in tomorrow's final?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  He play like pass the ball all the time and when he put -- to put the winner with his forehand, he is doing, but I think he is playing good with a lot of confidence because he is in the semifinals so I think tomorrow is going to be a long match maybe.

Q.  Are you expecting five sets?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Maybe, why not.  (Laughs)

Q.  How do you feel physically?   You had a little treatment on the court yesterday, I think.

Q.  How do you feel when you get out of bed in the morning?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  This morning?  

Q.  Each morning.
