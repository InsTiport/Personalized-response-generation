THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Juan Carlos.  
 
 
Q.  Is that a little bit more difficult than you expected? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  You know, I saw him like three years ago when he was playing against one of my friends at his practicing (inaudible) Australian junior, but I see some good changes in him, you know, the serve, you know, very good forehand.  But anyways, maybe he has to improve mistakes in important moments.  But, anyways, I think he improve a lot everything. 
 
Q.  On the tournament as a whole, generally in the past the Australian Open seems to be a tournament where it's important to be fit, the fit guys come through at the end.  This year we're seeing all the big names progressing.  Is it different this year the way people have prepared?
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  No, no, no.  I think the people prepared Australian Open very well,  you know, because is true when we are starting the year, you know, we are very fresh, and we have to try to win a big tournament at the beginning of the year.  So everybody wants to prepare very well this tournament.   I think we are doing very well.  We tried our best.  
 
Q.  You had very good form on hard courts the end of last year.  Does that give you more confidence for the Australian Open this time?
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I think I played the whole year very good on hard courts, not only the end of the year or the middle.  I just play very good on hard court when I have to play, and I feel very confidence on hard court, you know, as in clay court.  So this moment it's like this.
