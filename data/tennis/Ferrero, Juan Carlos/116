ATP: Questions, please.


Q.  Well done.  15 matches you have won now and you still seem to be fit and fresh and playing very well.  How long can you go on?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I don't know.  I hope to 100 matches maybe, so... (Laughs) You know when trying to play good all the days and today I think he start a little bit nervous with the first two or three games.  I broke his service in the first game and I take some advantage.  So I think today he not play very good and I play normal, solid and with confidence, with serving good and finally I won 6-2, 6-2.  Normal history today.

Q.  Again was the treatment precautionary?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yes, only for prevent the problems.  It is my 15th match and I am a little bit tired with my body.  It is better to prevent-.

Q.  Presumably you would be happy if it was a little warmer out there as well, wouldn't you?  It is a bit cold out there. 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yes, cold but doesn't matter when you start the match you are hot all the time.

Q.  What did the trainer do?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Nothing, he give me some antiinflammatory and, you know, only massage for relax the sides, nothing more.  Then I did some electrons (sic) and ultrasound and something else. 

Q.  This was afterwards?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yes, afterwards.

Q.  And more massage?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yes.

Q.  He did something to your side or your thigh?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  My side.

Q.  Where is it?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  In the deltoid, close to the  groin.

Q.  Was that a match easy as it looked?   Was it easy for you or was it hard work?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Today?  

Q.  Yes.

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Today, no, it was easy, 6-2, 6-2 in one hour and 15 minutes.  It was easy match today.  So it is better for me because tomorrow I am going to be more fresh.

Q.  Did you expect that to be that easy?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Not really.  I thought, you know, yesterday he played very good against Gambill.  Gambill is serving all the time very strong and he won the match 4 in the third and today I expect for a difficult match because Johansson is serving very fast all the time. Finally I don't expect this score.

Q.  Which reason do you have that Spanish players are doing so well here in Hamburg?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  We have to enjoy this moment because there isn't so many tournaments in clay court, so we have to enjoy this moment in clay court.  So everybody want to play good in clay court so I think it is for that.

Q.  Do you have kind of team spirit?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  No.  No, we don't have. 

Q.  What about the next match?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Nothing special.  We play in Barcelona one month ago and I won in three difficult sets, so I think tomorrow maybe is going to be difficult the match because he is playing good.  He won 6-1, 6-2 today and with yesterday 6-3, 6-Love and now I think he is in great moment right now.

Q.  Do you practice at all together when you are both in Barcelona or not?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I am not living in Barcelona, so I don't practice so many times with him, only this morning, yesterday morning when we have the opportunity.

Q.  Will you practice together tomorrow morning?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Why not.  Maybe.  But  -- maybe I am going to practice with the winner of Portas and Martin or somebody else.  It doesn't matter.

Q.  Can you switch off very easy when you know you are playing another member of the Davis Cup team?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yes, I can.  I can do it because it is different situation.  He is my friend, but tomorrow he is going to be my enemy.

Q.  Why don't you base yourself in Barcelona with many of the other Spanish players?  

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  (Inaudible) I live in Valencia.  I have all the things for to do very good my job there and I don't have reasons to go to Barcelona.  I am very close to my family and I don't need to go to Barcelona for do anything.

Q.  Who do you practice with there?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I practice with some guys with my same age and they are playing satellites and futures, so the ranking is 300, around this ranking, so it is very good for practice.

Q.  It is okay for practice?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yeah, it's okay.  It is enough.

Q.  You didn't play Wimbledon last year?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  For injury. 

Q.  Not for the seedings?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Oh, for the seedings is one reason, but finally I didn't play for the injuries in my leg.

Q.  Are there any plans maybe in the back of your head to not to play again if the seedings come out  --

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I want to play Wimbledon, but I don't know what is going to happen with the seedings.  But I want to play because I never played in Wimbledon so last year I played in Halle, I like to play in grass, it is fun.

Q.  Will your decision depend upon the decision?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Depend.

Q.  It will depend?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yes, will depend on the seedings.

Q.  Did you talk with Alex and Albert about this?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  No, not yet.

Q.  What would you regard as acceptable in the seedings?   You have your -- one suggestion has been that the top 16 will be seeded, but there may be changes within the 16  --

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  But why?  

Q.  No, that is not the point . I am not defending it or  --

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I know, but I asked for the Wimbledon why they want to change the seedings.

Q.  Well, because history shows that  --

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I know it is the history.

Q.  No, no, but history shows that they have been more successful in the way they have been seeding than any other Grand Slam tournament.  What I am asking is if they were to do anything other than go straight down 1 to 16, would you be likely to join a boycott?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Maybe, yes.  That is all.

Q.  So the idea put forward by the ATP that they might go 1 to 16, but change about within the 16, you wouldn't like that?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I don't think so.

Q.  It is a tremendously long run of tournaments that you are going to have because you said you will play in Dusseldorf next week and then the French Open.  Had you not considered taking one of those tournaments out, maybe Dusseldorf to get a rest?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Not this one, but I don't know about Dusseldorf because I am a little bit problems with my body but I am going to try to play.

Q.  Will that not hurt your chances at the French Open?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I don't think so.  I think it will be very good, Roland Garros because it is a great tournament and I have more motivation for to play so if I am tired I am going to forget the problems and I am going to try to win.

Q.  Do you think the French Open is the most difficult tournament on the Tour?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  One of them -- it's very difficult to  -- it is very difficult to win all the matches because it is very long the matches, you know, best of five sets and you can play bad some day and it is  difficult to be very good all the two weeks.
