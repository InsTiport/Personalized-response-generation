THE MODERATOR:  Questions in English, please.  
 
 
Q.  You said after your defeat in Paris that it would take you many months to recover, yet you seem to have recovered fairly quickly.  What did you do in between Paris and here? 
 
JUAN CARLO FERRERO:  Nothing special.  I stop one week, five days, then I start to practice on grass, one court is synthetic grass, it's not like the same.  Is different but is similar.  So I come here with only one week with practice in grass, so I feel all right for the moment. 
 
Q.  Are you pleased that you've come? 
 
JUAN CARLO FERRERO:  Yes.  
 
Q.  Are you also pleased that you meet Greg?  
 
JUAN CARLO FERRERO:  Yes.  I think two years ago in US Open, two years ago.  
 
Q.  Yeah? 
 
JUAN CARLO FERRERO:  Yeah, I think so.  I lost in fourth set, yeah. 
 
Q.  First round? 
 
JUAN CARLO FERRERO:  Yeah.  
 
Q.  What about your chances now? 
 
JUAN CARLO FERRERO:  I don't know.  He's in house, you know, and he's playing good.  He has very good service here in grass.  It's very fast.  And, I don't know, I have my chance because I am playing good with my serve and with the base of the line.  You know, is different games.  He goes to the net all the time and I'm in the baseline.  When I can go to the net, I will go.  So I think I have some chance.  
 
Q.  And it all, perhaps, revolves around his service game? 
 
JUAN CARLO FERRERO:  Today, I saw him only in his first set against Black.  I saw he was playing good also in the base of the line.  So he was very good today, and I think is not all his service.  He can't win all the matches only with the serve.  
 
Q.  Are you enjoying playing on grass after eight sets now? 
 
JUAN CARLO FERRERO:  Yes.  You know, the first day only I thinking to enjoy the play on grass.  So right now, I won two matches, so I enjoy the grass, you know.  (Laughing.) 
 
Q.  You've played both your matches on the No. 1 court.  Would you like the opportunity to play Rusedski on the centre court? 
 
JUAN CARLO FERRERO:  I like, yeah.  I wish.  
 
Q.  What about the fact that there will be a lot of noise for Greg?  They will be very excitable, the British crowd.
 
JUAN CARLO FERRERO:  I know.  Is in house, is normal, no?  There is some Spanish people, and I have to give the tickets to everybody for to go to the centre to say,  "Come on."
