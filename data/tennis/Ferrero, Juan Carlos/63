THE MODERATOR:  Questions in English, please.  
 
 
Q.  You could not get the year-end No. 1 ranking.  How do you feel right now?
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I feel, you know, I'm not thinking in that, you know.  I'm thinking that I lost the match, you know.  I'm out of the tournament, you know.  I didn't play a good tennis in these two match.  But I'm not thinking of No. 1 right now.  
 
Q.  What happened during that match?  You were ahead in the first set pretty easily. 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yeah.  Yeah, because I think he did a lot of mistakes in the first set, you know.  I was serving well, you know, playing normal, not unbelievable tennis, you know.  In the second set, I think I had chances with 3-all and love-30, you know.  And maybe I had to take that game and try to finish the match.  But, finally, I think he start to play better and better, you know.  I keep in the same level, but finally he played better than me.  
 
Q.  This is a disappointing loss, but can you reflect on your year? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yeah, I think is not a good tournament for me, but I think I played a really good year, you know.  I'm gonna finish No. 2 in the world for the year.  I think it's great for me. 
 
Q.  How does that help you going forward, looking ahead to next year, and for going into Australia? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  You know, I think I'm gonna try to play at the same level as this year, you know.  I play really good in all surface so I'm going to try to keep going in Australia and the rest of the tournaments.   
 
Q.  You had two bad matches.  What's the reason? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  The reason, I don't know the reason.  You ask to Nalbandian the reason to play good the first day and play bad this day, there is no reason.  In tennis some days you play good and some days you play bad.  
 
Q.  Did you feel tired when you arrived here?
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  No, no, no.  No, not at all, you know.  I think I arrive in a good day, you know, and I practice well and I try to do the same as the other tournaments.  But was not possible.  
 
Q.  Do you already have your head in Australia for the Davis Cup final?
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  No, not yet.  Not yet because I have a lot of time between right now and Davis Cup, you know.  I will think in the next day maybe.
