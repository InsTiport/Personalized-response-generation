THE MODERATOR:  English questions, please.  
 
 
Q.  What about looking forward, because I'm sure you'd like to look forward?  What are your plans now between today and the Davis Cup final? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I'm gonna take a rest some days, you know, and then I will go to Australia.  So it's very clear. 
 
Q.  Are you looking forward to that?  Do you think you can make the adjustment to grass and play well down there? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  No, I think we have enough time to practice in grass, you know.  I think is the same to practice only one week or two weeks, because we are not specialists on grass.  So I think with one week, I think is enough for us.  
 
Q.  Where are you actually going to practice on grass? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Here, maybe, some days.  I will go Los Angeles also.  And then, of course, there, Australia. 
 
Q.  So you go direct from here to Australia?
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yeah. 
 
Q.  You don't go home?
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  No.  
 
Q.  Is there anything we can read into this, heading into Davis Cup, as far as just a bad week for you?  You're feeling okay? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I'm not feeling okay right now, of course.  I play three very bad matches, you know.  But, you know, I think I play a good year, you know, and only one bad week.  So I have to think right now in Australia and forget about this tournament because it's, you know, a bad tournament.  
 
Q.  During the match did you think about, you know if you'd won, you could have maintained the No. 2 ranking?  Now it's out of your control?  Was that a concern at all?
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  No.  No, no, no.  I didn't think in this.  
 
Q.  What was most difficult about Roger's game today for you? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  He was serving very well, you know.  You know, his forehand is very good.  When his forehand, it's working good, it's difficult to beat him.  But, you know, I was trying all the time and, you know, I was playing so bad since the beginning of the tournament.  So today was the same.  
 
Q.  What happens when you get into sort of a period like this where you just sort of can't find your game? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  What's happen?  
 
Q.  How does that happen or why does it happen?  Why can't you sort of turn it around?
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I don't know.  It's impossible to know, you know.  I was practicing in Spain, you know, and I was playing good in Paris, you know.  I was practicing in Spain very good.  I came here with options to get No. 1 and to try to play good, but I couldn't do it.  Is not reason.  
 
Q.  Of the tournament overall, obviously this is where the Masters Cup is going to be held next year also, are you looking forward to it being held here again, after spending the week here and seeing the tournament?  Did you enjoy it overall? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I think this tournament  -- this Masters Cup is not the same as I played before, you know.  I play in Sydney, I played in Shanghai, you know.  There, it was much better than here, you know - the courts, the organization, you know.  I think this tournament is not that we expect.  Is not special, you know.  The Masters always is special, and this tournament wasn't this time.  So they have to improve to next year. 
 
Q.  To improve it next year?
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yeah, of course.  
 
Q.  You said the court was one of the things they need to improve on.  What else? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yeah, what else...?  You know, I spoke with  -- we spoke with Weller (Evans), you know.  We speak everybody about it.  And it's a lot of things, so...
