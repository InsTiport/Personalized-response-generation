THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Juan Carlos, please.  
 
 
Q.  How do you like this tournament?  Do you like it? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yes, it's one of the best.  Maybe for me Roland Garros is the first one, and this is the second one.  It's wonderful to be here for the weather, for the people.  It's really nice, all the stadiums.  I feel very wonderful here.  
 
Q.  You like the surface, as far as your game?
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a little bit less fast of Sydney last week, so I feel very good here.  
 
Q.  I thought that match in Shanghai was really rough. 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yeah.  
 
Q.  Did it take you long to recover from that?
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  No, not really, you know.  I have to forget this match because, you know, I know that I was very close to win, you know, 6-4 in the fifth.  It's only this I have to remember, you know.  I played the final, and I am playing good in hard court and it's only I have to remember and I have to try to improve it and improve it and that's it.
