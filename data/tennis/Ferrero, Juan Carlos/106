THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Juan Carlos, please. 


Q.  What went wrong today?  Was it the rain, the cold air, the balls? 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  The conditions on the courts were heavy.  The conditions of the ball were very heavy.  The condition of the court was not ideal.  I am a little bit fed up that I had to play on that court.  I feel that the Spanish are being treated not in the right way, and it's about time some of the Spanish players turned up and said something about the conditions where they're put to play.  When Moya was No. 1, he did not get the right treatment when he had to play.  Now I'm No. 3 in the world.  I did not play on center court.  I did not play on Pallacorda.  I had to play on a court where the conditions were not good.  The other courts were covered, and that court was not covered so it's been receiving a lot of water all day.  Again, coming back to the point that the Spanish are not treated the right way, there should be something done about it. 

Q.  Do you think they gave the center court to Moya because he was playing Hewitt maybe?  He's famous like you (smiling). 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  The treatment that the Spanish players are receiving is not the correct treatment, and this has happened for a long time.  I don't know if Moya would have played on another court.  They can win or they can lose, but the treatment of the Spanish players is definitely not correct.
