THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.  
 
 
Q.  You look more fitter than last year, if I'm not wrong.  I would like to know if you think it's a disadvantage, the fact that you will play a lot of tournaments until Roland Garros? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Well, physically, indeed I feel very well.  I just have a slight problem with the ankle, but otherwise everything is all right.  And referring to the fact that I will play many tournaments, I believe these are tournaments I must play in order to prepare myself for the French Open.  If I chose them, it's for a special purpose, it's for preparing myself.  
 
Q.  Who would you consider your biggest rival, your main rival in this tournament? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I don't know, there are many very good players, many rivals possible, especially the Spanish players.  I remember last year the next round had been very difficult for me, the score was very tight.  If Kuerten goes ahead, he's going to be very difficult, too.  And South American players play here, and they play well, too.  So there's a certain number of them out there.  
 
Q.  You Spaniards, in general, and you, Juan Carlos, have had better results on the hard court in recent years.  But when Estoril, Barcelona, Monte-Carlo come about, do you feel better, do you think, "Ah, it's like spring or summer, our season is coming," and do you feel better about it? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yes, of course we feel better in this season just because of the fact that we're playing closer to home.  Also, a little bit because it's on clay, I feel a little bit better on clay.  But I also feel the same, very good, on hard courts.
