THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Juan Carlos in Spanish. 


Q.  You won in two sets. 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  The match was complicated, but then we were even.  In the second set, I think I made a couple errors, two or three points in a row.  Maybe it was too much.  But it was a good match, especially the tiebreaks.  Don't tell me that we played badly indoors, please (smiling). 

Q.  Now you're in the quarterfinals, playing without pressure because you've qualified for Houston.  Is it a good thing for you to play under pressure?  You have nothing to lose. 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  When one loses a match, he always loses something, of course.  I'm motivated because I'm in Spain.  You always learn from a match you win.  Now I'm risking No. 1 against Federer, so that's important. 

Q.  According to the statistics, if you win the next match, you're No. 1. 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yeah, tomorrow is a difficult match against Srichaphan.  The last time we played, I won, in Sydney.  Okay, it was outdoors, but it's going to be a difficult match, that's for sure. 

Q.  Now you have to go to Paris, Houston.  Are you going to rest? 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Well, I didn't go to Vienna because of my injury, my foot.  I'm a little bit rested.  So let's play this week and next week we'll see. 

Q.  What about your foot? 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Today it was perfect.  It didn't bother me.  I'm happy.  I played a hundred percent. 

Q.  What do you think about Moya's loss against Feliciano?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Feliciano was motivated because he was playing at home.  It's clear that he's used to playing in this type of altitude.  His serve is a great weapon.  He volleys very well.  He moves well.  It was an even match.  He won.  But it's one match of many.  You shouldn't give it more thought. 

Q.  Once more you have the support of Real Madrid players.  If you won the Godo, would you be upset if the Barcelona players were there? 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I hope Valencia players play well in Valencia's tournament (laughter). 

Q.  Will you deny you belong to Real Madrid or what? 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  No, I'm not.  I don't belong to the Real Madrid.
