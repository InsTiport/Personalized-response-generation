MODERATOR:  Questions for Juan Carlos in English.  
 
 
Q.  Did you realize at one time that Escude was going to retire?
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I didn't know so well.  I think he start to feel the problem in the third set.  So, you know, for me, was not so good.  I wanted to play more time in the court, and I wanted to win  -- I don't want to win like this.  You know, is not a good win.  But sometimes you have to do this.  Bad luck for him. 
 
Q.  The first two sets, it was a good test for you?
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I think was a good tennis.  We played a good tennis today on grass.  The first set was so close after I had the break.  The second and third, I think I play a great tennis, all the time, very, very solid, and very, very regular, I think.  I think is not easy to play like this on grass.  So I'm happy. 
 
Q.  How do you feel on grass?
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I'm feeling great.  I think I play a great tennis this match and the last match.  I hope to keep going in this tournament.  
 
Q.  How do you prepare for this tournament?  Do you stay in Spain?
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yeah, I stay in Spain.  I was practicing since past Wednesday on synthetic grass.  You know, I just practice three days there after the parties of Roland Garros, you know. I came here on Friday and I start to practice Saturday, Sunday.  You know, I start on Tuesday.  
 
Q.  Do you feel more comfortable on grass this year than the previous years?
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Maybe yes because I think I'm playing better tennis than the other years.  And also if you win to Escude, I won two sets, I know, but I think I was on the good way to win today.  So I feel better than the other years, I think.  
 
Q.  How closely does synthetic grass resemble real grass?
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I don't know.  I don't know exactly.  I don't know.  
 
Q.  Do you get the same kind of bounce?
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I think.  Is like the same.  I can't tell you the difference because I just practiced three days. 
 
Q.  In Las  Vegas, you're a 60-1 shot to win this tournament, which means you're an extreme outsider.  Do you think you have a lot better chance than that? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  It's okay, yeah?  Not bad, yeah.  No, I think is more than the other years.  Is okay, I'm happy. 
 
Q.  What does it tell about the development of tennis that for the first time I think this year you, as the prize money leader amongst the men, have earned less than the top two or top three women? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  At least I have to win the same money as the Top 20, no?  But is not happen this.  I think is not so good for me, and good for them. 
 
Q.  How is it explainable? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Nicola (Arzani) can tell you (laughter).
