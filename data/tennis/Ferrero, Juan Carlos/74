THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 
 
 
Q.  Todd won a lot of points at the net in the sets he won.  What were you able to do in the fifth set to change that? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I didn't understand so good.  
 
Q.  His play at the net was very aggressive in the third and fourth sets.  What did you do differently in the fifth set to kind of take that away? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  You know, I think when you do a break early, he is a person maybe he doesn't come really good to the net.  I can pass easy than maybe the third and the fourth set.  You know, maybe I was serving better in the fifth than in the third and the fourth.  And also is the key, that he didn't come to the net. 
 
Q.  Were you pretty confident going into the fifth you would win?  You've got 10 years on him.  It's very humid. 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yeah, I know.  I was very confident in the fifth.  Also in the whole match 'cause I was playing good.  You know, I had a lot of breakpoints in the fourth set and I think I could win in that set.  Finally, I couldn't.  I try to fight all the time in the fifth set to try to get the match. Finally, I think I did it pretty well.
