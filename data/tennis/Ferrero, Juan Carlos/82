THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.  
 
 
Q.  When did you feel some pain?
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  It had begun when I was playing Valencia.  Today it was hurting a little bit.  Then when I was serving, it hurt, a kind of sting in my arm.  That's when I knew it was getting worse.  It's nothing serious, but it's hurting.  It's an inflammation of 6 millimeters in my arm.  I think because I've been traveling a lot and playing a lot of matches in a row, maybe I need some rest.  
 
Q.  What is your program?  Will you play Hamburg?  Will you play before the French? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  No, I'm gonna stop until French Open.  I will not play Hamburg because I need to take some more -- some days' rest, and then start again but slow, you know, practicing and take care about the shoulder and then we'll see.  
 
Q.  How much and in what way was it restricting you today? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  At the beginning I was 100 percent.  But I think when I was 5-2, I serve one time when I feel the push here, you know, and I start to feel worse and worse.  You know, the second set, I prefer to stop because if I am not 100 percent, I'm not gonna enjoy, I'm not gonna do anything good.  So was better to stop I think.  
 
Q.  When did you feel it for the first time? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Two weeks ago in the first match, I was playing in Valencia.  
 
Q.  When you were playing during the other matches did you feel this pain as well? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yes, but it was not so strong, so it didn't bother me very much.  I couldn't serve as I wanted to, but, well, that was not so serious.  But now, today, it grew worse and worse and that's why I decided to retire.  
 
Q.  We all understand why you wanted to play in Barcelona and Valencia, but do you think now to plan to play five weeks in a row was too much? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Of course it's too much.  It's for that I'm not gonna play Hamburg and also because my injury.  So, you know, I had to play Valencia.  Normally, the last years, you know, I never played that week because was in Mallorca, was not my city.  But this year I had to play because it was in Valencia and I wanted to play.  But five weeks on the road is too much for anyone.  
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yeah.  
 
Q.  If you were not injured, you were going to play Hamburg if you were 100 percent?  You were ready to play Hamburg? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Uh-hmm.  
 
Q.  Do you think two weeks will be enough to recover for the French?
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yeah, yeah. 
 
Q.  Will you come to the French Open 100 percent?
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yeah, I hope.  I hope two weeks is gonna be enough.  The doctor told me yesterday that I need to like four, five days take rest.  Then start slow, step by step.  And then I think I'm gonna be ready maybe Friday or Thursday next week, so... 
 
Q.  How surprised would you be if no Spaniards are in the final here? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Last year wasn't Spanish players in the final, but this year there is two Spanish players in the semifinals.  I think is very good.  In the final could be just one.  Maybe I'm a little bit surprised if there isn't one Spanish player in the final - maybe, a little bit.  But I think Mantilla gonna win.  Look, 3-1 (laughter).  
 
Q.  Are you going home now? 
 
JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Maybe tomorrow, yeah.  I will go.
