THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  You're pretty happy with that performance there today, I would imagine? 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yes, I believe I played very solid.  I never made any errors.  I believe it's my best match of the week. 

Q.  How do you think your game has stepped up again another level compared with last year as we approach the French Open? 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I feel better physically this year, and I have more experience.  I believe I will come to the French Open with more experience, and I believe this year I can win. 

Q.  Are you playing as much this year between here and the French as last year, or have you dropped one or two weeks from it? 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I'm going to play all the tournaments every week except Dusseldorf.  I want to play many matches, because I want to acquire my rhythm and a good level. 

Q.  You've only beaten Spadea once.  That was a dead match in the Davis Cup.  He's come back from having been a long way behind in his career.  He's fought back very hard.  What do you think about playing him tomorrow? 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I believe he's a better player on hard court, but he plays very well on clay.  He's very solid.  He makes no mistakes.  He takes his opportunities, so it's going to be very difficult for me to win tomorrow.  I will have to have the same level as I had today to beat him. 

Q.  Is the French your biggest dream this year? 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Well, it's one of my dreams.  I played a semifinals this year and a final, and of course I'm very eager to play the French Open and I really wish I would win this tournament. 

Q.  What are your other dreams for the year, No. 1? 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yes, this is one of my dreams.  I also want to do well in the Masters.  For Wimbledon, it's going to be difficult because we have very little time to practice on grass before the tournament, so we need a bit of luck there.  But my main dreams are the US Open, the French Open and the Masters.  These are the tournaments that are important to me. 

Q.  Did you see very much of Nadal this week playing? 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Yes, I've seen him.  I believe he has a lot of strength.  He's has a lot of endurance.  He has a lot of potential.  If he plays so well at 16, I think he will soon be at our level, like us. 

Q.  Inevitable British question:  How much do you think you'll be able to play on grass before Wimbledon, and where? 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I'm going to play Halle, but if I'm in the second week of the French Open, I don't think I will be able to.  I will play Nottingham and then Wimbledon.  I don't dislike at all to play on grass.  I don't dislike it. 

Q.  You actually play quite well on it. 

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  (Smiling).
