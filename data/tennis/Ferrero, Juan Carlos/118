ATP: Questions, please.


Q.   Are you feeling tired after that?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  I feel a little bit tired during the first set because I think I -- was very long, but second set I win the first set, I feel better.

Q.   There were no distractions having to stop...

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  No, I didn't feel so much difference.  

Q.   I think you play Alex in the next match or Lapentti.  Do you have any preference?

JUAN CARLOS FERRERO:  Maybe Alex, he is a Spanish player, but Lapentti is a good friend also so I don't want to say anything.  I think a little bit more Alex because he is Spanish but it doesn't matter.
