B. ANDREESCU/Q. Wang
7-5, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. That must feel amazing.  Does it?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Amazing is an understatement right now (smiling).  It's incredible.  I'm just grateful.  Yeah, that's really all I can say.
I'm playing Muguruza tomorrow.  I have watched her play many times on TV, so it's just crazy to think that I'll be competing against her.
Q. Apart from the result, you must be feeling that your tennis just comes very easy, because that's what it looks like from the outside.  Is there a way you can make this keep going forever?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: That would be really nice.  Obviously, I don't think it's going to be all butterflies and rainbows every day, but it has been so far, and just gonna take it one day at a time.  Hopefully I can do a lot of great things this season.
Q. You're the player that has won most matches this year.  What role does confidence have in the way you're playing now?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: A lot.  I think confidence is almost everything for a player.  If you trust your shots, if you trust your game, good things always happen.  I think that's what's happening with me right now.
Also, the work I have put in is really paying off, and it's showing.
Q. The little racquet smack at 4-All in the first set, did that kind of wake you up or did it help?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Well, no, I lost the next game at Love, but I think maybe it helped for the next couple games after that.
It's nice to let some anger out sometimes.  I wish I didn't have to do that, but it just came out.
But, yeah, and then I held serve and Sylvain came and spoke to me.  Told me to stay calm.
Because I was doing all the right things.  She just stepped up her game a bit more.  And then at 5-4 when I was serving, I stepped my game up just a bit more than hers.  And I think that made the difference in the important points.
Q. She seemed to play straight up and down a lot, angles, hitting it hard.  She was hitting right down the middle.  You were there and you could take advantage.
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Yeah, all she does is hit through the court.  She doesn't really open up the court.  She does like pace, so I tried not to give her a lot of that today.
She really didn't like the high ball to her backhand, which I used a lot, and it helped.  Also the slices, the angles, everything that I like to do worked well today (smiling).
Q. Do you have a routine for matches that you have won, like eating always the same things or wearing the same clothes?  Do you believe in these kind of things?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: I'm not that superstitious.  The only thing that I do is I like to use the same dampener the whole time, which is the Canadian flag.
I take a sip of water.  I take a bite out of food.  Doesn't matter what food.  And then my sports drink.  And then I sniff that little thing, which I'm not gonna go into detail about.  My little secret.
Q. At what point during the season with all of your wins and all the matches that you played were you the most surprised?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: I think this week.  Yeah, I didn't expect for me to get all the way here.
I honestly don't know how I won my first round, because I wasn't feeling so well that day, and Begu was playing incredible.  I think it was nice I had a day off after that to recover, and, yeah, the days in between really help a lot.
Also, like, actually, everything, really, like with Caroline Wozniacki, I didn't expect anything.  Venus, yeah.
Q. I wonder if you have seen Denis' rap after his victory over Cilic?  What are your thoughts on that?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: I actually just watched it before I got in here.  It really put a smile on my face.  That's for sure.
It's nice.  It's a different thing.  It brings entertainment to the game.  He's really good.  I have no doubt he's -- I don't think he's gonna stop, which is -- that's his thing.  I'm happy for him.
Q. Tennis fans know that Djokovic has done a lot of meditation.  It can be powerful.  Can you talk about meditation in your life, how you use it, how it's impacted you?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Yeah, my mom introduced me to that when I was really young.  I was maybe about 12.  Ever since then I have been meditating.  I do a lot of yoga, as well, and I think that really helps me just have a balanced life.
I don't only work on my physical aspect.  I also work on the mental, because that's also very, very important.  It's definitely showing through my matches where I'm staying in the present moment a lot of the time.  I don't like to focus on what just happened or in the future.
And I think that's a really important aspect of the game.  I'm going to keep continuing on improving that, and I think with that, I can do great things.
Q. Can you share with us what kind of meditation it is?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: It's creative visualization meditation.
Q. In Australia, you were a bit surprised to learn you were in the top 100.  And now?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Top 50 (smiling).
Q. How do you feel about that?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Yeah, it's really crazy.  If someone told me at the beginning of the year that I would be top 50 during Indian Wells, I would have told them that they're crazy.
But if I can continue doing this, then I think I can do really great things.  For me, the sky's the limit.  I believe that anything is possible.
Q. It took you two months to get 100 to 50.  So in another two months, what do you think?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Top 10?  Who knows?  In this sport, in life, I think that anything is doable.  Yeah.
Q. A question on Muguruza.  You said you watched her on TV and stuff like that.  Can you talk a little bit about what you see when you see GarbiÃ±e play?  What do you think is the challenge of playing her tomorrow?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: She's a hard hitter.  She likes to use her serve to control the point.  She fights really hard.  She moves really well, as well.  So she has the whole package.
So I have no doubt that it's gonna be a tough match tomorrow, but I'm going to go out there and play my game.  I think I can win tomorrow, but I know it's going to be a tough match.
Q. Just back to the top 50 thing, trying to stay in the now, what you're doing, how helpful is it to maybe not think about numbers much at all about those kinds of things?  How do you approach that?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Yeah, I don't check any of those things.  If I see something on Twitter, then that's all there is.  And that's what happened with the top 50, top 100, most wins this year.
Yeah, I don't like to focus on numbers, because that is definitely overwhelming.  But if I just focus on my tennis and stay healthy, then I think I can do great things.
Q. How hard is it to do that in a social media age, constantly having those numbers in your face, seeing how you're being evaluated and how you're doing?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: I just try not to overthink it.  I see it, and then I close my phone.
Q. I want to ask you about numbers a bit.  Talk about the work you have been putting in.  Can you quantify that?  What was your preseason training like?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: It was really hard.  I worked a lot physically.  I worked a lot on my cardio, being able to last long rallies, and also on my game.  I used to have trouble choosing to hit the right shot at the right time.  I think that's definitely improving and it's showing throughout my matches.
Also, the mental part, like, with the meditation and just having the right amount of time off, time on the court.  For me, it's quality over quantity.  Yeah.
Q. You just said the sky is the limit.  In Australia you told me that you're here to write history.  What do you have in mind when you say that?  What would be writing history?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: I like to dream big.  I think I did make a bit of history the last couple months, but I'm not gonna stop.  I'm going to keep going.
For me, No. 1 is to be the best player and person that I can be, on and off the court, and be an inspiration to others.  I think it just gives me more purpose to play this game.  I think I have been doing that really well.
And who knows?  Maybe if I win this tournament, I'll make even more history (smiling).
