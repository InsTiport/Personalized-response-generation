THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Lots of Chinese fans talked a lot about your dress last night on social media, Chinese style. How did you choose it?  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Well, I'm in China, so I wanted to be a little bit more authentic. I know that color means 'difference' and 'royalty'. I'm not saying I'm royalty, but the 'difference' part is that I think I'm pretty different than... I don't know, I bring a different vibe to the game I think. I wanted to showcase that a little bit, hopefully gain some more Chinese fans.   
 Q.  One of the fun elements of this tournament is the round-robin format. Have you ever played round-robin? What is your mentality knowing you can lose but still potentially go through?  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Yeah, I think they did round-robin during Junior Fed Cup, but that was a team sport which is different.   
I'm really looking forward to it. I mean, I've never played this tournament before. I've never played a round-robin in singles. It's going to be fun. It's not going to be easy. I'm playing amongst the best women players in the game. I think it's going to be really fun.   
 Q.  It seemed like throughout the US Open, even here, you don't seem to feel the pressure at all. Have you noticed a difference in your life since you won the US Open? Is it true that you don't feel the pressure or we're just not seeing it?  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: There's definitely pressure, for sure. I always say whether the pressure you put on yourself or the pressure from everyone else, but there's always going to be pressure.   
I found that I deal pretty well under pressure. Don't ask me how. I think my game just elevates to another level unconsciously, which I'm really grateful for. I think that's why I play my best against the top players.   
That was more when I was an underdog, so let's see how it is now.   
(After hearing translation into Chinese.)   
I didn't really understand what you said, but I think you got everything down. You should get a raise (laughter).   
 Q.  First-round match that's a rematch of the Australian Open final tomorrow with Naomi and Petra, and first-round match is you and Simona on Monday. What do you think it's going to be like someone for the first time? Also, in terms of that sort of aspect of the format, which is you don't play yourself into this, you're playing the best players right off the bat, how different does that make things as an event?  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Maybe it makes it more exciting. But there's definitely some good matchups. It's like you're playing the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam right away.   
But I got some good practice in. I have some pretty good wins up my sleeve. I think I have some pretty good momentum coming into this tournament. So do all the players, as well. Belinda just won a tournament. Naomi did really well during the Asian swing.   
I think it's going to be a good match, Petra and Naomi. Then me and Simona, I've always wanted to play her. I'm finally getting my chance. I'm really excited.   
 Q.  WTA Finals is the last event of the WTA calendar, also a big party. How many family members or team members did you bring to Shenzhen?  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: I brought my team, meaning my coach, my fitness trainer, my physiotherapist. My agent is here as well. Also my hitting partner.   
My parents right now are in Romania, but I think they might make it down here. We'll see. It would be really nice for them to come.   
 Q.  Petra Kvitova talked about being the oldest player here in the tournament at 29. You're 19, the youngest. How do you feel? Is that an issue you've thought about?  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: I think age is just a number. I think anyone can accomplish anything at any age if they really want it. I think I proved that. Petra proved that. Serena proved that.   
Well, I think right now I don't have much pressure on my shoulders going into this tournament. It's my first WTA Finals. I know I'm coming off a really good year this year, but I'm just going to go out there like any other tournament. I know it's the biggest tournament of my life, but I'm not going to keep saying that to myself.   
Just go out there and play like it's anything else.   
 Q.  I noticed you signed a new deal with Rolex. Can you share any details? It's also a sponsor of this tournament.  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Yeah, I got that Rolie on my wrist. It's sick, it's really cool (laughter). I'm not going to lie. It's one of the best watch brands in the world. Being able to be a part of their team is truly incredible.   
Roger is with them. Having my name amongst his in the books is pretty cool.
