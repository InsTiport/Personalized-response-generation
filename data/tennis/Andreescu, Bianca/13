3-6, 7-6, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Thoughts on the match? Obviously really close. Also talk about how your back was feeling.  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Not much to say really. It was a good match. She fought really hard. I didn't take my chances in the second set, so I'm really disappointed about that.   
Yeah, my back friggin' hurts, yeah.   
 Q.  You were shifting tactics a lot throughout the match. What changed in terms of what Simona was doing that made things more difficult?  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Well, she started putting more balls in the court, first of all. Then in the third set, I really don't want to blame my back, but I felt like I didn't have the same power as I did in the first and second set.   
But I fought well with what I had in the third. I'm proud of that. Still pretty disappointed.   
 Q.  You've only just come off court, but are you concerned the back issue might rule you out of future matches here?  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: We'll see.   
 Q.  Is it something you felt before? Is it a new injury?  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: I really don't want to talk about my back right now. But, no, I didn't feel it before.   
 Q.  Up until you felt it, what were you pleased with? First time facing Simona. You must have been pleased with some stuff you did.  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Yeah, I think I was executing the right tactics. My serve. My return was good today, for most of the match at least. I didn't feel intimidated at all stepping on the court.   
I know I looked up to her a lot, so being able to play her was really fun. Yeah, maybe I'll get to play her again here, get my revenge.   
 Q.  You're still in the tournament. In terms of rebounding and recovering, what's first on your mind playing in 48 hours?  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Shit ton of treatment, resting as much as possible, eating well, drinking a lot. Hopefully I can step on the court a little bit tomorrow to work on some things.
