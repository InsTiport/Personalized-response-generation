6-1, 2-0 [Ret.]
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You mentioned there was some tightness in your shoulder after the match against Kerber.  Did it get worse in the day off?  How were you feeling to start?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: I tried to get as much treatment as I can.  I thought it would be okay, but obviously it just got worse as the match progressed.
Q. Did the rain delay make it even worse, like, the adrenaline kind of go down when you were having to go off court and then go back on?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Yeah, maybe.  But I think it's just all the matches I have played.  I don't think the rain delay maybe did much or a bit or maybe it didn't do anything.
Yeah, I have played so many matches.  I guess this is just a way of my body telling me that it's had enough.  It's disappointing, but it's part of the sport.
Q. Can you describe the kind of pain?  Is it when you're hitting a specific shot?  Is it just kind of soreness and just difficulty getting the arm up?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Yeah, it's basically all of the above.  Yeah, it's just so tight.  The physios and the doctor said that it's nothing too serious, but it's just -- the pain is there, and I couldn't continue today.
Q. Did he tell you how long it's going to take before it gets back to normal?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: No, it's hard to say.  It's in the middle of a tournament, and I'm playing a lot of matches, so...
Q. Now that the run is over, okay, can you just sit back and look at what happened in the past 20 days?  Does it feel any different?  I mean, you said in Indian Wells that you didn't really realize what was happening, that it was something that had not sank in yet, even when you came here.  Can you now take a look at everything and say, What did I do?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Well, now I'm pretty upset with what happened today, so I wasn't really looking back at my time at Indian Wells.
But I guess, now that you mentioned it, I really can't complain with what I have achieved.  It's been an incredible run, a Cinderella story, like a lot of you guys said.  It's a dream come true, so I'm really pleased.
Now since I'm going home, I will have a good chunk to just take everything in and relax and be ready for Fed Cup.
Q. The first prize in Indian Wells is $1.3 million.  Do you plan on going shopping anytime soon?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Of course (smiling).  What do you do with 1.3 million?  I'm not just going to leave it there.
Yeah, I will probably -- I didn't do any shopping yet, but I'll definitely get to that.
Q. Any idea?  Anything in mind in particular?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Well, actually, I wanted a Louis V purse with my first actual big prize money.  So I will...
Q. This probably qualifies as a big...
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Of course, of course.
Q. Back to tennis.  What's the plan?  You mentioned Fed Cup.  Obviously your ranking has improved massively.  So rescheduling I believe is in order.  Do you have any idea what's happening in the, say, the spring?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: I didn't talk to my coach about that yet, but all I know is that I'm not going to be playing Charleston anymore.  I really need a break.
But after that, after the break, I will be playing Fed Cup, for sure.  But after that, I'm not sure.
Q. Speaking a little bit about the clay court season, I don't think you played a ton of clay as a pro level, but in juniors you played it a lot.  I think even on your ITF profiles, it's your favorite surface.  I'm curious what you're excited about in terms of getting back on clay and maybe what your game plan is going in?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Yeah, clay is one of my favorite surfaces.  I think my game really suits that.  I love sliding on the court.  I mean, I slide on every court, but it's easier on clay.  It's easier on the body, too.  So I'm looking forward to it.
