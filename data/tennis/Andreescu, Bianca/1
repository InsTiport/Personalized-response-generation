Q. Talk us through again a little bit what happened last night and I guess the prognosis from the tournament doctors and the scan today.
BIANCA ANDREESCU: So I twisted my knee during a forehand return. I heard a crack. After that it was hard to put pressure on it. On the spot the physio thought it was my meniscus, so she taped it up. It was really hard to bend with the taping and the pain kept getting worse, so I had to stop.
I fought with what I had, but I didn't want to get it worse.
Q. You had a scan today. Obviously the result of that is what made you decide as a team to withdraw?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Yeah, so the MRI just showed it didn't look good enough to play. Yeah, I mean, it's very disappointing. It's the last tournament of the season. You want to go all out, but stuff happens.
You just got to take a step back, reevaluate. That's what I did. I think this is the best decision for me right now.
Q. Overall do you still feel like it's been a positive experience in terms of qualifying, experiencing the WTA Finals, and it gives you the motivation to really make it a goal for next year?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Yeah, 100%. It's really nice to be amongst the best women athletes in the sport. It's an incredible event. I think it's one of the best events of the season really.
I think it definitely gives me a lot of motivation to work hard for next year so I can come back.
Q. What is in your immediate plans over the next few weeks? Have you thought much about the next step? Is it just getting some rest, recovery, then having a holiday? What's coming up in the next few weeks for you?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Yeah, definitely I need some time off. It's been a short yet long season at the same time for me. I'm definitely going to take time off, be with my family, with my friends, recoup, then start my pre-season. I'll become even stronger for 2020.
