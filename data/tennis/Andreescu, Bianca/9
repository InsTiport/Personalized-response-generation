THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Your impressions so far of the tournament and China?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Yeah, it's my first time in China, my first time at this tournament. So far so good. I'm really enjoying it. The people are very kind. The food is unbelievable. That's what I was looking forward to the most. The hotel is nice. The site is very well-organized.
I'm looking forward to the rest of the week.
Q. Have you gotten to do much exploring yet in Beijing?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: I went to the Silk Market. That was on my bucket list. I got some things. But other than that, no. I just stay at the hotel.
I went to the Spa. I heard the facials here are really good. My expectations were really high, but I didn't crush them, so...
Other than that, I'm really looking forward to going to the Great Wall of China, though. That probably will be after the tournament because I heard it's really far. I heard it's really beautiful, so it's worth it.
Q. What is your comment after the draw?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: I actually don't like looking at the draw, so I have no idea who I play (smiling). I mean, you can tell me because I have to know one way or another.
Q. What is your expectation? What is your goal?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Who am I playing? Does anyone know?
Q. They haven't sent the draw out yet.
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Well, I'm feeling pretty confident. I've been having some really good practices lately. I had a good training week in Toronto and in Montreal. Now here. I got here four days ago, and I've been practicing really well. So I'm feeling pretty confident.
Q. What was the reason behind skipping Wuhan? I think most of the top players are there this week. What were the goals post US Open before coming here?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Just to relax physically, mentally. Those two weeks at the US Open were very draining in every aspect. I just wanted to take some time off to just take care of my mind and my body, not rush into things.
I want to schedule-ize my tournaments, schedule-ize - I don't know if that's a word - properly because I don't want to get injured. I've been getting pretty injured this past year, so I just want to be careful.
Q. Is the mindset any different coming into a tournament like this versus a Grand Slam tournament?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: No, I don't think so. It's not as big as a Grand Slam, but it's still a very big tournament. There's a lot of tough competitors in the draw. I think most of the top seeds are playing. I'm really looking forward to what I can do.
But every tournament I go into, I want to win it. If I play my best tennis with what I have that day, I've done my job.
Q. (Question about the NextGen.)
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Yeah, I definitely think that the NextGen is arriving. A lot of young athletes are doing very well right now, like many other years before. I feel like this year has been even more.
I think it's good. It's nice to see new faces on the WTA Tour. I definitely feel like there are a lot of young athletes right now that can become even better.
I think not only me, but a lot of us are paving the way for many other young athletes. I think age doesn't really matter. I think we can do well at any age.
What was the last part of the question?
Q. Your comments on possibly becoming to No. 1.
BIANCA ANDREESCU: I think so. If I keep doing what I've been doing this past year, I think I can.
