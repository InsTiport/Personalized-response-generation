6-3 (ret.)   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Can you tell us what happened with the injury and how it's feeling, whether you think you'll play the third match or just abandon.  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Yeah, I stepped weirdly on a return. I heard my knee crack. It kind of went inwards. Putting pressure afterwards on it really bothered me. I could barely bend my knee.   
But I fought with the pain as much as I could. At some point an athlete has to say 'stop' and just listen to their body. That's what I did.   
Yeah, it's disappointing 'cause this is the last tournament of the year, you want to go all out. You're playing one of the biggest tournaments of the year, too. It's not easy.   
 Q.  I think on court you were selling Sylvain you thought it was the meniscus, that the physio said it was. Has there been any further discussion about that? Do you have any sense as to how serious it might be?  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Yeah, she thought that's what it was. But we'll see. I'm getting an MRI tomorrow. Hopefully it's nothing too bad. Yeah, we'll see.   
 Q.  If this is the end of your season, obviously a disappointing end. Can you reflect on what a fantastic year it's been for you.  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: You're putting a smile on my face. Thank you. Wasn't really thinking about that.   
But, yeah, it's been amazing. I really can't complain. I made history in Canada. I won my first slam. My game just keeps getting better and better.   
The thing with me, though, is that I'm never satisfied. Even looking back at that, I still want to do well right now.   
But I have to look at the positives. Hopefully I can recover quick after this. Who knows if I can play. We'll see. If not, then I'm going to have a good pre-season, good off-season, be ready for 2020.   
 Q.  Is it of any concern to you, you've had two or three injuries during the year, that may be a problem going forward?  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Well, some injuries are just inevitable. It's the athlete's job, team's job, to just try our best to prevent as much as possible. It's a long season. It's not easy day in, day out.   
But I love doing this, so I'm just going to keep fighting.   
 Q.  You said you thought it was the meniscus, the physio confirmed it.  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: I have no idea.   
 Q.  Can you talk about the thought process of wanting to continue. Most athletes would have stopped there.  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Yeah, actually I've never had a during-match injury happen before, other than spraining my ankle, but that was back in 2015.   
Honestly, I really didn't know what to do. I've fought through pain before, but this was different. It was like very acute. But it's the last tournament of the year. I just told myself, Push it as much as you can. You're going to have a good break after this.   
But yeah, maybe I could have pushed it more. I don't know. My team said no. It was good that I stopped. Honestly, I could have kept going. If I did, then I would just be, like, whining on the court. I don't want that. I've done that enough.   
 Q.  You're going to wait till the scan to decide if you're going to play your next match or not?  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Yeah.   
 Q.  Assuming this is the close-down of your season, what is a typical off-season for you? How long can you take before you actually pick up a racquet again?  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: It would be nice to take a month, but that does not look realistic. Two weeks is good enough for me.   
I don't know yet. I don't know where I'm going. Would be nice to go to Bali since I'm already in Asia. I always wanted to go there. That would be nice.   
But I don't want to focus on that now. Maybe I'll still be playing. We'll see.   
 Q.  Sorry to talk again about injuries. Your back was completely okay after the match the other night?  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Yeah. It didn't feel okay during the match at all, but afterwards I got a lot of treatment done, and it felt much better.
