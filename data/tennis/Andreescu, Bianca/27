THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Wondering if you could just reflect a little bit on the year. Indian Wells, what happened in Canada, it's been something. As you come into this tournament, talk a little bit about how you're feeling, how the year has gone.  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Yeah, "something" is definitely the word. I would say it's been surreal. I have enjoyed every moment out there. I didn't expect anything to come this quickly, but I do believe that I'm capable of doing big things. So I'm just really happy with how everything's turning out right now.   
 Q.  Since Toronto, what have you kind of been up to? Physically, that's always the big question going into a tournament. Physically how are you feeling? Not just shoulder but everything else. You're doing pretournament press in your main-draw debut at the US Open. It's kind of a whirlwind, I would think.  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Yeah, so I did have a bit of groin issues after Rogers Cup, so I just wanted to take it easy. I have prepared very well physically and mentally the last two-and-a-half weeks, so I'm feeling fresh for the US Open.   
And, yeah, this is my first main-draw seeded debut here at the US Open. After coming from the win in Toronto, I'm feeling pretty confident. I love playing on hard court. I'm here at the US Open in New York, so this is a moment I have dreamed of. I'm really looking forward to whatever will happen these next two weeks.   
 Q.  Do you have a special meal before matches? Is diet an important part of your whole regimen?  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: I don't have anything too specific. I try to have the right amount of carbs, protein, and vegetables before. I usually have a smoothie, too, to give me energy. I usually eat that usually between, like, I'd say an hour and a half, two hours before the match so I can digest properly.   
But, yeah, I think you are what you eat. So I think nutrition is definitely a big part of anything. So I really looked at that throughout this year, and I tried to improve it as much as I can. So, yeah, I'm feeling really good.   
 Q.  You have had some really good experiences at big tournaments this year, big scale at Indian Wells and Toronto. How does all of that compare to this? I imagine it's a lot larger, but do you feel like the experiences there will help you adjust to here? What has the experience here been thus far for you?  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Yeah, for sure. I have had some experience playing in Grand Slams already. I got to the third round of Australian Open this year, so I kind of know what to expect. I know every Grand Slam is different.   
Here in New York, the atmosphere is crazier, I think, than any other Grand Slam, so I'm really looking forward to being able to play in front of all of the fans.   
 Q.  With your success at Australian Open, obviously Indian Wells and Rogers Cup, would you say you're most comfortable on the hard courts? If so, how does that work with your game? A lot of people talk about the power you have in your shots and your selection, but how does being on the hard courts in New York help with your game?  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Yeah, I mean, I grew up playing on hard court, so I think it's the court I'm most used to. And, yeah, I think my game also suits it. It definitely shows in the results I had.   
 Q.  Could you assess Serena's chances for this US Open? Do you consider her as the favorite?  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Yeah, definitely if she manages physically, then I think she can do really well here, definitely.   
 Q.  In Indian Wells and in Canada you played amazing. Here it's two weeks and there is a lot of energy. It's New York. What's the best advice that you have received to play here and be here and doing well here?  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Well, I think it really helps when a tournament is two weeks, because you get that day in between matches, so it helps you recuperate better.   
I would say I think it's good to have a good balance. Explore New York, but at the same time be more mindful of that. Don't get too caught up in what's happening in the city. You don't want to get too tired. But that's personally more for me than for anyone else.   
 Q.  Speaking of, like, big things happening in New York, Serena and Maria are going to play the first round against one another. What was your reaction when you found out about it? And will you watch it?  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Oh, definitely. That's going to be a match to watch. And also Felix and Denis are playing each other. I think they played each other here two years ago. I feel like the draws are rigged sometimes because the Canadians keep playing each other first round.   
Definitely I'm looking forward to watching that match. That's going to be big.   
 Q.  When we talk about your season and your rise and everything happening so fast, sometimes players they have a great season and they will struggle to back it up. Have you and your team sort of started to have those conversations on how you're going to maintain the momentum?  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Not really. I don't want to focus on that. I just want to focus on what I have accomplished and basically just take what I have accomplished and how I prepared before that and just bring it into every tournament, because if I do that and not focus on anything else, then I think it will go well for me.   
 Q.  Speaking of the Canadians, there are seven here including yourself. What's it been like seeing this rise in Canadian tennis this year? And you're 19. Felix is 19 and Denis is only 20 or 21 at this point. But seeing the rise, especially from the younger players, and looking to Genie and Milos being the older veterans on the tour, what does it mean to see Canadian tennis like this?  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Yeah, what's happening in Canadian tennis right now is unbelievable. It's so nice to see me, Felix, and Denis doing well at the same time. I remember playing junior events with them, so it's nice to share that success with them at the same time.   
But we have looked up to Genie and Milos when they had their rise, so I think if we just keep motivating each other like Genie and Milos did, and even Daniel Nestor, Vasek Pospisil, everyone, then I think we can keep doing what we're doing.   
 Q.  If you get to play on one of the bigger courts -- at Ashe, you get to kind of ask for, play that song when you walk out.  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Really?   
 Q.  I think so. In years past I believe so. Hypothetically, if you have to tell the DJ, what song is playing when you walk out on Arthur Ashe Stadium?  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Oh, there are too many good songs out there. I'm going to stick with Drake, with my homeboy (laughter). Can't go wrong with that. 'Started From the Bottom.' Literally.   
 Q.  You just talked about the vibe of New York. I'm curious if you feel like you match up with that and what it is about New York compared to other big cities you play at?  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: I think it's just the atmosphere. Everyone makes it so intriguing. You never know what you're going to see on the streets.   
There is always just something to do. It's literally the city that never sleeps. I think it does fit into my personality. I think I'm more of a night owl. Obviously I'm going to save that for after the tournament.   
But, yeah, I'm just going to enjoy myself and hopefully I can do good.   
 Q.  So you met Nadia Comaneci? She's such an inspiration for many. What do you admire most about her, her career?  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Yeah, what she accomplished was incredible. Coming from a Romanian background, it's really nice to see another Romanian doing well, I guess. So we have that special connection, because she did well in Canada. I'm Romanian, she's Romanian.   
And I got the chance to meet her. Yeah, she's an unbelievable person, very down to earth, and, yeah, she's an incredible inspiration for many, I'm sure, including myself.   
 Q.  Wondering if have looked ahead to your first opponent and what you're going to be facing with her.  
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Yeah, I played her in Newport Beach earlier this year. She's a tough competitor. She gets to a lot of balls. So I'm not expecting anything easy.   
So, yeah, I know she's American too, but hopefully I can get the crowd support, as well (smiling).
