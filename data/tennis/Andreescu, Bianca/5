N. OSAKA/B. Andreescu
5-7, 6-3, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Talk through the match. Obviously had the leads. What were the differences that allowed her to get back into it?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Some points here and there. We both played really, really well. If you really want to look at things in a match that you think you can do better, you'll always find something. Not every match is perfect. There's always going to be points here and there that you're going to lose.
Maybe I could have made less unforced errors. Maybe my serve could have been a little bit better. But I think I was returning well. Points were really long. Naomi played really, really well.
It was a tough battle.
Q. You said yesterday how your games might match up. Now after two and a half hours, how do you think the games match up? What was it like playing her?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: I was really excited. I prepared like I always do. I think I was more focused than usual. I don't know, it's usually like that when I play top players.
I think we're going to have many matches like this. Our game styles are pretty different, but they level up pretty equally. If she's playing well, like she did, I play well, then I think they level up very similarly.
Q. You had a long exchange at the net. What did you say to Naomi at the net?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: I said, Congrats, you played amazing.
She said, You're amazing.
What did I say then? Oh, I said, We're going to have so many more matches like this. I can't wait to see what the future holds.
She's like, Yup, I'm excited.
Q. The streak is over obviously. What is your reaction? Is this just a loss or does it feel bigger?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: I mean, it's disappointing. I forgot how it feels. Honestly it sucks. I didn't miss it at all.
But at least I didn't get whooped 1-1. I put on a fight. Honestly, it could have went either way. It was just some points here and there.
At the same time I am pissed, but at the same time I'm proud of myself with how I played today. I really fought, especially in that last game. Holy crap, that was crazy (smiling).
But, yeah, hopefully it was fun to watch.
Q. Looking ahead to Shenzhen, given the break you had after the US Open, the matches you had here, are you pretty pleased with where your game is at physically, mentally?
BIANCA ANDREESCU: Yeah, I think I'm playing really well. Maybe even better than at the US Open. I don't know. I'm feeling my shots way better actually. So hopefully it can just get even better from here so I can do well in Shenzhen.
