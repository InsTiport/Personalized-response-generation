Q.  John Parsons, Daily Telegraph, London.  You must have known beforehand that you'd be playing both the crowd and a great opponent out there.  What's your feeling now at this stage after coming out on the wrong side of a fantastic match like that?
 
JONAS BJORKMAN: Well, first of all, I'm very disappointed of being in the situation of losing this match, a little bit upset at myself.  But in the end, I feel I'm hitting the ball just better and better every week, and these top guys should be happy with every win they can get against me I think because sooner or later, I'm going to get the wins, you know, against these guys.  Then that's going to turn around.  And I think at the end I will have a great year. 
 
Q.  You could have won in straight sets.  Those points at the end of that first set, with hindsight, do you think that was very, very crucial?
 
JONAS BJORKMAN: Yeah, I think it helped him to sort of get the first set going.  But still, I won the second, I played great in the third, and in the fourth, it's probably only one point away to game, set and match.  Like I said before, he was lucky to escape this time and hopefully next time will be a different story and I will take my opportunities a little bit better.  But all credit for him who came back and played strongly at the end.
