Q.  Is that a little bit better than yesterday? 
 
JONAS BJORKMAN:  Definitely.  I thought I played much better today.  I was feeling much comfortable out there.  Of course, I saw Sergi was not feeling a hundred percent.  But sometimes it's hard to play a guy who is not a hundred percent.  I was just trying to stay focused and concentrate on my own game. 
   

Q.  Do you feel now that you've got the win, it's not a big step to get to the semifinals?  At least you have a fight?
 
JONAS BJORKMAN:  Yeah, definitely.  Everything went the way I wanted things to go.  Kafelnikov did his job. Tomorrow I have a match against Michael.  That's going to be win or lose.  That fits me perfectly.  So hopefully I can keep up my play like I did today.  If I can play as good as I did today, I think I got a good chance.  
   

Q.  Jonas, a lot of people think that you're strong enough to win the tournament.  Is that kind of pressure for you?
 
JONAS BJORKMAN:  No, not at all.  It's more a nice comment to hear.  So they just make me feel more anger to work really hard in these matches, just give everything I have to hopefully make it true.
