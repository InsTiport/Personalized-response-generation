Q.  Granted the surfaces were different the last time you played him to this time, but other than that, what made the match different, the way he played?

JONAS BJORKMAN:  I think Pete served extremely well today.  I played him a lot of times, but I haven't seen him serving that good.  He was so confident, he was coming up with like almost close to 200 second serves.  It definitely made it hard to get into the rhythm.


Q.  Do you think that this will have any influence or will you have any influence on the Swedish Tennis Association on what court to put down for the Davis Cup final?

JONAS BJORKMAN:  Well, I don't think so because the day like today, when Pete is playing and is serving that big, you know, it doesn't matter if it's grass, clay or whatever; it's just going to be tough to break him anyway.  I don't know.  They maybe watch the match.  That's something we got to discuss later on.
