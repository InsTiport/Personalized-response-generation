 Q. How do you feel you played today? 
 
 JONAS BJORKMAN: I felt that I was playing very well today. Didn't do any mistakes, I
was hitting the ball well, had him under pressure all the time. Well, I was never worried
that I lose him because I had a lot of confidence going into the match. With the start I
had, it gave me even more confidence. I'm hitting the ball very well now. I was very
satisfied with it. 
 
Q. Any thoughts on your next opponent, either Rusedski or Siemerink?
 
 JONAS BJORKMAN: Yeah. It's two tough lefties. No matter who it's going to be, I think
it's going to be a tough match, first of all, for them. And then no matter who I play, it
will be a tough match for me, as well. But I've got a good record against lefties. Even if
I lost to Rusedski last year here and Siemerink in Wimbledon, I think my records against
both of them are still in a positive way. You know, I'm going to be tough to beat. I'm
hitting the ball better and better every day. I'm getting more and more confidence. It
feels like I'm, you know, hitting the ball as good as I did in '97. 
 
Q. How do you like playing with your new racquet with the hyper carbon in it?
 
 JONAS BJORKMAN: Well, it's good. I was a little worried of changing before The Open
here, but I didn't have a choice. I think we have some problems with my other racquets. I
had a couple days before. You just have to be mentally ready to make that switch. You
know, it worked out well. I felt the racquet was good for me. It's a few different things
from the other racquet I had, but it was not anything, a major difference. That's why it
was not a problem to change. 
 
Q. Is this the first tournament you're playing with it?
 
 JONAS BJORKMAN: Yeah.
