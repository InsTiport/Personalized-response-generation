 Q. Can you describe the match against Todd this evening, and the roll that you're on,
obviously the performance at Indianapolis and the way you're playing in general right now. 
 
 JONAS BJORKMAN: Well, I think I got off to a good start today against Todd, but then I
maybe stopped playing the game I should play, you know, to be aggressive and hit the ball
and really work hard. I was more waiting for his mistakes. I lost my rhythm a little bit.
You know, I was down 5-3. Then it was important I made a good comeback and won the first
set. I think for Todd it's harder to work, you know, when you have to play another three
sets, when he's still coming from a long injury. He's maybe not used to playing a lot of
sets and a lot of points. When I even got up two sets to love, it felt even better. I felt
that it's going to go quite good, I was hoping. So it was maybe not the best tennis from
both of us, but it was a few good points for the crowd. I'm happy to get through in
straight sets. 
 
Q. And how about your game in general right now, coming off the win in Indianapolis,
where are you in your game? If you can look forward to the match against Kuerten.
 
 JONAS BJORKMAN: Well, it's going to be an interesting match. We had a big battle in
French Open second round. He beat me in four tough sets. Obviously, he's playing pretty
good as well at this time. He had a good win today. It's going to be interesting. I think
I'm having some good chances. I'm a little underdog in that match, he's the favorite. I
think that it's going to fit me quite good. I'm just going to go in and give everything,
you know, trust the way I'm playing for the moment.
