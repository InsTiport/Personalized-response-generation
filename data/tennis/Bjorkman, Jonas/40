Q.  The seeding system, the 32 seeds, you had kind of a lucky break in the sense that you wound up being seeded because two guys were pulled out. 

JONAS BJORKMAN:  Yeah.

Q.  How do you now consider the system of having 32 seeds as opposed to 16?

JONAS BJORKMAN:  I think it's great. 

Q.  Can you explain why?

JONAS BJORKMAN:  I think we got 16 seeds in all the other tournaments.  But in a 128, it suits to be 32.  The competition is so strong.  The guy who is ranked 17 to 32 is as good as the guy who's maybe inside the top 16.  So I think it's more fair to all the players.  It's also a mandatory event these days which makes it even importanter for every guy to count their results.  You know, definitely it has been before, but some guys has been really lucky with the draws, it open a lot more.  I think with 32, I don't think it could be better than 32.  I think it's great. 

Q.  From your own point of view, before the tournament started, you could have met Pete Sampras first round, couldn't you?

JONAS BJORKMAN:  No, because already did the draw.

Q.  Coming into the draw, I think you were 35 in the rankings. 

JONAS BJORKMAN:  Yes.

Q.  Until those guys pulled out injured. 

JONAS BJORKMAN:  I was the 33rd.  I needed only one guy to pull out.
