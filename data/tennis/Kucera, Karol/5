Q. How did you feel on court today?

KAROL KUCERA: I felt a little bit nervous today. Probably was my first match on the
Championship, in the World Championship. Probably the nervousness was also because my
serve was not so good today, and I didn't feel so comfortable from the baseline. It was
tough for me to stay mentally relaxed.

Q. It's clearly been the best year of your career. Do you believe you belong in the Top
8 or do you think it's going to be difficult to sustain that next year?

KAROL KUCERA: It is tough to say. I have to win a couple matches to get confidence, of
course. This is one of the toughest tournament of the year, so I have the toughest
opponents. So I have to deal with it, you know.

Q. I was thinking in a broader sense. Look what happened to Jonas Bjorkman who had a
great year last year, but then this year he's had very great difficulties sustaining the
form. 

KAROL KUCERA: Yeah, of course. The year is very long. You have a lot of opportunities
to play. I hope I can prove that I belong to the Top 10 for next year as well.

Q. Were you surprised by how effective he was at the net today?

KAROL KUCERA: Yeah, I was really surprised how he played on the net today. He played a
lot of volleys. He went a lot to the net. I think he had tough volleys to play, and he did
well. So I was pretty surprised.
