 Q. One group is stronger than the other? 
 
 KAROL KUCERA: I think so, but I am happy to be here. 
 
Q. Is it for you a problem to play tomorrow or the other day?
 
 KAROL KUCERA: No problem. After the draw, Carlos Moya would be the best. 
 
Q. How do you feel about Pete Sampras?
 
 KAROL KUCERA: No question about Pete. He is No. 1 and playing the best tennis in the
world. Carlos Moya, he is more dangerous on clay. He is Spanish and his play is Spanish
baseline play. Kafelnikov is playing better at the end of this year. 
 
Q. How do you feel being here?
 
 KAROL KUCERA: It's a great feeling. I'm enjoying it so far. 
 
Q. Are you a national hero at home?
 
 KAROL KUCERA: I don't think so, no. 
 
Q. Would you want to be one?
 
 KAROL KUCERA: Not really.  
 
Q. Do you have thoughts about ending your career? I know it sounds silly. What will you
do after that period?
 
 KAROL KUCERA: When I'm not in the tennis? 
 
Q. Yes. Do you think you'll stay with the tennis?
 
 KAROL KUCERA: It's tough to say. This is the most -- probably I'm going to stay with
the tennis and teach, yeah. 
 
Q. As a coach?
 
 KAROL KUCERA: As a coach maybe or as a captain maybe Davis Cup, or I help Federation. I
don't know yet. 
 
Q. What are your plans for next year?
 
 KAROL KUCERA: I like to stay healthy, you know, for the next year. I can play all
year-round, win some good matches. To keep this level, you know, that I play this year. 
 
Q. (Inaudible)?
 
 KAROL KUCERA: That's tough to say for me now. Maybe if I can improve a few things in my
play, maybe I can play even better. 
 
Q. Is it your goal to be No. 1?
 
 KAROL KUCERA: Not really. I'm happy so far what I've done in the tennis. I'm happy to
be here. I like to win my next match.
