 Q. You played against Pete Sampras tonight, and he was in good form. Would you say
there's any player at the Championship now that you think could beat Sampras the way he
played tonight? 
 
 KAROL KUCERA: Yeah, I think Pete played his game tonight, and I didn't, I would say.
I'm pretty physically and mentally already tired probably from whole year. But the
question you ask me from these guys here, I think who could hold his serve with Sampras,
you know, to get a little bit farther, like 4-4, 5-5, maybe 6-6, a little bit closer to
the set, then he can beat probably Pete. 
 
Q. So what are you going to do now that for you the tournament is over? Are you going
to think about this? Go home? Prepare for the next season?
 
 KAROL KUCERA: I'm going to forget about this probably, try to prepare myself for the
next year as best I can. 
 
Q. I don't know if it's been asked: Did you give any thought to the fact that Sampras
had achieved the No. 1 ranking? Did you think perhaps he would step back a little bit and
it would be an easier match?
 
 KAROL KUCERA: Probably today's game wasn't so important for him because he was already
in the semifinals, he was already No. 1 for the end of the year, he could play more
relaxed probably. But, you know, I didn't give him any back power, I would say. I wasn't
opponent for him today. 
 
Q. Are you surprised at how well he played?
 
 KAROL KUCERA: Not really. Not really. I was expecting him to play well. If I want to
play well against Pete, I have to be physically and mentally fit, a hundred percent, to be
focused every point, try to concentrate on my game every point. It wasn't my best day
today.
