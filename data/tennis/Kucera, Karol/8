Q. Karol, this was really --

KAROL KUCERA: --  a tough match.


Q. Embarrassing match.  The people, the crowd, was very embarrassed.  How did you feel on the court today?

KAROL KUCERA:  Yeah, I didn't feel really comfortable.  I felt pretty tired, especially in the beginning of the second set.  After I won the second set, I was just keeping fighting, and I won.


Q. This is your seventh victory against him.  Is this right?

KAROL KUCERA:  The fourth.


Q. He can't win against you, true?

KAROL KUCERA:  He won already once.


Q. But he's a player that you like to play?

KAROL KUCERA:  Last two games were very tight.  We played three sets also in the final of New Haven.  Pretty close matches.
