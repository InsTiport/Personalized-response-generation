 Q. That was a tough match. Are you disappointed that you lost because you had your
chances? 
 
 KAROL KUCERA: Yeah, I'm a little bit disappointed that I didn't won the second match as
well. But I don't think that I played so bad like yesterday. I was a little bit more
satisfied today in my play. 
 
Q. What do you think was the key to the victory?
 
 KAROL KUCERA: For me, tough to say now so early after the match. I think I gave him a
little bit more easy the second set. I made a couple double-faults there. I lost too easy
my service games in the second set. I was losing one game after another, and I couldn't
stay on the same level like in the first set.
