Q. In your opinion what happened with Guga's game today?

KAROL KUCERA: I don't know. You should ask him.

Q. In your game, did you improve?

KAROL KUCERA: Yeah, I felt pretty good. I think I put a little bit -- a lot of pressure
from the beginning, and Guga could hit back pretty easy. So I decided in the second set to
change tactic a little, to play a little bit longer, slower and then if I had some chances
to approach then I was trying to do that.

Q. What are your objectives first for this tournament and then for the clay court
season as a whole?

KAROL KUCERA: For me this event was very, very important. I didn't play so well so far
this year, but before the Davis Cup I changed the strings and I feel much more comfortable
with it. Already in Davis Cup I played pretty good match with Guga. I think was pretty
similar play than today. It was just a week ago and just it was best of three sets, so it
was short. I hope I can play such good tennis also in the second round and my next
tournaments are Hamburg and Rome, Dusseldorf and Paris.
