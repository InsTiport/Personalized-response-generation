Q. Karol, bad luck.  Your physical condition at the end was not the best.  Can you tell us when you first started to feel bad? 
 
KAROL KUCERA:  Yeah.  First I felt bad after first set, I think.  And I got into the match with the winning of the second set.  And then somehow I found it real strange not to play a big rallies, but I could run a few rallies. 
 

Q. You actually felt tired by the start of the second set?
 
KAROL KUCERA:  Yeah.  But the last set and I think from the point from 5-2 in the fourth set, it was real bad. 
 

Q. Did you set out to overcome that by attacking more instead of containing and counterattacking?
 
KAROL KUCERA:  Yeah, that's right.  I was trying to keep the rallies as short as possible, you know. 
 

Q. Were you surprised then how close you got to winning?
 
KAROL KUCERA:  Yeah, I was pretty surprised  (laughter). 
 

Q. Could you have done anything different on those four match points, do you think?
 
KAROL KUCERA:  It's tough to say.  But I don't think so.  I could hit some ace or something, you know.  But I couldn't really run too much.  All the MVPs was I think like two of them was rallies.  One he hit a forehand winner return, so was no chance there. 
 

Q. You played very well, but how do you feel about missing the chance at all that money?
 
KAROL KUCERA:  Yeah, you know, that's only some money.  So it would be worse if it would be like a Grand Slam semifinal or something, I think.  I don't feel really bad about this result, so I'm not disappointing too much.
