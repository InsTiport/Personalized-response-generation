G. GARCIA-LOPEZ/M. Zayid
6-1, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.
Q. What will you say of your experience, given that you are to rising in stature, but then to run into somebody like Garcia, a big tournament, can we have your thoughts?
MUBARAK SHANNAN ZAYID: It's my honour, like to play this ATP tournament.  It's a very high level tournament.  And I'm very happy that Qatar Tennis Federation gave me this opportunity to play.  It wasn't an easy match for me to play against this guy.  And I knew that I will have to work very hard to get like some games or some points.  He wasn't giving me any chance to take any points unless, like, I really force it and get it like a really good point.
Q. Second set, 4th or the 5th game, you had a chance, you know, when you were trying to save yourself...
MUBARAK SHANNAN ZAYID: 3-All.
Q. ..yes, 3-All you made.  Did you think you had some chance there?
MUBARAK SHANNAN ZAYID: Absolutely.  I think I had the chance to get that game.  I did take the wrong decision, unfortunately.  And this is how I lost the game.
Q. Hard luck, but I mean what are the positives you look at?
MUBARAK SHANNAN ZAYID: Yes, I for sure, like, for the upcoming months or weeks, I will have to work twice as hard like I'm working now to get to their level and I have to compete way more - I have to compete in way more tournaments that I'm doing right now.
THE MODERATOR: Questions in Arabic, please.
