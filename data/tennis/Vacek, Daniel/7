 Q. Do you think anybody is going to be able to beat that guy? 
 
 DANIEL VACEK: I don't know. We'll see. He's very confident I think and even after that
relatively long break, he seems to me had -- he's fast and physically fit, so I think it
will be very difficult.  
 
Q. We heard something on the TV about you having a sandwich, you wanted to eat, you
didn't eat at the time you went out on the court. 
 
 DANIEL VACEK: I don't know.  
 
Q. No? 
 
 DANIEL VACEK: No.  
 
Q. You played him before, do you think he's weaker now? 
 
 DANIEL VACEK: Well, I don't think so. You have that feeling?  
 
Q. No, I'm just asking. You are the one that played him.
