 D. SAFINA/B. Zahlavova-Strycova
  6-3, 6-4 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. What do you make of your performance today out there?   
 DINARA SAFINA: Well, tough to say. I don't know. In some moments I played not bad, but, I mean, it's good that I win the match and still there is so much room to improve. You know, that's such a good thing, you know -- you know deep inside you have so much more to bring out, you know.   
 But, you know, I think the serve was pretty good today. And that I won. In the next match I can do a little bit more and more, until I don't find everything on the court.   
  
  Q. So what do you think you need to improve moving forward?  
 DINARA SAFINA: Well, overall I think was too many unforced errors. The second set was breakpoints. I had the balls on the racquet to go for the winners. I had again 15-40. Second set had to be much easier and I complicated myself.   
 So just because of this, you're saying in the match. I mean, it had to be 5-Love for me instead of 3-2. So it's complicated.   
 But, you know, hopefully next match I can do better.   
  
  Q. Do you know anything about your next opponent?  
 DINARA SAFINA: Yeah, of course. I know her very good.   
  
  Q. What sort of match do you expect?  
 DINARA SAFINA: I mean, she's a good player. She won two matches. She has nothing to lose. So basically I just want to go out there and do better than I did today and play better.   
  
  Q. How have you spent the off-season?   
 DINARA SAFINA: My second home in Monaco I've been.
