H. WATSON/O. Dodin   
6-3, 6-0   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.   
 Q.  How would you analyze this match?  
OCEANE DODIN: Well, not great.  I tried.  I was okay until 3-Love, but I wasn't ready physically, and I didn't train very much these past few weeks.  So I wasn't expecting a very great match.   
 Q.  How are you health-wise?  At the Australian Open you said you were a bit better, but how are you now?  
OCEANE DODIN: Well, so-so.   
 Q.  What do you think about the future?  Since you're so-so, are you going to continue to play tournaments?  
OCEANE DODIN: No, I really don't know.  I don't know what's going to happen ahead.   
 Q.  Do you want to stop for a while?  
OCEANE DODIN: Yes, possibly.  I want to take time off and give it a bit of thought and see what, you know, what's going to happen.
