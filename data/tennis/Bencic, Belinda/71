  6/4, 6/1 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   First, I would like to know, you were very intense on the court during the match.   Tell us a little bit why you were frustrated.   
BELINDA BENCIC:   Yeah, because I was just frustrated because I missed some chances there.   Yeah, but I did my best, and I think I fighted until the end.  
I really want to put up a good game, and sometimes I did some stupid mistakes or didn't use my chances, and that's why I was a little bit frustrated.  
   
 Q.   2014, first time in the main draw.   Can you tell us a little bit about what you go away with?  
BELINDA BENCIC:   I think I can be really happy with this week.   I reached third round.   It's my best result so far.  
And it's really great after I played just the juniors last year that I'm here in the main draw and I could win two rounds.  
So I'm happy with that, but obviously I will keep improving.
