B. BENCIC/T. Pironkova
  3‑6, 6‑1, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How do you feel physically?   We saw you a bit crying during the last set. 
BELINDA BENCIC:   Yeah, I think it's not too bad.   I twisted my knee a little bit in Eastbourne, but I was just checking with the physios, and I think they can help me.   So I think it will be good. 

Q.   What was your feelings during the match today?
BELINDA BENCIC:   Yeah, first set I think I was a little bit off.   I didn't really find my timing.
Yeah, it was very difficult.   I didn't have like very good preparation here on this grass court.   I couldn't practice at all.   Just yesterday half an hour and this morning half an hour.
I think she was here a little bit longer, so that was my disadvantage.   But I think I managed to do well with my serve in the second and third set, and then I kind of got in the game a little bit more.   I tried to play more carefully, slower, and, yeah, I think that's good.
