V. AZARENKA/B. Bencic
  6‑2, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You have a lot of English supporters here.   I wonder if you could explain to me what you found particularly difficult about playing Victoria today?
BELINDA BENCIC:   Of course all her game is very difficult.   She has very aggressive game, and she had a lot of control today in the shots.   And her serve and return were for sure better than mine today. 
I think there is a lot of work to do, so I can try to beat these players, but I'm very happy with my tournament and I'm ready to improve.
