 B. BENCIC/A. Friedsam
  7‑5, 4‑6, 6‑0 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Talking about three double bagels in the first round, the psychology of it, being on either side of it, is it really kind of weird to either win or lose?   I don't know if you've ever lost one, but...     
BELINDA BENCIC:   I don't know.   Of course it looks very‑‑ how do you say?   
   
 Q.   Harsh?   
BELINDA BENCIC:   Harsh on the paper.   But maybe it's not as easy as the match seems or something.   Sometimes it is, but I don't really feel like there is a difference if you win 6‑1 or 6‑0.   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   As a junior, have you ever lost one like that?  
BELINDA BENCIC:   I lost 6‑0, 6‑0 to Caroline Wozniacki in Istanbul.   
Yeah, so I really know how it feels and it's really not funny.   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   Hard to come back from it, or you just have to put it out of your mind?  
BELINDA BENCIC:   I mean, after the tournament and the same evening I was really like in the locker room, I was like, what happened?   It went so quickly.   I was not able to win one game.   It's really like frustrating.   
But, I mean, after the next tournament you're very happy when you win the first game, of course.   Yeah.
