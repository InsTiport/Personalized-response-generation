THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
   
 Q. Could you just talk about the injury? Is it a precaution to stop or something that really bothered you? How do you feel for the Open?  
BELINDA BENCIC: Yeah, first of all, I don't think it's like very serious. I just wasn't 100% today. To beat Lucie or even compete against her, you need to be 100%.  
I'm really sorry I had to retire. It was like I think the first time ever I retired a match, so it didn't feel very good.  
Yeah, I mean, I just hope it will get better and I'm sure I will be fit very soon.  
   
 Q. Do you plan on playing New Haven next week?  
BELINDA BENCIC: I don't know yet. We still need to talk with the team and then decide.  
   
 Q. What's the nature of the injury?  
BELINDA BENCIC: Sorry?   
   
 Q. What is the nature of your injury?  
BELINDA BENCIC: It's just muscular. I'm very tight through the forearm. The change of balls and I played a lot of matches, I think that it's just too much pressure.  
   
 Q. Has it been bothering you for quite a while, or is it something that just cropped up recently?  
BELINDA BENCIC: I mean, it was getting tight every match as I continued to play, and I was just hoping with a lot of physio and everything I could do it.  
But today I think it was just too much, and I couldn't play anymore.  
   
 Q. You have been playing a lot lately. Do you feel like physically and mentally it was becoming a little too much?  
BELINDA BENCIC: No. Physically I'm fine except this, and mentally I'm also fine. I mean, I won a lot of matches. I think that's the best that can happen to you mentally.
