V. WILLIAMS/B. Bencic
      6‑4, 6‑1

    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please. 

Q.   Did you feel nervous at all before the match today?
    BELINDA BENCIC:   Yeah, of course, a little bit nervous, but not more nervous than before any other match.   Yeah. 

Q.   Were you a little bit intimidated by Venus' reputation, or did it help that you had actually played her before?
    BELINDA BENCIC:   Sorry? 

Q.   Were you a little bit intimidated by her reputation or did it help you played her before?
    BELINDA BENCIC:   What means intimidated? 
    No, not at all.   I mean, I played her before one time, and I knew that now I can play on the big court against big players, and it was not the first time.   So, no, not at all. 

Q.   What do you think the turning point in the match was for you?
    BELINDA BENCIC:   I think I missed some chances in the first set at 3‑All, I think.   Yeah, in that moment.   So I think I should have been more focused there.   Yeah. 

Q.   When Venus was your age, teenagers were winning Grand Slams.   That's not the case anymore.   Why do you think that has changed?
    BELINDA BENCIC:   Well, I'm not winning Grand Slam yet.   But I think it's more physical, the game, and also the older players are more experienced and we are also having limited tournaments we can play.
    So it's just harder to, like, the time before.

Q.   You won juniors here last year.   Within the past year, how do you feel you have changed the most and what kind of things have you learned?   How different is it for you coming, when you came to this tournament this time around?
    BELINDA BENCIC:   Yeah, I won the juniors last year, and it was really great.   I was looking very forward to this tournament, so I was very happy to play on the big court.   Yeah. 

Q.   How do you feel you have matured the most or changed the most within the past year?
    BELINDA BENCIC:   I don't know.   I think I improved a lot.   And also in the rankings, in the pros.   So it's great that I was in the main draw here.   Yeah. 

Q.   Do you still speak to Martina much?   Did she give you any tips about how to battle the clay and maybe how to prepare for playing Venus again?
    BELINDA BENCIC:   Yeah, of course.   Her mother gave me most of the tips and also Martina gave me some tips, yeah.

Q.   What sort of things did she say?   What sort of tips did she give you about how to prepare for the clay?
    BELINDA BENCIC:   Just the normal things.   I played already in Rome and Madrid.   So, yeah.
