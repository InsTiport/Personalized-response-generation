B. BENCIC/B. Mattek‑Sands 
  7‑5, 7‑5

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Can you tell us a little bit about the injury and what happened in the first set. 
BELINDA BENCIC:   Yeah.   I think it was a little bit ‑‑I mean, it got better over the days a lot, but then in the warmup I stopped a little bit, and then it started hurting again a little bit. 
And also my tape came off, so the main reason I called the physio is of course so she could redo the tape and to loosen it up a little bit, but I think it was ‑‑I mean, it hurt a little bit, but yeah. 

Q.   What do you think was the key to turning it around in the first set?
BELINDA BENCIC:   I think the key was that I was getting more rhythm.   In the first set I was definitely thinking too much about her game and her always coming to the net and me panicking when she does it.
I think I calmed down a little bit, and I focused on my game and tried just to put the ball in the court and to make a rally and not to think what I will do when she attacks. 

Q.   You probably get asked about Martina Hingis every single press conference. 
BELINDA BENCIC:   Yeah, that's true.

Q.   But is there something a little extra special with her watching you?
BELINDA BENCIC:   Well, of course it gives me not special motivation, but it always feels nice and I'm happy when she comes to watch my match and when she helps me. 
And also we call Melanie, my coach, all the time, and she gives me also advice against top players.   She watches them on TV and me.   Yeah, they just help me a lot.

Q.   How difficult a player is Mattek‑Sands to play against?   She's quite different. 
BELINDA BENCIC:   It's really difficult because she plays so different.   You get no rhythm because she tries to take every ball and comes to the net always. 
Her serve is not flat but with a lot of rotation, so in the beginning I was really trying to find how to play against her.

Q.   What do you think you need to do to make the step up and become a Grand Slam champion?
BELINDA BENCIC:   I have to win matches (smiling). 
No, I mean, I don't know.   It's still so a long way to go, and I have to really have a lot of experience and every match I have to improve.   I think my serve is still more improvable, but of course it improve a lot. 
And I think overall my game I just have to be experienced.   I hope it will come with the time. 

Q.   Bethanie has been very vocal, criticizing the white rule.   I wonder what your opinion is?
BELINDA BENCIC:   What I think about the all white? 

Q.   Yeah.   Are you in favor of it or... 
BELINDA BENCIC:   I think is what is the rule, so I think it's fine.   I mean, it's just only this tournament.   When Wimbledon has such tradition, so why not do it? 
I think when it says white, so white and then have here something colorful.   When it's all white, then it's all white.
