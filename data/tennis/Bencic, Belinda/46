THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Tough match out there for you today.  Just kind of walk us through your experience of it.  
BELINDA BENCIC: Yeah, definitely was a very good match.  I think she served unbelievable, first of all, so that put a lot of pressure on me in my service games, but I think I defended pretty well.  I tried to play smart.   
Yeah, just a little bit different than her.  Then in the end it wasn't enough, but for sure I was fighting till the end, so...   
 Q.  That was your first time facing Maria.  What surprised you about her game or what stood out the most for you on your end?  
BELINDA BENCIC: That her scream is not so loud (Laughter.)   
No, no, no, I'm joking.  Definitely I was very impressed how she served; probably she's serving the best now in this moment.  Once she plays Serena it will be ace, ace, ace, everything.  Will be interesting match, no.   
But just in general, like I really tried to hold the rally and then wait for my chances and obviously when she was serving wait for my chances.   
But then, yeah, it wasn't enough in the end.   
 Q.  What were your thoughts on the challenge at the end?  
BELINDA BENCIC: Well, in my opinion, I was there.  I was there and he called it out, so I didn't play.  But what can you do against the referee?  I mean, there is really nothing you can do.   
 Q.  Did you ask the chair umpire?  
BELINDA BENCIC: Yeah, of course I ask.  I told her, I was right there.  But she was like, No.  They never change their mind, so...   
 Q.  A lot of people talk about Serena and Maria and facing them for the first time.  Since you have already played Serena, what did you think about taking on Maria in a situation like this?  
BELINDA BENCIC: What do you mean now?   
 Q.  The difference between playing sort of these two very well-known, powerful women.  
BELINDA BENCIC: Well, today I didn't feel like there was a difference serving.  It was even tougher against Maria.  She was acing everything, no?   
But I mean, obviously they are the top two players of the game.  I think they were a lot of like epic battles between them.  I'm just really happy now.  I faced everyone in the top 10 and the top players.  I feel like it's getting -- I'm getting closer and closer.  So that's the positive part.   
For sure if I will keep working hard and just improve a little bit here and there and also the head, most important situations, it can go well.   
I'm trying to take the positive also from today.   
 Q.  What would you like to improve on?  Anything specific?  
BELINDA BENCIC: On everything, starting with the serve, with just a little bit more fitness, to be more fit, defensive game, offensive game.  Just everything.  Small details is what matters.   
 Q.  You said you feel like you're getting closer.  What are you most proud of from the start of the season?  
BELINDA BENCIC: Well, I'm proud of I give everything in every single practice and every single match.  So that's really what I want to do this year.   
And then for sure I can go much far.  I have to put the effort in really everything what I do.  If it's fitness session or a practice session, I really always have to give 100%.   
 Q.  You beat Serena last year.  What advice would you give Maria to try to beat her if she plays her?  
BELINDA BENCIC: I don't think I'm in the position to give Maria any advice.  I mean, she's such a champion.  Obviously Serena, too.   
So, I mean, Serena didn't win yet, first of all.  It will be also a tough match.  Yeah, I'm definitely gonna be watching and learning.
