THE MODERATOR: Questions for Belinda, please.   
 Q.  Congratulations on the win two weeks ago.  How do you feel about getting into the top ten?  
BELINDA BENCIC: Well, of course I'm very pleased to be in the top ten.  It's a dream come true for sure.  I've worked very hard for this and I finally reach it and kind of relax me a little bit.  I'm just enjoying to have this status to see myself as a No. 7 and, yeah.   
 Q.  So because of top ten, is your mindset or approach any different for this tournament, or how about preparation for tournament or mindset?  
BELINDA BENCIC: No, I'm just preparing the same as normal.  If your No. 11 or No.7, doesn't change your tennis.  Try to do everything the same.  Try to win as much matches as possible and happy about I reached the top ten.   
 Q.  Could you talk about your first game, your first opponent in this tournament?  
BELINDA BENCIC: It's Kirsten Flipkins or Coco.  They will play tomorrow and for sure I will watch this match.  Little bit opposite style of players.  We'll see who wins.   
I mean for me, doesn't matter I just try to focus on myself and have some more practice here and feel good for my first match.   
 Q.  Can you speak about Melanie Molitor influencing your game?  
BELINDA BENCIC: Yeah, she's been like the biggest influence of my game.  She taught me everything that I can.  She was very first coach and, yeah, technically she's brought me really to the highest level.  I feel like if I do the things she tells me to do, I can really reach it far.   
I always feel good practicing with her.  It's tough week, tough days, but when I go to the tournament, it's always very good.  I play with confidence.   
Everything like her -- that she's really doesn't make compromises.  She doesn't tell you your so great.  She tells you the truth, and I think that's the best thing that can happen.   
If something is not right, she just tells you to your face.  You have to change it.  It's not like patting the shoulder all the time.   
 Q.  Could you talk to us about the courts and the conditions here.  How do you find them?  
BELINDA BENCIC: Yeah, usually it's supposed to be windy here.  Last year, as well.  But this year somehow it's not that windy, so I hope it stays like this.   
Yeah, the courts are okay.  The balls as well.  I feel quite good here, normal conditions.  I just hope to doesn't winds too much.   
 Q.  We have been always talking about new generations coming up and you're of course always the leader of top younger generations.  But if you look on Grand Slams nowadays, some veteran like Angelique or Pennetta won slams.  How do you see this kind of transition or new trend?  Do you feel like it's your time to win the title?  
BELINDA BENCIC: Relax.  I mean I just made the top ten.  We'll see.  I mean I don't feel the pressure now to have to win a Grand Slam.  I have lots of time.   
As you said, it's the older players winning the Grand Slam.  I just think it's the experience.  They've been there a lot of times, also the physical game, and just consistency to win seven matches in a row to win the title.   
I think it's a big step to win a Grand Slam.  Well done to Angelique in Australia.  Yeah, maybe now it's changing a little bit, but I still think it's impossible to win the Grand Slam when you're 16 nowadays, or 17, 18.  Yeah, we will see.
