J. BOSERUP/B. Bencic
  6‑4, 1‑0 [Ret.]

THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

Q. Can you just talk about the injury and when you started to feel it. 
BELINDA BENCIC: Yeah, it's my left wrist. I don't know what it is yet. It's nothing too serious. I think I have to get it checked. 
Started a couple of days ago. 

Q. Did it happen in practice you started to feel it or a match?
BELINDA BENCIC: Just ‑‑I don't know. It just came. 
Q. When you went on court, did you think you would be able to finish the match?
BELINDA BENCIC: Yeah, I always try to go on the court to see what happens and how I feel. It just wasn't enough. I cannot play like this against such a good player.

Q. Having played yesterday, from yesterday to today, how much time did you have to rest? Was it a tough turnaround?
BELINDA BENCIC: Well, it just got worse. That's why I had to retire. 

Q. Did you feel it a lot yesterday on court? Seemed like you were playing very well. Backhand seemed to be working okay. 
BELINDA BENCIC: Yeah, I mean, I didn't ‑‑it was for sure better than today. Today was just not possible. Yesterday obviously it was possible.
