S. WILLIAMS/B. Bencic
6-4, 6-3
Q. Were you pleased with at least the level that you were able to bring today in terms of what you were expecting?
BELINDA BENCIC: Yeah.  I was definitely not disappointed of how I played, but I knew that I played good.  But obviously it's not enough against Serena.  It's not enough to play just, like, not bad, so you really have to bring the best.
Yeah, I mean, I tried today, but it was not enough.  I think she was very focused and played good.
Q. You have obviously played her before, but did anything she do today surprise you?  Was there anything that was surprising to you from her level and what she was doing today?
BELINDA BENCIC: No, she was just playing very consistent and was doing everything a little bit better than me, I think.  I think she was very focused.  Yeah.
Q. What's your plan?  You're obviously in doubles.  What's your reaction to the first-round doubles draw?
BELINDA BENCIC: Amazing (smiling).  Yeah, it's very tricky to play No. 2 in singles and No. 1 in doubles, but I guess I will just -- we will go to the doubles and obviously fight.  Yeah.  There is nothing more I can say.
Q. When you play Kristina, are you able to check your friendship with her at the door, or does it creep up on court?
BELINDA BENCIC: No, I think when we were on the court, even if it was Hopman Cup, it was exhibition, we tried to totally destroy each other.  It's work.
On the court, I don't see my opponent.  I don't think about it.  It's basically my best friend.  Then we shake hands, and off the court and we are fine again.  I can do that really good, I think.  Yeah.  I think this is how it should be.
