B. BENCIC/T. Pironkova
  6‑2, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

Q. That must feel really good considering the grass court leadup you have had and missing all of the clay court season. 
BELINDA BENCIC: Yeah, that felt great. I mean, of course I didn't have a lot of match practice before. As you said, I didn't play on clay so much, but I always feel good on grass and I always feel good here.
I was confident that at some point my game will go all together, and that was the case today. I'm really so glad.

Q. You made a comment in the TV interview that you hope one day that this will be your court. Can you explain what you meant by that? 
BELINDA BENCIC: Well, I meant that this was the first time I played on it, and I felt incredible. So it's a good feeling. Obviously it's bad when you play the first time and you lose and you don't feel comfortable. So I hope to play many more times and maybe even bigger matches.
So it's a great feeling that the first time was so positive. So it will always be in my mind, and I hope to build up on that.

Q. And you would have seen a lot of great matches from your countrymen and countrywomen on that court before. 
BELINDA BENCIC: Yes, of course. I mean, it's basically Roger's court. Also that I played so well on it. I mean, it didn't surprise me. Like I expected it with the roof, especially. It suits my game perfectly. So theoretically I should play great. But, yeah, that I did today was amazing, yeah.
