THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What is your preparation? How do you feel you are heading into this tournament?
BELINDA BENCIC: Yeah, I think my preparation was pretty good. I played two tournaments before. I played in Shenzhen and Adelaide now. I feel pretty good.
I was really happy to get the wild card in Adelaide, to get some more matches. The preparation was good. Today I had my first practice here. So I feel pretty good.
I have a Tuesday start, so gives me even more time to practice.
Q. How did you find the conditions out there, the air? Obviously what's been going on with the fires in Australia, the smoke, all of that. I'm just wondering how it felt hitting outside today.
BELINDA BENCIC: Well, I just arrived yesterday actually. I was in Adelaide. There it was nothing. We didn't feel anything of the air. Obviously we know or we knew what was happening here during the quallies.
Today it was perfectly fine. I think I didn't feel anything.
Q. About your Aces for Bushfire Relief Double-Fault Tally. How is that going? Good or bad?
BELINDA BENCIC: It's going pretty good, if we talk about the donation for the bushfires. I'm doing a lot of double-faults, it's all good (smiling). Always in plan to donate as much as possible.
If it's not going to be enough, then maybe we can add the aces and put both together (smiling).
