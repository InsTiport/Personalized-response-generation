B. BENCIC/E. Alexandrova   
6-4, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How different did it feel like maybe playing this tournament with the success you had had a couple of weeks ago?  Do you feel that confidence just really infecting your game?  
BELINDA BENCIC: It didn't feel much different.  Obviously Dubai is now the past already, so no one cares about it anymore.  You play the next tournament.   
Yeah, you have to, you know, show your game again.  I definitely think the first round is always very difficult.  I was relieved to win it, because Alison was a tough opponent.  Today even more I felt better on the court.   
Yeah, it's just a new tournament.  You have to build up your tournament confidence again, and, like, get into the tournament.  So I think I did well in that.   
Now again, you know, I won two rounds.  You know, I'm good.  Now I'm playing against higher-ranked opponents or at least -- yeah, we'll see.  Definitely good players.  So I have nothing to lose again.   
 Q.  Yeah, you talk about Dubai is in the past, you're moving forward, but again, tournament confidence, as you phrased it, being able to back that up, get back into the round of 16, give yourself an opportunity for another deep run, it has to feel pretty good.  
BELINDA BENCIC: Yeah, I'm on a winning streak.  I think the match toughness is there, so even though when you're in close scores, you can be there, you believe in your game, and you can go for your shots more than when you're still trying to find your rhythm and you didn't play much.   
 Q.  Looking ahead, obviously we don't know who you'll play, but if it is Naomi, what is that opportunity?  How do you see that opportunity to play the No. 1, a player who is young, as well, and who has kind of risen while you have been slightly away?  
BELINDA BENCIC: No, definitely a big opportunity.  You know, I always like to play on the big courts, I like to play the big players.  I really enjoy that, and that's what I work for.  Definitely, she's a great player.  Also Collins is a great player.  So even today will be a good match.  I will definitely watch it.   
I'm just super happy to be on the big court at 6:00 p.m.  So yeah.   
 Q.  What do you make of Naomi's rise?  
BELINDA BENCIC: Well, you know, definitely, you know, it's inspiring, because we all -- as I said in Dubai already, we try to push each other.  One is doing well, so you're motivated to do well again.   
I think we are all, like, different players, but still, I think, the '97 generation, it's so strong.  And I think always one of us is doing well.  Sometimes, you know, the success, like, everybody has their own timing, you know.  So sometimes it takes longer; sometimes it takes faster.   
I think it's nice to have so many different girls that play different.  It's nice (smiling).   
 Q.  And then just in terms of Collins, she's -- well, she can play different types of tennis, depending on it, but what do you make of her, if that's the matchup for tomorrow?  
BELINDA BENCIC: I actually don't know her so well.  I never played her.  I just saw her run in Australian Open which was, yeah, was impressive.   
Yeah, but definitely, you know, it will be fun, as well, because she's American.  You know, the big crowd will be there.  They will definitely support her if she wins.   
Yeah, I'll try to look into that a little bit more later.   
 Q.  What flavor cheesecake did you have for your birthday?  
BELINDA BENCIC: Guess?   
 Q.  Are you a chocolate person?  
BELINDA BENCIC: No.  I mean, I am chocolate person but not in cakes.  Not in cakes and ice cream.  I like chocolate, you know, Swiss style, like Lindt, you know.  But I had red velvet one.  Yeah, it's really sweet, but it can never be too sweet.  (Laughter.)   
Actually I got one from Denise.  It was red velvet, which I love.
