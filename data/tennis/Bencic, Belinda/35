THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. 4-nothing lead in the tiebreaker.  She came back to win it.  How did you regroup and save your best tennis?
BELINDA BENCIC: Yeah, the first set was so frustrating because I had so many chances which I didn't convert.  I honestly didn't deserve to win this set because I didn't use my chances, and always when I was leading I was super tight.
I think it's normal after the injury to have this.  I mean, in the moment I was very frustrated, but, I mean, I had nothing left, just to fight and win the next two sets.  That's what I did.
Q. You want to make easy work out of your competitors in the first match, but it's good to be pressed a little bit and know you can turn things around.
BELINDA BENCIC: Yeah, I don't want to practice, so I practice in the match.  (Smiling.)
No.  I mean, it's good.  I didn't play a lot of matches, so I don't mind playing longer match.  For me, it's nothing.  I don't need to save energy now.  I didn't play for so long.
