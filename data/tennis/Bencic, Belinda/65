 B. BENCIC/C. Wozniacki
  3‑0 [ret.] 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   That's probably not the way that you wanted to reach the final.   Were you aware of any issues with Wozniacki early on?  
BELINDA BENCIC:   Well, definitely it's not the way I wanted to win, of course.   I'm also a little bit disappointed we couldn't play a proper final because of course all the people and everyone.   
I didn't know anything before the match.   Of course I also fell down a little bit yesterday, so I was more thinking of myself in that moment, so I didn't notice anything what she had.  
   
 Q.   I mean, you were strapping and your on‑court interview, you were fine, but...   
BELINDA BENCIC:   Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.   Just yesterday I had a little fall so it's prevention so nothing happens anymore.   Of course we look like really like she had something, and me, and, yeah.  
   
 Q.   When you had your fall yesterday, do you think it was a bad injury or...   
BELINDA BENCIC:   No, it was little painful in the beginning, but I think it's just a muscle like a little bit stretched, but I think it's normal thing with   tennis player.   
   
 Q.   Probably more the shock of a fall?  
BELINDA BENCIC:   Yeah.   But of course it's grass court tennis so you need to be careful.  
   
 Q.   Is it causing you pain when you're moving and twisting, the injury?  
BELINDA BENCIC:   Mine?   
   
 Q.   Yeah.   
BELINDA BENCIC:   Oh, no.  
   
 Q.   When you're moving.   
BELINDA BENCIC:   No, I'm fine.   Like I'm totally fine.   It's no pain.  
   
 Q.   When you came into the week, you must have had some targets in your head.   I don't suppose they included the final?  
BELINDA BENCIC:   No.   I actually saw the draw and I saw like Barthel first round, which is not easy.   Then Madison Keys second round.   I was like, okay.  
Now I am in the final, so I think it's a very good tournament for me.   I think I played a lot of good matches.   I'm very happy about it.  
   
 Q.   How do you feel about facing Agnieszka?   She's a former champion here.   She's playing really well.   
BELINDA BENCIC:   Yes.   I have never played her before.   She has a totally different style of play.  
I think it will be of course a real challenge, but I'm just super excited.   I've always watched her on TV, as well, and she has a very smart game.  
I hope I can play good tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   You say you watched TV.   Do you find it hard to play players you have watched growing up and coming through the juniors?  
BELINDA BENCIC:   No, it's not hard.   It's like dream come true.   It's very ‑‑ how do you say?   I'm very happy about it when I can face those players.  
   
 Q.   You mentioned Hingis has been helping you recently.   She was obviously a great grass court player.   What sort of tips and advice has she given you this week?  
BELINDA BENCIC:   Well, of course, based on the player I'm playing, so she really knows all of the players and gives me great advice and tactics, also, and also in my game.   
I'm also really happy about it.   Of course she played the semifinal today.   I'm happy she also found time to watch my match.  
   
 Q.   She was watching you yesterday.   Does that give you any extra motivation when you have someone of her caliber watching you?  
BELINDA BENCIC:   Yeah, definitely gives extra motivation.   Of course I can learn a lot from what she says.   I try to listen as much as I can.   I think I always play really good when she's in the box, so I'm very happy when she has time to come.  
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts ahead to Wimbledon?   What are your thoughts on the draw?  
BELINDA BENCIC:   Yeah, I'm facing Pironkova first round.   I saw it this morning.   I don't think about it too much now.   Of course it's not easy opponent.   She was in quarterfinals and in semis one time, so she can definitely play on grass.  
Yeah, I will just be ready and I hope I can win.  
   
 Q.   You seem to be taking quite well to the grass, though.   Is it a surface that suits your game?  
BELINDA BENCIC:   Yeah, yeah, definitely.   It's my favorite surface.   I really enjoy.   I play all of the tournaments, so I have a lot of matches on grass now, which I think is also advantage compared to the other players.  
   
 Q.   Swiss players seem to like grass a lot.   What is it about that?  
BELINDA BENCIC:   I don't know, because we actually don't have grass courts there.
