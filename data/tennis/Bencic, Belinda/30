THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How would you describe what turned around this match?
BELINDA BENCIC: Good question.  Tough question.  I'm not really sure what turned it around.  I guess just some key moments where I just stayed in the match and not let her go to, like, 1-3 in the second set.
Yeah, just some key moments, but I think I just really tried to fight till the end.  I think that turned it around.  Yeah, just some one, two points in the second set.
Q. How would you describe Alison?
BELINDA BENCIC: I think she was playing unbelievable.  I think the grass court suits her really well for her game.  I mean, it's just unbelievably tough to play her.
I mean, she's played well before on grass, you know, had some big wins.  I think every year she's playing good.  So she was a very tough opponent.  Today was very tough, yeah.
Q. What is your level of confidence as you proceed here at Wimbledon, and what are your thoughts looking ahead?
BELINDA BENCIC: Well, the confidence obviously goes up when you keep winning, and for sure it's bigger than before the first round.  So I feel like with every match you improve and you feel more confident and you just know what to expect, you know, when you go to the court.  I think that makes it easier.
Q. What do you consider your greatest strengths?
BELINDA BENCIC: I would say, how do you say, that I always keep playing.  You know, I complain, I'm frustrated, but I keep playing, keep fighting.  I would say that's my biggest strength, mentality.  It's my biggest weakness, but my biggest strength, too.
