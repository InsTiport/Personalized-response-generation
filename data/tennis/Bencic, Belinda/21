6-2, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Not an easy draw getting Anastasia in the first round.  Talk about the match?  How did it feel to get the Wimbledon grass under your feet?
BELINDA BENCIC: Yeah, definitely not easy first round, of course, because Anastasia, she's normally regularly seeded at slams, and just, like, top-20 player, for sure.  Not easy.
I was very focused.  I think it's very difficult for the first round, because every mistake you do is just punished, so you cannot do much in the first round.  You're not playing great always.
I think I played a good match, but I think I can still improve.  It was great obviously to play at Wimbledon, my lucky court.  I never lost there, I think, Court 18.  Yeah, it went well.
Q. How was Court 18 playing?  Is it playing the way that you remember it in the past?  There is a lot of discussion about the speed of the courts this year.
BELINDA BENCIC: Yeah, it's weird.  I also find it a little bit slower.  I think the grass is higher.  I mean, I don't really -- there is nothing I can do about it, so I'm not thinking about it.  I'm just, like, playing.  I think when you're playing, then you just get used to the speed of the court.
But, yeah, I remember, like, the serve was more effective the years before.  Now it's, like, everybody can return it just like on hard court.
Q. Looking ahead to Kaia, it doesn't get any easier still with the draw, but can you talk about the challenges of playing Kaia.
BELINDA BENCIC: Yeah, for sure.  I think she's a player that she's hitting very fast, the ball, and hitting very much.  So will be, yeah, also depending on her how she's gonna sleep and how she's gonna play.  But obviously I play very aggressive and do my game, so I think that also depends then how she's gonna play.
Yeah, for sure I'm ready about it, and we play the first time together.
