KENT KINNEAR:  I was trying real hard to get ready.  Obviously I really wanted to do well here and it is -- it is a little bit different game out there compared to the doubles and I just felt like I didn't really -- I don't know, I felt like I served okay, but maybe I missed a few too many first serves, but overall I don't think my service games was a problem.  I think mostly it was probably just a few volleys here and there that I missed on my returning games.  I was just missing a lot of backhands which is really weird because usually my backhand is my steadier side.  That kind of puzzled me a little bit out there why I was missing that many backhands.  And he pressures pretty well from the baseline.  I felt like I needed to force a little bit.  I think maybe I was just, I don't know, my backhand was just a little off and I was making too many errors.  
 

Q. Get psyched up now for doubles?
 
KENT KINNEAR:  Yeah, hopefully -- I heard we don't play tomorrow.  Hopefully we will get a good day of practice in  and come out on Wednesday ready to go.  
 

Q. Got any idea of how many of the home folks were here tonight?
 
KENT KINNEAR:  I don't know.  It was nice.  Obviously, it wasn't full out there. I heard a lot of support.  That felt good. 
 

Q. How many of the immediate family were family and friends?
 
KENT KINNEAR:  My parents, my sister and my brother and his family, so, that was nice. 
 

Q. Will you be allowed back in the house now?
 
KENT KINNEAR:  I don't know.  We will see.  I hope so.  They are pretty good about it.
