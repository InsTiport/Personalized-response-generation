Q.  Was it  a big letdown after such a big win?

GEORGE BASTL:  It's a loss.  That's it.  You know, in this  -- this sport, every time I walk on the court, it's a new match.  That's what makes it so interesting and just, you know, bad day at the office.

Q.  What are your memories now?  What are you going to take away from Wimbledon 2002?

GEORGE BASTL:  Well, I think I'll have more from Wednesday than from Friday.  That's for sure.

Q.  Did you, like, feel the pressure coming into this match, because  obviously you had more attention coming into this.  When you were against Sampras, people probably didn't give you much of a chance at all coming in like a loser.  Did you feel any pressure yourself?

GEORGE BASTL:  No, because it's, you know, as I said before it's another match.  It's another completely different opponent.  I have to give him a lot of credit.  He played a very good match very solid, and you know just  -- just the way it was.

Q.  And today, like, all three of you who hit the headlines two days ago have gone out.  Do you have anything to say about that?

GEORGE BASTL:  Well, we didn't plan to be in the headlines on Wednesday and just  -- you know, things happen like this.  I cannot give any reasons for that.
