CARL FOSTER:  Carl Foster with Leslie Allen, chairperson for the 2005 Federation Cup.  The draw party today.  Action starts on Saturday and Sunday.  The girls are already out there practicing this morning. 


Q.  Leslie, you played on the tour.  Now you're the chairperson of the Fed Cup.  How did this all come about? 

LESLIE ALLEN:  I think it was just a natural evolution from being a player, working on the corporate side, and when the opportunity came up to be participating in Fed Cup with our previous president, Alan Schwartz, I said, "Absolutely, I support you in your initiatives to grow the game of tennis, to get a wide variety of people involved in tennis.  Fed Cup was a natural area.  It's been a great run.  It's been very exciting.

Q.  As a former player yourself, how important is the Fed Cup to the players, playing for their country?  A lot of times, some of the players feel like it's a burden off their regular schedule.  Do the players today really want to play in this Fed Cup? 

LESLIE ALLEN:  I think the players really want to play.  They're hopeful that they're fit, that they're healthy.  It's just something very unique about a team situation.  There's a different kind of camaraderie.  If you look at our team, for the rest of the year, the people that are on the team that are your teammates, they're the people you're competing against.  Now you're competing with them.  It's such a unique situation.  You have a lot of fun together.  There's something very patriotic about waving the flag.  It's just exciting.
