 Q.  How did having Frank here contribute? 
 EUGÈNE LAPIERRE:  This was great.  More often than not, we have in Montréal a Canadian or a Quebecer doing good.  This time it was Frank.  I did not expect very much of him after he had that great result in Indianapolis because it's very difficult to confirm a good performance in a tournament, a win over Andy Roddick, reaching the final in Indy there.  I thought he would have a lot of pressure now in front of his crowd. 
 He showed so much character in each of his matches, especially the one against Verdasco where it was very windy, he was having a lot of problems.  He probably played the most terrible match of the tournament for him and he still came out a winner in that match.  It was a very impressive game. 
 Then everybody thought -- well, a lot of people thought, Listen, Nadal is going to crush him.  Let's hope he does a good showing, like 2-3 or something.  Then he goes out and takes the first set.  I mean, this was amazing. 
 If this match, the final, was probably the highest level of tennis that we've seen all week, the Friday night match against Nadal was probably the highest level, most emotional match we got all week.  It was crazy to see the crowd behind our player. 
 I tell you what, doesn't matter where Dancevic is from, he's not from Montreal, not from Quebec, but the Montrealers got behind him like he's a kid from around the corner here.  So it was great to see.
