   THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. When did you first incur the shoulder injury?
 SYBILLE BAMMER: Um, yesterday at my practice the first time, and this morning, when I was when I was warming up, after I shot, I couldn't continue, so... 

 Q. Have you had problems with the same shoulder before?
 SYBILLE BAMMER: No, first time that I have had problems with my shoulder.

 Q. What's your plan now? Miami, still? 
 SYBILLE BAMMER: Tonight, I make an MRI, and I will check my shoulder and I will rest and I hope I am fine for Miami.

 Q. How frustrating is it for you to have to pull out? You know, you beat Ivanovic in '07 when you had a good run into the quarters. 
 SYBILLE BAMMER: I'm very disappointed, because I was playing better and better. 
 Two years ago I beat Ana here, so it's frustrated for me. 

 Q. This is on a different topic, but Kim Clijsters is going to play Team Tennis, and Lindsay Davenport has apparently said Kim has contacted her about what it's like to travel with a child. Do you have any advice to offer her if she wanted to play more now that she's a mother? 
 SYBILLE BAMMER: No, I think everyone should do how everyone wants to do it. 

 Q. Roger's going to be a father this summer. If he drew you aside and said, Look, I need one tip, one hint, what's the key thing to being a parent while traveling the tour? 
 SYBILLE BAMMER: For me, since I'm mother, I have -- I feel more -- um, how is the English word? More confident and I think I'm stronger than before.

 Q. So it's been a plus? It's been rewarding to travel the circuit with your child? 
 SYBILLE BAMMER: Yeah. For me, it was advantage, because after the birth of Tina, my ranking was getting better and better. So for me, it helped me a lot.

 Q. So Roger doesn't have too many ranking points to go up, but do you think it will go up? 
 SYBILLE BAMMER: Um, well, I don't know. Maybe he win every tournament now. No, I'm joking. I think for him, it's no difference, because the woman makes the most work, I think.

 Q. He has great hands on court. Do you think he'd be good with diapers? 
 SYBILLE BAMMER: What about this? 

 Q. He has good hands on the tennis court. Do you think Roger would be good at diapers, at changing diapers? 
 SYBILLE BAMMER: Well, sure. I think he will do it, too. Why not? I think it's nice if he's doing it.
