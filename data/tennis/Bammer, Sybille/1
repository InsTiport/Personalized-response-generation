  7-5, 6-4 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. How would you rank today's win? Is it the best, second best, third best?   
 SYBILLE BAMMER: I won against her two years ago, or longer maybe. I was nervous today, so I don't know how I really played. I just tried to come into the rallies and make her play, and this worked.  
  
  Q. You were nervous just because it's her?   
 SYBILLE BAMMER: No, I didn't feel good on center court. It's different than Court 3, and it was first match on center court.   
 I didn't practice there before, and this was a little bit different. So I didn't feel so good.   
  
  Q. But you won.   
 SYBILLE BAMMER: Yeah. Doesn't matter how you feel, I gave my best and I'm happy that I won.  
  
  Q. Was there a stage in the match where you thought, okay, I've got a chance, you were getting into the match?   
 SYBILLE BAMMER: Well, at the beginning it was very close. Everyone hold the serve, and I had a couple times 40-15 on her serve and didn't make it.   
 I tried to hold my serve, and I was happy that I hold my serve every time after I didn't use the breakpoints.   
 Yeah, when I won the first set, I know if I'm ready and if I'm here, I can win.   
  
  Q. And you got to 5-2 and she sort of tee'd off and hit a few winners and broke you. What were you thinking then?   
 SYBILLE BAMMER: I know that Serena sometimes is down and then she, at the end, wins, so I tried to be focused on my game and tried to be calm and tried to be a little bit more aggressive.   
  
  Q. So does this kind of win mean a lot to you?   
 SYBILLE BAMMER: Of course. Always if I go on court I want to win. Sometimes I win and sometimes I don't, so I'm happy that today I won.   
  
  Q. Have you had a chance to speak to Kim much about being a mother on tour and the things that she'll have to go through?  
 SYBILLE BAMMER: Just some smalltalk, but not -- we didn't speak for a few minutes.   
  
  Q. I've seen your daughter in Indian Wells two years ago, I guess. She grows up?  
 SYBILLE BAMMER: Yeah.  
  
  Q. Does her presence help you a little bit when she's in the stadium?  
 SYBILLE BAMMER: Yeah, I like if she can travel with me, because then I don't think all the time about tennis. I think also on her, how is she feeling at home if I am not at home.  
 I feel better if she's with me at tournaments.  
  
  Q. Does she enjoy the matches?  
 SYBILLE BAMMER: Yeah.  
  
  Q. She was very happy when you were winning.   
 SYBILLE BAMMER: She enjoys, but she always wants me to play just two sets. (Laughter.)  
  
  Q. Can I ask you a few questions about your impressive match with Agnieszka Radwanska. Was it a surprise that you beat her first set 6-0?  
 SYBILLE BAMMER: Of course I was not expecting to win 6-0. I was a little bit surprised, and after I won 6-0 the first set I got a little bit tight because I was not expecting to win 6-0.   
  
  Q. Did you play with her in previous --  
 SYBILLE BAMMER: Yeah, this year in Sydney. I lost to her.  
  
  Q. What was the score between you?  
 SYBILLE BAMMER: I had no chance, but I don't know how I lost.   
  
  Q. And in this match, both players, you and her, had chances to break serve. You save nine breakpoints, and she saved four probably only. What do you say about her ability to finish the breakpoint?   
 SYBILLE BAMMER: It depends. I think sometimes I served very well on the breakpoints. I did a good slice to the body, and sometimes she was surprised that I go slice wide. I think on the breakpoints, most of the time my serve was solid.  
  
  Q. Do you feel that you can win this tournament over here after today's win?  
 SYBILLE BAMMER: I don't think so far I go around, and I'm happy that I won today.   
 Tomorrow is a different day. I hope I can win, too.
