THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How did you feel about your game today?  Are you happy with the way you played?  
JELENA OSTAPENKO: I mean, I didn't start the match really well.  But then during the match I think I was playing better and better.  Also the opponent, she was performing really well today.  It was hard for me.   
But I fought until the last point and I won it.   
 Q.  In the second set when she won the set, do you think she raised her level or you went away a bit yourself?  
JELENA OSTAPENKO: I think there were a couple of deciding points which I lost, then everything kind of went the other way.   
 Q.  Do you feel like you're one of the favorites here or not?  
JELENA OSTAPENKO: I mean, honestly I'm trying to not think about those things, just to focus on every match, try to show my best.   
 Q.  Your next opponent is Kontaveit.  What do you know about her?  
JELENA OSTAPENKO: I know her since juniors.  We played a couple of matches in juniors.  Actually we also won doubles, a 25K together.   
Yeah, she's a great player.  It's going to be a tough match.  I'm really looking forward to it.
