6-3, 7-5
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. First time on Centre Court, first time playing Venus.  What did you make of the experience?
JELENA OSTAPENKO: I mean, she was playing good today.  She was serving well.  I think I didn't start the match very well.  I was missing a little bit.  But, yeah, she was serving really well.  It was very tough to break.  Because of that I had more pressure because I had to keep my serve.
Q. What did Venus mean to you before this match?  What does she mean to you after this match?
JELENA OSTAPENKO: I mean, she's a great player.  It was also a good match today for me.  I wish I could play better because, I mean, I was not playing bad, but I was just not playing the way I wanted to play today.  I wasn't serving so well.
But I hope we'll play more matches and I can perform better.
Q. Had you ever been out on Centre Court before?
JELENA OSTAPENKO: No.  I was playing on Court 1 last year in mixed doubles.  But it was really nice to play on Centre Court.  A lot of people were watching.  I enjoyed it.  Hopefully I can play again there.
Q. Were you feeling nervous at the beginning of the match?
JELENA OSTAPENKO: I had kind of, like, some pressure because, as I said, she was serving really well today.  She started the match good.  She made a lot of aces.
But, yeah, I was not, like, feeling nervous.  I just couldn't really play my best today.
Q. Can you describe the challenge of playing a player who made their debut here in the same month that you were born 20 years ago.
JELENA OSTAPENKO: You mean Venus?
Q. Yes.
JELENA OSTAPENKO: As I say, she's a great player.  Of course, I wanted to show my best today.  But I think she played really well, as I said.  Because I was watching her first matches, like couple of matches this tournament, and I think every match she was playing better and better.  Especially she was serving very well today.
Q. Were you listening to music?
JELENA OSTAPENKO: Yeah, I was listening to music.
Q. Can you tell us what music?
JELENA OSTAPENKO: Just Russian pop music.
Q. Folk music?
JELENA OSTAPENKO: Pop music.
Q. Would we not know it?
JELENA OSTAPENKO: No, for sure not.
Q. Do you have any memories of Venus playing at Wimbledon when you were growing up watching TV?  Do you remember any finals she won here?
JELENA OSTAPENKO: Not really.  Maybe I was very small, or also I was watching more her sister playing the Grand Slam finals.
Q. After this amazing summer you had, what are your expectations heading into the American hard court season?
JELENA OSTAPENKO: I mean, it's good.  Last year I didn't get any points there, so I don't have to defend anything.  I just will try to play and not think about anything.  I'll just play as good as I can.
Q. Has your life changed after Paris or not?
JELENA OSTAPENKO: I mean, a little bit, yes, because other players, they know me better.  They prepare for every match against me.  For me it's a bit tougher because I have more pressure now.
Q. In your personal life?
JELENA OSTAPENKO: Yes, of course, I get more attention from everyone, yeah.
Q. On Venus, can you imagine playing at 37 here and reaching a semifinal?
JELENA OSTAPENKO: I mean, I think her best surface is grass court because she won I think five Grand Slams here.  It's one of her best surfaces.  I think she has pretty good chances to win this title, as well.
