V. AZARENKA/J. Ostapenko   
6-4, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
 Q.  What happened today?  
JELENA OSTAPENKO: In general, I think I didn't play my best match today.  But, of course, the opponent for the first round was, I think, one of the toughest in the draw.   
And I think I was rushing too much.  And also conditions were very tough.  It was super windy today.
