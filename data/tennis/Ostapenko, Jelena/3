THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Jelena, what was it like playing against Serena, doing so well against her?  
JELENA OSTAPENKO: I mean, as I said, she was my idol since I was growing up. I always watched her play. It's very special to play her and share the court with such a champion.   
I think today in deciding moments I could have played better. In general, it was a good match. I mean, to lose against Serena, it's like normal because she's such a great player.   
I just tried my best today and fought until the last point.   
 Q.  Jelena, you seemed to play so well during long stretches of the match. The tiebreakers seemed to get away from you. Did something seem different to you in the tiebreakers?  
JELENA OSTAPENKO: I think I was rushing a little bit too much. During the games, I was taking my time. In the tiebreak, it's 2-1 serving-wise, I was rushing a little bit too much. I didn't take my time. Probably that's why I was making, like, more unforced errors.   
 Q.  A lot of times you talk about how the atmosphere is different at Fed Cup versus every week. What are your thoughts on the crowd, the full stadium?  
JELENA OSTAPENKO: I mean, I expected something like this because obviously we're playing in the U.S. against U.S. It's normal, because when we play in Latvia, the crowd was also very loud.   
But I was just trying to not focus on that. I was just trying to fight and to play my best, to help my country to win.
