THE MODERATOR: Questions for Jelena Ostapenko, please.   
 Q.  You lost the title, but you've won so many hearts this week, the respect of all the other players.  How can you rate the tournament here in Doha?  
JELENA OSTAPENKO: It was great week for me here.  I won a lot of good players.   
But today was also a good match, but I didn't -- I had to maybe stay more consistent and not go for every shot.   
But she played good today.   
 Q.  Did she beat you with her experience?  
JELENA OSTAPENKO: Maybe, because she's almost 28 and I am still 18.  I hope more finals to come for me.   
 Q.  You asked on court about -- you're going to be top 40, I think?  
JELENA OSTAPENKO: I will be 41.   
 Q.  Still, it's huge.  You're very young and your reaction was, Yeah, but I want better.  Are you not happy?  
JELENA OSTAPENKO: Yeah, because I have a lot of things to improve.  If I improve, I can play much better than now.   
So I'm looking forward to go more up in the ranking.  My dream is to win one of the Grand Slams, so I hope I can do it one day.   
 Q.  Until today, what was the happiest moment of your career?  
JELENA OSTAPENKO: I mean, the winning of the junior Wimbledon and also the final here and the final in Quebec City.   
But the biggest probably here because it's such a huge and nice tournament, and I really like it here.   
 Q.  What do you think you should improve in your skills?  You just said you needed to improve.  
JELENA OSTAPENKO: Maybe I have to be more consistent on court and improve maybe my serve.   
 Q.  TV commentary basically said that you were going to buy your first car with the winnings this week.  Is that true and do you know which car?  
JELENA OSTAPENKO: I mean, I don't know yet.  I decide when I come home.  I didn't think about that yet.   
 Q.  Congratulations.  Your performance was amazing all the championship.  It seems to be some nerves today?  You were nervous?  
JELENA OSTAPENKO: Yeah, I mean, I won the first set 6-1.  I played really good in the first set.  Then I was like 2-1 up and then 3-2 up.  Then I lost my serve I think.   
Then was, like, yeah, was a bit nervous.   
But still she played good today.   
 Q.  On the court you said getting in the top 50 just first step for you.  And you said of course your dream is winning Grand Slams.  What do you think the second step is for you?  
JELENA OSTAPENKO: I mean, it's not the first step, but it's one of the steps because first step was like to go through the juniors.   
I mean, just to improve and play all the Grand Slams as good as I can, and play the Olympics.  I hope I got to the Olympics.  It was my goal for this year because the Olympics, they are just once in four years, so it's nice to play.
