Q.  Anna, in the first set Chanda was serving 5-4, you managed to break her and won four games in a row.  You had some momentum, what sort of happened there?  Did she left lift her game or maybe you came down a little?

ANNA SMASHNOVA: I was just trying to play every point, one point at a time.  And I think she went for her shots and she didn't make them as well as she did before.  That's what happened.


Q.  In the last game --

ANNA SMASHNOVA: Yes.


Q.  -- you were down Love-30 and she missed a couple of easy overheads, did you consider lobbing up another one for her?

ANNA SMASHNOVA: Well, I did.  I did lob another one and then she win, so...


Q.  Did you ever think at some point you were in control of the match?

ANNA SMASHNOVA: In control of the match? Yeah, definitely.


Q.  In the third?

ANNA SMASHNOVA: Also in the second.  I was 7-5 up, 2-Love up 40-30 up serving, I mean, I was up.


Q.  How much difference do you think there is right now?  We've seen a lot of seeds fall today, how much difference is there between say the number 15 to 20 player in the world down where you're ranked at 50?

ANNA SMASHNOVA: Difference between 20 and 40, I mean, it's not that big of a difference.  I mean, player No. 40 can beat player No. 20.  I mean, one player can do well in this tournament and No. 40 can get to No. 25.  I mean, it's not that big a difference.   I mean, it is difference definitely, but not that big.


Q.  What do you think the difference was today in the match?

ANNA SMASHNOVA: Difference today?  I think we were, more or less, the same.  I mean, it was a tough match and she played really well.  She really got into the third set.  She made a few really good points. It's a matter of a few points.
