THE MODERATOR:  First question.  
 
 
Q.  Does this come down to Lindsay's power, this match?  Did she just overpower you?
 
ANNA SMASHNOVA:  I think she played really well today.  She played well on the important points.  She served well.  She hit well.  She looked like she was really into it today.  
 
Q.  How about the heat?
 
ANNA SMASHNOVA:  I was not really thinking about that.  I think it was for both of us the same situation.  
 
Q.  Have you played in these conditions very often? 
 
ANNA SMASHNOVA:  In Australia it's pretty hot, in the States.  Yeah, I mean, not that often, but we do get to play in these conditions so we're kind of used to it, we know what to expect.  
 
Q.  Did you feel a great amount of pressure? 
 
ANNA SMASHNOVA:  Pressure for... my team?  No, I was just playing - like another match.  
 
Q.  Does Lindsay look any less of a player for having been off for nine months?
 
ANNA SMASHNOVA:  Well, not today.  She obviously played really good match today.  
 
Q.  What did you like about your game? 
 
ANNA SMASHNOVA:  Today or in general?  
 
Q.  Today. 
 
ANNA SMASHNOVA:  I think I was fast.  I was not fast enough to beat Lindsay today, but I was fast.  And my serve was good.  I obviously was not good enough to beat her but...  It's not for me to judge.  I mean, it has to be other people who judge my game.  
 
Q.  You broke her serve twice.  Did you think at that point that there was an opportunity for you to work your way back in? 
 
ANNA SMASHNOVA:  I think in women's tennis now the serve is really not that important as maybe man's.  I was just playing game by game.  She broke me; I broke her.  
 
Q.  (Question referring to what Anna was thinking)?
 
ANNA SMASHNOVA:  I was just trying to stay in the match and still believing until the very last point that anything could happen.  
 
Q.  You didn't go up to the chair umpire, but it seemed like you were questioning maybe some of the line calls. 
 
ANNA SMASHNOVA:  No, the linesmen and the umpire, I think they saw it better than I did.
