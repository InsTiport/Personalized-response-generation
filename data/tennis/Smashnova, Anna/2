THE MODERATOR:  First question, please. 


Q.  How do you feel you played today?

ANNA SMASHNOVA:  I think it was a very good match today.  It was very tight first set.  I had a few game points to go 5-all, but Monica played really well. 

Q.  Did she do anything specifically different in the second set? 

ANNA SMASHNOVA:  I think the second set was not as close in the score, but it was a close set.  I had a lot of break points, game points, and I didn't make any of it. 

Q.  Did you have a different strategy going in?

ANNA SMASHNOVA:  I just tried to play my game today, and I played quite good I think.  But Monica played better. 

Q.  Was fatigue a factor at all? 

ANNA SMASHNOVA:  I think I did get a little bit tired, but Monica also got tired.  She was the one leading, so it's easier to maybe keep tiredness when you're winning than when you're losing.  Plus, I was making more running than her because my game is more to run than hit winners.

Q.  What was your game plan going into the match today? 

ANNA SMASHNOVA:  Like I said, I just try to play my game. 

Q.  Your first service game in the second set, you had ad in and double-faulted twice in a row right there.  Was that a key turning point for you there?

ANNA SMASHNOVA:  No, I wouldn't say that.  I don't think so. 

Q.  Is this your first visit to the American midwest?  If so, How do you feel about it?

ANNA SMASHNOVA:  I had a very good hospitality here and I enjoyed my week very much.  Also, I didn't get to see much of springfield, but I did enjoy my stay here. 

Q.  What do you think about this American team?  Now it's back in the World Group.  I mean, is this a team that should be the top team in the world, do you think?

ANNA SMASHNOVA:  I think American team is one of the best teams in the world - if not the best.
