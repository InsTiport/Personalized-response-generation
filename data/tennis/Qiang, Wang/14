6-2, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions in Chinese.
Q. Would you please assess your performance.
WANG QIANG: The score looked pretty bad, but I enjoyed the process because I learned something great from my opponent.
Q. Can you be more specific?  Skills of your opponent or 84 going to get stronger?
WANG QIANG: From a perspective of attitude or mentality, I improved.  She's one of the top-10 players in the world.  It's a great chance for me to improve.
She sets a really good example.
Q. What are you going to try to work on, your serve?  Your opponent was diversified in her skills.
WANG QIANG: Yes, I should improve my serve, and how could I deal with the lower balls, different variations.
Q. Can you talk about your achievements this year.
WANG QIANG: It's really hard to say.  I moved up in the rankings.  I increased my contact with top players.  I've become much more professional.  That's my feeling.
Q. In China tennis is growing rapidly.  You are receiving wild cards.  The strength in the competition is really strong.  In the first round of the China Open, it's like the second round in Grand Slams.  You are getting more opportunities, and pasted qualifications.  In Beijing and Wuhan, the difficulty in the first match is similar too that in the second round of a Grand Slam.  How do you feel about the new opportunities?
WANG QIANG: In front of all the qualifications, I find that I have to play as hard as I participate in the Grand Slams.  It's a rare opportunity because I could meet so many great players.  In China the pressure is limited.
