KNOWLE-MELZER/Melo-Sa
  6-4, 7-5

 THE MODERATOR: Questions. 

 Q. Could you go over your match. 6-4, 7-5. How did you go for you? 
 JULIAN KNOWLE: It was a close match. We saved I think three breakpoints at 2-All or 3-All in the first set. Then it was one break in the first set. We were up a break in the second. Got broken back immediately. Could have gone either way. We were very happy to be in the finals. 
 I think we deserved to win. 

 Q. Beating the defending champions, does that give you momentum? 
 JURGEN MELZER: It's always nice to beat the defending champions because you know that they feel comfortable here if they won the year before. 
 For us it's been really important to get some matches this week coming into the Open. Playing the finalist the week before, cannot get any better than that. 

 Q. Have you played here before? 
 JURGEN MELZER: Yeah. 
 JULIAN KNOWLE: Couple of times. 

 Q. As far as the Open goes, the more matches you play helps you prepare. Being in the final, does that get you prepared for the Open?
 JULIAN KNOWLE: Well, yeah. I think matches is the best practice. Especially for me, I haven't had a lot of matches lately. It's my first tournament here in the States in the summer. So it's huge for me, also for us as a team, to get four matches here. 
 I think we played so far three really good ones and hopefully one more is coming tomorrow. 

 Q. Indoors, did that affect your game at all? Was there any concern about that? 
 JURGEN MELZER: I think we both don't mind playing indoors. It's something we grew up with. We have a lot of indoor courts in Austria. It's always easy to come from outdoors to indoors than the other way around.
