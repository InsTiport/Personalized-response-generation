  3-6, 6-7, 7-6, 7-5, 9-7

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. How is your body and your wrist after five sets? 
 NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO: The wrist, okay. Body, I don't know. (Smiling.)
 Really that's was I take now one hour. Normally I go to press after, you know, finish match in ten minutes, straight.
 But now, I say to ATP, I need one hour maximum because I need treatment. That's was I delayed. I need treatment more and more, a little bit painful muscles, tight. I need to rehabilitation a little bit.

 Q. I will ask you about the Davis Cup. Will you play? 
 NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO: Yeah, I will play. If I'm not injury one more time. 
 But I will play, yes.

 Q. What do you think about the match against Argentina?
 NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO: I don't know. Depends who's play there. I don't know really players now in the moment. 
 We coming there like say for practicing already like, and before Davis Cup we know who coming. Already we check who be No. 1 or 2 and who play singles.

 Q. Nalbandian said that he will play. 
 NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO: Perfect. It's be good. That's was I really enjoy play against Nalbandian.

 Q. If you want to tell me the percentage of chance to win in this match. 
 NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO: You know, we have good team also. Not bad. I know Andreev and Tursunov is still, you know, just -- like say not injury, but just coming back, like me.
 But Youzhny and me, for sure we have good shape. We'll try, you know, beat Argentina in Moscow. Because I think it's be hardcourt, not so fast, but not so -- you know, normal like was we play in I think Moscow, Kremlin Cup tournament. 
 Yeah, I think we need preparation also after grass court. But I hope we be everything okay. I hope give me more confidence after Wimbledon coming to Davis Cup and play five-set matches.

 Q. Do you like to play Argentina or...
 NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO: In Argentina or in Russia? 

 Q. Anywhere. 
 NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO: You mean against Argentinian guys? 

 Q. Yeah. 
 NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO: I really enjoy. Why not? I enjoy play against Nalbandian, Chela, Del Potro. Nice guys, and really we have good tennis.
