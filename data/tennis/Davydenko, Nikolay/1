THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Can you tell us what happened out there?  
NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO:   Normally I don't want to tell.   You should ask doctor, physio.   
Can explain I just was sick.   
   
 Q.   So you were feeling sick before the match?  
NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO:   I feel already like from Monday I was sick, but it was my feeling it increase.   I start not feel good yesterday.   
My match yesterday, I was lucky I hold my match.   And today he play well.   You know, I just want to see how he will play.   But second game was very tough for me.   I cannot hold.   He just play long rally and I cannot hold this level.   
I know I cannot hold all my match.   That's why I decide to stop already before.   I for sure feel not better.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel you should feel better by next week?  
NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO:   I don't know.   Doctor can give me something, antibiotics.   If I can take, then there will be no chance to play Cincinnati.   I will be waiting if it will be better.   
For sure it will be better for US Open, but I don't know for Cincinnati.   
   
 Q.   What were the symptoms?   
NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO:   Bronchitis, okay?
