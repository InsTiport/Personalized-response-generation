 N. DAVYDENKO/M. Cilic
  7-5, 7-5 
   
  Q. You finally get a win here in Beijing. It was a tough match?  
 NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO: Yeah, it was very good match for me, because today, couple things, I didn't good play just like I have not so good first serve, but baseline was good control and play fast, and I think it's only was one chance of winning today.  
  
  Q. How does this help your confidence to come here and play as well as you did? Maybe a few things to work on for the next match, but confidence-wise, how are you feeling?  
 NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO: Yes, I just change racquet, and it's my second tournament and really start from zero.   
 It's just take -- just enjoy tennis, and if I win I enjoy more and have good result and feel good.  
  
  Q. How difficult is it when you change racquets? How much of an adjustment do you have to make?  
 NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO: Just make it mentally, for sure, different feeling and need to maybe play differently, but I run the same, fast, and just need to control.  
  
  Q. Next round you've got Isner. I know you've beaten him in the past. He's improved quite a lot since you've played him. What do you think about that match?  
 NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO: I know like a big guy, like good serve but not play so good baseline. Isner is different. Surprisingly he play also baseline and always have -- first serve is pretty fast and good, and for sure he always try to returning and play baseline, make points there. For me I think it's good, and I really try to enjoy it.
