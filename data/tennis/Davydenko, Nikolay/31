 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. What happened out there today?
 NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO: Where? 

 Q. On the court?
 NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO: Something happen? (laughter.)
 Retired. Just some muscle problem, like groin muscle maybe. We don't know yet. I can't explain. Was okay, play first, second set, but I'm moving, you know, well. Have some, after second set -- I think in the middle second set I feel I really have some painful in the muscle, and every point I have more and more pain. 
 That's was -- I need to do something, and I call physio, just thinking, what is wrong? I really don't know, big injury or small injury? 
 And physios also cannot tell me anything. I need some MRI, something to check my muscle. Don't know yet.

 Q. Which muscle, lower leg? Upper leg? 
 NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO: Which muscle? 

 Q. I mean what area of your leg? 
 NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO: Oh, I don't know how say in English. 
 THE MODERATOR: Thigh? 
 NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO: Yeah, left.
 THE MODERATOR: Left thigh.

 Q. Left thigh? Are you getting any more tests on it, MRI or something?
 NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO: Not here. I gonna go home today or tomorrow, and I do at home.

 Q. Even though tennis had no finding of anything wrong, anything in the way of wrongdoing with you with that match in Sopot, do you feel as though when you pull out of a tournament with injury there's more attention to it than with other players?
 NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO: I really don't care. For me, I really don't care now. I do my way, and if I have injury, I don't want to finish my match. 
 You know, if I feel like I don't finish, I don't finish. I stop it, like today. I really -- doesn't matter what happen in Sopot. I don't know what's happening now. I really don't care anymore. 

 Q. To what degree do you think what happened then affects how you're perceived by people in the tennis world today?
 NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO: For me, it's very difficult question, so I have no answer now for these questions. 
 Just everybody play tennis. I don't know what can be out of tennis, you know. For me, it's -- I don't know. For me it's not interesting.

 Q. Has that whole episode caused you to do anything at all differently in terms of the way you conduct yourself or the precautions that you take?
 NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO: Can you translate me in Russian? 
 THE MODERATOR: No. 
 NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO: Somebody? 

 Q. I'll make it an easier question perhaps. 
 NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO: Yeah.

 Q. Has that whole episode, what happened there, all of the attention, the investigation, caused you to do anything differently in your life?
 NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO: It's already a last -- like, you know, I don't know who can answer me these questions. You know, tell me these questions before tournament somewhere I go. 
 I don't talk about this in already a long time, you know, and I don't want to talk anymore. That's was, for me, this questions, no answer them.
