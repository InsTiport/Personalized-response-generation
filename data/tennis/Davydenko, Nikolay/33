 THE MODERATOR: Questions.   
  
  Q. Given that you're one of the top players in the world, how do you feel having to play on an outside court today?  
 NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO: It's was good because first round, really difficult. I didn't know by self if I play good or not because first match after three months. I really enjoyed.   
 Court 2 is also not so small. Okay, I don't play at Court 9, it's already much better. But tomorrow I think playing against Nalbandian, have Court No. 1.  
  
  Q. How do you feel your clay court form is now?  
 NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO: I don't know what I need to say because, you know, it's not like about clay court or hard court, it's just starting, you know. From me, was starting tournament now. My season start from Monte-Carlo, not from Australia Open.   
 I think every match if I win is good for me, very good for the futures, for the next, next tournaments.  
  
  Q. Do you feel ready for a top guy like Nalbandian?  
 NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO: I think so. I really don't know because, I don't know, I didn't see how play in three months. You know, I don't know what is tennis change now. We'll see tomorrow how guys playing. For me is very interesting.
