Q.  Can you give us some forecast about your semifinal?  Nalbandian is a little bit better on this surface. 
 
NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO:  Yeah, okay, I tell about Nalbandian.  For me priority also semifinal play against Nalbandian because I was surprising he beat so easy Ljubicic.  Yesterday he play very well, because I think he was the best match for Nalbandian.  I see all match, he was in good control, play from baseline.  He returning everything.  I was surprising.  But Ljubicic I think not so good concentration with match.  I think he was most only from serving, try to make only first serve and make winners.  But Nalbandian to do everything, to make good control and to win match.  For me also tomorrow important, also like Nalbandian to good control from baseline.  I think if the ball guy to play from baseline should be to find who should be better tomorrow.  
 
Q.  Why were the games so easy today?  Do you feel you are lucky?
 
NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO:  You know, okay, it's like a group because Nadal and Agassi is not playing here.  But easy today?  It was not so easy.  First set started Puerta play very well.  I was surprising he play fast.  In this surface he was normal.  But he make some few mistake and easy mistake, and I was break back.  Also the second set, he play some few points, you know, not concentration.  For me was easy to win games for returning and then keep my serve only and to win match.
