   THE MODERATOR:  Questions?   
  
  Q.  A good start over a player that's been in form.  Must be pleased with your win.   
 NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO:  I don't want to say like I be just perfect for the first round, but this was great to win in three sets.   
  
  Q.  What pleased you most about the match?   
 NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO:  It was most difficult to control baseline.  It was pretty windy.  But, you know, try, you know, my best to control.  Doesn't matter what's happen on the court, and try to do, you know, how possible to win match.   
  
  Q.  Normally you have a lot of five-set matches.  Must have been pleasing to go through in straight sets.   
 NIKOLAY DAVYDENKO:  You know, like, okay, in three sets is much easier to win.  But we play almost two hours.  Five-set matches can be more and more.   
 You know, just for me good finishing, you know, in two hours.
