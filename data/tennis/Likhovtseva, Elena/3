ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: I don't think there were any secrets. It's just that I tried to be concentrated and I think she didn't have a good day today tennis-wise. I just -- I played the first set, I won it. Then I just found it was better with my rhythm and I guess she was still struggling till the end of the match. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: Yeah. Well, my coach, he told me that I have to be -- I have to be aggressive with Kim because otherwise she will put so much pressure in me. So I just tried to take any chances, you know, and just go down the line and make her run. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: I didn't really think about it. I was just thinking about one point at a time and just, you know, that I have to play it. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: Oh, no, I didn't think about that, no, no. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: Yeah. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: Well, against Lindsay it's always tough. And I think, you know, she's -- I just knew I had my chance today, so I took it. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: No. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: No. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: Oh, is it? 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: That's why they put her there. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: So now they have another one. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: Yes. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: I feel maybe more confident, because I've been struggling since the beginning of the year. Especially in the beginning, first few months, I didn't win many matches. I've been struggling. Then it just started to work. I knew it was coming because I had a few close matches through when I played in Europe and when I played at Roland Garros. If it wouldn't come here, then it would be somewhere else. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: Yeah, well, she played really good there. And I didn't -- I couldn't do much about that. But I played good matches before that and, you know, just that she played good. Today she didn't. Or maybe I played better. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: Yes, I guess so. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: I don't know. It's like I knew that she's not going to go down the line with her forehand many times. She likes it more cross-court. And she has this hook, you know. And she always, most of the time, goes cross court. It was easy for me. I was just concentrating on trying to return her serve and try and make the deep returns. She was struggling with her forehand a lot. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: I did I guess, yep. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: I played her last round of qualifying in Eastbourne and I won 7-5, 7-6 against her. She's a good player. She's young. I know she serves good, and she can play good. But she's still -- she has a lot of unforced errors. And I guess she a bit struggles under the pressure. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: Yeah, the bigger the better. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: Yes, I played. Centre Court is nice, Centre Court is very nice. I like it better than Court 1. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: I guess she's from Ukraine, and I don't really follow football. But my husband knows his name, so... He's pretty popular, I think.
