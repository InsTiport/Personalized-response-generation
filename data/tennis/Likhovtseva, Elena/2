ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: Well, second set, I think I started to play a little bit, like, more relaxed, you know, than the first set because I was kind of -- I wasn't nervous, but it's tough to get rhythm with her. She was, you know, she was hitting good returns, and then, like, she didn't give me the rhythm. I struggle with my serve. Then the second set, I played a little bit more relaxed, and I guess she started to, you know, she just wanted to hit winners. Then all of a sudden, she started to make a lot of unforced errors. I had chances. So second set, I won. I think I had a lot of chances in the third set as well, you know. 40-love on my serve in the second game. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: Yeah, I had it for a while. I felt it was better than before, but, you know, during the match, I aggravated more so. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: Yeah, it just was support, yeah. It's more like my knee and my hamstring, so... But it was nothing. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: Yeah, I guess so. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: Yeah. I wanted to win also, you know. I felt like I could win. That's what, you know, some people, like Serena, she fights till the end. I also tried to fight till the end, but somehow I get tight so... And, you know, I think that Serena needs more matches because this is like her second match this year so... But she still, she fights till the end. You see her, she wants to win. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: Yeah. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: No, not really. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: Yeah, I think so. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: More unforced errors, and, you know, like she -- yeah, she did the easy mistakes. Not as consistent, I guess. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: Yeah, she's a little bit -- kind of she doesn't know where to expect the ball sometimes. I think when my serve was pretty good, then I caught her sometimes off guard, you know, served a few aces. So she wasn't ready for that. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: Yes. I guess once she kind of ready for the return, she has special like I guess backhand, she's ready for this. Then she just go through and she comes forward. That's her best shot so... 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: It is a little bit intimidating for me, like, to o, because she's a great player. But about the looks and stuff, I like how, you know, how she dresses. You know, we see it all in the locker room. So I know what to be prepared for, so... It's all right. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: You mean this match or...? 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: I think, I mean, I think Serena is not in her best form now. So I think, yeah, if I would play my good tennis, best tennis, I would win this match. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: No, it's the thing that I, you know -- it's kind of -- it's tough. I try to somehow fight it, you know (smiling). I struggle with it, and I try to overcome it. 

ELENA LIKHOVTSEVA: Yeah, it's Serena, it's center court, but, yeah, it's not like just about this. It's like when you think about that you can win, then sometimes it overwhelms you, you know? It's, like, it's different.
