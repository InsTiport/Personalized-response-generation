THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Why here at the US Open have you done well, after this injury absence?  
PABLO ANDUJAR: Probably because I have been playing better and better. My level of tennis have been improving also during this years. Of course, because the first round was very tough for me against Kyle. I played a good match.   
To have a reason, probably it's my level of game that improved. I didn't play top, top guys after in the second and third round. Yeah, that's the only reason, that I improved. I kind of tried to improve my game on these surfaces.   
 Q.  You played one hard court final in Winston.  
PABLO ANDUJAR: Yes. As I said, I have always believed that my game could fit in these kind of surfaces, but it's also true that I don't play a lot on hard court. I mostly base my calendar on clay court tournaments.   
Both reasons: don't play so much and my level of game has been always better on clay.   
 Q.  What was the worst point during these two years? Have you ever thought to give up?  
PABLO ANDUJAR: I think the worst moment was when I made the second surgery. After the first I try to come back. Although it was hurting, it was not so, so bad as after the second. The second we thought after surgery was going to be fast, a fast recovery, everything was going to be better. Actually, it was worse. It was pretty bad. It was hurting quite a lot.   
That's when mentally I was a little bit more down, yeah.
