An interview with:
PIERRE-HUGUES HERBERT
NICOLAS MAHUT
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. I'm interested in how important you see psychology within tennis.
PIERRE-HUGUES HERBERT: I don't know.  A lot of things happen in the head.  We had the proof today.  We had the dream match, 6-3, 5-3, serving for the match, 30-Love, 40-30, two match points.
You don't know why.  You're serving, and from one second to the other you're not there anymore.  You're making three double-faults in one game, then the others come back.  They see it, they get confident and they play better and better.  At the end you lose.
I think the head is really, really important, and that's where the best are really, really good.
