  BOLELLI-FOGNINI/Mahut-Herbert  6-4, 6-4  An interview with:  NICOLAS MAHUT  PIERRE-HUGUES HERBERT   THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   Q.  What went wrong from your side?  PIERRE-HUGUES HERBERT: What went wrong?  I had a small problem starting the match, before the match.  Twenty minutes before the match I felt a big pain in - I don't know how to say.  I was bleeding by -- I had a problem.  I felt sick 20 minutes before.  I don't know if it's because was a final or if it was because anything.  But after this I took some medicine because I couldn't almost run or anything.  I was really in pain.  And when I started the match I felt dizzy the whole match.  I had the feeling, yeah, it was maybe the worst minutes of my tennis career because I wanted to do everything for my partner, for everybody who was expecting something.  And actually I couldn't be 100%.  Yeah, maybe the worst minutes of my life on court because, yeah, so much pressure, and I couldn't react.   Q.  So probably you play 50% or something like that?  PIERRE-HUGUES HERBERT: No, no, no.   NICOLAS MAHUT: All the credit...   PIERRE-HUGUES HERBERT: All the credit to the Italians who played really good.  But the fact is for me inside it was really hard, because I got the feeling it go so fast at this level.  We had an unbelievable team against us and they played a really good match.  But in the important moments, you have to be 100%, and I didn't have this feeling today, yeah.  All the credit to them.  And I felt really bad for Nico because I felt he made a great match and he played really well, and I was just not at my level.   Q.  The ball in the first game of the second set.  You touched the ball three times, I think.  NICOLAS MAHUT: Maybe four, I don't know.  Sometimes it happens when it's coming really fast.  I tried to put the ball on the court.  I don't know if only one player can touch the ball twice in the frame and put the ball on court.  So I just tried to but the ball.  It's true, it hit the frame twice.  So umpire have to see this, but didn't change anything. Other question?
