 N. ALMAGRO/N. Mahut
  7‑6, 6‑3 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English.  
   
 Q.   If I were to ask you to bet today who would end their career with more Grand Slam championships, Nadal or Federer, who would you bet?  
NICOLAS MAHUT:   It's 17‑12?   
   
 Q.   17‑13.   
NICOLAS MAHUT:   Depends how much I have to bet.   
   
 Q.    200?  
NICOLAS MAHUT:   If it's  200 I would say Nadal.   
   
 Q.   Why?  
NICOLAS MAHUT:   I think he will win at least two French Opens, which is 15.   Then if he can win US Open or maybe not Wimbledon because of his knee, maybe Australian Open, then he will be close.   
Roger has to win one this year, so I would say Nadal.   
   
 Q.   How about  1 million?  
NICOLAS MAHUT:   I would say Federer.   
   
 Q.   Why?  
NICOLAS MAHUT:   You never know.   Rafa has a knee injury, he doesn't win, it's tough to win four or five.   Maybe Roger is going to win Wimbledon this year, then would be 18‑13.   You have the answer.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French.   
   
 Q.   Of course, you played a clay‑court specialist.   Are you disappointed by the point in the first set and do you believe you played good tennis and it's a good sign?   
NICOLAS MAHUT:   Yes, it's a good sign.   Of course, my past results on clay are not in my favor, but after 10 days playing on this surface I feel good.   I was able to play a good match.   
But winning is another story.   In the first set I believe I deserved better.   I made a good return at 4‑3.   After that, when you're down a set, it's always more difficult.   I would have needed to serve better if I was going to play a third set.   
But, anyway, during this match my intentions were clear.   I did what I wanted to do.   As you said, he's one of the best on clay.   I still need to work a lot more.   
   
 Q.   Today the conditions were not good for aggressive players.   
NICOLAS MAHUT:   Well, I played a bit later today.   But, indeed, the conditions today were not favorable for being aggressive.   But I know if I had served better, I might have had a chance to win.   
The conditions were not as good as yesterday.   But I believe he was bothered by the wind, too.   I'm losing something on one hand but gaining something on the other.   
I think he likes, too, when the clay is fast.   
   
 Q.   What is your schedule now?   
NICOLAS MAHUT:   I'm playing doubles with Mika here.   This is important to us both.   Then I will go Bucharest, Rome, Madrid, and the French Open will be here very quickly.
