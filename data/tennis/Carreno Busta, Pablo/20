THE MODERATOR: Questions in Spanish.   
(Questions in Spanish.)   
THE MODERATOR: One question in English.   
 Q.  Just wanted to check with you, like, how did you feel out there on the court today after the withdrawal of Roberto? So you haven't got much time to practice and get accustomed to the conditions. So how was your preparation going into the match and how did you feel out there, like, with the cold conditions?  
PABLO CARRENO BUSTA: I was ready for playing the match, you know. Of course, it's tough when you are not playing the rest of the other matches of the preliminaries and you have to start the tournament in quarterfinals.   
But I was practicing really good, dealing all the week. And well, today I start the match very focused, trying to push, trying to be very aggressive. I think at the beginning of the match I was better than him.   
But after that, the pressure, you know, when you play these kind of matches in Davis Cup, it was too much for me.   
And, physically, I was a little bit tight at the beginning of the first set and even the rest of the match.   
 Q.  Was it very fast?  
PABLO CARRENO BUSTA: No, the conditions are good for us and also for me and also for Guido, because they are not too fast and you can play from the baseline.   
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
