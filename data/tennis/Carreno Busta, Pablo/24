P. BUSTA/K. Anderson   
6-4, 5-7, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What an incredible roller-coaster match.  I mean, after what happened in Indian Wells, to get this win in the final-set tiebreaker, what was going through your mind when you won that final point?  
PABLO CARRENO BUSTA: Yeah, it was an amazing match, no?  I lost last week with him, 7-6 in the third set.  And today, well, at the beginning of the match I start to playing really good, I think returning good, serving good, being very aggressive.   
Well, I serve for the match in the second set, 40-15, and he played some unbelievable points, passing shots, returning really good, winner with his forehand.   
And after that it was a really tough mental moment for me after lose the second set.  But I continue, on court, I continue fighting.  At the end of the match, I save a match point with his serve in the tiebreak, and finally I won.   
So imagine I am very happy with a victory, because it's very important to me this victory against him and also to be in the semifinals in this tournament.   
 Q.  How important to you were the fans and their chants out there towards the end?  Did they help boost your morale?  
PABLO CARRENO BUSTA: Yeah, was very, very important, no?   
When I lost the second set, maybe at the beginning of the third set, I was a little bit tired, and mentally, also.  It was the crowd who start to say "Vamos, Pablo."   
And on the 3-All, I just start to believe in myself again, to believe in my game, to be aggressive again.  Well, I think the victory, 50% is because of them.   
 Q.  Also, how tired do you get out there?  There was a lot of baseline running.  
PABLO CARRENO BUSTA: Yeah, I am tired, of course.  It was a really tough match, battles with a lot of pressure, no?  When you are close, 7-6 in the third set, the pressure I think is the most difficult thing to beat, no?   
And, well, I will try to recover as soon as possible.  Tomorrow I have to play semifinals.  I'm very excited to play it, and I think that I will be ready.   
 Q.  Any memories, or did it come into your mind when you play him about that US Open semifinal?  
PABLO CARRENO BUSTA: Yeah, I lost three times, four times in the last year against him.  It's normal that you think about it.  But of course in the semifinals in the US Open was a very important match, and he beat me four sets.   
But, you know, all the time that I play against him, it's a close match.  Probably I lost because of the ties.   
And today I serve for the match, I lost this game, I lost the set, and I continue fighting.  I think this was the key, no?  It was the most important thing.  Finally I won, and of course I am very happy, no?  But I think all the matches with him are very close.
