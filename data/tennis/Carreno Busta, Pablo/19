THE MODERATOR: We're going to start with the English questions, please.   
 Q.  I want to ask you, Rafa, can you say what this amazing match said to you tonight?  
RAFAEL NADAL: Well, yeah, a lot of emotions out there, you know, playing my team. Yeah, a lot of things, a lot of things went through, we went through a lot of things this week, no, honestly. Every day.   
Yesterday, I went inside my room at 4:24 in the morning. Two days ago we had the father of Roberto passed away, so is terrible thing. Today Pablo had been under some diet thing from yesterday and then Marcel, he was not feeling well, no?   
So a lot of things. So we needed to find a way. And Feli played good singles without being ready, because probably Feli didn't expect to play the singles. Then I won my singles and then doubles we know.   
We played in the past but since long time ago we didn't play together. But we know each other well, we have a very good relationship, we are very good friends from a long time ago. So that helps in these important moments that you have somebody that you have a great feeling. And that what happened.   
We knew it was going to be very, very tough battle out there, not a lot of chances. In the beginning, yes. Then in the second set, yeah, we were not able to find a way to win points on the return. But we needed to wait and to hold our serves. Doesn't matter the way, but arrived to the tiebreak. That's what we did in the tiebreak, we saved some incredible moments, some incredible points.   
We can't be happier to be where we are today, no? We can say thank you very much to the rest of the team that are not here with us, but they are so important for all of us, every day until very late-night they are working so hard to prepare us for the next day. So we can't thank enough them.   
And of course, we can't thank enough all the crowd because without them, I will not say we don't going to win, but for sure the percentage of chances of victory will be much, much lower.   
 Q.  I'll ask this of Feli. In the past, in the best-of-five format, the doubles was obviously important and it was the only thing going on on the Saturday.  
 But I'm curious how you guys feel now that the doubles is the deciding point?   
FELICIANO LOPEZ: With the new format, the doubles can be the more deciding point. And sometimes if you lose or if you win 2-Love, then doubles is not important at all. But also in the group stages, it's also very important because sometimes you can qualify by winning one point, which can be the doubles, for example. So, yeah.   
As you see, most of the ties, they were so close. They have been decided in the doubles match. Today, Canada and Russia, us today, yesterday also a few more. So I think with this new format we can say that the doubles is, yeah, really important.   
THE MODERATOR: Last one in English.   
 Q.  Congratulations to each of you. Each of you have had incredible individual achievements in your career. I was hoping that you could also weigh in about what this means to go to the finals as a team in front of a home crowd essentially? And maybe you can talk a little bit about the atmosphere that you experienced this evening. Any of you.  
FELICIANO LOPEZ: I think, yeah -- for me, personally, this is something that I will never expect, to be honest. I'm 38 years old. I'm playing the last, you know, years of my career probably. And honestly, I will never thought that I will have the opportunity to play another Davis Cup Finals, first of all, in Madrid, and playing today, the deciding point with Rafa to be in the final.   
So I'm living a dream, to be honest. And this is, this is the truth.   
And, yeah, I think we, as Rafa said before, we want to thank everybody in the team because we've been suffering some issues during the week, injuries, things that we have to go over, you know, during the week. And I think this is what we are doing, we are going over many situations this week. This is probably what is making us stronger as a team.   
So I want to -- I want to really thank everybody here at this table.   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in Spanish.
