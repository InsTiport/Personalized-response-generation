R. NADAL/P. Carreno Busta
6-2, 2-0 [Ret.]
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.
Q. Can you just talk about the injury, what you felt, and just how you feel right now?
PABLO CARRENO BUSTA: Yeah, I felt when I serve with 5-2, I felt pain when I serving.  And I tried to continue, but I preferred to stop because it was -- I felt the pain all the time.  And I don't know if the muscle is broken, but I prefer to stop for no broken.
Q. Is this something you have experienced before, or it's the first...
PABLO CARRENO BUSTA: No, during this tournament maybe when I finished first round, I felt a little bit tight the abdominal.  But after that, I didn't feel it again.
So I don't know why that's happen, but sometimes when you are trying to do your 100%, you can do this.
Q. How disappointing is it?  I know you were looking forward to the match and you really believed in your chances.  What will you tell yourself to not be too upset about this?
PABLO CARRENO BUSTA: Well, the match, I start to trying to play aggressive.  But with Rafa, it's not easy, no, to play like this.  I do some mistakes, and then I cannot win my -- I couldn't win my serve any time.  You didn't win your serve, it's very difficult to win to Rafa.
But it was a short match, so I cannot tell you more.
Q. Rafa said that you should look at the positives.  You must look at the positives in the tournament.  Is that your attitude now, because it's an injury, because you have played so well to get here?
PABLO CARRENO BUSTA: Yeah, of course.  Now I will go home.  But I arrive to quarterfinals here in Roland Garros.  I won four matches.  I think I'm playing really good.  I am in a really good performance.
So I think this problem, I hope that will be not really important.  I hope.  I don't know.  And I try to continue like this.
Now we have the grass season.  It maybe is not my best surface, but I will try to win my first match on this surface and arrive to Wimbledon as best as possible.
Q. What's your happiest memory of -- obviously this is a sad moment the way you went out.  But getting to the quarterfinals, what are your happiest memories of your matches?
PABLO CARRENO BUSTA: Yeah, it was my best Roland Garros.  I need to be happy, because my level in these weeks was really good.  I believe in myself more than when I start the tournament, so that's good news for me.
We know that we can do important things in the future in these tournaments, and we just try to continue improving my tennis, my mentality, and my fitness, and then we'll see.
THE MODERATOR: Questions in Spanish.
Q. What about your injury?  What happened to you?  Rafa told us that it happened to you when you were serving at 5-2.  Is it an abdominal problem?
PABLO CARRENO BUSTA: Yes.  I can't remember whether it was 15-30 or 30-15.  So I started to serve and then, at 30-All, I hit the serve very hard.  And I felt an acute pain in my abdominals.
From then on, I looked at my staff.  I was apprehensive.  I felt an abdominal pain.  It's a delicate area.  It was quite uncomfortable.  I wanted to serve, but I couldn't serve.  I was afraid.
So I asked for the physiotherapist to turn up at the end of the set.  From then on, I didn't feel any problem, but I couldn't serve.  And when I wanted to smash a ball, it was too painful.  I realized that I couldn't continue.
It's impossible to win against Rafa without your serve, without being 100%.  So it was a complicated situation.  I didn't want to overdo it, and I tried to limit the damage.  I don't want to have a torn muscle.
Q. Talking about the positives, in English you said that you trust yourself more than at the start of the tournament.
PABLO CARRENO BUSTA: There are lots of positives with this tournament.  I booked my spot for the quarterfinals in a Grand Slam tournament.  It has never happened.  I defeated Milos, Dimitrov.  I lost to Rafa today.  At least I would have wished to win the match.  I could have learned more if the match had continued.
I hope it won't be a serious injury.  But as you said, I'm leaving the tournament knowing that in the future I will be able to be back here to make a potential deep run.  I contended with some problems, but I managed to find solutions.  When I played against Raonic, I had good feelings, new feelings, and this will reinforce my experience.
