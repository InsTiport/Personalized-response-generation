 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. How were you able to reset and come back and play such a big fifth set after what happened in the fourth?
 PABLO CARRENO BUSTA:   Well, I just try to think in the present, no?  Also at the beginning of the match, I was very nervous.  I try to rushed.  When I start the second set, I think that I was playing much better than on the first one.
 Then in the fourth set I felt little bit tight, my lower back.  That's my important point, on my lower back.  Well, just the physio told me that I was little bit block.  He try to do his things.  Was incredible, no?  After that I not feel 100% because we were playing, like, four hours, but I could play my best tennis again.
 Q. Were you nervous at all in the fifth set or were you more confident because you started to feel better physically?
 PABLO CARRENO BUSTA:   Well, always you are nervous, no?  It is a five sets.  You are playing for be in the semifinals.  But I was comfortable on court.  The fifth set, I enjoy the moment, no?  It's not easy to play these kind of matches because it was a really good battle.  Denis plays very good.  I think if we play this level we can continue playing these kind of matches.
 Q. Where would you rank this or put this in terms of your victories?
 PABLO CARRENO BUSTA:   It's very important to be back in the semifinals of the US Open, no?  When I arrive to the quarterfinals in Roland Garros in 2017, was amazing.  Then I made a semifinals here.  It was unbelievable.
 If I can repeat it, if I be again in semifinals is because I have the level.  So is very important to me, to my confident, to continue working very hard, to continue this way.
 Q. The situation the other day with Novak, what kind of response have you been getting?  Do you think a player should be held responsible for bashing a ball or racquet in the stadium?
 PABLO CARRENO BUSTA:   Well, of course, it was a tough moment for Novak, for me, for the tennis, for everybody, no?  I think the rule is the rule.  The referee needs to do these kind of things.
 Of course, was unlucky, no, Novak hitting the ball in the line umpire...  You can try to don't do these kind of things.
 Q. We know Denis is an aggressive player.  He came to net 70 times tonight.  Were you surprised by that?
 PABLO CARRENO BUSTA:   No, I know that Denis plays like this.  With an incredible serve, lefty, that's more uncomfortable to play against them.  Aggressive, no?  Very aggressive, going to the net, trying to do the winners.
 But at the beginning of the match I was very nervous.  It was very easy for him I think.  After that, the match was different, very different.  I start to return his serve.  I serve better.  I push a little bit more from the baseline.  I play inside the court.  I trying to be aggressive.
 Is difficult, of course, because Denis try to play more aggressive than me.  I just do it, no?  It's very important to me to win this match because Denis is an incredible player.  I don't know if he's now 12 or near to the top 10.  Is a very good victory.
