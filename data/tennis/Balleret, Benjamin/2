  Q.  Well done, congratulations.  Although possibly not the way you would have liked to have won.  BENJAMIN BALLERET:  No, I prefer to play a matchpoint.  It's always better for the ground, for everybody.  But I'm very, very glad to win this match.  I'm happy, too, he retired because it was not so easy even with his injury.  So I'm happy either way.  Q.  Have you surprised yourself this week at being able to play at this level in your first Masters Series?  BENJAMIN BALLERET:  Yeah, really.  I didn't expect that.  But it's very nice to play here.  This court, I know very good.  So I'm happy this way.  Q.  What has happened to your game to bring about this improvement suddenly?  BENJAMIN BALLERET:  Not so much.  I play like -- I play every week, but I fight really hard.  It's happening like this, so that's it.  End of FastScripts...
