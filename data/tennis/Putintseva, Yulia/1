 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Congratulations on your win.  You had a big three-setter.  Talk us through the match.
 YULIA PUTINTSEVA:   It was a tough match, tough conditions because it was a little bit windy and a hot day.  Not like tomorrow, but still.
 Yeah, I was just trying to move well, to play my game, to attack when she gave me like a slow ball.  So I was just doing the best what I can, and yeah, trying to win.
 Q. Lots of players that did the hard quarantine said it was really tough to be at their best level, physically and tennis-wise.  How did you feel?  Do you feel you're getting there or it's not there yet?
 YULIA PUTINTSEVA:   I mean, it's tough to say because of course I've been in a hard lockdown for 14 days.  Even if you count with the plane and everything, it was around 16 days, so it's really tough to get on the court straight and start to play like points, start to practice with the girls because usually it only for me takes like two to three weeks just to start slowly getting there tennis-wise, physically.  I start playing points like when I practice after two, three weeks in the end of the season.  So it was definitely a new experience.
 Now I cannot say that I feel like 100 percent, but I'm trying to do every match my best to get there.
 Q. Sloane Stevens was in the same situation as you.  Did you feel during the match there was more ups and downs than usual because you were not feeling so good?
 YULIA PUTINTSEVA:   It's tough to say.  It depends, because when you play a match there are always ups and downs.  Even if you feel 100 percent there is pressure because it's a Grand Slam.  I cannot say that -- I think for someone who has been locked down for 14 days, for both of us, it was pretty high level.  I can only say that.  Maybe it would be even higher if we didn't stuck in the room for 14 days.  That's my guess.
 I mean, for today, I just tried to do my best and win.  That's it.
 Q. I would like to know what you can tell me about Alison Van Uytvanck.  I've seen you played her four times, but the last time was already three years ago.  What do you remember of her, and how do you have to play against her?  And also I read in your bio that one of your idols was Justine Henin.  Can you tell me why and what you appreciate about her?
 YULIA PUTINTSEVA:   Yeah, about Alison, we played, I think, first time in juniors.  It was a while ago.  I think it was like 10 years ago.  She likes to mix it up.  She likes to drop shots.  She like to play flat.  She likes to serve, like do big shots.  So it's going to be a tough match for me, definitely.  I have to prepare.  I have to have a look how she was playing her last matches, how she was performing, what she was doing good, what she was not doing well, so I have some homework to do.
 And by Justine Henin, yes, she was one of my favorite players because I always watched her, like when I was a kid, she was also not very tall.  She liked to mix it up.  She was playing really aggressive, using all kinds of shots on the court, and for me she was a great example how a short player can use like good sight, like slicing, coming to the net, drop shotting, doing like all this stuff.  For me she's like the best example of the game.
