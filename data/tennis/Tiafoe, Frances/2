 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Bad luck on tonight's result, but some fantastic points and efforts in there.  Just talk us through the match from your perspective.
 FRANCES TIAFOE:   I mean, yeah, I mean, played well.  Played really well tonight -- or afternoon.  Yeah, I mean, it's tough.  I mean, obviously he's No. 1 in the world for a reason, he's won the amount of slams he has for a reason.  He's super clutch when he needs to be.
 I was in it.  You know, I thought I mixed things up well, kept him on his toes, and, you know, I brought it.
 But obviously wasn't good enough.
 Q. What do you take away from a match against Novak that you brought, like you said, you brought it?  How do you move forward after that?  Do you have a lot more confidence now?
 FRANCES TIAFOE:   I mean, these matches aren't a problem for me.  You guys have seen it, whether you guys choose to remember or not.  Obviously, you know, '19 lost in five with Roger.  Played Medvedev here last time, lost in four.  For me, I'm at the stage in my career where I just want to be back to where I was, 29, inside top 30, you know, and higher.  Just being seeded in these events.
 I think I'm more than capable, but it's a matter of not what I do, you know, against Novak but what do you do every day.  And those matches, losing matches, I don't think I should.  I mean, that's the difference.
 But as far as taking confidence away from today, honestly what I feel is that more than anything.
 Q. Could you also talk about the electronic line calling here?  Did you have any issues with it tonight?
 FRANCES TIAFOE:   Sorry, for my language, it was fucking horrible.  I hate it.  I cannot stand it.  But, like, I mean, there was a game today where I hit like -- Novak was even laughing one time, he just served like well long, and I said, Good joke.  He's laughing.
 There was one body serve I hit big at him before the line and he misses it, and we come into a complicated game.
 Yeah, it's a lot.  I mean, it's gonna take a while to get used to, I guess, if they keep carrying on with it.  But, I mean, I'm not a fan.
 Q. I know this is the first time you have played Novak competitively, but it was statistically his best serving game ever in Grand Slams I think.  Was his serve particularly potent tonight?  Were you expecting that from him or was it just because it was so quick out there?
 FRANCES TIAFOE:   Yeah, what was that?  Serving insane today.  I was, like, All right, Isner, goddamn.  I mean, opening game he comes out four bombs.  I was, like, All right, bro.  He served well.  He served well when he needed it, which was big.
 Yeah, it's tough.  He's got kind of the same toss for all the serves.  It was tough to read, I found.
 No, that's not something I was anticipating at all.
 Q. Tough luck today.  You probably heard that Novak openly sympathized with what happened to you on the court today.  In a sport as competitive as tennis, how can you know, and does it really matter if these comments of support are genuine?
 FRANCES TIAFOE:   Look, I mean, we're competitors, right?  I wasn't -- I'm not bugging out at that moment for him to change it, because I wouldn't.  You know, there's so much on the line.  Fuck, I mean, I'm a nice guy but not that nice.
 And same for him.  We're trying to win.  And I get it.  He even said it when he shook his hand.  He's like, Sorry.  He's, like, I know.  I know.  And I'm glad he acknowledged it, but...
 I mean, for me, I feel like there just has to be conversations about it.  If we're gonna go and not use the towels with COVID and everything with the kids, I get it.  I'm here for it, but let's have more time.  Especially on a court like Laver.  If I'm walking all the way over here to then go here to then go to the line -- after we play a long point, I'm not using the same ball, I'm not going to go sprint to my towel and come back, like, I'm not breaking records.
 But, yeah, I mean, so, I mean, that was kind of my thing.  I felt like that kind of broke the match, honestly.  And he ran off with it.  Hats off to him, but that was a terrible ending to the match, to such a high-quality match.  Could I have handled it better?  Yes.  Yeah, I mean, that just broke me.  I'm out there battling World No. 1, and like he needs any more help, you know.
 Q. I wanted to ask you what you don't like about the electronic calling system.  It's supposed to be almost perfect, but what about it do you not like?
 FRANCES TIAFOE:   It's technology, right?  It's gonna make mistakes.  That's just a fact.  How sometimes we hit the side of the net and they are saying out.
 I played my first round, it was like 2-All or -- something.  I hit a serve, I have a ball on top of the net.  Out of nowhere, the electronic calling is screaming, Stop.
 What is that?  And then I end up losing the game.  Okay, that's a problem.  Sorry, malfunction.  Well, thousands and thousands of dollars, malfunction?
 So things like that, I'm just not a fan for it.  I don't think I'll ever be a fan.  It is what it is.  I think there will be misses.  Things are happening so fast.  I get technology is at a crazy high level.  I'm just not a believer in it.  That's just kind of what it is.
 They're gonna do what they're gonna do.  It doesn't matter what I say.  They're not gonna change anything because Frances Tiafoe said it.  I'm never gonna be for it.
