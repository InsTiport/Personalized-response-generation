THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Nick, congratulations on the performance.  You took a knee before the warmup.  Can you please explain why you did that?  
NICK KYRGIOS: I'm doing that before most matches just to remember, you know, the two most important people that have passed away.   
You know, I just take a knee to remember those before I go out there and play.  Yeah.   
 Q.  Has nothing to do with Donald Trump?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Fuck, no.  Serious?   
 Q.  Nick, there were a bunch of protests in the U.S. with guys taking knees in the NFL today.  That's why he asked that.  John, what do you think overall?  
CAPTAIN JOHN McENROE: I thought it was amazing.  This is something that's here to stay.  I think we all could tell that.  It was unreal.  We have a new fellowship here with our team.  We were so close, and it was just so beautiful.  Seriously.  It was an absolutely awesome event.   
 Q.  Nick, you got really emotional in the end.  I was just wondering, how did those few moments go for you?  And obviously now you seem to be in a better mood.  
JOHN ISNER: He's had a few beers.   
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, it was tough.  When I'm playing for myself, you know, sometimes I don't put the greatest effort in when I play on my own.  When I play with these guys and I'm playing for something as a team, I'm not just playing for myself out there.  I'm playing for the whole team.   
It's the same in Davis Cup.  I'm playing for the country, playing for the guys on the bench.  I know that every single one of these guys up here has put effort into this week, whether that's practice, supporting other guys.   
You know, Johnny Mac supporting us, P-Mac helping us with everything.  We all bought in as a team.  That's why it hurt.  I gave everything I had.  I came short, and I knew that we were going to be favorites going to the doubles.  That was in the back of my mind.   
Yeah, it just hurt because I knew I didn't want to let these guys down.  I wanted to come through but I didn't.  Yeah, that's why I got a bit emotional out there.   
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: You didn't let us down, Man.   
NICK KYRGIOS: Thanks, Bro.   
GROUP: (Agreement that he did not let the team down.)   
 Q.  John, you hadn't beaten Rafa before.  Have you played better than that in a best-of-three match, you think?  What was the emotion like for you, being able to play that well?  
JACK SOCK: The best match I have ever seen.   
JOHN ISNER: No, it was certainly a very good match for me.  It's a good format for me, as well:  two out of three sets, tiebreaker in the third, playing indoors.  Can't really ask for anything better.  I'm not playing him at Roland Garros, so it would be a little bit different story if I was.   
But, look, I knew we were down 12-6, but if I could pull that off, I knew we could have a good shot at winning this thing.  That's what we did.  We were a point away, essentially.   
We would have really liked our chances in that last doubles, but, yeah, it was good to keep the team alive, for sure.   
JACK SOCK: Unreal tennis.   
 Q.  It's only three days, the event, but there is a whole buildup, and you have been playing a lot, been sitting on the bench a lot.  How tiring is it?  
FRANCES TIAFOE: Very tiring.   
NICK KYRGIOS: I'm feeling pretty spicy.   
FRANCES TIAFOE: I feel great, actually.   
JACK SOCK: Energy is so high.   
JOHN ISNER: Cheering is more tiring than playing, right?  Can we agree on that?   
SAM QUERREY: A lot of up and down.   
JOHN ISNER: Thanasi is the most haggard person here.   
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: Thanasi's the best.   
 Q.  How tired is the coach?  
CAPTAIN JOHN McENROE: The coach is exhilarated.  It's been awesome to be out there.  I wouldn't have it any other way.  I can't wait to do this again.  I mean, you feel like you want to do it again sooner than a year from now.
