J. ISNER/F. Tiafoe
3-6, 4-6, 7-6, 6-2, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Where do you think you had the better chance of winning, the third set tiebreak or when you served for the match?
FRANCES TIAFOE: Both, I mean, about the same.  Yeah, pretty disappointed I missed that backhand at 5-All with that much court I had to work with.  Overcooked it.
But, yeah, serving for it I thought I definitely had it.  I thought I definitely thought the match was over, but he played a good return game.  Didn't make that many first serves that game.  Probably should have played a higher percentage, but it's tough.
Q. You were very gracious on court.  What were you feeling after the match, having chances?  What is going on in your head?
FRANCES TIAFOE: I mean, toughest loss of my career so far for sure.  But, you know, think I'm getting over it now a little bit.  I mean, not much to really say.  It's tough.  I was so excited serving for it 5-3; the crowd is going nuts; I'm going nuts.  You have so much adrenaline going.
Come up a little short, it hurts.
But it's against an experienced player.  Me and John are great friends.  It was a good battle and I had a lot of fun today.
Q. (Question regarding experience.)
FRANCES TIAFOE: I think that played a part in it.  If I could replay that, probably wouldn't have gotten as hyped up when I broke.  Maybe would have taken a little bit out of it.
No, I mean, I think that played a little part in it.
Q. Talk about the atmosphere playing on the new Grandstand.  What was that like?
FRANCES TIAFOE: I think it's going to be the best court at the US Open in years to come.  It was unbelievable.  It was pretty much packed the whole time.
Yeah, I mean, it still feels pretty intimate, just like the old Grandstand.  I think it's going to definitely be a court I want to play on for sure in the future.
Q. What did you and John say to each other at the net when you hugged?  There's always a lot of questions about the future of American tennis.  With young guys like you and Taylor Fritz, how bright is the future?  Can you compete for slams down the road?
FRANCES TIAFOE: To be honest, yeah, I don't really know what John said.  I just heard him say, You're going to be great, you know, and I was kind of crying on his shoulder.  But, yeah, I mean, he's so nice.  I mean, we're such good friends.
And then the last thing I heard him say is, Don't let this get you down.
For American tennis, I think it's looking really good.  I think we have a lot of guys that are going to be very good.  I think American tennis is definitely on the right path.  We just got to keep our heads down and keep doing the work and I think we're going to have good careers.
Q. What did those first two sets feel like?  Looked like you could do no wrong.
FRANCES TIAFOE: Seemed like everything I touched was golden.  Came out playing pretty much lights out.  I was returning unbelievable.  I was guessing right on everything.  Wasn't really expecting that.  I was ready to play a couple breakers going in.
But, yeah, I mean, it was a lot of fun today.  I really enjoyed myself and I really thought I played one of the best matches I've played so far.
I pretty much did everything but win the match today.  It was an unbelievable experience.
Q. Did your dad have anything to do with tennis before he got the job at the camp?
FRANCES TIAFOE: No, nothing at all.  Nothing at all.  Never really even held a racquet before he came there at all.  No relation to tennis whatsoever.
Q. How do you build off a match like this going forward, take the positives out of it?
FRANCES TIAFOE: I think the positive is that I can play that level, you know, on a big stage like that.  Also that I think one day I could maybe have a good run at a slam.
You know, just keep going on the practice courts and keep doing what I've been doing:  working hard, get my strengths even better, and my weaknesses to one day be strengths.
Q. I saw you in the Orange Bowl when you were 15.  What part of your game has made the biggest advance since then?
FRANCES TIAFOE: I think I've just gotten a lot stronger physically.  I think that's helped me a lot.  Moving better.  You know, hitting the ball stronger from both sides.  Serving a bit better.
I mean, yeah, I just grew a lot as a person, as a player since then.  I think that's really what's been helping me the last couple years.
Q. Which tennis figure has provided you with the greatest inspiration?
FRANCES TIAFOE: As far as player or... ?
Q. Can be a player.  Doesn't have to be.
FRANCES TIAFOE: I'm a big DelPo fan.  Huge DelPo fan.  Seeing him win a slam here when he was 19, 20, that was huge inspiration for me.  I always wanted to be like him.
Seeing him in the locker room, now we're talking, that even seems surreal.  I think he was a big inspiration for me.
