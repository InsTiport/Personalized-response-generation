6-4, 6-1
THE MODERATOR: Questions in Chinese, please.
Q. It was a good match today.  What is your assessment of your performance today?
WANG YAFAN: I played to my level.  I can see the gap between me and the top players.
Q. In the first set you broke her first.  After that, your serve, you dropped four points in a row.  What changed at that point?
WANG YAFAN: She played very aggressively.  As for those two games, I wanted to finish those two games rapidly because I felt passive for the match.
I made some mistakes trying to finish it quickly.
Q. You had breakpoints during the match that you couldn't convert.  Petra is a great player.  In your mind, how can you compete against top players?  Do you learn something from those players?
WANG YAFAN: They are better at dealing with the key points and key moments.  At those key moments, my level of play was not consistent.  Sometimes I was slow a little bit.  At the key points, I was not very aggressive, as they were.
Q. What is your take away from the China Open?
WANG YAFAN: I think I have built up my confidence after five matches.  I played top 100 players during the past four matches.  I've learned a lot from those top players.  I have built up my confidence by playing them.
Q. What is your schedule?
WANG YAFAN: I will play the Tianjin tournament.
Q. Last year you performed well in doubles.  You won the title in Zhuhai.  This year you reduced playing doubles.  Are you focusing more on singles this year and next year?
WANG YAFAN: Actually, I focus more on singles.  Last year my doubles performance was good, but my focus was still on singles.  But, of course, I will not give up on doubles.  My key is the singles.
Q. When did you start playing tennis?
WANG YAFAN: Since I was nine.
Q. So you played tennis constantly since you were nine years old?
WANG YAFAN: Yes.
