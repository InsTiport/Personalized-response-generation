 Q.  What was the key today?  
OLIVER ANDERSON: Trying to sustain a high level was the biggest focus going into the match.  Yeah, that was always going to be a bit of a struggle.   
 Q.  What would have been your expectation coming here this week?

 Q.  You had huge and very good crowd support out there.  Best crowd you would've played in front of?  
OLIVER ANDERSON: Yeah, for sure.  Had a lot of my friends and family there because I live locally.  Yeah, it was good.   
 Q.  Going to be hard to come down off the high and get ready for the first round?  
OLIVER ANDERSON: No.  I've already started thinking about it.  I'm pretty focused on what I need to do tomorrow.  Not sure who I play yet but, yeah, looking forward to it.   
 Q.  Is there anything you've done differently in the pre-season that might have got yourself to this point, do you think?  Change anything up?

OLIVER ANDERSON: No.  He moved up here.   
 Q.  Okay.  What does he bring to your game?  
OLIVER ANDERSON: So far he's helped a lot with my serve.  Yeah, because he had a pretty good one, so ideal to have him as a coach.   
 Q.  When did that start?  
OLIVER ANDERSON: About two weeks ago.  Yeah, pretty recently.   
 Q.  Preference where you end up in the draw?  (Regarding playing Ben Mitchell.)  
OLIVER ANDERSON: Yeah, I wouldn't mind playing Mitchell because he absolutely killed me a couple weeks ago in the wildcard playoff.   
Yeah, not sure.  Don't really care who I play.   
Enjoy it.   
 Q.  What's does this kind of win do for you?  Belief and confidence, but what else?  
OLIVER ANDERSON: Mainly just belief and confidence.  That's pretty much it.  Yeah, doesn't do too much else.   
 Q.  It proves to you something you've done, a change in your mindset, something you're doing is working better?  
OLIVER ANDERSON: I'm just trying to play more aggressively and believe in my ability, that I can play at a high level and sustain that for three sets.  So I proved myself that.   
 Q.  New wave of Australian man coming through with Omar and yourself and a few talented youngsters.  Does it help to have a group coming through together?  
OLIVER ANDERSON: Yeah, it's good.  Right now there is just a big bunch of players just inside the top 300.  It's good that everyone pushes each other.   
Yeah, can all get better together.  It's good.   
 Q.  Who were you working with before Wayne?  
OLIVER ANDERSON: Mark Draper, who is now coaching James Duckworth ask John Millman.
