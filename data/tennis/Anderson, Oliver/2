6-3, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How does that experience rate?  
OLIVER ANDERSON: Yeah, it was good.  Ivan played way too good for me today.  He was on from the very first point.  I didn't really get a sniff.  He was too good.   
 Q.  He's ranked better than you.  How do you prepare for that kind of match?  
OLIVER ANDERSON: The day off yesterday helped, but it was always going to be a tough one for me, pretty physical battle playing him.   
Just had to try to really just fight for every single point and make him earn it.   
 Q.  In a word or two he was too what today?  
OLIVER ANDERSON: Too good.  He was.  Yeah.   
 Q.  Is that a Gregory Terrace cap?  
OLIVER ANDERSON: It is.  My school.   
 Q.  So you did year 12 in the year just gone, did you?  
OLIVER ANDERSON: No, the year before.  I finished school early.   
 Q.  At year 11?  
OLIVER ANDERSON: Year 12.  I was a year young for my grade.   
 Q.  How big a learning curve is that?  It's only a match, but you probably learned a lot out of that.  
OLIVER ANDERSON: Yeah, definitely.  It was a pretty good experience.  This whole week has been a big, big learning curve for me.  Being able to get through two matches and playing a better player every single match, it was good seeing how -- being part of the whole tournament was good.  Great experience.   
 Q.  Whet the appetite a little?  
OLIVER ANDERSON: For sure, yeah.   
 Q.  How difficult did you find it to kind of conserve yourself through the rain delay?  
OLIVER ANDERSON: It wasn't too bad.  I was being entertained the whole time by my mates that were here.  It was fine, yeah.   
I enjoyed it.  Got to spend a bit of time with them.   
 Q.  What are your plans now?  
OLIVER ANDERSON: Take a couple days off and come back here and practice for a few days and head to Melbourne for the qualifying for the men's Australian Open.   
 Q.  Did you played the December wildcard playoff?  
OLIVER ANDERSON: I did.  I lost to Ben Mitchell first round.   
 Q.  Have you and Wayne ironed out your schedule this year?  
OLIVER ANDERSON: No, haven't looked past the Open yet.  Yeah, don't really look past that.  Pretty big tournament for me.  The juniors as well as the men's.  The men's is just an experience once again, but the juniors is a pretty important tournament for me.  Hopefully I can do well.   
 Q.  What is your ITF junior ranking?  
OLIVER ANDERSON: Don't have one.  Yeah, I haven't played a junior for at least a couple years.
