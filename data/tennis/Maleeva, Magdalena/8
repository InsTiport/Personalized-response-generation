KATERINA MALEEVA: Well, obviously it was very difficult for both of us to play against each other and I guess it is difficult for the people to understand that because they think that their money involved and they just cannot understand what we mean to each other and, I guess it is over, so. 

MAGDALENA MALEEVA: I am just glad it is over. I cannot say that if I had won I would have felt happier. Maybe I wish I had won and played the quarterfinals on center court. But I equally happy that my sister is going to be there. I wish I could play better, but I couldn't, and I am just glad it is over. 

MAGDALENA MALEEVA: Because it was not my day. 

MAGDALENA MALEEVA: Definitely. 
KATERINA MALEEVA: No, this victory doesn't mean anything to me. It just -- I know now that I am in the quarters and she is not. That is the only difference. I wish we could both be in the quarters, but... 
MAGDALENA MALEEVA: But at the same time, we could have both lost earlier, so it is very good that one of us is in the quarters. 

KATERINA MALEEVA: Not yet. 
MAGDALENA MALEEVA: But I am better than them in the ranking, so -- 

MAGDALENA MALEEVA: Always we practice, though. 

MAGDALENA MALEEVA: No. It is not that they are my big sisters. It is just that they are my sisters. 

KATERINA MALEEVA: Yes. 

KATERINA MALEEVA: We played quite -- I would say quite a few tournaments together and I would blame it on myself now that we met because my ranking dropped and I wasn't seeded here. I mean, if I am seeded, yeah, we could still meet, but we could meet the earliest maybe quarters. 

KATERINA MALEEVA: Yeah. I don't like it and it just that-- it hasn't happened in a long time and it happened the last two tournaments we play; in Canada I played Manuela and now I played Maggie and -- 
MAGDALENA MALEEVA: But that is the price we pay for being so good and competing at such a high level. I mean, if you have three sisters in the top 15 or in the top 20, it is always going to happen. So that is the price we have to pay. 

KATERINA MALEEVA: I don't know. I didn't see her. 
MAGDALENA MALEEVA: I don't think. She said she wasn't going to come. 

MAGDALENA MALEEVA: I don't think so. She didn't care who is going to win, so why should she watch. 

MAGDALENA MALEEVA: She was having a massage. 

MAGDALENA MALEEVA: Yes. 

KATERINA MALEEVA: Yeah, she is. 

KATERINA MALEEVA: I don't know. 

KATERINA MALEEVA: I would say a lot of time. 
MAGDALENA MALEEVA: We don't sleep together but always -- we are always together. 

KATERINA MALEEVA: We have been quite busy. Not yet. 

MAGDALENA MALEEVA: We just stop talking to each other. It is the same. It doesn't matter. We just try to be enemies on the court, but otherwise everything is normal. 

MAGDALENA MALEEVA: Very hard. 

KATERINA MALEEVA: I don't try anything. I mean, I just go out there and play and I don't think too much. It is something that maybe very few people can understand. 
MAGDALENA MALEEVA: There is no sibling rivalry between us. You have to understand that. 

MAGDALENA MALEEVA: Yes. 
KATERINA MALEEVA: Yes. 

KATERINA MALEEVA: She keeps saying this and I have can't imagine her not playing and staying home. I guess we will have to deal with it when it happens, but now I don't -- until it happens I don't think it will hit us. 
MAGDALENA MALEEVA: I am sure she will come and watch me though. I need her badly. 

MAGDALENA MALEEVA: No. 
KATERINA MALEEVA: No.
