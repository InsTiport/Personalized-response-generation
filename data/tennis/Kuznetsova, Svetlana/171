THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Svetlana.  
 
 
Q.  Your comments on today's match.  You looked reasonably comfortable by the score line. 
 
SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Yeah.  In the start it was a little bit difficult, you know.  She played many matches.  It was my first match.  It's tough to get on the court and get straight in the match.  She was leading 3-1.  After I get on top, and I won 6-3, 6-2.  But still I pulled my adductor muscle, so it was so hard to move.  Still I was -- I didn't want to take a break because I was completely comfortable and I was all right.  
 
Q.  You played a lot of tennis so far this year. 
 
SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  No, not really.  I don't feel like it.  
 
Q.  Doubles and singles. 
 
SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Yeah, but still I feel like I need more matches to get in.  I feel like I need to play more singles to get my good shape because I don't feel like I'm on the top of my game now.  
 
Q.  What do you feel has got to change?  What have you got to pick up in your game?
 
SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  I mean, just to keep ball in play more, you know.  Like matches today, give me no rhythm, so it's not that good for me.  Like like next match, if I'm going to play Vento-Kabchi or Talaja give me more rhythm, the girl going to make me play more balls and I don't do many mistakes and I can find my game again, I can start to attack as soon as I can and just show my strength in the game.  
 
Q.  How do you feel about the conditions, playing out here?
 
SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  I'm feeling like I moving okay.  I need the rhythm.  I need the game.  But I feel good.
