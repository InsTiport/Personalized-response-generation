S. KUZNETSOVA/L. Safarova
  5‑7, 7‑6, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How do you feel physically after two tough matches yesterday and today? 
SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:   I was feeling way worse in the first set.   I was really sore everywhere and I was trying to convince myself that it should get better.
And it did.   Now I feel quite good actually, which is surprising me.

Q.   She was serving for the match and then you won the match.   Actually, you are from Russia, not the Czech Republic.
SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:   Yeah, they did this on court already.   I made them change it when I played Muguruza.   They did the same thing.

Q.   How did you feel when she was serving for the match? 
SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:   Look, I been serving for the first set and I didn't close it, but this is not the key.
I thought, Okay, I am going to make her play each ball.   I knew at some point she should get tense.   I just played the game I was playing.   I felt like I was the one like second and third set who played better.
Was really unlucky was the close call like when I got broken.   For me, the ball clearly was touching the line, but, I mean, everybody can make mistakes.   But it was big call was to make. 
Then I thought, Okay I have nothing else to do than fight and I'll have my opportunities, and I did.

Q.   The match against Sharapova, we all know your head‑to‑head.   How will you prepare for that?   How will you recover? 
SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:   Well, I just do normal stuff, whatever I do:   massage, treatment, sleep, eat.   There is not a bicycle to make, you know, out of this.
It's going to be tough match.   Maria will be favorite.   Yeah, just going to go out there and try to enjoy and do my best. 

Q.   Does it suit you that there is no pressure on you at all?   Will you be able to just hit free tomorrow, or do you think that playing Maria and knowing she is the defending champion is going to make you maybe a little tighter?
SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:   I had no pressure in my any of my matches.   I need all my points about me in the ranking, but it doesn't really matter, you know.
Pressure we make ourself.   The press make pressure.   It's my thing to take it or take it away from me.   I don't care.   What I know is to play the ball, play tennis.
That's my life and I enjoy it, so I will enjoy it tomorrow as well hopefully.

Q.   So twice now you've been on the same court as Andy and played a long three setter.   Do you think you owe him a nice big wedding present for keeping him away from the court until, what was it, 1:00 a.m. yesterday?
SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:   Well, I'm sorry, it was not only my fault.   Each match was about 2:30, 2:40, except was Rafa's match, which was like the key. 
So I have nothing to do with that.

Q.   How do you feel the scheduling has gone this year and how tough is it?
SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:   For me the schedule would be pretty bad.   I won't be afraid to tell this word.
I don't understand like why I played last night like really late.   I finish at 1:00.   And today and tomorrow I play at 11:00 in the morning.   To me it's really unfair, the schedule.   I guess priority is TV, but I guess they should defend more interest of players to make us recover and stuff. 
THE MODERATOR:   Questions in Spanish. 

Q.   Seems that you want to be up there again.   What does Carlos MartÃ­nez help with?   How does he help? 
SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:   Well, first of all, Carlos is my trainer and he's also my friend, so he's support me quite a lot and also knows me very well.   He knows that when I don't have‑‑ he doesn't have to put pressure on me, you know.
He works really well with me and supports me a lot.   I always have his support.   For me, it's a very important factor that he's always next to me.   Anything that happens to me, it's very important to have such a close person as him beside me.
