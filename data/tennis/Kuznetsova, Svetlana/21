6-3, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How much did the match from two days ago affect you today?
SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: I cannot say I was very tired, but I was really tight.  I mean, yeah, definitely I was not the freshest, but still, I was okay.  I know I still have to improve on a lot of different things in the game to get decent level, and I was a little bit too tight in my opinion.
Q. Any reason, or just the way it is?
SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: Well, I know the reason.  I just don't want to say it.
Yeah, there is reasons and I have to work on it.  That's fine.
Q. Over 12 years since your first Grand Slam singles title.  Where is the ambition coming from still?
SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: Oh, I enjoy.  Not days like this, definitely.  I won't remember this as a good day.  But end of last year, I managed to play great tennis.
These moments I really enjoy.  The rest of days like other day I just like to fight and I just have the game.
Q. Do you feel at 31 the body and the mind is still able to...
SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: Yes, yes, why not?  They say womens physically they are the best after 28.  I heard (smiling).  I try to convince myself, anyway.
