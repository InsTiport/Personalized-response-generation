   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.   
  
  Q.  Your 18th meeting with Justine tomorrow.  You getting sick of this in the final?   
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  No, not at all.  You know, the thing is you can count meetings first when we started playing.  I think first year I played like five times with Justine and she was in Top 3 players in the world and I was like number 80, so it was pretty clear that she was winning.   
 But we had a few very close matches and I won two matches.  She's No. 1 so that's world.  It's means it's good.  If I play Justine it means I always lose to No. 1.  That is fine.   
 But I also have opportunities to beat her.  She's going to go the favorite and that's fine with me.  I just going to go there and play my game.   
  
  Q.  It's not intimidating at all?   
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  No, not, not at all.  She's No. 1 clearly now.  I just have to work for my game to try to improve it so maybe one day I can be where she is.   
  
  Q.  And you're quite good friends.   
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Yeah, we're cool.  We're cool.  We shot a lot.  Actually I'm good with everybody on the Tour.  I'm not the person going to stay in conflict.  I hate that.  I like to be friends with everybody.   
 She's not friends with many people, but with me she's good.  I have all respect for her.  She has an amazing career and I have all respect.  I mean, some points I have or I take example of her.   
  
  Q.  Is it hard playing a good friend?   
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  No.  I have everybody play good friends so I have to play almost every day.   
  
  Q.  How big do you think the gap is between No. 1 and No. 2?   
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  You see points gap, no?  In the points it's pretty big gap.  I don't know, it's not my thing to deal.  It's important I'm No. 2 for me, and I going to see from there.   
 I have only one place to go and I looking forward to improve my game.  I still have lots of things to work on.   
  
  Q.  Without divulging your game plan tomorrow, what one or two things do you need to do to be spot on with Justine?   
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Just to play every ball.  She's No. 1 but she's not perfect, you know, you going to have chances.
