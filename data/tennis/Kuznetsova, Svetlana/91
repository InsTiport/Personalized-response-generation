S. LISICKI/S. Kuznetsova
  6-2, 7-5

 Q. I guess it wasn't quite the birthday present you were hoping for. What did you feel went wrong? 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: Well, I felt like I was standing, I was not moving anything. Her game is not -- you cannot adjust. You cannot have long rallies so you've got to be quick and at maximum level all the time, and I haven't done so today. That's why I lost.

 Q. You didn't seem quite yourself. Did you not feel so comfortable?
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: I wasn't feeling my comfort at all. I was not moving much and I was not doing my thing. I didn't serve.

 Q. Why do you think that was?
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: You know, some days it's not going your way, and I was just standing there and not doing much.

 Q. Has it ruined your birthday for you? Will you still be celebrating later?
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: Well, it's definitely still a great day.
