  THE MODERATOR:  Questions please. 

 Q.  How are you playing?  Pretty well?  I didn't see too much of the match. 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  I played all right. 

 Q.  What's the problem there? 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Just a bit tired.  Been playing too many matches, but nothing serious. 

 Q.  Too many matches? 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Yes. 

 Q.  That's the usual affliction. 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Heavy ball. 

 Q.  Are they heavier here? 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Yeah.  We played Wilson and here is Dunlop.  It's nothing serious, don't worry. 

 Q.  Gotten rid of all the other Russians I guess, haven't you?  You're the only one.  How are your feeling going into Paris, okay? 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Yeah, feeling good.  I got so many matches already so it's great.  I'm feeling great and I think I will have a few days off before French, so it's going work really well for me. 

 Q.  You've always played pretty well there. 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  I love being there. 

 Q.  Yeah, I think everyone does. 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Yeah. 

 Q.  Very good.  Have you had some injuries? 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Not really.  A bit wrist injury after Miami, but it was very serious.  I just pull out of one tournament, but nothing that really stop me from practicing for a while. 

 Q.  Well, I know Anita will be glad to see you play.  We haven't seen you play for a long time. 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  I'm here; come to watch. 

 Q.  What about your opponents? 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Is it -- 

 Q.  It's Hantuchova or Medina. 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  I guess it's more chances for Daniela for tonight because she has -- she has the pressure.  She is the favorite to win this match. 
 But I think Anabel is playing well.  I played Anabel and I beat her in Fed Cup.  It was just a few weeks ago.  And I played Daniela this year twice and I beat her once and I lost to her once. 
 So it's going to be a tough match.  But, I mean, I don't want to think about them.  I want to concentrate on myself.  I think if I play a good game I have chances against everybody. 

 Q.  So Fed Cup is going to be at an interesting place up in the woods of Vermont? 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Where? 

 Q.  A place called Stowe, Vermont. 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  In United States? 

 Q.  Yeah. 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Which surface? 

 Q.  I imagine hard, but I don't really know. 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Or indoor. 

 Q.  It was just announced yesterday. 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  I don't know if I'm playing yet.  My captain didn't invite me yet for the team. 

 Q.  Long time between now and then.  It's a ski resort really. 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Could we ski in July? 

 Q.  No.  We have to wait for the snow, but eventually it comes.  That's principally what it is.  It's a nice country.  Lots the fresh air.  I think they have to build a small stadium for 3,000 people. 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Okay. 

 Q.  But there hasn't been any tennis in that part of the country for a long time, so it'll be nice. 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  That's great. 

 Q.  Who's your captain? 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Tarpishev.  Probably going to be on the team.  I'm just joking, but nobody told me, Come on, let's go. 

 Q.  So he captains both teams? 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Yeah, he's the man. 

 Q.  He might win them both this year. 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Who? 

 Q.  Russians. 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  I know, but it's tough, Serena and Venus. 

 Q.  If they play? 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  You never know.  I think they should, but you never know. 

 Q.  Amongst the players that are now going to play, you are the highest in the ranking.  Does the absence of other high players in this tournament makes your way to the semifinal let's say stronger?  Does it give more weight or does it give less weight? 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Well, depend how you take it.  I don't even know who is in other part of the draw more or less.  I saw Serena lost before my match, but I don't even think about it. 
 Basically each match is very hard so everybody can play well.  And, you know, I have to concentrate match by match. 
 Being the top seed now who's the draw it makes more attention to myself.  People thinking that I have to do it or I can do it.  I have chances. 
 Yes, I do have chances, but the pressure, I don't take it on myself.  I just going play and that's it.  I realize that I go on the court that I can win.  The same thing, I can lose.  It depend on me.  It's beautiful the game of tennis. 
 It depend on me.  So I can one day --  it's like in the office:  One day you have good and one day you have bad, but it depend on you. 
 So, I mean, I don't want think about what the pressure and is just play match by match.
