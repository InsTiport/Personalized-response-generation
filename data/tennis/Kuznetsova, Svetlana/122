   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.   
  
  Q.  How do you explain the first set?   
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Well, I didn't start well, definitely, and I've been missing it up, and she been playing pretty good.  And then I was getting a bit tighter and I still didn't play my game.  But when I was down 5-2, 5-3, I felt I'm just not doing the things.   
 I think I just tried to put more balls in play and tried to make rallies long.  So she's not very consistent, so I wanted to play with her.   
  
  Q.  A lot of the players say that early in the championship it's hard to get your rhythm.  Was that something you found difficult to do today?   
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Yes.  Every match is different.  And especially my first match was against Nathalie Dechy.  And today was against Pironkova, two different players.  They play different style.  It's not easy to get the rhythm.   
 I was feeling not bad there, but it was very weird match, not very consistent.   
  
  Q.  You got it all together in the second set.  That must have pleased you.   
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Yeah.  I played better.  I still was not happy with the first set, but I couldn't change anything so I just did better in the second.   
  
  Q.  Do you find it useful to get advice from former champions?   
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  I have my coach.  And I get all advice, how you say this, from my coach.
