 THE MODERATOR: Questions. 

 Q. Where did that match turn after the first set? 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: Well, I think both sets were pretty the same. The one I lost, it was 2-1 and a break. And I was losing my serve too easy, you know. Like the games I kept serving, and I didn't serve well in the second and third set. I think I never served so little percentage of the first serve. I just could not make it. I had to serve too slow to make the serve. 
 But still, like even third set, I remember this 2-1 game, I did two unforced errors forehand, but like so easy. Maybe I have some problem seeing the ball. But I think I just played differently, so differently. First set I played so good. I was playing the right thing against her. And second and third set I think I was going like -- in the third set was long rallies. I was going for too much. Rather she was just keep playing the stable game, doing the right thing, but not much, not overdoing. I was overdoing it a little bit. And she played some very good shots in the third set, I think. 

 Q. Where to from here for you? 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: Well, I fly to Moscow and on Tuesday I fly to Beijing.
