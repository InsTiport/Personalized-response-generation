THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Svetlana, please. 
 
 
Q.  Svetlana, must be nice to come in here when there's hardly anyone in here.
 
SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Well, yeah, you know, I have to do still what I have to do so... 
 
Q.  How was your form today? 
 
SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Well, I'm not really happy with my singles.  I mean, I'm happy that I won, right, but I wish I played better.  But that's okay.  You know, I still fight as much as I could.  Of course it didn't go the way I want it to go.  I think I could win much easier.  But sometimes you have bad days, and this is tough in Grand Slams, you know.  You have to handle it. 
 
Q.  Has it been difficult mentally to put the week behind you? 
 
SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  I'm fine with this.  Other day I was a little bit more tense.  Today was too much maybe relaxed.  But I'm fine, you know.  I think I'm strong enough to handle everything. 
 
Q.  You think you're ready to make a second-week charge for another Grand Slam title?
 
SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Hope so.  I'm looking forward for this. 
 
Q.  Is there any part of your game you need to improve? 
 
SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  I think I can improve many games and I can play many different styles - I can defend, I want to go more forward to the net.  But it will come with the time, you know.  You cannot have everything, you know.  I'm pretty good from baseline.  My forehand is good.  But I want to go more forward, more serve and volley.  But I'm looking for it, you know, and I hope it will come with time.  For the moment I'm fine.
