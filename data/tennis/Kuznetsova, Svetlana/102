  J. JANKOVIC/S. Kuznetsova  
7-6, 6-4  
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Obviously, it was going to be tough here for you. But you just fell a little bit short of expectations, presumably?   
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: Well, I mean, I'm more positive after this match, definitely than after the first match.   
 I think I had many chances. First set, second set. But I played better, and this is the most important thing. I was positive.   
 I think I missed some determination in the important moments, but this is the process of working, so I'll stay positive, and I'll work on it.   
  
  Q. Disappointing though at the end of the week for you?   
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: Well, you know, it was tough to expect more, you know, because I was not playing my best game. I was not winning many matches. But still I played pretty good, and this is it. I played one of the best players who played this year, so...   
  
  Q. What are your immediate plans now between now and the start of next season?   
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: Well, I have to play last match (laughing). I don't have to forget, don't tell me. Otherwise I'll forget and I won't come here tomorrow.   
 But I'm going for holidays. Thanks God, I was praying for that a long time. And, yeah, then I'm just going to take some days off just to recover. I need this break a lot because I pass lots of moments like in - how you say - mental tough moments. I push a lot this year it was tough, and I need to recover and start fresh next year. So the break is going to be very important to take careful.   
 And I'm just going to start my preseason and I'm going to be in Russia. It's my first time preseason there. I have to be extremely careful and active and motivated.
