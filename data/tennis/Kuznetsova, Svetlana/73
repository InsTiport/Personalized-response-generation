 THE INTERPRETER: Questions, please. 

 Q. Before the tournament in Tokyo you got flu. Did you have enough time to recover for this match? 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: I got what? 

 Q. Flu. 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: Yeah.

 Q. Do you think you had enough time to recover?
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: No. I mean, is impossible to recover. It was my super hard designation. I had to go. I came from New York. I had two, three days off. I practice hard for week in Moscow, and I was supposed to leave on Tuesday to Tokyo, so I have five days before the tournament practicing with the week and everything. 
 I got sick. So from Sunday to Saturday, one week, I wasn't home. I didn't go out. I didn't do any fitness. I was in bed. I had to go. 
 So Saturday night, as soon as I got a little bit better, I got first plane and I arrived Sunday. I play for an hour, and Monday I play, Tuesday I play, Wednesday I came here. I practice for Thursday, Friday, Saturday, for three days, and today I play.
 I mean, this is how it was for me. I didn't have time, but this is the way. 

 Q. Do you think schedule of the WTA is too tight? Did you feel tired during the later half of the year?
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: I think the schedule is all right if you don't have injuries and sickness, you know. I have no injuries, but I was ill.
 I cannot change it. You know, sometimes I think even in super hard designation, once a year or twice you can have a medical without paying any fine, but the rest I think the schedule is all right.

 Q. During this match you were up and down almost all the time. But in the third set you were 2-Love up. Then again, you couldn't find your game. 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: Which set? 

 Q. Third, last one. 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: No, I was not 2-Love down. It was equal, 1-All, 2-All, 3-All, 4-All, and I lost the break. But I think if I -- it took me time to get used to her game. It's different. Then it took me time to get used to the court and the wind first set. Then I played good. 
 I felt like I am better player than her, but I could not get my chances, and in the third I did use -- I think I should have made a break in the first game straightaway and be better, but I cannot -- I could not do this.
