S. WILLIAMS/S. Kuznetsova
  7-6, 7-5

 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Svetlana, please. 

 Q. Are you disappointed on the two double-faults? 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: Well, I think Serena played a good match. She forced me to serve better. And I have not been serving well. I think I lost this match because of the serve. 

 Q. You played very well during all the match. 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: I think comparing to other my championship games, it's the best game I played. But, you know, I didn't play some girl today. She served very well. I think her serve brought her through the match. I was a little bit unlucky few points. 
 But still was a good match and I still hope to do better next ones. 

 Q. Do you think between Venus and Serena, Serena will win tomorrow?
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: I think Serena. You never know what happens when they play each other. But probably.
