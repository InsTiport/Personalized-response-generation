 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Svetlana, please.   
  
  Q. What do you think about this match? It was a tough match.   
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: Well, definitely I'm disappointed. But I cannot expect winning players like Venus and Serena playing like I played.   
 You know, I gave my best both matches, but I don't feel great. I mean, I don't feel the ball like, for example, I felt in Beijing, you know. I didn't play the great tennis, and that's why I lose.   
  
  Q. There is no reason why?  
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: I just don't feel it. I have my reasons, but I don't really want to talk about it (smiling).   
  
  Q. You have tomorrow a tough game. It won't be easy for both of you. Can you focus on your game to win and maybe to pass to the semifinals?  
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: I have to. It's not if I can. I have to do that. I have to go and play. I'll do my best.   
 Definitely it's going to be hard. But I like playing her. Is going to be tough match. But I know if I play right, I going to have opportunities. I hope to take them.  
  
  Q. Are you ready physically for tomorrow?   
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: It's okay.   
  
  Q. No problem?  
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: Yes.   
  
  Q. Are you sure you can be in the semifinal, even if you win?  
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: I have no idea (laughter). You ask me question, I answer. But I have no idea, I win, I lose. I know if I win, maybe I have a chance. I have to see. But if I lose, definitely no chance.   
 But, you know, I have a tough group. I think I played three tough matches. It's much more positive than my past Championships. I think I know what to improve.  
  
  Q. But you prefer to just play without counting?  
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: Definitely I will ask. I'm just curious how it works. If I lose, there's no chance. Everybody except Serena has two losses and one win. It's going to be curious.   
  
  Q. Are you happy with your performance? Are you satisfied with your performance by the end of this year?   
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: You know, if I say I'm not, winning a Grand Slam title, I gonna be...   
  
  Q. I mean after the Grand Slam, after French Open.   
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: I mean, I saved season by winning French Open and Beijing. This is how I put it better. But the other tournaments was not so good.
