 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. (Through translation.) Many people say you are the female version of Nadal. What do you think of that?   
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: Well, that's a big compliment for me, but I don't think so because Rafa win too many Roland Garroses and most of the tournaments on clay.   
 Maybe I play of all girls more similar to Rafa. Well, I also grown up in Spain on clay court.   
  
  Q. (Through translation.) Many people say you often lack consistency. Do you feel that way?   
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: Yeah, I think I improved that and I played better. It's my main problem, actually. I have all the game. I have all the shots. But when I have this consistence I play much better and I play like last two weeks.  
 I started to win more matches and just playing within myself. It's just my goal to find the key within myself to play all the time consistent whole match.   
  
  Q. (Through translation.) Do you think you have a chance of winning the tournament?   
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: Well, definitely I have a chance. I played great this last week, and I'm playing better and better every match here.   
 I got used to this court today especially, and I'm looking forward to playing tomorrow. But definitely I have a chance.   
  
  Q. (Through translation.) You don't speak Italian but you understand it. Why is that?  
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA: No, I don't speak anything. Well, I embarrassed to speak because I confuse it with Spanish. I speak half Italian and half Spanish. I make up some words like Nadal sometimes. I heard him trying speak in English and half Spanish.   
 So I do this in Italian and Spanish. But I understand quite well, especially when you speak slowly. I'm looking forward to working now this first week with one guy, a fitness coach from Italy, so I'm trying ti understand more.   
 I really like it, and maybe I can visit more times Italy so I can understand more.
