   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 

 Q.  Are you okay? 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  So far.  I'm here and I'm alive.  A little bit tired, but I hope I still have time to recover before tomorrow. 

 Q.  This is your first time you are 3? 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  No, second time.  I've been already this year, yes. 

 Q.  And it means something very special to be 3? 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  It's my favorite number, one of my favorite numbers.  3 is great, you know.  It's much closer to the top. 
 But still, 3, 4 is not big difference, but still it's a bit higher.  But, no, nothing like -- it's already something important that I second time only here, so it's great. 

 Q.  And what do you think of your draw? 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  It's never easy, you know, especially after coming after two tournaments.  It's very hard.  Just have to get the game and the ball here. 
 It's a little bit different, the court, surface.  So hope to adapt quick, and I won't have problems if I would. 

 Q.  And you don't play no more with Amélie in double? 
 SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Yes, in some way, but I think we still will play some weeks with Amélie, because I love playing with her doubles.  We have very good friendship and we have lots of fun and practice together, and it's always fun to hang around.
