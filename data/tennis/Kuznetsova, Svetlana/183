THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Svetlana. 


Q.  How was the match for you against Mary Pierce?  What is your feeling now?

SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  The match was tough, you know.  It was pretty close, first set.  But I think I had chances to break her in the first set.  I just wasn't really convinced in myself.  But I just felt like I can do, I can make a break, you know.  Left a little bit, missed some easy balls on her serve.  But I felt like match was under my control, you know.  So I think this was the most important thing.  I feel good and I'm looking forward to play next match. 

Q.  What did she tell you at the end?  You spoke with her at the net. 

SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  We're talking sometimes like in the locker room.  We have pretty good friendship, you know.  I was like, "If you're fine," when she pull the leg, how she was feeling.  So I wish her to recover faster, and that's it. 

Q.  What was wrong with her?

SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  She said that she pulled a muscle in the last point in tiebreak. 

Q.  Do you still practice in Spain?

SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  I practice in Emilio Sanchez' academy and Sergio Casal.  I've practiced there since 14 and it's already five years.

Q.  Who is helping you here?

SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Sergio Casal. 

Q.  Is he here?

SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Yes

Q.  Is this the biggest win, most important win?

SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Against Mary? 

Q.  In general playing on this level. 

SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  No, I beat Justine this year, I beat Venus, I beat Sugiyama.  I beat many good players.  I did quarters last year in Wimbledon.  I'm just looking forward to do my best the next match. 

Q.  Is your mother here with you this year?

SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  No.  She's not. 

Q.  You're playing Justine Henin in the quarterfinals.  What do you expect from that match?

SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  I think she didn't play yet. 

Q.  You could play her. 

SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Yeah. 

Q.  You played her already this year. 

SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  I played her three times this year.  No, four times.  I lost three times and one I won.  Last time I lost I had good chances.  I just wasn't convinced in myself.  Now I feel pretty more confident and I feel like I played -- this is my first whole year that I played as many tournaments as I won.  Because before I had age eligibility rule.  I feel I'm a little mature in my game.  I control better my emotions.  I know maybe better what to do in difficult moments.  So I'm really looking forward to show good game and to do my best in this match. 

Q.  If you would play her, what have you learned in the games that you have played her before?  Is there another way you have to play her?

SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  I mean, she's just, I mean, one of the biggest players for the moment in the tour.  But, I mean, she's a person, and I think I just have to play my game.  You know, I have to dictate.  You know, if I dictate, I think I win. 

Q.  Did you ever have the kind of experience that you had today, a player who had to call for the trainer?  Obviously it got cold, you were trying to keep warm. 

SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  I mean, I know many players, like Elena Dementieva, she does it many times.  She calls the trainer.  I mean, it's not a secret.  I mean, player could be hurt.  I'm not saying Mary wasn't hurt.  Maybe she was hurt, you know.  But you really have to stay focused in this moment and not to think if she's trying to break your rhythm or if she's really painful.  You just have to play the same game as you played before. 

Q.  Doesn't that hurt your game when you're interrupted in that way?

SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  The main thing is not to think about it.  Otherwise, if you think it hurts my game, it will hurt it.  You just play.  I mean, of course it does because, you know, I've been 2-Love up.  I knew it was important to just take my serve. 

Q.  I understand your birthday is tomorrow.  How are you going to celebrate?

SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  My birthday is during Wimbledon. 

Q.  Mistaken information.
