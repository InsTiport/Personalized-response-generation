MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

Q. You had a progression together the entire year, quarterfinals, semifinals, finals.
How does it feel now to win? 

AI SUGIYAMA: Well, this is really great. We just started to play together since the
beginning of this year. We starting really good the beginning, but still quarter in Grand
Slam Australian Open and semis in French, then final in Wimbledon. I mean, this is the
only chance that we going to make the final, and we have a really good chance to win this
tournament. We feel really great. Especially today is Julie's birthday, so she put me
pressure that we have to really have a good present. I mean, we play good. It's going to
be very good present for her, of course. That's great. 

Q. Becoming the No. 1 doubles team, how does it feel? 

AI SUGIYAMA: We're definitely very excited about this. We're practicing for doubles, as
well, not only for singles. I worked very good. Also our coach interested in doubles, too,
so we work very hard on doubles. Doubles is very fun to play and also fun to watch, I
guess. This is really great. Also Japanese peoples like to see doubles. This is great.
We're No. 1 team. This is something that we never thought about before, so this is
unbelievable.
