VERONIQUE MARCHAL: Questions in English for Julie. 


Q.  Are you disappointed about the match?  You were getting strong there. 

JULIE HALARD-DECUGIS:  When you lose, you are always disappointed, I think. 


Q.  What happened today?

JULIE HALARD-DECUGIS:  Today, I had many opportunities, but I had some ups and downs during the match.  Sometimes I was playing very well, and sometimes I missed some easy points.  It's the only differences, because she doesn't give some points, like some free points.  I missed some important ones.  That make the difference sometimes.  Even the first set, I had Love-40.  Second set, I had many chances, too.  Just a few easy points by the net that I missed sometimes. 


Q.  What is your impression of Kournikova's play?

JULIE HALARD-DECUGIS:  It was the first time I play her.  It's the first time.  I'm not have a good idea.  But, for sure, she was serving well today.  She's a very good baseliner, coming to the net, taking the ball early.  She's strong.  She's playing good again.  I don't know.  She's a good player. 


Q.  Each day we're putting an instructional tip in the paper just for recreational players.  If you were going to give one tip to someone, what would it be?

JULIE HALARD-DECUGIS:  To someone? 


Q.  Whatever she thinks. 

JULIE HALARD-DECUGIS:  I mean, the important thing is to have fun to play tennis, to be in good condition.  For me, it's to get healthy, to warm up well, to get healthy on the court and enjoy playing tennis. 

JULIE HALARD-DECUGIS:  Yes, to stretch.  I don't know.
