Q.  Maybe talk about the level of play he was and how difficult it was, his serve?
 
ANDREI MEDVEDEV:  He played great.  I mean, the biggest difference in our match was his serve, of course.  I couldn't get a lot of first serves in and he was serving great.  He served not less than 120 miles per hour first serve and over 100 second serve, his placement was great.  He played well.  But every time I lost my serve I was fighting.  I thought if I could get some points into my side; then could have been different match, but he played definitely better than me today.  I have no problems losing this match. 
 

Q.  You said yesterday you were going to use this like a practice match or a gauge of how well you are doing?
 
ANDREI MEDVEDEV:  Yeah, I mean, yesterday was kind of difficult for me to get rested after my doubles because we played about two hours doubles and I finished at 10 o'clock, I mean, quarter to 10.  It was difficult for me to get enough sleep today and with the rain delay, I was kind of getting sore in the locker  room.  But I mean, these are not the excuses because Pete played great.  I don't know if I could have beat him if I was fresh, but as a result of this match, I see that I am far away from where I could have been and the top guys are playing much better than me at the moment.  But I see my chances good because I was on the right track for the last six months and things can only get better, I think, for me.
