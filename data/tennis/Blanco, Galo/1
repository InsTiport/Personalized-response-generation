MODERATOR: Questions for Galo. 

Q. Did you ever play better on hard court in your life?

GALO BLANCO: On hard court? No. Probably is my best match in hard court. I don't know.
I'm so happy for that. 

Q. You seemed to return very well. 

GALO BLANCO: Last month I have problems with my return. I practice too much in the
returns. Today was very good.

Q. When you were down 1-3 in the last tiebreaker, what went through your mind?

GALO BLANCO: You don't think in anything, you know. When you have all the people
support, you and him, you cannot think in nothing, you know. You only play. You try to do
your best. That's all. 

Q. One of the most important match of your career before was against him in Paris, I
think, a few years ago. 

GALO BLANCO: Yeah, that was my most important match in my life. So I beat him here in
this tournament, and he beat me there in my tournament. That's life.

Q. What happened to you in between these two matches? 

GALO BLANCO: Between these two matches? I don't know. When I play quarterfinals in
Roland Garros, I was 18 or 19. I was too young. Probably I did quarterfinals and was okay
for me. Now here, I want to win this match because I no have confidence this year, I
didn't win a lot of matches. I wanted to play well.
