  THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
   
 Q. It was a good battle out there tonight. Are you more satisfied with your sensations today than the previous one?  
RAFAEL NADAL: Yeah, for me every improve is important for me today. Obviously I improved from yesterday. I played a much better match than yesterday.   
Happy for the victory. Is a victory against a good opponent like Vasek. Good news for me. As I said the first day that I was here, every victory is an opportunity to play another day, so more opportunities to try to practice the things that I need to do to try to be ready as soon as possible, especially for the beginning of next year. That's my goal, my most important goal.   
So today I did few things much better than yesterday, obvious. Other days during the season I was very consistent, without ups and downs. That's a good thing for me, very important for my game.   
   
 Q. If preparing for next season is your big goal, do you feel the pressure is off you in some ways?  
RAFAEL NADAL: The pressure?   
   
 Q. Do you feel there is less pressure if you are more practicing for next season than going for this title?  
RAFAEL NADAL: For this year, pressure?   
   
 Q. For this tournament.   
RAFAEL NADAL: For this tournament, no, no. The pressure is the same. When I say that, is not because I take out the pressure. No, I don't want to do that. It's not my goal.   
I am saying here the things that I feel. I am being honest saying that. Obviously I am in Beijing. Is a very important tournament, very important event, and I going to fight for every ball to try to have the better result possible.   
But Beijing is the immediate goal. But for me the most important goal is recover my level. Every victory give me opportunities to keep practicing the things that I need to practice. Practicing outside of the competition is very important, but at the end you have to compete well. Every match is an opportunity for me.   
   
 Q. Your next opponent is Jack Sock. What are your thoughts on that match?  
RAFAEL NADAL: He's young, very good player, aggressive, with fantastic serve. Very, very strong forehand. Going to be a big opponent for quarterfinals. I need to play better than today even.   
So tomorrow is day off for me. Good day for keep practicing things, try to improve the things that I need to keep improving. Hope to continue with that improvement since yesterday, today, tomorrow, after tomorrow. I really hope to be ready for the match.
