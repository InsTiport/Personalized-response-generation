 Q.  You played Juan Carlos four times before today.  You were successful.  What happened today? 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Maybe he play his best match against me for sure, no?  For sure I don't play my best match in my life, but I wasn't play very bad.  He play good match.  That's all.  I am playing better this week.  I am happy for that.  I improve a lot than last week. 
 But today I have my chances, but he play good important moments.  I play very bad especially the first tiebreak. 

 Q.  The rain delay came at a very bad moment for you, didn't it, 4-5 down, second set?  Did that increase the pressure? 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah, sure, was bad moment because I was coming back better.  I have one 15-40 in the last game.  He had two unbelievable serves.  But I have a very good chance there for won the second set, no? 
 So after that he play good.  He play unbelievable the second tiebreak.  Very, very good all points, no?  I was play very bad the first tiebreak, but after I have my chances, and he play better than me in important moments, no, so. 

 Q.  When you double-faulted in the first tiebreak twice, did you lose focus?  What do you think happened? 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  I don't know.  If I was know, I wasn't be the double-fault, no? 
 So, you know, sometimes you miss the feeling in some important moments.  Normally I don't have this problem, but today I had mistakes in important moments. 

 Q.  So how are you feeling about how you're playing heading into the Open? 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  I am improving.  I improve a lot here from Toronto.  That's important for sure.  Now I am disappointed but because I am playing better and was a good opportunity for me for play a good tournament here. 
 So I play the quarterfinal.  Is not very bad tournament.  But, sure, my expectative is a little bit better, no?  Okay, we will see in the Open, no?  I was practicing a lot this week.  I was working a lot this week.  That's important.  Good work, so I gonna continue.  I have one week and two days more for practice and for put me at my hundred percent physical in tennis. 
 So I will try that, no?  I have a lot of illusion in the US Open, so I gonna try. 

 Q.  Do you have the feeling that on hard court everything seems to be possible, more possible than on clay, on grass; every game seems to be very tough? 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  I don't know.  Maybe, you know, maybe if I am playing my best tennis today I was winning, no?  I have my chances. 
 But if you are not playing your best, the match always is very similar against any player.  And if Juan Carlos is playing with very good confidence - he was No. 1, he was one of the best players in the world - and he is playing well this week - he won against James Blake, one of the best on this surface, he won against Soderling yesterday - so that is a good result.  He is coming with confidence.  This is a tough match for me and for everybody.  I can lose, and I lose. 

 Q.  In the first set you seemed - very unusual for you - tired.  Was it the humidity?  You didn't seem to have the energy. 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah, yeah, I was tired some moments.  The humidity was unbelievable today.  Didn't know.  Maybe one month out of competition, sometimes when a match come back tough, you feel tired, no? 
 But that's important for my preparation for the US Open, too.  I play very tough match today, very tough match the first day, so that's important, too, for put me in my hundred percent, no?  I gonna continue working very hard next week for arrive to the U.S. with my best. 
 I don't know.  We will try.
