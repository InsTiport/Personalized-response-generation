6-1, 6-3
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. You feel very comfortable on the clay.  I would like to ask you, fans could be returning soon to Rome, a thousand spectators.  What do you feel about fans coming back to tennis?
RAFAEL NADAL:   Well, I feel great.  If it's safe enough, fantastic.  I'm sure that they make the things the best way possible, and even if 1,000 is not much, at least it's something, no?
Happy for the tournament and happy for the tennis by itself.
Q. Were you surprised anyway about this decision?  I mean, one week ago they said no.  Now they say yes.  Everything seems changing everywhere.  Also in Paris, 11,500, now 5,000.  Are you surprised and do you think abroad somebody will think, oh, Italy are a little crazy?
RAFAEL NADAL:   Oh, I'm not surprised.  The situation is how it is.  Very difficult and very unpredictable, so is normal that the things are changing quick.
Is normal that the people who have to make decisions, they do with the best precaution possible.  I don't expect easy things and I don't expect things prepared in advance, because it's difficult to know how the pandemic evolves during day situations.  Changes can change a lot, no?  So if the situation is good enough, fantastic, and welcome the fans.
Q. Obviously you have a great chance to match Roger's 20 slams if you win in Paris, and I know you don't like talking about the next tournament.  But what significance would that have to match Roger?  What would that mean for your legacy?
RAFAEL NADAL:   I always say the same.  I did all my career my way, and that's what I gonna keep doing, no?
For me is not an obsession at all, and I just did my way.  I can't be all the time thinking about what Roger had or what Novak or what the other...
I know that you put a lot of attention on all of this.  Of course I would love to finish my career with 25 (smiling) but something that probably will not happen.
I gonna keep fighting to produce chances, and then when I finish my career, let's see, no?  I just want to keep enjoying tennis.  And that's it.  If I am playing well, I know I normally have my chances.  If not, gonna be impossible.  That's it.
Q. Before the tournament you said how excited you were to be back.  Just how much fun are you having to be competing again, playing two solid matches?  What are you happiest with so far with your level?
RAFAEL NADAL:   I played two good solid matches, no?  I played at I think a very positive level of tennis.  Of course it needs to keep improving.  I need to keep working in a couple of things that things are not coming automatic.
But I can't ask for more, no?  Have been another great evening for me against another good opponent.  Can't complain at all, no?
Much better, not what I expected.  Tomorrow another opportunity to play against one of the best players of the world, Diego Schwartzman.  So let's see.
