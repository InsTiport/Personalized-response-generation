THE MODERATOR:  Questions.  
 
 
Q.  What did you think of his serve in the first set?  I think the second serve you faced was 152 miles an hour. 
 
RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah, I don't think the serve is the (deficit?) for the match.  I think I don't play my best tennis today, and if I don't play very good, I can't win, no?  
 
 
Q.  What exactly is the injury? 
 
RAFAEL NADAL:  No, no, is not injury, but I have soreness here.  
 
 
Q.  What was the difference between -- the first set he won 6-Love.  Then you went up 2-1.  At the start of the second set.  What was the difference there?  What were you differently in the second set that you weren't doing in the first set?
 
RAFAEL NADAL:  I think in the second set I am not a lot of nervous.  I very, very nervous in the first set.  But in the first game in the match I was one 30-Love in the first game.  I can won this game and begin with one break down against Roddick.  Is not easy.  
 
Q.  You just won a tournament in Poland.  You beat some top players.  Could you tell me, what is the difference between the players you beat in Sopot and Roddick playing today? 
 
RAFAEL NADAL:  Is very -- is not similar, no.  In Sopot I won good players, but the ranking of all the players I won is 70, 50, 60.  I don't know.  Is clay, no?  After my injury, I don't play very, very good.  I only play very well two or three matches.  I play against Chela in Stuttgart very well and against (inaudible) in Bastad.  But the other matches I can't play like the same before the injury.  
 
Q.  What are your impressions about the tournament in Poland and Poland in general?
 
RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah, I like the tournament because I won (smiling).  But, yeah, is good tournament.  Is very, very good tournament.  I was very, very good week in Sopot. 
 
Q.  You like the city?
 
RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah, I don't see the city.  
 
Q.  How impression do you have at playing Arthur Ashe Stadium?
 
RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah, but I play in the center court in Australia.  In Miami is good.  But I think is the biggest court in the world.  For me, is not... 
 
 
Q.  You beat Roger Federer earlier this year.  Now you played Andy Roddick.  How would you compare the two, Federer and Roddick? 
 
RAFAEL NADAL:  Is very, very different players, no.  Federer, I think, is my favorite.  For me, Federer play better.  He's very complete.  He have all...
