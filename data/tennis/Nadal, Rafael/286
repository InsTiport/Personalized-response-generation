2-6, 6-4, 3-0 (ret.)   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Can you just talk us through what happened out there.  Looked like the heat got to you.  Was it more than that?  
RAFAEL NADAL: Well, everything was fine until end of the first set.  I start to feel myself not very good.  It's getting worse, worse, and worse, so finally in the second set I realize that I was not able to keep playing.   
I tried to resist, but I get a little bit scared to be too dizzy and lose a little bit the (through translation off microphone.)   
So I call the doctor a couple of times, but I felt that I was not safe there so I decided to go.  I wanted to finish the match, but I seriously could not.   
 Q.  Do you think it was the heat or more than that?  You think you might have an illness of some kind?  
RAFAEL NADAL: Hopefully is nothing.  Hopefully is just the extreme conditions out there.  Something happen, hopefully is the beginning of a virus, and in combination with the conditions I had this strange feelings.   
But just finished half an hour ago, so I don't know.   
 Q.  Were you feeling ill this morning or last night or did you feel perfectly fine when you got on the court?  
RAFAEL NADAL: Perfect.  Nothing strange before the match, no.   
 Q.  Setting today aside you had a very good run at Indian Wells.  Given what you've seen of your season so far, what positives are you taking?  
RAFAEL NADAL: I was playing well during the match at the beginning, too.  When you have something like this then is impossible.  Was tough for me because I felt myself I was playing well; I had good practices after playing a great week in Indian Wells.   
It's a hard accident, but that's life and it's like this.  If the health is fine in a couple of days, so nothing important is there -- the most important thing is health than any tournament.  If I am able to practice in a couple of days I know I was playing well and I hope to be ready for the clay.   
 Q.  It's been almost six years since you've withdrawn from a tournament.  Is it difficult for you to do so?  Is it disappointing and difficult for you to pull out in the middle of a match in the manner you did today?  
RAFAEL NADAL: Yes, it's very bad feelings.  Even with very bad conditions I finished a lot of the matches in my career because I didn't want to retire.  Like Australian Open a couple of times; few more.   
But today was suffering for the health, for my health, so I didn't know what's going on.  I decided to stop because I was not sure that I can finish the match that way.   
 Q.  Have you experienced these sort of feelings before in a match?  If so, you can remember when that might have been, the way you felt today?  
RAFAEL NADAL: Yes, few times happened in my career, but not very often.  Every time is different.  You don't remember exactly the feelings of the other times.   
Sometimes I felt something similar, but today was not -- I was a little bit worse, so that's why I have to stop.   
 Q.  I know it's kind of difficult probably to say so now, but looking ahead to the clay court season, are you seeing that as is sort of major opportunity for yourself after the progress that you appear to have made this year generally?  
RAFAEL NADAL: Every tournament is an opportunity for me and for everybody.  If you are playing well, you have opportunities; if you are not playing well, you don't have opportunities.  That's the real thing.   
If I am playing like last year week it's obvious I'm going to have my opportunities on clay.  That's my goal.   
 Q.  Are you okay right now?  
RAFAEL NADAL: So-so.
