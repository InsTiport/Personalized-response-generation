THE MODERATOR:  Questions in Spanish, please. 


Q.  You fought until the last moment. 

RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah.  I haven't played too well.  But even though I've been training hard during the last weeks, I've seen there was something missing in the matches.  I don't know if it's physical, mental control, but I'm not playing as well as I used to.  But that happens.  It can happen.  What we have to do is to keep working hard.  True I haven't played well.  But last week was worse.  My game was more defensive.  This week I've changed this.  I've played in a more aggressive way.  That's I think one of the key steps forward and I can improve. 

Q.  Why do you think you're not playing as aggressively as before, as at the beginning of the season? 

RAFAEL NADAL:  I don't know why.  Maybe it's a bad period for myself.  Maybe I'm not confident enough.  But I have to work and continue as quickly as possible. 

Q.  Your serve today has not been good; it hasn't worked.  During training periods, you were better. 

RAFAEL NADAL:  No, I don't agree.  My serve did not worry me today.  It was a bit slower than it should have been today.  But the serve was not one of my weakest points today.  In fact, during training, I think I'm good at it.  I don't usually train with an aggressive serve.  Time will change my serve.  I'm worried about being aggressive. 

Q.  Were you worried to play against Corretja, to whom you lost? 

RAFAEL NADAL:  Sometimes I've lost against him.  I just want to congratulate him.  I played well throughout the season.  I think it has nothing to do that Corretja has had a bad year.  I just lost.  I started strong.  At the end, I was a little mixed up.  That was before, and this time I don't think I was confident enough.  I was calmer, but that was not enough either.
