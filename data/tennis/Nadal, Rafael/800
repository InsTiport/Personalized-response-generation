  Q.  What is your comment on your own performance today as well as Tommy's?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Well, I feel very happy, no?  I'm very happy with my first victory.  Was very important for me.  If I was losing, I am out of tournament.  So that's very important, no?   
 I feel good.  I was playing good with my forehand, with my backhand okay, too, and service with confidence, no?  So I play a complete match.  I am very happy.

  Q.  The other players have more and more chance to win when facing you?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  I don't know.  I don't know.  If you win a tiebreak, normally you are with more confidence, no?  I don't know.   
  
  Q.  Do you sense that you're starting to get better and better as this tournament goes on?  Did you feel better about your game today?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  I don't know.  I say two days ago I was playing okay.  The problem is not the games.  But today I play good, too.  I play more aggressive maybe with my forehand, trying to play with more winners, so I feel okay.  I played today better the important moments, for sure.  That's very important in the game, no?   
 I am happy.  I am very happy with my victory today because was tough the first day lose.  Today, well, if I lose, the last day.  But I am here (smiling).   
  
  Q.  It all comes down to this match against Nikolay Davydenko.  If you beat him, you're in the semis.  What are your thoughts on playing against him?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Going to be very difficult match, no?  He's playing at his best level.  He was playing very well the last weeks.  Two tournaments victories.  He won two days ago Tommy, and today he play good match.  He has the match, no?  He has the match in his hands.   
 But, well, Blake is difficult in some moments.  He return very good.  But the match against Davydenko and Blake was a very good match.  We will see tomorrow or after tomorrow.  I not play my best, like this, I can't win the match, but I going to try to play my best.
