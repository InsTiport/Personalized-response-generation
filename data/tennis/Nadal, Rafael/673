  6-2, 6-3, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. You've only dropped 11 games in two matches. How do you assess your form to this stage? You must be happy. 
 RAFAEL NADAL: Yes, I am happy, no? Sure, I played before first round, second round. But, anyway, was a good result today. The other guy play very, I think, irregular. Sometimes play well, sometimes he had some mistakes. So was tough match for get the rhythm.
