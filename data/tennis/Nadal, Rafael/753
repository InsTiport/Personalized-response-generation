   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.   
  
  Q.  A lot of people didn't think you could win Wimbledon, and you almost did.  Do you feel you could make the same kind of surprise statement here in New York?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah, I play a very good tournament there in Wimbledon, no?  Well, I improve this year.  I play better.  I think I play my better season of my careera.  Very happy about my season.   
 Anyway, if I during the year, last part of the year, for example, US Open, I play bad and I lose early, I gonna be happy about the season, no?   
 But for sure I am here practicing hard.  Have good preparation for this tournament.  Play Montr√©al.  Cincinnati I have problem.  I come here on Sunday, Sunday night, and I have one week practicing here before the tournament.  So I hope and I think that can help a little bit.   
  
  Q.  Since Cincinnati, how have you been physically?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  I feel fine.  Wasn't a big problem.  Strange, an accident.  I feel totally dizzy when I start the match.  But after two days, I am fine.  I am so much better.  Right now I practice four hours yesterday, no problem.   
  
  Q.  You come from a small village in Mallorca.  Are you used to being in big cities or do you prefer the small town where everybody knows you?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  I prefer the same like always.  I prefer be at home with the family, with the friends, my closer friends.  I know my friends from the school.  So I am very, very happy living in Mallorca.  Is a very nice place, very quiet place.  When I come there, I feel very good.  I can do everything.   
  
  Q.  What about spending a couple weeks in New York City?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah, for some weeks, it's very good.   
  
  Q.  What do you like to do in New York?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Well, normally I practice a lot, so is difficult do so much things.  I go to walk, too, walk for the city.  Yeah, every year normally when I am in the tournaments, I am not doing too much because when I finish the practice, I go to the room, I feel a little bit tired.  Watching films.  Sometimes playing a little bit with the PlayStation.   
 But here is a little bit different.  Is nice, closer to 5th Avenue.  I walk a little bit there.  My hotel is in front of Central Park.  So that is good.   
  
  Q.  Do you know anything about your first-round opponent?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Not much.   
  
  Q.  Do you know what he hooks like?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  No, sorry.   
  
  Q.  Will you be doing any studies on him?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  You never know, no?  I saw him this year maybe he won in Surbiton, challenger.  He played the final in Segovia, too.  Tough tournaments.  Gonna be a tough match.  The draw always depends if you are playing good or not, so...   
  
  Q.  You practice more or less at a Grand Slam than you normally would?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  The same.  Not much difference, no.  I like to practice two hours and a half, three hours every day before the matches, especially four days before the competition.  One day before, two days before, two hours maximum.   
  
  Q.  You like the French Open for obvious reasons.  Do you like the US Open?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  I like every tournament.  I enjoy every tournament.  The Grand Slams, every one is nice.  Well, this Grand Slam improve with the new locker room.  That's a very good improve.  And the players, we are very happy for that.  Sure, I like the US Open.   
  
  Q.  What did you learn from Wimbledon after losing to Federer where you could have capitalized on a break?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Winning Stuttgart the next week.  That's it.
