R. NADAL/D. Shapovalov   
6-4, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Rafa, please.   
 Q.  What was the difference, biggest difference, between this match and the one you played against him in Canada?  
RAFAEL NADAL: The surface, I think, probably the most importance.   
It was a solid match for me.  I started with some mistakes on the return.   Because with my serve, I didn't lose many points.   
But on the return at the beginning, I really think that he was serving big.  And I had couple of mistakes with the return, so it takes a while to have the break.   
That's the other thing.  I had 15-40 on break points, and then I had again 15-40 on some more break points.  So, it was a few opportunities missed in that moment.   
But then, was very positive that I make the break in the 3-all.  And then the match changed --  Well, the match didn't change a lot because, with my serve, I continually were winning the serves, more or less, comfortable way.   
But, in terms of the return, probably he stopped a little bit to serve that big.  And I was a little bit more relaxed, and I was able to not have more mistake  with it, too.   
 Q.  You play Fabio Fognini tomorrow.  You have quite a history, the two of you.  Can you tell us something about the way he plays and how you prepare, how you are going to prepare for this match?  
RAFAEL NADAL: I'm going to prepare like every day.  Just try to be ready for the match.  It's another match, quarterfinal match.  Every day the matches are becoming more important, of course.   
But, that's it.  It's a match against a great player with big talent.  And I know I have to play well to keep having chances to keep going on the tournament.   
And I hope to be ready for -- to make that happen, to play at the right level to be competitive and try to find the way to have my chances.   
 Q.  Are you happy with the sensation you have on your shot, or do you feel that is something you want to get better at?  
RAFAEL NADAL: No, always you can do things better.   
But it was not a comfortable match against a player that is lefty, serves big, and he goes for the shots.   
You know, a player that already he won a couple of matches here and make semifinals last week.   
So, being honest, 6-4, 6-1 and having a lot of break points before that in the first set and then not suffering much with my serve, I can't complain much about the match.  I should be happy the way that things went.   
 Q.  The ATP Next Gen finals are going to trial a towel rack at the back of the court.  
RAFAEL NADAL: What that is, a "tunnel rack"?   
 Q.  A towel.  Towel.  
 So the ball boys don't have to handle the towels all the time.  Do you think this is --  If it was introduced in the tour, do you think it would cause a problem because players are so used to asking the ball boys all the time?  What would be your thoughts?   
RAFAEL NADAL: I don't know.   
But I really think that we are doing sometimes stupid things.  Because that's not  the big improvement on the sport at all, you know.   
Ball boys are there for something.  So, at the end of the day, it's important to innovate, to create new things.  But I really don't believe that that creates any impact on the game.  For me personally, I really don't care at all.   
But being honest, I don't know.  If they want us to go faster between points and now we have to go behind the court for the towel, we have to go running for the towel, too.  So, don't make much sense.   
 Q.  I'm working on a story on David Goffin, who's the smallest guy in the top 10 but still has been able to have a lot of success.  What do you think is the biggest key to Goffin's success at this level?  
RAFAEL NADAL: He's very good.  He's very good in all aspects.  Nothing wrong on his game.   
When you are not that tall --  How tall is him?   
 Q.  180.  
RAFAEL NADAL: 180?   
He's not very small.   
 Q.  He's a light guy, too, he's only like 68 kilos, too.  
RAFAEL NADAL: Yeah.  But I don't think that's a disadvantage, you know.   
I believe, of course, if you are taller, maybe is a little bit more advantage because of the serve.  But 180 is not a drama, you know.   
He's super quick.  He has big talent.  So, you know, he's there because he has everything what -- about what a tennis player needs to become top player, I think.   
 Q.  You started to win here 14 years ago.  That's a long time.  You won seven times.  In other tournaments, you won maybe ten times.  Do you think there is a reason why here was maybe a little more difficult in the last five years?  Since 2013, you haven't won Rome again.  Do you think there is a reason or it's just a coincidence or something that you don't know how to explain?  
RAFAEL NADAL: No.  Of course, it's no confidence.  There's always a reason.  And there's a couple of reasons why these things happens.   
First thing, in 2015, I didn't win anything.  So, that's a year that is forget about.  Because I was not ready to compete at my highest level, I believe.   
And then, I am not 18, 19, 20, 21 anymore.  So, winning Monte-Carlo, winning Barcelona, playing finals, or  winning Madrid and coming here as the last event of the clay court season before Roland Garros, you get a little more tired probably mentally and maybe physically, too.   
But most importantly, mentally, no.  After a big run before these tournaments.  So, probably that's the biggest reason.   
And we talk about that.   
But, beside that, I won seven.  You know, it's not a bad number at all.   
And the normal thing is don't win that match, no.  Is lose more than you win.  And still I didn't win, but I lead a couple of finals.   
 Q.  Rafa, have you talked to Shapovalov before about his future?  I'm wondering what you think are his strengths and weaknesses.  And what advice would you give him to be a champion like you are?  
RAFAEL NADAL: He doesn't need any advice.  That's the real thing.  He's good in all aspects.   
And the only thing that -- the only thing that he needs is a little bit more time.  Maybe not that much.  (Smiling).  He's good.  He's very good.
