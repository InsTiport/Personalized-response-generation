R. NADAL/P. Mathieu
  6-4, 6-2, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Is it fair to describe that performance as your best of the tournament so far from your point of view? 
 RAFAEL NADAL: I didn't understand. 

 Q. Was it your best performance in the tournament so far? 
 RAFAEL NADAL: Today? No, not in my opinion. No, I think I played really well. But I was playing well the last matches too. But the opponent was different characteristics, so for my game, probably was a little bit easier to play, no? 
 Because I have more rallies from the baseline. The serve was a little bit easier to return than the last two matches. I was playing well from the baseline the last days, but I didn't have the chance to play. 

 Q. You will play Soderling in the quarterfinal. What's the key to beat him on grass?
 RAFAEL NADAL: No, sure, gonna be a really tough match. I think probably is one of the more difficult opponents that you can play on all surfaces today, but especially here. I think he's playing with big confidence, big serve, perfect flat shots and long from the baseline.
 So he's playing great. Gonna be very difficult match for me I think. Hopefully for him, too. (Smiling.)

 Q. Did you notice the police escorting a fan out at like the end of second set. I think you were waiting to serve when they were taking him out. Did you notice it at all?
 RAFAEL NADAL: I didn't know. I didn't know. Sorry. I know nothing. 

 Q. Did you have any problems from your knee? If not, what did you do after the last game to make sure it was good for today? 
 RAFAEL NADAL: I tried my best, no? I take antiinflammatories. I did a lot of treatment with the physio, with the doctor. 
 Today it was better. I didn't feel pain today, but, you know, you never know. It's there, but wasn't the problem today. Hopefully gonna be fine for the next day, too.

 Q. Prior to the match, it was announced that you were fined $2,000. What is your reaction to that? 
 RAFAEL NADAL: What's that? 

 Q. After the coaching accusation with your uncle from the last match, you were fined $2,000. 
 RAFAEL NADAL: Yeah.

 Q. What are your thoughts about that penalty?
 RAFAEL NADAL: No, that's the rules are the rules. I gonna speak with the person that I -- well, I already spoke with the person that I had to spoke. Nothing to say here. 

 Q. You've watched the World Cup you mentioned before during the week. What are your thoughts about whether there should be a replay rule video used in the World Cup?
 RAFAEL NADAL: I completely agree with that. Yeah, was unbelievable the match of -- both matches of yesterday, especially the first one. England against Germany was -- well, first thing is the referee must see that, for sure, because it's half meter inside.
 Second thing, if the referee don't see, have to do it, I don't know, you have to put Hawk-Eye on something to see that. All the sports of world have technology, so football must have something soon, especially in this kind of competitions. World Cup is one time every four years, and the second goal of England must -- the goal was fair. After that, the match change completely. Maybe England can be in quarterfinals if that doesn't happen.
 So change everything. I think that FIFA must change that, is my opinion.

 Q. You did win against Robin Soderling a couple of weeks ago in France. What do you think will be the difference playing here on grass?
 RAFAEL NADAL: I said before, I think the match is completely different. Nothing similar to play on grass than on clay. I think his game is good in every surface. 
 Probably is even more difficult stop him here, because the ball go faster and gonna be very difficult to return and difficult to stop him from the baseline. 
 But I gonna try. 

 Q. Yesterday was Sunday. Did you have a chance to relax? What did you do? Did you go into London?
 RAFAEL NADAL: No.

 Q. Just practiced? 
 RAFAEL NADAL: I only practiced 20 minutes, but I watched England, England/Germany. I did treatment in the afternoon with the doctor and with the physio. I watched Argentina/Mexico in the evening. I played a little bit video games and watch a film in bed and that's it.

 Q. Those biscuits, are they the Mallorcan biscuits? 
 RAFAEL NADAL: That is the most important biscuit in Mallorca. That's my favorite. In every tournament I have 100 of these bags. Tomorrow I gonna give you one. You have to try. (Laughter.) Very good.

 Q. Are you at all concerned about your knees for tomorrow's match, given you had to play back-to-back days, today and tomorrow?
 RAFAEL NADAL: I don't gonna play tomorrow.

 Q. Excuse me. But are you concerned going forward that they're just gonna continue to get sore or sorer?
 RAFAEL NADAL: I don't have the control of my knees. I don't know what's gonna happen, no? I try my best to be ready. I tried my best after the last match to be fit for today. I did well. 
 Gonna be the same for after tomorrow. We will see what's happen. I am here to try my best even with pain on the knees or without pain of the knees. I gonna try my best in all the conditions.

 Q. How has your relationship with Robin changed through the years?
 RAFAEL NADAL: Every time I play against him you gonna ask me the same question. But I don't have any problem with Soderling. I had a little bit problem in this tournament few year ago. After that I never had any problem with him.
