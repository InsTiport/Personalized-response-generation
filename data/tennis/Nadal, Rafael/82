R. NADAL/J. Chardy
6-0, 6-1
(Transcribed from recorded ATP audio.)
Q. You must be delighted by the way you launched your Rome campaign.
RAFAEL NADAL: Yes, good start.  Happy with the victory.  Happy because have been almost around one hour.  That's important for what's coming up.
Q. You meet Nikoloz Basilashvili in the third round.  He only took one game in your last meeting on clay.  Much improved since 2017.  How do you approach that match?
RAFAEL NADAL: Yeah, tough one.  He's a great player, very dangerous.  He hit the ball very strong.  Will be a tough one.
He already won two great matches here.  Going to be a big challenge.  Is a big test for me and I'm excited to play that match this afternoon.
