 THE MODERATOR: Rafa will make a statement in English about what happened, and then we'll continue with the Spanish part of the press conference that we didn't get to.   
 RAFAEL NADAL: I have to say in English? I just have cramping in my leg. That's all. I don't know. There are no questions. I already finished my press conference in English. I talked half an hour.   
 I just have cramping in front and behind. That's why I, was so painful. That's all.
