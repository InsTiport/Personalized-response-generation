THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  It was a tough battle.  Rafa, are you happy to end this week on a good note?  Pablo, can you talk about your past month, playing pretty good tennis?  
RAFAEL NADAL: Yes, win is always a win.  That's like this.  We enjoy together.  We played some good matches here, I think, winning against some good players.   
Yeah, is always a positive thing finish a tournament with a victory, even if it's in doubles.  That makes you feel on competition, too.  You feel happier going to the next tournament.   
Especially winning with a good friend, too, is something that is a bit more special.  So we're happy for that.   
PABLO CARRENO BUSTA: For me also I think we are focused in the singles.  But when you lose in singles, you continue play in doubles.  You try to do your best.   
Always win is important.  So I think we are ready to go to Shanghai now and to play singles again.   
 Q.  This morning you spent a lot of time practicing net play.  How do you feel about your net performance?  
RAFAEL NADAL: This morning we practiced like a normal practice.  Doubles is not a big deal for us in terms of physical performance.  For sure, when you are in a final, you want to be ready to try to win it because always a title is a title.  That's another title, and an important one, because is a great event.   
But, you know, for us the goal is try to be ready for the next week, too.  We practice for one hour and a half, more or less, trying to work the things that we need to work for next week.   
PABLO CARRENO BUSTA: I completely agree (smiling).
