7-5, 6-1

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. When did you first start feeling the problem with the foot?
 RAFAEL NADAL: Well, the Sunday in the night. When I wake up for 6:00 in the morning for come here, I put the foot on the floor and I can't put the foot on the floor. So I call the trainer for -- my trainer for come to the room and put something for can go to the airport, and I did. 

 Q. So you were in pain when you were moving, when you were running on the court, were you?
 RAFAEL NADAL: Well, you know, it's very difficult prepare in a match, you know. For sure Juan Carlos is a very tough opponent.
 So especially if you are playing Masters Series and you are not 100%, it's impossible win the matches, no? Especially in this tournament. Every match is very tough and Juan Carlos is a very good player, so congratulate him. 
 Today I wasn't play my best tennis, so I -- the true is I didn't feel very good on court. I can't put the legs on the floor with my power. I can't put the ball long, so every time I play very short because I don't have power in the legs. 
 Because I have this point the point behind the foot, pain, so it was tough for me to. But anyway, I happy about my attitude: try to go on court and try to try my best. 

 Q. Were you close to not play? Were you hesitating not to play? 
 RAFAEL NADAL: Well, today in the morning when I wake up I say it's impossible to play, no? Later, I come here, prepare in the practice. I was in the doctor's, like yesterday and before yesterday, and they put special protection, very big protection. They put some cream, anesthetic cream, something like this, for didn't feel the same pain. 
 Anyway, it's tough, because when the foot was inside of the -- well, I can't put the foot like this. I always went like this because I scared, no? 
 So, you know, the calendar is impossible. Last week and in Barcelona everybody is talking about how you feel about the calendar and everything. I said for me going to be impossible four weeks in a row playing well, no? They told me, Yes, but you have already two playing very well. 
 I said, Yes, but in a few days you going to see why it's impossible, and disappointing they going to see. Finally they see it's impossible, no? Just congratulate Juan Carlos, because this is an important win for him, I think. He's trying to go to Olympics, too, so important points for him. 
 Just happy for him because he's a nice guy and a very good player. That's it, no? I just try to at home have some rest, and after try to go with my best feelings to Hamburg. 

 Q. You know that Etienne of the ATP is here. Are you going to talk to him and say the same thing you told us about the calendar, what you said in Barcelona? I know you have told him already, but do you think there is a chance that something can change, or you don't think anything will change?
 RAFAEL NADAL: I don't have nothing to speak with this man, no? Not more. 

 Q. Don't trust him? 
 RAFAEL NADAL: Lose more time trying to fight for nothing it's very stupid, so I have -- it's stupid. Last year I have a lot of time -- lose a lot of time trying to understand why he doing these things, and he's impossible to understand. 
 So right now it's not the moment for speak about that because I lose, and when I lose always the people think about it as an excuse for my lose. So I spoke about this in Monte-Carlo and Barcelona when I win. When I lose I don't like to speak about these things. 

 Q. Does this mean your participation in Hamburg is maybe under threat because of injury? 
 RAFAEL NADAL: Hopefully no, no? Because two Masters Series without play in the best conditions on clay going to kill me, no? So I hope not. 

 Q. Every place where you lose you are unhappy for sure, but Rome you are more unhappy than somewhere else, or not, or all the same?
 RAFAEL NADAL: For sure it's very important tournament for me here. Lose here is very, very tough for me just for everything, no? For the crowd because the crowd support me a lot always. So I just can say thanks very much, because probably I won in 2005 and 2006 for the support of the crowd. So that's tough for me. 
 Very nice for me coming back here, but at the same time, very disappointing for me to come here without my best preparation. That's true, no? 
 Finally, I can't do more, no? I play my best and I am here. I try to prepare with my best motivation the first two days here practicing: first day twenty minutes; second day one hour but without move and without play points, without nothing. 
 So it's very difficult to prepare for a tournament like this, no?

 Q. (In Italian.) What was your feeling inside especially being used to winning so much? Was there any particular feeling that you felt losing today? 
 RAFAEL NADAL: The feeling is, well, normally I know more than you how tough is win a lot of the matches on clay and in every surface, so I am prepared for this moment because I know already when I go on court everything can happen and I can lose every day. 
 Right now for sure I'm disappointing because it's very important tournament for me and important because I have chances for improve in the ranking and for don't lose points and continue to improve in the race. Disappointing for me I can't be 100% and I can't win, so it was tough.
