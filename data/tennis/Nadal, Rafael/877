THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  You must be pleased with your current form. 

RAFAEL NADAL:  Okay. 

Q.  It was rather easy for you there tonight. 

RAFAEL NADAL:   Yes, I am.  I am happy.  I play the first set and the second set I think I play very well.  In the final of the match, I little bit scared, but it's okay.  Finally I have one breakpoint down in the 5-2 -- in the 5-3.  I have matchpoint in the 5-1, 5-2.  I don't have good luck in these two points.  But finally I can won in the 5-3.


RAFAEL NADAL:  And I can win the match. 

Q.  It looks like it's going to be Hewitt next round.  You played him last year.  Are you looking forward to that? 

RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah.  Last year I lost against him here, and I play in Australia and in Toronto.  Here I lost 7-6, 7-6, 6-3.  And in Toronto I lost 6-1 for me, 6-4 for him, and 6-3 for him, no?  It's very, very difficult match, hard.  But I am playing good.  I am in the fourth round.  Is my best result in one Grand Slam.  I have confidence with this match, no.  I want play very good match.  If I play very good match and Hewitt not his best match, I think I have one chance.
