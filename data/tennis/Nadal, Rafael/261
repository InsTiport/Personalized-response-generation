THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.

Q. Rafa, that must have been mighty tasty. Talk about what it means to you to win the gold in doubles. You're one of only four tennis players who have ever won singles and doubles. 
RAFAEL NADAL: Thank you very much. It was amazing experience, especially doing that with one of my best friends, with Marc, is something unforgettable for me, for both of us, I think. 
Win a gold medal today after two months and a half with no practice, with no preparation at all, just working on the gym, is something that is a dream, no? 
The moment was unbelievable, and we had fun. We fight hard. The only thing that we can say is that we are very, very happy. 

Q. Rafa, I saw you winning Roland Garros and one Olympic gold medal, but I never saw such enthusiasm. How do you explain it? Is it because you are two friends? I never saw you so enthusiastic. 
RAFAEL NADAL: I think I am always enthusiastic, sometimes less, sometimes more. Depends on the feeling on every moment. But I am a passionate player, that is the real thing. I play with passion, I play with emotions. 
Is a very special event, a unique event for me and I think for everybody, no? Olympic Games is only once every four years. You never know if that's the last Olympics for me or not. Hopefully not, but is a possibility. 
I only competed in two Olympic Games. I competed in Athens, but I had 16. I competed in Beijing, and I could not compete in London four years ago. The chances are just a few ones. Have two gold medals with me is something unbelievable. Yeah, extremely happy. 

Q. Marc, you're an Olympic gold medalist. What are you thinking right now?
MARC LOPEZ: I have problems with my English. Can I answer with Spanish maybe? 
(Through translation.) It's a very unique and special occasion. Sharing these feelings with Rafa, being together at the Olympic Village, it's really a dream come true. All the things we've done together, I am the happiest man on Earth.
