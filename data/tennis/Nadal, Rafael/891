MODERATOR:  Good afternoon, Ladies and Gentlemen.  Rafael Nadal.  We'll take questions in English first and translate them into Spanish simultaneously. 


Q.  Would you say that you were pleased to see the rain when it came?  When you had the break, you were looking a bit tired. 

RAFAEL NADAL:  Yes, I think it came at a good moment for me because I think he was hot at that moment and maybe I wasn't hitting the ball that well right now.  So I think, yeah, it came to my advantage, the rain break. 

Q.  You seemed to be enjoying yourself as well on grass today.  Do you feel more and more comfortable on grass? 

RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah, I feel better.  But I think I still played better the first two sets of my first round than I played today.  Yeah, today I started off well, but then towards the end of the second set, the beginning of the third set, I didn't play that well.  So I think the first two sets that I played in the first round were my best tennis here. 

Q.  Was that because of a lower level or a lack of stamina that you let your game drop slightly? 

RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah, it was a combination of a couple of factors.  He started to play well in the second set, towards the end of the second set, and also I wasn't that fast with my legs.  That's very important on this surface. 

Q.  What did you change in your play compared to the clay?  Do you change movements, shots? 

RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah, I changed a little bit of everything, like the grip for my forehand and backhand are different, and my serve has got more slice. 

Q.  Has your elbow been troubling you at all since you've been playing on grass? 

RAFAEL NADAL:  No, everything is okay. 

Q.  How far do you think you can go in the championships? 

RAFAEL NADAL:  Well, the most normal thing is that, you know, I should lose in the next round.  Before coming here I said if I could lose my first round in five sets, I would have signed that, I would have been happy, because I couldn't play for a month.  You know, no competition for a month.  Now I can only say I'll do my best and we'll see. 

Q.  Most Spanish players have not had much success on grass.  What do you think about your success on grass?  What is it due to? 

RAFAEL NADAL:  No, I think it's changing right now because Spanish players are starting to get good results on these kind of surfaces.  You can see that especially, you know, from the young players coming up that, you know, have the interest to play on these surfaces and develop their games.
