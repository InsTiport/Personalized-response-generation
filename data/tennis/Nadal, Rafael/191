R. NADAL/A. Ramos-Vinolas
7-6, 6-2
Q. Can you give us your thoughts about being in the quarterfinals here, and also your thoughts on what happened yesterday in Barcelona.
RAFAEL NADAL: For sure very happy to be in the quarterfinals.  Was a tough match this afternoon against Albert, and now another very, very difficult match against Kyrgios, no?
So I just need to be ready, to play my best.  The only way to try to have success in that match against Nick is just playing aggressive and play very focused all the time, and of course play at a great level of tennis.
And, yeah, what happened yesterday in Barcelona was, of course, terrible.  Everyone is very, very sad.  I don't have words to say, because when these kind of things happen, is difficult, no?
All my support to Barcelona, and especially to the people that are suffering a lot, for all the families of the victims, no?  So just keep going and sorry for everything.
