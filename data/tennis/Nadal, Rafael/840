  Q.  You found it a little bit difficult to begin with, did you?  RAFAEL NADAL:  No, no, because I begin 1-0 with break 40-0 in my serve.  So here in this moment I lost my concentration.  I make a double-fault.  But I was 2-1 down and 30 -- Love-30.  And after I can won this game (indiscernible).  Maybe I play little bit better after, no, in the second set.  When I won the first, I play a little bit more aggressive in the second.  So that's better, no.  Q.  Overall, are you satisfied now with your progress on clay after these two matches?  RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah, yeah, I improve a little bit, today especially in the second set.  But I need improve more, no, I need improve every day little bit.  I was playing on clay very good last year, but is a long time ago, no.  So I need little bit more confidence, little bit more matches.  I hope gonna be better, no, tomorrow.  Q.  Let's have a football question.  We have Fabregas playing for Arsenal and a lot of Argentines playing for Villareal tonight.  Who are you going to support?  RAFAEL NADAL:  Sorry, but I gonna support Villareal, no.  He's (sic) a Spanish team.  But Arsenal was have a very good team, and the Spanish guys, too, no.  Q.  What do you think is missing from your game at the moment?  You say you're not as happy as you were last year on clay.  RAFAEL NADAL:  No, no, no, no, no, I don't say.  I don't want to think about last year.  I don't want to compare this year and last year, no.  This is a different year.  And if I do the comparation (sic), always is bad, because last year I won all, no.  But last year I won lot of tournaments, but I not play very well all matches, no.  Sure, that's sure.  Maybe I need to play little bit more matches, you know, on clay, no?  Is my second match.  Maybe finally in the second set I move a little bit better, I go a little bit more in.  Then play little bit more tough and with a little bit more aggressivity.  So that's all, no.  And serving a little bit better I need, too, but maybe that's why - I gonna serve better when I gonna play matches.  End of FastScripts...
