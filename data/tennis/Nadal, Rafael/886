THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 


Q.  What were your thoughts of your performance tonight? 

RAFAEL NADAL:  I played well the whole match.  I thought that my performance was very good tonight and that the match was very good.  I had opportunities to perhaps win a set, which I was not able to do.  Towards the end, I started to feel a bit tired.  The physical aspects started to catch up with me.  But I was very happy with my performance. 

Q.  There's much talk in Australia that you one day can become the world's No. 1 tennis player.  Does a performance like that give you hope that you can achieve that? 

RAFAEL NADAL:  Becoming the No. 1 is quite a difficult process.  I hope that one day I can reach that level.  But it depends on a lot of things.  You know, I just hope that I will make it at some stage to No. 1.  But it's not dependent on just the match tonight, but on a number of things. 

Q.  Were you over-awed at all by going out in front of 15,000 people, all of whom were cheering for Lleyton?  You didn't seem like you were. 

RAFAEL NADAL:  I was nervous at the beginning of the match, just like any other match.  I don't think I was over-awed by the 15,000 people.  Perhaps a little bit because I was playing on Centre Court in a Grand Slam tournament.  Perhaps that might have affected me a little bit.  But really not that much.

Q.  What are your thoughts of Lleyton's performance? 

RAFAEL NADAL:  Lleyton is a great player.  He played very, very well.  My strength is my forehand.  Lleyton played his forehand very, very well tonight.  That's why he won at the end.
