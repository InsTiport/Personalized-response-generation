 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. How much of an advantage do you think you had just because Feliciano had never played on that court, had never played that late?  
 RAFAEL NADAL: No, he played in that court.  
  
  Q. Oh, I thought he said he had not.   
 RAFAEL NADAL: I remember very good match against Roger in this court few years ago. He won the first set.  
  
  Q. He talked about the advantage you had.   
 RAFAEL NADAL: Well, sure, is difficult court to play. Is not easy. Is not easy for me, and I play almost every -- last year I played almost every day on this court. So I imagine for Feli is a little bit more difficult, no?   
 But, yeah, finally is tennis court, yeah. Is true wind is more difficult on center court than outside courts. In my opinion, the center court is a little bit faster than the other ones. But that's all.   
  
  Q. Does the time of day make any difference? Is it harder to play it at 11:00 p.m. than 1:00 p.m.?  
 RAFAEL NADAL: Yeah, but I am here, too, no? Feliciano, he started at 11:30, but I don't know what time, at 11:00, but I started, too. Doesn't make any difference.  
  
  Q. How important was it for you to jump out 3-Love in the first set and really set the tone?  
 RAFAEL NADAL: I didn't understand.   
 (Through translation.)   
 Well, the important thing is with 3-0 I have an important advantage to win the first set, and the first set is always very important. But at the same time, he had good chance to come back with 3-2, I think. No, 4-2, 4-3? I don't know.   
 But he had another chance with Love-40 one game. So with two second serves he had two mistakes on the return of the two second serves, so was a big mistake for him in that moment.   
 After that, I think my serve was working well all the time, so I had opportunities on the return. I convert not every one, but I convert the set, so it was enough.  
  
  Q. What's the scariest thing about Verdasco to you?  
 RAFAEL NADAL: Everything. He's a very complete player. He has all the shots and he's playing very well, no? Much better than he did last months, so gonna be very difficult match. I saw him play today, and I saw him play against Nalbandian the other day.  
 He's playing very good tennis, so gonna be a very interesting match. I have to play aggressive, to play well. It not gonna be impossible, I think.  
  
  Q. Do you think you've got any edge just because of how long he spent on the court today?  
 RAFAEL NADAL: Well, I don't know. We don't know yet, no? We will see in one day and a half.   
 I think we are fit enough to resist that. It was four hours?   
  
  Q. Four-and-a-half.   
 RAFAEL NADAL: What? Four hours 23, so, yeah, was long, but I played in Australia five hours 15 minutes in semifinals, and I had to play the final one day later.  
 So I was very tired, but I was ready. I think for sure he gonna be ready.  
  
  Q. You have not lost your serve or a set the whole tournament. When you're serving this well, do you feel your whole game lift?  
 RAFAEL NADAL: No. No, I think I am playing well, but I not playing yet at my highest level, but I am playing well.  
 To be in quarterfinals of the US Open without lose a set and without lose a serve, two things must work really well: the concentration and the serve.   
 Without these two things you gonna lose for sure serves, no? So both things was worked very good. I think every day I played a little bit better, no? The conditions some days are not easy, like today. The opponent is not easy, too, because the rhythm against Feli is not always the right rhythm to play good because he plays light, he goes to the net, very good serve.   
 So I think I am playing better and better every day, and I had to play a little bit better this match.
