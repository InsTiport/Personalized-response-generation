I just can say thank you very much for the England people and the London people. I felt the same last week in Queen's. Well, I am very happy about the crowd here always. 
 I know if I play against Andy Murray, probably the crowd gonna be with him. But I think with me gonna be nice, too, no?

 RAFAEL NADAL: If I say that and today I won 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 I going to be very stupid, no? 

 Q. If Andy Murray doesn't win Wimbledon, do you think the crowd here would like you to win it more than anybody else now?
 RAFAEL NADAL: Ask the crowd. I am not nobody for say what the crowd wants. I just can say when I go on court I feel the crowd support me a lot. 

 Q. Federer said before that he had a quiet week. Can we say the same for you, you had a quiet week?
 RAFAEL NADAL: Never quiet. Never is quiet, no? Always is difficult. Every match. Sometimes you win with easy result, but in every match you have some difficult moments. 
 So I don't want to say and I don't like to say is a quiet week. Is important week because I am in quarterfinals, so is a very good result being in quarterfinals here for the third time in a row here in one difficult tournament like Wimbledon and playing like this. But quiet, never.
