 Q.  Roger was saying earlier that it was difficult to play an Italian here in Rome. 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Roger say?  Against Italian player? 
 Q.  Yes. 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah, but the public stay very good today, no, very respect to us.  So when I play the final last year, the public supported me a lot.  When I go to the Davis Cup in Napoli against Italy, the public stay very good with me, no, all the time.  Sure, the public support Volandri or the Italian player, but very good, no.  Understand perfect.  They respect to us, no. 
 I want to say thank you very much because when I play against the other players, the public stay a lot with me and support me a lot.  So very happy for that, no. 
 Q.  Could you just talk about playing Henman next. 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah, against Henman, no, is a difficult match.  He play very aggressive.  He don't has easy game, no (speaking in Spanish). 

 RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah.  I need to stay with my very focus.  Sure, I gonna have a difficult match, and try play good for the victory, no. 
 Q.  (Through translation.)  So you lost once against Volandri.  Did you expect an easier -- sorry, a more difficult match tonight? 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  (Through translation.)  In fact, I played three times against him and, yes, I did expect a tougher match because he's a great player.  But it was obviously a difficult match for him.  I started very well and I was moving him around so he was a little bit nervous.  He was making some unforced errors which gave me confidence because I knew that even if I was to make a mistake, then I would still be able to break him.  So that helped me a lot. 
 Q.  (Through translation.)  When you were down 2-1, 0-40 for Volandri, did you think that the match could change? 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  (Through translation.)  Well, we were still in the match so the match wasn't over at all.  In the following shots I had a little bit of luck, but then I played very well and he made some mistakes.  I served very well. 
 And then the match was somehow over because afterwards he lost 0-40, so the match was over at that moment more or less. 
 Q.  (Through translation.)  Do you feel more comfortable with your serve? 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  (Through translation.)  I don't know.  This year I haven't lost here in Rome my serve tonight.  But in Barcelona I did lose it many times. 
 I think I am the 7th in the ATP ranking of the players who lose their serve less often, so it's quite amazing for me, for my standard.  It's a good record. 
 Q.  (Through translation.)  Federer this morning met the Pope.  Do you think that it will give him some advantage to beat you? 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  (Through translation.)  I don't think he needs it.  I think he can do it on his own - well, I hope not anyhow.  We will meet, if we meet in the finals, it is a long way ahead and there is time. 
 Q.  (Question asked and not translated.) 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  (Speaking Spanish.) 
 BENITO PEREZ-BARBADILLO:  What he said, basically, especially two years ago he was playing more under pressure.  He's not a player who normally is under pressure.  He's not always a guy who is always attacking.  He has a middle way of playing.  He hits very well the ball, and that probably gives the feeling to the player he's under pressure all the time.  He doesn't have a big winner like Moya, Federer.  Blake this year, he felt under pressure all the time. 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  In Indian Wells. 
 BENITO PEREZ-BARBADILLO:  In Indian Wells.
