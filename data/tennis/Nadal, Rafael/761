   THE MODERATOR:  Rafael Nadal.  Questions, please.   
  
  Q.  Some people looked at the draw and said if he gets by Youzhny, Berdych won Halle.  You must be feeling pretty good.   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah, maybe for this Wimbledon I don't have the best draw.  I have a very difficult draw.  But, yes, today I play a good match.  Was very difficult play with this wind.   
 Well, very happy with my game and with the victory, because today was very, very tough game.   
  
  Q.  It's amazing considering the championship that you've had, you are the first player to get into the semifinals.   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Unbelievable but true.  Was big chance for be the last.   
  
  Q.  Is it an advantage to be first in?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Well, right now is not much time.  If Djokovic and Baghdatis play five sets, it's hours, little bit.  But maybe if they play a normal match, anyway, is two hours of advantage.  Not much.   
  
  Q.  Tomas said the wind out there was so bad it was almost impossible to play good tennis.   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah, is difficult play very good tennis.  That affect him, especially his serve.  I tried to be very concentrate all the time with positive attitude in all moment and try to be in movement all time, no?   
 So I can't stop, because if you stop the ball, it's moving a lot from one side to the other side.  So I just try to be very focused on the ball.   
  
  Q.  How important was it to win in three sets today?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Well, important after especially two very, very tough games, tough matches against Soderling and Youzhny.  The most important thing is the victory.   
  
  Q.  You said yesterday you played your best three sets on grass.  Do you think you played better today?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Better, no.  With this wind, is impossible play better than yesterday.  But for the conditions, I play very, very good match because I know I beat one of the best players in the world, especially in this surface.   
 Is very, very good victory for me.  This year I am very happy about my Wimbledon, I'm in semifinals.  But beating very good players, Fish, Soderling, Youzhny and Berdych:  all very tough players, good players, in all surfaces, but grass more.  So very happy about my Wimbledon right now.   
  
  Q.  Does it feel like a different Centre Court, the character of the court?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  A little bit more wind.  Yeah, is different, no?  Maybe the Centre Court has more character with the old roof, no?  That's the cathedral of the tennis.   
 Like this, looks a little bit strange, a little bit different.  Well, my opinion last year's was the best Centre Court in the world.  Right now, not, no?   
  
  Q.  If it turns out that you make it to the finals, Roger makes it to the finals, how different will the feeling be this year versus last year when you faced him?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Well, right now I'm in semifinals, semifinals against Djokovic or Baghdatis.  Going to be very tough match.  Just think about this, about that.  If tomorrow I win, you can ask me.   
  
  Q.  You played on three different courts now.  If you have a choice for tomorrow, would you prefer to play on Centre Court or No. 1?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Doesn't matter.   
  
  Q.  Roger doesn't give up too many sets on grass.  He gave one to Juan Carlos today.  Does that surprise you?  How do you think you would have played had you not played for six days in a row?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Is difficult play after long stop because you lost little bit rhythm.  But, well, Federer, maybe he's winning in the third right now, too, no?   
 Juan Carlos was playing great tournament, is playing very good level, so he gonna fight all match.  But Federer continue be the favorite.   
  
  Q.  Two Spaniards in the last eight.  What are the secrets?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Secret?  No secret.  Just fight every match.  That's important for us, have two Spanish in quarterfinals of tournament like this, Wimbledon, on grass.  Long time ago we didn't have that result, so is very good for us.   
  
  Q.  Do you think the difficulty you've had in getting through this draw might ultimately help you, make you sharper?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Well, be in semifinals, anyway you play one guy or other one, is good for the confidence, no, because you have to win good matches for be in semifinals of one Grand Slam.   
 But this Grand Slam, especially I beat very good players, so that's give me good confidence.  But I know tomorrow I gonna have another test, another difficult test against Baghdatis or Djokovic.  They're playing very good.   
 Just try to continue like this, no, with positive attitude and play aggressive like this.   
  
  Q.  You've had two five-setters, one over five days.  You've rain, wind, lightning, thunder.  Can anything stop you this year?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Maybe Djokovic or Baghdatis tomorrow (laughter).   
  
  Q.  Do you get nervous before your matches, before a semifinal in a Grand Slam?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  I'm always nervous before match.  If is important match, more.  Semifinals of any Grand Slam, for sure.   
 But, well, I have experience.  Is my fifth maybe semifinal in my career in Grand Slam.  So experience help a little bit, no?  A little bit less pression for me here than Roland Garros, no?   
 I can enjoy a little bit more the moment because you're in semifinals and you don't think -- yeah, I play good tournament, lose in a semifinal of a Grand Slam is very good tournament.  But, well, that is a little bit more pression than here, no?
