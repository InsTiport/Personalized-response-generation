  THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.   
  
  Q.  Can you tell us how nice it is to win a title again after quite a long time?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Well, to win a title always is very nice, but I won a Masters title, so that is special.   
  
  Q.  A lot of people were very surprised that it was eight months since the previous one.  What's the reason for that do you think?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  As I say, every tournament I win, people ask me, it was some months without title.  That's true, no?  But, well, I was in quarterfinals US Open, quarterfinals in Australia, and semifinals in Shanghai.  I wasn't win, but I am there all the time, just trying, trying, trying, and that is what I feel.   
 Last week I feel very, very well that finally I can win.   
  
  Q.  Has it always been a question of fitness, of physically being fit?  Has that also been a factor in this?  You had the injury in Australia.   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Well, it is important always not have injuries.  That's very, very important, but after that, I am fine all the way.   
  
  Q.  When I last spoke to you, you talked about hitting the ball from further up the court and serving a little harder.  Do you feel you are adding to your game?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Well, I always try and improve, no?  I am very young.  I just try to look forward.  That's very important for me, and I am trying to play a little more aggressive, especially on this court.   
 Last week I was feeling very well and I can play a little bit more aggressive with the serve, with the forehand especially.  So that's it.  No, I always try improve, but the reason sometimes you feel better, you feel worse some weeks.   
  
  Q.  In other sports they talk about momentum can help you.  Coming off the win at Indian Wells, can momentum carry into this week, as well?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Well, I'm going to try my best here.  Every week is different.  For sure is important winning in Indian Wells for play with a little bit more crowd.  Arrive into the season without the same pression, so right now is important for me have a good result here or try to have a good result here.   
 It's important because I am coming with confidence.  That's the most important thing to going and play very well.   
  
  Q.  You had the fantastic match with Roger here.  Was it two years ago when you --   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah, two.   
  
  Q.  You were up in the final set?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  No, I was winning two sets to Love, and finally he beat me the third set, and after he beat me 6-2, 6-3, or 6-3, 6-3.   
  
  Q.  What do you remember about your play that day, and how different are you now compared to then?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Well, I have two more years.  At that moment I was the No. 25 in the world.  Right now I have three years in the No. 2, play more matches, better experience.   
 For sure I am a better player right now.  At that moment I was playing very, very well, but for sure I am better player right now.  That's sure.   
  
  Q.  Are you playing golf these days?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  No, no more golf.
