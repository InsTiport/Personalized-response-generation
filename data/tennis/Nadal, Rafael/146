7-6, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Rafa, please.   
 Q.  It was a really close match today.  Where did you think you made the difference?  
RAFAEL NADAL: Well, of course, was a good match.  Difference was few points.  In the first set, it's true that I was in advantage.  And I played the game (indiscernible); and he played well, I think, honest.  He played a good game, no mistakes.   
And then the match become very -- very close.  And I think I played with the right determination.  The important moments later, in the tiebreak.  I think I played aggressive with my forehand.   
And then in the second set, in some important moments, too, was the key.  I was able to change the rhythm of the point, combining high balls with shots down the line with my forehand.   
The dynamic of the match was a little bit more for me.  But when I stopped doing that exclusivity, then the match was a little bit more for him.   
 Q.  Novak had a little bit of a thoughtful period in the last few months.  You played the last time I think in Madrid last year.  How would you rate his level, and how could you compare his level of today compared to last year?  
RAFAEL NADAL: Being honest, no, it's impossible to be always at your best.  And especially when you have injuries, the comebacks are not easy.  I know that.   
And Novak, we can't forget that he came back from long injury.  And it's difficult to be back.   
But, don't have any doubt that if Novak wants to play, he will be back at his best.  He is too good to not be there.   
And that's it.  Week by week, the normal thing that he gonna find his way and his level again.   
 Q.  Slightly similar question.  But obviously, you've played him 51 times now.  When he was at his best today, I'm just wondering what the kind of particular challenge is that he was giving you today that perhaps other players don't do, makes Novak one of the unique players?  
RAFAEL NADAL: Today, I played against one of the best players of the history of this sport, you know.  It's always a challenge to play against him.  He has all the shots.  He takes the ball very early.  And it's difficult to move him from the baseline.  And he create angles.   
Uh, yeah.  A lot of things that he does very well.  And especially he change the direction of the ball very easy.  That's something -- probably one of the most difficult things in our sport is changing the direction of the ball.  He's able to do it very, very easy.  So, that's Novak.   
And he's always a match that you gonna have to play -- when he's playing well, you're gonna have to play your best if you want to have chances.   
In my opinion --  I saw him couple of matches this year.  And I saw him playing this week.  And, in my opinion, it was the best week that he played.  Not only today.  Yesterday was a good match to see against Kei.  And before yesterday, his tough opponent like Ramos.  He played at the right level again.   
So, in my opinion, he had a good tournament.   
 Q.  You had a lot of success against him today in long rallies.  I think you won 14 out of 20 rallies that went over nine shots today.  Is that a physical advantage you still have in this matchup right now, where both of you are in terms of your health?  Or what did you sense about that on court today?  
RAFAEL NADAL: It's not a physical issue, probably; it's a mental issue to resist the important moments.   
Just thinking that, I have to put one more ball.  Was a couple of important moments.   
And with the 4-3 in the second, I saved a very important point with great defense, cross forehand; and then I came in with a cross backhand, no.  That was a great point for me at this stage in my match because it was a point I had to hold it.  And then play it with the right determination, the backhand, no.   
It's important for me, obviously, to win the long rallies, of course.  That made me feel strong and gave me confidence.   
 Q.  Since you came back sometimes from injuries, you know how long it takes not just mentally but physically sometimes to get the best condition and best shape.  Do you have the feeling that he has enough time before the Roland Garros to get better physically?  Because, honest, even if you say that it's mentally, or mainly mentally, in the second set, he seemed to be a little tired; I mean, a little less physically strong, in my opinion.  Maybe you didn't realize.  But 10 days are enough or 12?  
RAFAEL NADAL: I have a different opinion, sorry, for that.   
It's not about that.  I was in that situation, too.  I mean, when you come back from a period of time that you didn't win a lot of matches and you start to feel like you are playing better and better.  And that's my opinion was his feeling today.   
The mental effort is higher than when you have this automatic.  So, that's why maybe he was a little more tired.  I was tired, too, in the second.   
The first set was tough set.  It's normal to be tired.  And when you are able to do things more automatic without thinking that much, then you are less tired.   
I think he's ready for Roland Garros.   
 Q.  If you win the title tomorrow, of course, you will return to No. 1 in the world, as well.  I know you don't like to look too far ahead to these things.  But how significant, how good would it be for you to get back to No. 1 world in the world rankings?  
RAFAEL NADAL: Believe me that, if I win tomorrow, for me the main thing is win Rome.  Not come back to No. 1, no.   
Have the title here is, for me, in terms of personal feeling and personal satisfaction, for me is win Rome, not come back to No. 1.   
And my motivation for tomorrow, if I tell you my real feelings before coming here, I came here to try to win a very important title, like Rome.  Not to try to come back to No. 1.  That's my feelings, of course.   
If I am back to No. 1, it's great.  Better than  to be No. 2, it's true.   
But my motivation is win a title, and I am playing for this today.
