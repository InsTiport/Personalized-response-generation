Q.  Apart from the Davis Cup, is that your best moment in tennis?
 
RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah, I don't know.  For now, yes, I think.  Is my first title, my first big title.  But I think I am very happy when I won the Davis Cup. But now is unbelievable. 
 

Q.  How did you play today?  How did you get out of losing the third set 6-Love, and then you came back very strongly?
 
RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah, I play very well the first two sets.  With the forehand I play very, very well.  And after, in the third set, he begin 2-Love, 3-Love, and I can't fight every set because my physic is not for the five sets, no.  And I stop.  In the third set I lost 6-Love. And after, I come back in the fourth set very well, 4-0 -- no, 4-1.  And after, the same of Miami, no?  I'm a little bit scared because is the same situation.  But finally I can won 7-5.

Q.  Do you think the experience that you had playing Federer in Miami helped you today when he came back?
 
RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah, I am sure.  Because I know what happen in Miami against Federer, and today I am very, very concentrate.  I am very concentrate all the time.  When I lost 4-1, 4-4 in the fourth, I am lot of concentration for win the match, no.  And in Miami, the same.  But now I was lost one match, one final in Miami, and I think is important for me for won this match.

But my objective is improve my tennis, no, and need improve some shots, and this is my objective for now, no.  I need improve my serve, my volley, my slice.  And if I do, if I improve these shots, I think I can won lot of matches, no?

Q.  So now you are maybe the favorite for Roland Garros?  What do you think?
 
RAFAEL NADAL:  No, no, no.  I am not favorite, no.  Is my first Roland Garros.  I only think about the next tournaments:  Barcelona, Rome, Hamburg now, you know.  I am playing good now, but I don't know when is in the French Open I gonna play good or I gonna play bad.  If I play the same like this, I can won, I can do a good result. Not favorite, but I can do good result.  But I don't know, is after one month. 
 

Q.  Don't you think that you should skip one of the following tournaments, either Barcelona, Rome, Hamburg, in order to be fit in Roland Garros, or you can be too tired?

RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah, for the Grand Slam is a good preparation.  But I know -- I think when the tournament is all tournament in three sets, I think is better the final in three sets, too, no? But the rules is that. 
 

Q.  It's good to get the feel of playing the five-set matches, like Davis Cup, as well?
 
RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, as well.  I play some matches, lot of matches, tough matches in Davis Cup final, in Australia against Hewitt, against Youzhny, in Miami against Federer.  I play some matches tough and is important.  Sometimes I won, sometimes I lost, but I play good these matches.

Q.  What was the key to your game?
 
RAFAEL NADAL:  I don't miss a lot of balls...  (very few unforced errors.)  And that's very important for play good in clay, no? I am very happy with my forehand, with my backhand.  And with the serve, I serve bad the first day.  I serve -- and after the first day, I improve my serve.  I serve better every day. I want to practice after first match, and I am happy because I improve around the tournament. 
 

Q.  Do you practice weightlifting and training?
