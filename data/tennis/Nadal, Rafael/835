 Q.  Rafael, are you happy to be back on clay? 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah, sure, I am happy for this day.  On clay, is my first match after a long time so is important begin with a victory. 
 Q.  How did you think you played? 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Not good (smiling).  Maybe I don't play very good, no, but is normal, no.  I lost in Miami first round.  My first match on clay, so I was a little bit nervous, but that normal, no. 
 And then I am happy because I am practicing very good every day, no.  So when I finish my nervous, I think, and when I gonna play a little bit more aggressive, maybe I gonna play good, no - I hope. 
 Q.  Were you a little bit disappointed by your results in America? 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  No, no, no.  I lost in semifinal in Indian Wells so it was very good week for me.  I lost against very good player, Blake, who was playing unbelievable. 
 And second week, sure, is not my best result in first round in Miami, but Carlos play a good match with a lot of confidence.  And maybe I don't play good, no. 
 Q.  What was difficult today?  Which part of the game was difficult today?  Was it footwork? 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  No, no.  Clement play very aggressive, no.  Maybe Clement don't play bad today, I don't know.  But maybe he don't play bad.  He play very aggressive.  And I play lot of defensive, no, so that's bad, and he play little bit more aggressive with a little bit more intensity. 
 So maybe the worst is play too much defensive, no.  I need play with a little bit more intensity and aggressive.  And if I find that, I gonna play good because I touch good the ball - I am touching good the ball (smiling). 
 Q.  What is the problem with the foot? 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Foot, forget.  I don't want to speak more about the foot. 

 RAFAEL NADAL:  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  No, with the tape.  No, no, don't pain with the foot.  The tape push too much. 

 Q.  You have a lot of pressure because now we are on clay, you have a lot of points to defend.  Do you think about that? 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  I don't have a lot of points to defend, no, because in the Race I am the 8.  So the most important thing is the Race, not the defensive points, because every year is different.  So I am the 8, and if I play good tournament here, I gonna be a little bit better. 
 So the important is the Race.  Sure, I don't gonna defense all points, no. 
 Q.  Can we compare your level of play now compared with last year at the same time. 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  No, I can't compare that, no, because I don't know very good exactly.  But last year I don't play good the first match here, too, no.  I remember very well because I have the match, I watch all matches on TV. 
 Sure, I was playing last year in Buenos Aires, Brazil, Acapulco.  I have a lot of matches in my shoulders.  So after now is my first tournament on clay, but I gonna try my best, no.  I want to play good here, and maybe I can.
