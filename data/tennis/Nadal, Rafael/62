R. NADAL/G. Pella
6-3, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How much of a challenge was the wind tonight in your match?
RAFAEL NADAL: Have been a tough day in terms of wind.  But we are used to play like this.  When we play on outdoor courts, that's part of the game, too.  Of course is better to play without this kind of wind.
At the same time is beautiful to play under tough conditions because then the player who has different options to play has better chances to survive these kind of days, no?
Is about adapt and being focused mentally.  Of course, I prefer to play without these conditions, but in some way I enjoy.
Q. What was the thinking behind getting back on the council and what is it you would like to see?  What is the reason for this?  What do you think you can get done?
RAFAEL NADAL: Well, the last couple of ^  times have been some tough moments in terms of discussions, a lot of important things to have to be done.  So just to be little bit more informed about what's going on and try to have a better knowledge of everything, try to give my opinion after more than 15 years on the tour.  Probably I can give a different perspective of how the game have to be or things that we can add.
That's it, no?  Is about just trying to help the game to be better.  If I am there, I believe that I can be helpful.
Q. Since you and Roger kind of maybe think alike about tennis - classic, the way it is - do you think having Roger on the council will be a strong thing for you?
RAFAEL NADAL: We decided to be together out there.  If we are there is because we spoke before about being there, no?  I will not be alone there, he will not be alone there.  No, if we are there, both of us I think can be a good power, good help for the sport in some way, hopefully in a better way.
Just we are here to help and, of course, to know little bit better what's going on.  Last year have been some up and downs in a lot of things.
Q. Was there a lot of encouragement coming from Novak, as well?  Were there some conversations to get you onboard?
RAFAEL NADAL: Novak have been there for a while.  We have been there in the past.  Is good that players are interested on what's going on in our sport.  I think all our careers, Roger and I cared a lot about this sport.  Is true, as I said before, there is a lot of things that have been going on.  We want to be part of it.  That's why we are there now.
Q. In the first set, you had that shot behind your back.  I'm guessing that's not the type of shot you can actually practice, right?
RAFAEL NADAL: Well, you can practice when you are doing a smash, when you are practicing your smash.  Sometimes if the ball is a little bit longer than usual like today, I normally try to hit the ball.  If you do it on the practice, you have another thing to do on the match.  That's all.
Q. You're going to face Fognini in the next round.  What are you expecting from him?
RAFAEL NADAL: He's playing great.  I saw him a little bit yesterday.  He played a great match.  He's having a great season, one of the best of his career, if not the best.  He's playing at very high standards.
I need to be playing well.  I think today I play better than yesterday, so I hope tomorrow continue with this improvement.  That's what I need if I want to keep having chances to be through, knowing he is a very tough opponent.
We are in quarterfinals of a Masters 1000.  All opponents are tough.  For me tomorrow is an opportunity to go on court against one of the best players, try to play a good match.  So let's see if I am able to.  Hopefully yes.
