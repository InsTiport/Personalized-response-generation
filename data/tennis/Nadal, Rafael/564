R. NADAL/S. Wawrinka
  6-4, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Rafa. 

 Q. Was this a difficult match today? He was hitting a lot of big shots, winners and aces. What was it like out there for you today. Was this a hard match? 
 RAFAEL NADAL: Every match is difficult, no? Playing against Wawrinka is impossible have an easy match. 
 You see the results, 6-4, 6-4, is a very good result. I can't say was one of the toughest match because Wawrinka is a very good player and is very difficult to have a victory today in straight sets, 6-4, 6-4. I happy for that. For sure, it wasn't easy, but it wasn't one of these very, very difficult days. 

 Q. As the year is winding down and obviously you've played a lot of tennis, how difficult is it to maintain your composure when you have to do press conferences and commitments? How do you manage to maintain your focus and keep your energy? 
 RAFAEL NADAL: Oh, that's part of the work. I understand and I know when I go to play a tournament what gonna happen. The work is not only on court. That's part of our job. 
 For sure for moments you are more tired than in other ones to do the rest of the things outside of the court, but you have to do it. Better to do it with the right way than the wrong way, no? 

 Q. Andy Murray just said he thought he and his partner won the game last night against you and your partner. I want to hear the story from your side. Who won? 
 RAFAEL NADAL: Is not a story about that. That's the true. I not going to answer because everybody who was there knows who win yesterday night. So if he's happy coming here and lie everybody, it's okay (smiling). 
 But we won, that's true. Monaco and me, we won 2-1. That's true. But, anyway, if he doesn't recognize that they lost, we don't gonna play against them another time. That's for sure.
