 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. More than 40 unforced errors. Was that the key?   
 RAFAEL NADAL: Well, no. No, because the key of the match -- the matches are a lot of points, but few points are the key of the match, no? I think I did the more difficult thing, is change the dynamic of the match because I wasn't play well.  
 But I came back well. I started to play a little better with my backhand. That was very important, very positive thing for me. I started to serve a little bit better. I was in a good position in the end, no?   
 Yeah, it's true I had unforced errors. But, yeah, the thing, or the positive thing, is I finish the tournament better than I started. That's what is positive.   
 Another thing is in important moments when I had all in my favor I came back after difficult situation, set and break down, and I had all in my favor in the third, no? 4-All, Love-30, playing few good points. I missed two returns, two second serve returns. That was the key of the match, no?   
 After that he played well. I think his serve was very good today. Just congratulate him. He's very good person, and it's very positive for our sport. I am happy for him. He had injuries and he came back, and now he's playing well another time.  
  
  Q. Was his serve a lot better than you were expecting? You only got seven points off his first serve all night. That's kind of low for you.   
 RAFAEL NADAL: Yeah, that's very few points. But he served really well, that's true. A lot of very good first serves, and close to the lines. So yeah, it's not easy to return.  
 But I repeat: I was in the right position at the right moment 4-All, Love-30, two second serves. So I had the match there.   
  
  Q. Were you a little disappointed by your net cord play? Looked look you didn't finish some points at the net on a short ball, for instance.   
 RAFAEL NADAL: No, that was unlucky I think. At the 4-All I was a little bit unlucky in that situation, because I was playing - 30-15 - I was playing well during all the game, and two balls was there in difficult position for me behind the baseline, behind the net.   
 I had to go to the net. I didn't have another chance on this ball, no? First one I thought he was waiting for me a lot of times to his backhand. I thought I gonna change, and he had a very good passing shot winner.   
 And the next one I played a good forehand to his backhand, and he had a good defensive, a little bit lucky, because the ball was very low in that moment. I didn't another option to do that and repeat the shot to his forehand and go to the net, and he hit another good passing shot.   
 So nothing to do in that moment. After the double fault was (indiscernible). But that's it. After he served well last game. Nothing to do.   
  
  Q. So today it was a mental problem you think?   
 RAFAEL NADAL: No. Not only a mental problem, no? My game can improve, that's for sure. Must improve if I really want to have chances to have some opportunity in two weeks or in one week in New York.   
 So I have one week to keep working, keep practicing hard, and that's what I gonna try: to keep improving my confidence with the backhand. And the serve I think I am in the right way, but I need to keep working. I gonna have a good chance to work.  
 And the forehand, I am playing well with the forehand, but I am having too much unforced errors for the moment. But the feeling with the forehand is good. I need to be a little bit more consistent. That's the only thing, no?   
 So forehand maybe is not the problem, but the backhand, yes. So I have to improve. The positive thing today I started to hit the ball with the backhand, no, not to play with the slice all the time. I finished the match playing much better with the backhand than I started, no?   
 So that's positive. But that's what I had to do yesterday. I didn't try yesterday, so... yeah, probably that reasons I played bad the important moments today.  
  
  Q. The forehand errors you talked about, was that more as a result of just playing aggressively?   
 RAFAEL NADAL: Sometimes. I think I have to play aggressive, but sometimes I am playing too aggressive with the forehand, no, trying to have more winners too fast. So that's another thing that keep improving. But maybe it's because I wanted to protect the backhand, no?   
 But I think if my backhand improve all my game's improve, because my movement's gonna improve a lot because I didn't have to cover the backhand with the forehand. So I gonna cover better the position on the court.   
 I can serve with more calm the first serve, because if I miss the serve and he has a return, for me it's no problem to play with the backhand. But right now, when he had a good return to the backhand, I started all the time the point in the very bad position. So I think the backhand change all my game, because I had to make too much adjust to save that shot.   
 But I am happy I finished, because I started to play with the backhand with more confidence, no? So that's positive for me.  
  
  Q. You are going to train with Toni very soon?   
 RAFAEL NADAL: I gonna keep practicing. I am gonna have now I think two days off. Remain one week, and I don't need I think to practice all the days. Maybe I gonna have a few days off.   
 After I gonna practice three days with Francis in New York, and Toni arrive on Wednesday, no? But I repeat: Doesn't make the difference if Toni's here or not. The thing that make the difference is myself. Always is the same. When I win, I win. Sure, I had the support of all my team. But when I lose, it's my fault. And when I win, it's mine also.   
 So I think in the end, the player is -- if the player wants to do it, the player can do it with any coach, no? So for me, I repeat, the important work for the coach, the biggest work is when you are a kid. So that's the more important work for the coach, no?   
 Today, you know what you have to do. The coach can help you in few things for moments, but doesn't change a lot.   
  
  Q. Do you think the matches that you had in Toronto and Cincinnati are enough preparation to go into the US Open feeling comfortable?   
 RAFAEL NADAL: I hope so. (Smiling.) What I can say? I don't know. I don't know. We will see in two weeks the result in New York.
