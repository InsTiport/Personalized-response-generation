R. NADAL/J. Tsonga
  6‑2, 5‑7, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How would you rank your level on that match?
RAFAEL NADAL:   My level?   It wasn't one of my best matches.   That's the real thing.
I didn't play very well tonight.   I think I started match playing really well, but later when I had the break at the second, after the break of the second, I don't know which game I had the break of the second, but after that I started to play more defensive, no?   To close the match, I played very bad.   That's my feeling.
Before, no.   Before, I believe Jo had much more mistakes than usual.   That's makes the match‑‑ make the match less complicated for me at the beginning.
But, you know, when he started to play a little bit better and I have advantage in the score in the second set with the break, I started to play more defensive.   Finally, I played a really bad game serving for the match at 5‑4, and then he started to play better.   That's the true.   And I happy about my third set.

Q.   The third set looked like you were having the same scores in the first set. 
RAFAEL NADAL:   Sorry? 

Q.   The last set, he was about to break you again ‑‑second set, I'm sorry.   The third set, the last game was, you know, a very tough game.   Were you worried at that point that, you know, that you... 
RAFAEL NADAL:   I had a few break points again in the last game serving for the match another time.
You know, losing the second set, serving for the set, stays on my mind when I have to serve for the match another time in the third.
So I arrived at that moment, and anything can happen.   That's the true.   I didn't play very well the last game, as well.   But I was able to find solutions and to go to the net a few times and to hit good shots. 
I was lucky with one mistake of Tsonga with his forehand.   He was unlucky he broke his strings.
So that's the thing.   Finally I won.   That's it.

Q.   Can you explain why you played more defensive?   Do you know why?   Confidence? 
RAFAEL NADAL:   I don't know.   Seriously my feeling was Jo was ‑‑he was having much more mistakes than usual, so the match didn't have the right rhythm.
When I arrive to that moment to serve for the match, you know, for moments I didn't know if I have to play more aggressive, I have to play just defensive because, you know, he was doing almost everything, having few winners but at the same time having lot of mistakes.
So for moments I had the feeling that just playing solid without risk was enough for moments.   So when I arrived to that last game, I really didn't had the right line how to win the points.
So that's the thing.   My serve was bad.   I really served bad tonight.   Much worse than the previous days. 

Q.   You said that you played well the beginning and then you played bad as the match was going on.   Do you think it's a fitness issue?
RAFAEL NADAL:   No.   Well, I have problems on my left knee.   That's the thing.   I'm not feeling great.   I don't know what's gonna happen in the next match, because gonna be a big match against one of the toughest opponents on tour, and probably I don't arrive in my perfect conditions to that match.
But, you know, we talking about physical performance, I am feeling great, no?   I am not tired today now after three hours' match.   My fitness is perfect.   It's not a problem, that.   I don't know the problems. 

Q.   Andy Murray in the semifinals.   You each have a mutual respect for each other.   What do you think of that matchup, meeting here in Miami for the first time?
RAFAEL NADAL:   Always playing Andy is a pleasure for me, and exciting playing against a player like him that push you at the limit on everything.
The negative thing is I have to recover well.   I have to improve my knee if I really want to have any chance to win.
If not, gonna be almost impossible.   But always is fantastic being in semifinals, first two Masters 1000s of the year, being in both semifinals in hard court are fantastic results.
So happy in that.   Right now hopefully I can recover and can enjoy the match. 

Q.   He was saying that he had too many complaints to the referee at the end of the game, that he had to challenge too much because the referee never say out, because he has a feeling that the referee doesn't want to say out against you.   He says that. 
RAFAEL NADAL:   Yeah, well, that's... 

Q.   What is your feeling?
RAFAEL NADAL:   No, I understand sometimes the frustration on this situations, no?   Because that is true that the referees with the Hawk‑Eye are doing less overrules than before.   I said hundreds of times, too, no? 
But is not because he's playing against me.   No, no.   Happen to me a lot of times, no? 
Easy to remember.   In Australia, you remember against Berdych the very important points 6‑All in the tiebreak of the first set?   So he didn't make overrule, too, and ball was clear out.
So I called the challenge late and the point was for Berdych.
So is not a thing with me.   Is a thing, general thing with the referees today that with the Hawk‑Eye I believe that they feels that they have less pressure than before.   So probably knowing that you have the challenge, they don't take the risk to have to overrule. 
He's right in one thing; he's wrong in another thing.
