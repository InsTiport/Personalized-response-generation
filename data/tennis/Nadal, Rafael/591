 Q. On behalf of everybody who watched that match, thank you for the most fantastic entertainment. It was probably closer than you wanted. 
 RAFAEL NADAL: Well, you know how difficult it's been, coming to play. He's a good player. I think his game adapts very well to this surface. He plays flat and has a good serve. 
 Yeah, wasn't easy for me. The day was difficult, too, a lot of wind. When you have the wind, play like this, the court, the ball stays lower. For me, a little bit better, the sunshine, the court is true. I played a lot of matches here with good sunshine. 

 Q. We saw you have an injury timeout. What was that? 
 RAFAEL NADAL: I felt something here, behind the leg. Just, I wanted to check with the physio if it's something dangerous or not. I gonna check if I can finish the match playing. 

 Q. How do you feel at the moment? 
 RAFAEL NADAL: I am feeling very good.
