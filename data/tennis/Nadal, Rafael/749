  Q.  You know David very well.  Did you expect he can play on such a level like he played today?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Sure, no, he's a very good player.  He's having unbelievable season.  So maybe he gonna be in the Masters of Shanghai.  He's one of the best players of the world right now.  He has a very good level.   
  
  Q.  How much were you hurting?  We saw the trainer came out.  Looked like your finger, and still your knees.  What was going on with you physically during the match?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Well, I speak a lot about, well, my physically all the week.  So I don't want to -- I prefer don't speak about my body right now because always if I speak something about my body, later someone thinks about is an excuse.  So I don't want to put any excuse.   
 He play very good and he beat me.  Maybe another day we can speak about the injuries.   
  
  Q.  What about the physical condition of David?  Seems he could reach everything.   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Is nothing new.  He's a very tough player, very fast.  For me, it's not a surprise.   
  
  Q.  How frustrated and disappointed are you to go out this early in a slam?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Well, sure, this is disappointing for me.  But that's the tennis, that's the sport.  I am having a very good season.  I arrive here playing well.  Disappointing for me I can't play the last days a hundred percent the tournament for the problem of the knees.  And maybe that affect a little bit my physical performance.   
 So that's it, no?  I am with calm.  I know I do the hundred percent that I can.  So, well, right now, the season continuing, and continuing doing my hundred percent for try to play the season as well as I can.
