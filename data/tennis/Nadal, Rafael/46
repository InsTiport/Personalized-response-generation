R. NADAL/A. Mannarino
7-5, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. Did you expect such a tough match? Because Mannarino plays good tennis.
RAFAEL NADAL: Yes, I expected a very tough match. I know how dangerous is Adrian in this court. The court here is fast, the bounce is low, so I think is a perfect court for him, no?
So I went on court knowing it going to be very tough one. I needed to play well, and I think I did. My serve worked very well during the whole match. I think I played at the right level.
Not easy to come back on the tour after a while without being on the tour. And playing in this surface is difficult, and against a very dangerous opponent, in the first round for me, second for him, no?
So very happy with the victory.
Q. How do you feel physically?
RAFAEL NADAL: Well, here we are, no? It's always -- historically, I had issues at the end of the season, and sometimes at the beginning and sometimes during. (Laughing.)
But here we are, no? It's always little bit scared when I am here because in this tournament I had plenty of things during all my career. So when you are here, always a little bit more dangerous for me.
But I am very happy to be here, no? And I'm very happy to be able to compete again at the good level. And let's see. Tomorrow is another day, another tough match against Stan.
Every day on this tournament is so difficult. So let's see if I'm able to play another good match.
Q. Just talk about the sensation on the court. It was not easy, I guess, after one month without to see on the tour. Just talk about the feeling and the sensation on the court for you today.
RAFAEL NADAL: Good feelings, honestly, no? I have been able to do some good work at home, to work on things that we believe could help in this surfaces.
And today, the serve, for example, was one of these things. So very happy the way that I served. I think I didn't face no one break point during the whole match, and against player who returns well. So that means a lot.
Feelings are good. To be back in this court is always special. This city, of course, always special for me. So crowd is great with me here.
So excited to have the chance to play another day here.
