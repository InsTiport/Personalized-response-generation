  Q.  (Through translation.)  You lost twice against him.  Did you expect a tougher match?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  (Through translation.)  I am very satisfied with this match because I think I played a quite solid match.  It was a special occasion for me, in fact, because I lost twice to him, but I came on the court very confident.   
 I think my forehand worked very well.  It was solid with the backhand.  I didn't serve as hard as yesterday, I mean for my standards, but I couldn't afford to.  I knew if my first serve wasn't good enough, he would attack me, so I prefer to do that.   
  Q.  (Through translation.)  Which are the aspects of your game that you appreciate most of these four matches that you played here in Rome?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  (Through translation.)  I think I'm playing fine.  What I like most is that I've been quite aggressive and I could come up to the net whenever I could.  I also hitting closer to the lines.  I'm progressing well with my forehand.   
  Q.  How close do you think you are to your best level?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  I don't know.  Always I meet the same question a lot of people, no, the best level.  I don't know what is the best level for me, no.  I don't have a top.  I don't know.   
 But I am playing well, no.  My best level, maybe I never play too much better than now, no?  I won Monte-Carlo, Barcelona, semifinals here.  I can't play so much better, no.   
 I can improve my game.  But play better now is difficult for me.  I am happy with my game.   
  Q.  (Through translation.)  Which is the opponent that you would prefer for tomorrow?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  (Through translation.)  I don't think in those terms because I think about myself and my game.  I want to play well.  And if I go on the courts and I play well and I lose, well, I've done my best.   
 So I think that anyone who will reach the semifinals is the one who played the best so it's the tougher opponent.   
  Q.  (Through translation.)  Did you see Federer on television?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  (Through translation.)  Yes, I did see Federer on television.   
  Q.  (Through translation.)  Do you think about the record?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  (Through translation.)  No, I think about Rome semifinals.   
  Q.  (Through translation.)  Do you always think about the results of Federer as you have this sort of rivality?   
 RAFAEL NADAL:  (Through translation.)  No, I don't.  I don't think he does either.  Anyhow, we have 3,000 points that separates us.   
 So if I be in the final and I meet him, well, I be glad to compete against him because I like to play against tough players.  But for the moment, I am on semifinals.
