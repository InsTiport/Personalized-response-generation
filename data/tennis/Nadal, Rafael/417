R. NADAL/C. Berlocq
  6‑1, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   A very entertaining match, particularly the second set.   When those sorts of points are going on, are you aware and can you enjoy those sorts of matches or do you not realize it until afterwards?
RAFAEL NADAL:   Yes, but the situation today with the humidity was not nice.   When you play these crazy points with the good conditions it's fine because you feel fine for the next point.   With the conditions of today, not comfortable to play with this situation.   Too much humid, sweating too much. 
Berlocq is a great example of player who never give up, a player who always improved all during his career.   Good guy, good fighter.   Very good example for the rest of the players.   Very good example for the kids, I think. 

Q.   You were mentioning the humidity.   How many shirts do you walk on court with?
RAFAEL NADAL:   Seven today.   I used five.   Maybe tomorrow I will be with nine.   Yeah, is too much.   Feels like every two games I can change the T‑shirt.   Crazy humidity. 
But happy the way I played at the end.   I think I played a fantastic first set.   The second I felt a little bit more tired.   Even like this, I had a lot of opportunities.   Love‑40, two more breakpoints.   But is true that I never had the chance to play one of those breakpoints with a second serve. 
But anyway, I had to convert one of that.   If I was able to do it, probably the match will be not that difficult because at the end was really close.   He had a big opportunity in the tiebreak with the 5‑2.   So was lucky I played three great points in that moment.   Unfortunately for him, he had the double‑fault. 
At the end was close, emotional.   Very happy to be through. 

Q.   Andy just announced he will pull out of the World Tour Finals.   Are you expecting him to come back strong next year?
RAFAEL NADAL:   I already know that he will not be able to play in the Masters a few weeks ago.   Is tough for everybody and for big players.   For all the players is tough the injuries.   Is not easy to come back. 
I'm sure at the beginning will be a little bit tougher for him.   But the good thing, in my opinion, for him, if he's able to start the season in January, the first tournament of the year, even if he's coming back from an injury, the good thing can be that the rest of the players are starting from zero, too, because they stopped for the end of the season.   Is different than if you have to come back in the middle of the season and all the players are in rhythm than if you come back in the beginning. 
That can be a good advantage for him.   I wish him really the best, all the best.   He's important, very important player, for the tour.   I always have a great relationship with him.   I have a big respect.   I really want all the best for him.
