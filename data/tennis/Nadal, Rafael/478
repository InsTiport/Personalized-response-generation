  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Just talk about being back in Miami and your expectations for the tournament this year. 
RAFAEL NADAL:   Expectations are always similar, no?   Just try my best and try to have the best result as possible.
You know, that's all.   No, I will try, as I do usually, knowing that this is a very difficult tournament, that the best players of the world are here and all the rounds are really dangerous and difficult ones. 
Trying to be very focused from the beginning.
