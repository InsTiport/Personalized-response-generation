 Q.  How do you feel after this match? 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah, maybe I don't play my best match, but it's okay.  I win.  So that's the most important thing.  I feel a little bit more confidence on the baseline than yesterday.  The serve continuing bad (smiling).  Some things better, some things bad, no? 
 That's okay, we will see tomorrow.  Maybe I improve a little bit today my level.  We will see tomorrow. 

 Q.  What do you feel you could improve?  What weren't you happy with tonight? 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  My serve a lot, that's important.  The winner with my forehand is very important.  And improve a little bit the level of the all shots when I am playing the rally, improve a little bit the speed. 

 Q.  Do you think a lot of this has to do with the time off that you took, that it's taking you a couple matches to really feel good again? 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah, the most important thing is win.  After one month is not easy to come back and playing well.  So that's important.  The important thing is win.  Tomorrow I will have a very tough match.  If I win tomorrow, maybe I going to be prepared for everything, no? 
 We will see tomorrow.  Is one of the key matches. 

 Q.  Was Lee a tougher opponent than you thought? 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  No, I know Lee is a good player.  He's an aggressive player.  He has a very good talent.  He don't serve bad.  He has a good forehand.  Is tough playing him.  He play fast with his forehand, with his backhand. 
 And if you are not feeling the best for play more tougher to the side, so is difficult, no? 

 Q.  Tomorrow's match, Roger says Berdych is one of the guys that's one of the young guys that scares him.  Are you worried about tomorrow or are you confident? 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Who say that?  Federer?  Can you repeat please. 

 Q.  Federer has said before the player you're playing tomorrow, Berdych, is one of the guys that he worries about playing, he's one of the tougher opponents, up-and-coming best players.  Are you confident about tomorrow's match?  Is he as good as other players have said he is? 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah, sure, that's true, no?  He has a very good potential.  He has a very good serve, very good forehand, very good backhand.  If he feel he's hundred percent, going to be very, very difficult match.  And if not, too (smiling). 
 We will see.  I need play a very good match for try the victory.  I will try that.  I need play a very good match for win.
