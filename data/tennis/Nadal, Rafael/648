R. NADAL/R. Soderling
  6-1, 6-0

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Did you feel any cold out there, or when you run you don't even notice?
 RAFAEL NADAL: No, for the player it's not cold. Maybe for the crowd, yes, but for us it was good conditions. 

 Q. The beginning of the match, the first two or three games, it looked like it was going to be a really slugfest from the back of the court, and then suddenly you just ran away with it. What happened in between the first two games and the rest of the match? 
 RAFAEL NADAL: No, I think the match was really tough. Not the result, but, yes, the match. Yeah, the beginning I was winning 4-1, but at the same time I can be losing 4-1, no? 
 Yeah, I think I played really well. One of my best matches on clay sure this year. I don't know of my career, but I'm playing at the very good level today, so I'm very happy. Very happy about my level today. Very happy about this victory. 

 Q. It was a great match with Verdasco at the Australian Open. Do you think that here can be somehow repeated even if it's best-of-three and different surface, or the clay helps you much more than it helps Verdasco?
 RAFAEL NADAL: No, I think can be really tough match. Sure going to be a really tough match. 
 Yeah, I was close to lose in Australia. It was really emotional match. But, well, I gonna try to play my game tomorrow. Going to try to play aggressive and try to play like today. That's what I gonna try. 
 He have a very good forehand, good serve, and here the ball have a good topspin, and that can help him. But if I am playing my best, I hope have my chances to have the victory, no? So I going try to play aggressive and we will see. 

 Q. Is it slightly ominous that the top three seeds had very convincing victories today, more so than anybody else? Does it look like you three should be in the semifinals at the business end?
 RAFAEL NADAL: I think we are in quarterfinals right now. We will see after tomorrow night if we are in semifinals or not.
