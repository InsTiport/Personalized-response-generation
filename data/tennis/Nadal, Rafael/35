Team Serbia - 1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Can you talk us through the decision for you not to play the doubles?  
RAFAEL NADAL: Well, I have been playing a lot of tennis the last couple of days. My teammates have been playing great yesterday. My level of energy is a little bit lower than usual, because I played long yesterday, very long before yesterday, very long in Brisbane [sic] [Perth] the last day.   
So is a team decision, and we believe in our team. That's why we had success in the past, because we were able to give the confidence to the rest of the players, and we give the confidence to Feliciano and Pablo.   
They are doing well. We're going to support them, and hopefully they have a good day.   
 Q.  I think you said yesterday you needed to find something special for this match. You seemed to play a very good second set. So it had positives as well even though you didn't win?  
RAFAEL NADAL: Yeah, I made a tough start. First game, even if it's only first game, have been important, because I started the match playing more or less okay. Novak played I think an amazing first set, serving huge and putting a lot of pressure.   
But I did the most difficult thing. Changed a little bit the dynamic of the match after that first set. Happy the way that I was able to compete.   
And knowing that the last couple of days have been tough, I am happy the way that I managed to compete well in the second set. I had my chances. I was very close. Not happy with the loss, of course, but the feeling in that second set is positive.   
 Q.  I know you've played in a lot of difficult atmospheres. You seemed to be getting quite aggravated in the first set at one point. You spoke to the umpire. Did you feel the crowd was fair?  
RAFAEL NADAL: No, honestly, the crowd was fantastic every single day, but sometimes people from some countries, they probably don't understand how the tennis goes. They think it's about football or this stuff, and atmosphere in tennis is different, no?   
The respect for the players should be there, and at some point I think the respect with small part of the crowd have been not there.   
 Q.  You're done playing at the ATP Cup, so what are your thoughts overall on how this went and as a way to start the season every year?  
RAFAEL NADAL: Is a long competition. Is a tough way to start the season. I don't know.   
I think is a great competition, but at the same time is -- I can't change my mind that two World Cups in one month is not real. So is not possible.   
So we need to find a way to fix it and we need to find a way to make a big deal with ITF and ATP to create a big World Team Cup competition, not two World Cups in one month. I think that's a confusion for the spectators, and we need to be clear in our sport.   
And for the health of our sport and for the benefit of our sport is, in my opinion, mandatory that we fix it.   
 Q.  The record on hard courts is quite one-sided to Novak in the last years. What's so difficult about playing him on hard compared to other surfaces?  
RAFAEL NADAL: Well, he have been the best player in the world on hard the last couple of years, obviously. To play against the best player is always difficult.   
But I think I improve things. Probably today was maybe a little bit too early on the season, but in general terms I think I improved a couple of things that I really hope that give me chances in the near future.   
My serve is working better. So is an important point to have chances in the near future against the best players.   
Happy the way that I served, especially in the second set. I was able to change with some serves and volley, too. I did things different that my opinion is something that can work in the future.   
I gonna keep working. Now hopefully we have a great doubles and we're able to take this title. If not, for me remain a week to keep working. Gonna be an important week of practice for me.   
But in general terms, for me the last ten days here in the ATP Cup have been positive. I did a lot of things well; couple of things not that well. But I don't think I am in a bad way for the next week.   
 Q.  You said it was a tough competition. Is it maybe a lot of energy to burn just before a Grand Slam starts? Or is it good to play these good players?  
RAFAEL NADAL: I don't know if it's a lot of energy to burn before a Grand Slam. I don't say that, because I always said that when I am playing a tournament I am not thinking with the next one.   
So when I'm playing here, I'm not thinking about Melbourne, or when I'm playing in Monte Carlo I'm not thinking about Roland Garros, no?   
So I think is a great competition. Excited to be part of it. Excited to represent my country.   
I enjoyed a lot to share all these weeks or week and a half with my friends on the team. The organization have been fantastic, honestly. Just my mind is that we need to create one special thing, not two.   
 Q.  This week or the last week in November? Which one would you have -- or a different week entirely?  
RAFAEL NADAL: I can't tell you my real opinion, because will not make sense today. And it's not that easy. Is a little bit longer conversation.   
 Q.  When you go into a match against Novak on a hard court and the record is what it is, what is your mindset? Do you not think or not consider the previous matches? How do you approach it?  
RAFAEL NADAL: My approach is just go on court, try to play the best way possible, and try to win the match. That's the only approach I can have.   
What happened in the past is already done. I can't change that, so the only thing that I think when I go on court is to try to do it the best way possible the next time.
