Q. Before we get into obviously the match, I just want to say thank you from the bottom of our hearts from all the people here in Geneva and around the world. There was a lot of reasons for you not to come to Laver Cup. The fact that you have, thank you very much. It was fantastic of you.
RAFAEL NADAL: Well, no, thanks. Well, thank you. Thank you for your words, but honestly, be here for me is a very positive energy, no? It's amazing to be around a great team, and the crowd is just unreal every single day.
So many, many thanks for the support.
Q. Milos gave you a good run for your money in that opening set. You managed to kind of steal it away from him.
RAFAEL NADAL: Yeah, I feel very lucky in the first set, honestly, no? Have been, I think, unlucky first set for him. I think he deserved that first set, for sure.
Later in the match I think I started to play better, a little bit high percentage on the serves and started moving myself a little bit better, no? In the end I think I played a very good tiebreak with some good shots.
So very happy to help Team Europe to be I think 7-3 now. It's great news for us and I hope for you too. The crowd, we are in Europe, so you support us. So many, many thanks.
Q. I have just got to ask you one last question, because I know you have to go off and get ready for your doubles. We are going to get more of you tonight. A bit of competition to see who's the better coach on Team Europe at the moment: Yourself or Roger. You have both been helping each other out. At the moment I think everybody feels you're going to make a better coach.
RAFAEL NADAL: Oh, yeah, much better, yeah. (Laughter.)
No, I think it's a great team that everybody tries to help each other. It's a great team spirit. That's why we were able to achieve two Laver Cups, the two previous editions.
Yeah, remain a lot of work to do, so we need to be together. We need to help each other. We have great coaches, Bj√∂rn and Thomas, and the rest of the team is supporting very much.
So many thanks. Thank you.
