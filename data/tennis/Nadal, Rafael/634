 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Three hours is a long match. Is it nice to get a rigorous test under your belt? 
 RAFAEL NADAL: Yeah, sure. Was a very good practice for me, no? Sure, play in three hours is a very good test. At the same time is important. First day I didn't have any bad moment, you know, any pressure moment. 
 Today I had to do more. Yeah, I was good, sure, in the third and fourth set because after losing the second I think I didn't have a breakpoint against in the third and the fourth, so that's very important. 
 I started the match playing very well. I practiced very well before the match. When you win the first set very easy and the other have more mistakes than usual, later you have break in the second and, yeah, he start to play a little bit better and you are a little bit out of rhythm. 
 That's what happened. The bad thing was the second break in the second set. Later I had chance to come back, but I didn't convert and he played well.

 Q. How does your body feel?
 RAFAEL NADAL: I am very good. Thank you. 

 Q. Did you know this is the first time ever that all 16 top seeds on the men have made the third round of a Grand Slam. What do you think that says about the depth of the men's field right now?
 RAFAEL NADAL: Yeah, happened something similar in MontrÃ©al. Top eight in quarterfinals. I don't know. Top seeds are doing well. 

 Q. It means there's so many good players at the top, very competitive. 
 RAFAEL NADAL: Very good players right now in the top. The best players are winning and they are regular and normal, they don't have strange loses. I think that's good for tennis. 

 Q. Are you happy with the way you played tonight? 
 RAFAEL NADAL: Yeah, I'm happy, sure. I say, no, I started the match playing really well. Anyway, he had mistakes. Later, the second set was a little bit more surprise because I was winning 6-0, 2-1 with break. I had really bad game in 2-1. But that's can happen. 
 Yeah, he started to play well. That's true, no? He started to play really well. I played another bad game with my serve, and he has the break up in the second. Later I tried, but, no, no, I can't had the break back. 
 Anyway, in the third and the fourth, I have a good answer and I win 6-3, 6-4 with two breaks. I feel comfortable with myself all the time, so... It was very important.

 Q. Next is Almagro. 
 RAFAEL NADAL: He is very aggressive player, no? Always really tough to play against him. He has very good serve, too. I want try to move him, no? When he play still (sic), is very difficult to stop him because he play big shots and very aggressive shots. But when he moves, normally he have more mistakes. Everyone the same, no? But especially I think Nicolas, if he is still, is very difficult to stop him. 
 So I'm going to try to play aggressive. I have to play more aggressive than today, especially in the return. I gonna do, sure. 

 Q. He's never taken a set from you before. If so, does that give you confidence? 
 RAFAEL NADAL: I think I only played against him on clay. I think he had a set point in Barcelona semifinals. If didn't give me a set four matches... Doesn't matter the matches before. But we will see. That's important thing. If I play well, I gonna have my chances. If not, gonna be very difficult. 

 Q. Kiefer serving at 4-3 in the third set was a long game. Did that feel like an important part of the match to you?
 RAFAEL NADAL: Sure is important, no? I had the third set there. I had the break in the end. I played a few good points. He played well, too, because he did good points. But in the end, I had a few good returns and I had a good cross backhand in the breakpoint, good shot with my forehand, and was the set that break, no? I know if I have the break with 5-3, I was feeling good with my serve, no? 
 Sure, having the third set was not the match, but almost. 

 Q. Do you like playing late at night, after midnight?
 RAFAEL NADAL: What do you want to listen (smiling)? 

 Q. You don't like it so much so late?
 RAFAEL NADAL: It's too late. Right now, what time is it? 

 Q. 1:15. 
 RAFAEL NADAL: 1:15. I have to dinner. Before 3:30 is impossible be sleeping. Anyway, I think is a little bit late. That's my opinion, no? I would love to play at 7.

 Q. Kiefer said he sensed some nerves from you. Is that fair to say?
 RAFAEL NADAL: Well, I don't know, no? I had the break in the 4-3 in the right game in the third set. Yeah, would love to have the break in the first game of the third. I had my chance, but I didn't. 
 Nerves? Sure, when you are one set all, you need the break for win the match, for win the set. Normal nerves. But nothing really more than usual.
