 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Where did you find it in yourself to save those match points?   
 RAFAEL NADAL: Lucky. I think today was lucky. Anyway, well, I am not happy. I'm not very happy about myself and the first two sets.   
 No, I think I had from the memory, a lot the last two matches. He played well, yes, but I had a little -- I was a little bit scared about his backhand. So, yeah, that's -- I didn't go to the match with the best mentality, no?   
 But, well, important thing is that I won. I'm quarterfinals, so I'm very happy for that. Yeah. I'm happy to have -- with the reaction. I played very well the match points against, and I played better the tiebreak. In the third set he was tired, I think. But I played better.   
  
  Q. What about his backhand gives you trouble or was making you think...  
 RAFAEL NADAL: Not the problem. I didn't play against his backhand, you know. I was scared about his backhand and it was a mistake. I think that now, because I have a good close forehand, too. So I think can't be a problem play against his backhand with my forehand.   
 But I played too much to his forehand and he killed me against my backhand, no? In the end I have a little bit changes of rhythm with the slice, so that helps me a lot. And, yeah, I find a solution, no?   
  
  Q. Is it safe to say during the change in the second set when the crowd was cheering for you, kind of bounced out, and was that kind of a turning point in your mind?   
 RAFAEL NADAL: It was important, no? The crowd support is always really important. I just can say thanks to the crowd.   
 But they still there and supporting me, so thank you very much. It's nice to have the good crowd with you, and today was really important.  
  
  Q. What did you mean when you say you are not the good mentality on the beginning of the match? What was the problem?   
 RAFAEL NADAL: I say that, because I think I didn't go to the match with clear idea how to play the match, no? So I go in the match, and I didn't have exactly the tactic or the things I had to do to win this match, no? Probably because I lost very easy in the last two matches against him, and I didn't know exactly think play.   
 So I'm not happy about myself about that. Anyway, if I lost the last two matches, I didn't play well and he did, and I go on court and try to play my game. Play aggressive and hard, and later he play better and beat me.   
 But I have to play, no? I didn't play with that rhythm and with that aggressivity in the beginning and he killed me, so I'm not happy about that.  
  
  Q. What about coming back for the next match? And is this a little bit like Australia with Verdasco and then going into the final?   
 RAFAEL NADAL: Probably I going to be better physically. I didn't play five hours. How long was the match?   
  
  Q. 2:48.   
 RAFAEL NADAL: It's okay.  
  
  Q. Look ahead to play the next match.   
 RAFAEL NADAL: Yeah, that was a big save today, so I hope to play more aggressive next match and this match today give me confidence hopefully for next match, no?   
 Well, I have to play if I want to win. If not, going to be almost impossible.  
  
  Q. Do you think that the two matches that you played yesterday, the doubles and the singles, had anything to do with this?   
 RAFAEL NADAL: I am more tired than usual? No, completely not. I played very late today. I sleep more than eight hours. I didn't do nothing during all the day. No.
