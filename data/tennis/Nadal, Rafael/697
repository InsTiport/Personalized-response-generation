  R. NADAL/R. Gasquet
6-7, 6-2, 6-1

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. What did you think of that first set? That was a very tough, long tiebreak. 
 RAFAEL NADAL: Yeah, very tough, no? I had two times break for me in the first set, so, well, he returned well. I had some mistakes. Well, in the tiebreak, you know, it was emotional tiebreak. I have my chance, but he has more than me. 
 Finally he play a little bit better and he beat me the tiebreak, no? Yeah, it was a nice first set.

 Q. What did you think of the way he played, especially the first set?
 RAFAEL NADAL: Well, he played well, no? It's nothing new. Richard is a very good player, so I know how good can play Gasquet, no? So just he did well, especially in the first set. 
 Later I maybe improve a little bit the intensity, the rhythm. I start to move him a little bit more, and, you know, he had a little bit more mistakes. 
 Well, it's difficult after won first set, tough first set like this, start the second set at 100%, no? If you win the tiebreak maybe you can start the second set a little bit more relax, no? I know that. 

 Q. Did you feel like he started to wear down as the match went on, started to get tired and slow a little bit as the match went on? 
 RAFAEL NADAL: I feel that I have to continuing playing my game. I have to move him. The match is long, no? He was playing unbelievable winners, no? But after one very long set like this, if I can continue and improve a little bit more my rhythm, it's difficult because you feel a little bit more tired, no? 

 Q. He said that he thinks you're the best player in the world without a doubt right now. You haven't said that, but do you believe that? 
 RAFAEL NADAL: Thank you Richard for the words, no? But the ranking says I'm the No. 2, so I feel the No. 2. 

 Q. You're undefeated against and Murray, your opponent tomorrow. Is that a factor when getting prepared for a match? Do you think about stuff like that?
 RAFAEL NADAL: I don't know, no? I prefer my position than his position, because, you know, sometimes when you didn't win against another one it's tough. 
 But at the same time, you know, every match is completely different, no? But, you know, Murray didn't win never against Djokovic, and today he did. He beat Djokovic. 
 So every match is completely different and anything can happen, no? He's playing at very good level because he beat Wawrinka and right now Djokovic. Both players are very good. I have to play very well if I want to have chances for win, no?

 Q. The decision to bring Toni with you as opposed to Francisco Roig, who usually accompanies you to the hard court tournaments after Wimbledon. Is that because this year you won Wimbledon and you're getting closer to becoming No. 1 and Toni needs to examine a little bit more what it takes to becoming No. 1?
 RAFAEL NADAL: I think I doesn't affect nothing if it's Toni here or Francisco Roig, no? Toni is coming here because after is Peking, and Francisco is coming to Peking. Toni don't want to go to Peking. For Toni be one month and a half he prefers come here and for don't come to Peking. Doesn't matter for the No. 1. 
 The true, we don't think about that, no? We think about play very good tournament here in Toronto like every year, no? 

 Q. Being so close, now that you've defended your points from last year's tournament and with Roger losing so many. After almost 160 weeks at No. 2, how does it feel to be so close that many weeks at No. 2 to taking over the ranking, which is now pretty much a mathematical certainty in the next month?
 RAFAEL NADAL: I feel I am in semifinal of Toronto. Here is very good tournament, no? I feel I want to play very good match tomorrow for have chance for win another title here in Canada, no? So that's my goal right now.
