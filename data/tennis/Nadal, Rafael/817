 Q.  How did you feel?  You got into your rhythm very quickly.

 RAFAEL NADAL:  Yeah, no, is okay.  I think in the beginning I play good, no?  On the warm-up, the five minutes, I was thinking I gonna lose easy.  Agassi was touching the ball unbelievable, very low, very tough.  I can't return the ball. 
 But in the match, always is different, no?  Maybe I serve my best day in my career, sure. 

 Q.  We also saw at the French Open you were behind the baseline, couple of feet behind the baseline.  But today you were right on the baseline.  You stepped up into the match.  Are you changing your play for grass?

 Q.  Consistency? 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Consistense (sic) with myself, serve like today.  I don't serve like today every day.  But I need improve my serve for any day, serve every day like this, no?  That's very important in this surface. 
 And the rest, if you are serving well, the rest is more easy, no, because you play with more calm, you can return with more calm, and that's decisive, no? 

 Q.  If you can do it once, you must feel that it can be done?  You showed today you can do all those things.

That's very important for my confidence for this tournament, but for the future, no?  Is important for continuing practicing with illusion, with motivation.  Because any day, one day in the next years, I want to have a chance for play the final here. 

 Q.  Andre spoke about how well you moved today on the court.  Can you talk about the challenge for you of running and moving on grass? 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  Is little bit more difficult for me, no?  But is important understand the surface, no, understand the court, learn to run in this court, no?  You need go little bit more like this, not like this all the time.  You understand me? 

 Q.  I think so.  It's feeling more natural? 
 RAFAEL NADAL:  I can how you more... (smiling). 

 Q.  It's becoming easier for you to understand the surface?
