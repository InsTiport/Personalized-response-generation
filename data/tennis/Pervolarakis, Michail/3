(Transcribed from recorded ATP audio.)
Q. So what did you -- got your first match in, obviously a lot of talk leading in, what did you think? What were your thoughts on the match, the format and all that?
MICHAIL PERVOLARAKIS: Obviously it is my first match on this level, first ATP match. I just wanted to focus on my game and play my best tennis and let the result come. Obviously it didn't, Felix played really well, he didn't give me any chances. It was a learning experience for me.
Q. Did you feel a little better, as your level picked up in the second set, did you feel like you kind of settled in and found your way?
MICHAIL PERVOLARAKIS: Yeah, definitely, I think I -- in the beginning I was very uncomfortable with his pace, but after playing with him a bit I was a bit more comfortable. I was able to get into the attack sometimes, played some good points, but didn't play good enough to win.
Q. What did you think of the format and having the guys closer to you in the team zones, all that kind of extra stuff?
MICHAIL PERVOLARAKIS: We were kind of talking about it before getting in. I feel like if I was completely out alone I would feel way more stress very much like that. But having your coach, having your team behind you to support you, having the Greeks shouting, it feels, it gives you motivation, it gives you power, it also relaxed me a bit before the match.
