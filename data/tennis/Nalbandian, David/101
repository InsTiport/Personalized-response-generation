MODERATOR:  Questions for David. 


Q.  You must love playing against Xavier Malisse. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Why? 

Q.  Because you beat him twice. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yes, but doesn't matter.  I think I play good today.  If I beat him before in Wimbledon, doesn't matter.  I think every match is different.  I don't know, he has some arm problems or something like that.  But I think I play really good.

Q.  Is it tough playing someone that you know is getting a bit slower as the match is going on, is getting more fatigued?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah.  I think when I lost the first set, I think I must be focused because I saw him, he was start with a little pain in the arm.  I think if I won the second set and start good the third set, I think maybe he must retire, but you never know.  I think after the first set, I play really, really good.  Then Xavier didn't see many chances to do, and he retire.

Q.  Do you think his problems are more mental than physical?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I don't know.  You have to ask him.

Q.  Did you realize he was injured?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I don't know.  I don't know if his pain is much, if he saw it's a lot or small.  I think he start feeling something.  I saw him when he serve 5-4 in the first set.  But you never know.  I think he feeling a little bit or a lot.  You have to be concentrate of that.

Q.  Do you think you're going to your next round match against Roger a little bit unprepared because of Malisse's condition today?  Do you feel pretty happy with the way your playing, your preparation for that match?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, I think I play good the second and third set, the last three games.  I think Roger is a great player, but I know him from Juniors.  From a long time ago I beat him two times.  I think it's going to be a tough match, but I have a good chance.
