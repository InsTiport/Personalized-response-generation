 THE MODERATOR: Questions.   
  
  Q. How much did the first-round match against Lleyton Hewitt take out of you?  
 DAVID NALBANDIAN: A lot. Of course, today I was like empty, you know? Didn't feel good. Is tough, very tough.   
  
  Q. Was it an injury or just tiredness?  
 DAVID NALBANDIAN: Everything. Nothing specific. Like empty, you know? I toss a ball for the serve and everything was moving around. It's tough playing like that.   
 Call the doctor. Told me that dangerous playing like that. That's why I retired.   
  
  Q. What about emotionally? You and Lleyton are great rivals, such a big match. Did you lack motivation coming into this match?  
 DAVID NALBANDIAN: It's completely different. Of course, it's better if you won. But sometimes is difficult. Of course, playing Lleyton on center court with all the crowd, it's a different motivations. But this tournament, all matches are very important, as well.   
 But today I try, but I couldn't.   
  
  Q. Did you feel like that right from the start?  
 DAVID NALBANDIAN: I feel a little better in the beginning. But every game getting little worse. So worser and worse. Not much to do really.   
  
  Q. What about your opponent, what do you make of him and his future?  
 DAVID NALBANDIAN: Well, he obviously is a good player. Unfortunately, I couldn't effort him very much. But looks like he's going to be a good one.   
  
  Q. How long do you think it's going to take you to be at the same fitness level as you were before?  
 DAVID NALBANDIAN: Well, you never know. Matches are matches. Sometimes you play a short match but with a lot of stress on it, with a lot of pressure. That sometimes is worse than playing four hours. You never know.   
 But I think during the year I'm going to be better.
