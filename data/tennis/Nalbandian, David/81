THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  After the Masters Cup in Houston, when have you started preparing for the year 2004? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  When? 

Q.  Yeah. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  December.

Q.  In December.  You were about one month holidays?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, no, no, less.  Little less.  I finish it, I think, on 10 or 12 in Houston, of November. 

Q.  What's important during your training?  What's important for you to eat?  What are important things? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think food is very important  - very, very important, for recover your physic in December.  And either way, in Australia, it's too hot so you have to be careful with everything.

Q.  What are exactly important things do you eat? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I have to tell you (smiling)? 


Q.  Was a completely different match from the one you played against Fabrice in Madrid a few years ago.  Do you remember?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, yeah, was different.  Right now is clay courts.  Last match was indoors  - so fast, with altitude. So I think I play very good today.  I feel good on the court.  Yesterday I played very long match and today I feel perfect, so I'm very happy for that. 

Q.  Were you afraid of recovery from yesterday's match?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No.

Q.  You're feeling okay physically?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Perfect.

Q.  You can play three hours?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  (Nodding his head yes).  I hope no play like that, but...

Q.  Fabrice says that, in his opinion, you're a better player on hard court than clay.  Do you agree with him?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, I agree.

Q.  Yeah?  Clay is not your favorite surface?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, but I think I can play good also.

Q.  But you said it was different match because it was indoor, but you can also play very well indoor. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, well, but some time you don't play your best tennis, and I think that day I didn't feel good, and Fabrice played a good match. 

Q.  He just told us that you could be No. 1.  What do you feel about it? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think is not impossible.  You have to work very hard.  I think I'm gonna try to do it, but this year with my injury in my ankle, I didn't start the year very good.  But I'm gonna try.  I think I have many months to still work on it, and I think I have a chance. 

Q.  What about playing Coria now? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Oh, is gonna be a tough match.  We play together when we was maybe 10 or 12 years.  So he know me too much, I know him a lot.  Is gonna be a very tough match, and I hope try to do my best tomorrow. 

Q.  Last time you had to play against him it was in the final in Basel. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, but we didn't play.

Q.  So last time you played him was...? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  February last year in Argentina.  I lost 7-6 in the third. 

Q.  What is your tactic against Coria?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Tactic?  I have to think about it. 

Q.  How many hours do you play tennis a day? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Depends.  Depends my ankle.  But normally I play between three and four hours a day.

Q.  Do you still like it, or is it..?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  If I don't like it, I didn't do it. 

Q.  Did you hold up with your ankle today?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, perfect.

Q.  Even when you were sliding?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I feel every day better.
