MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  You're happy with your match today?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah.  I think I play really good the first set.  I didn't play really good, but the other guy, he play good.  And then I think I have a little of luck in the second set.  I was break down, but when he serve 5-4, I play really good that game, and then in the tiebreak I play good also.  So I think I'm happy, I played really good today.

Q.  Do you feel well on the surface?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, yeah.  I think the surface is good.  Every day you're coming with more confidence, so is okay.

Q.  Your next match might be against Xavier Malisse.  You played him in the semifinals of Wimbledon.  Is this a special match, a rematch for you?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, no.  It's another tournament, another year, another match.  So I think each match is different.  If he win, I think he going to be a very, very good match.

Q.  You have the advantage psychologically?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, a little bit.

Q.  It doesn't matter to you?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No. 

Q.  This is the first time you've been to the third round here.  How confident are you going into the next match?  How far do you think you can go in this tournament?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, I happy to be in the third round.  I think I'm playing really good.  I don't know if it going to be in the semis or in the finals or quarterfinals, you never know.  I think I have a chances to play really good this week and the next week.  I don't know.  I have to be focused in my game.
