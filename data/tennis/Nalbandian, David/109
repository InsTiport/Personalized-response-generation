MODERATOR:  David Nalbandian.  Who would like to start?  
 
 
Q.  Are you shocked?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Excuse me?  
 
Q.  Are you shocked?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  What is that?  
 
Q.  Are you surprised? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  A little bit, yes.  My first time in Wimbledon being in semifinals I think is very good result for me.  I hope to be ready for tomorrow.  
 
Q.  Can you tell us how this happened?  You are surprised, but how did it really happen?  How did you get this far?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I don't know (laughter). 
 
Q.  Richard Krajicek couldn't even pronounce your name. 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Nobody.  Is difficult name.  No, I think I'm a little lucky in the draw.  But I think I was playing very good in the tournament.  Today I think Lapentti is a great player.  I was two sets up.  Then I think I was a little bit nervous or something like that.  He start playing good again.  I think was a difficult match, like every match is here in Wimbledon.  But I think I was practicing very good before in Argentina in grass courts.  You know, my first time in grass, being in semifinal, is great. 
 
Q.  You were a semifinalist in the Junior event here, correct?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, I do. 
 
Q.  You were disqualified? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah. 
 
Q.  Because you were late to the match, if I understand correctly. 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, they change the schedule, and I never know it.  
 
Q.  How early are you going to come to the semifinal?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think I going to sleep here (smiling). 
 
Q.  How upset were you then?  Were you very angry?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, yeah.  You know, when I was Juniors, was semifinalist, then was default or walk-over.  For me was terrible.  But, you know, the life have a revenge, and I'm here again, semifinals again, so is not so bad. 
 
Q.  Were you born in Argentina?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, I do.  I born Argentina. 
 
Q.  Do you speak Armenian?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, nothing. 
 
Q.  How many grass courts are there in Argentina?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Not much.  Seven courts. 
 
Q.  Do you play on them much?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, all Argentinian players were practicing on there before Wimbledon, so that's it.  Just a few courts. 
 
Q.  Where is it?  It's artificial grass?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, it's natural grass. 
 
Q.  Where?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  In Buenos Aires. 
 
Q.  I believe you're the first person in their first time in Wimbledon to reach the semis in the first try, since John McEnroe in 1977.  Also, like John McEnroe, you were disqualified for being late to a Grand Slam event.  Do you think you have anything else in common with McEnroe?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No.  I think John is a great, great player.  I think I have a long way to be like him. 
 
Q.  Do you feel you're still learning how to play on grass?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  For us, very difficult play on grass.  For all Argentinians, is very difficult.  But I think the first matches was very, very important for me to take confidence and a great feeling, well.  And then I starting playing very good.  I have to play tomorrow semis.  
 
Q.  Growing up, who was your tennis idol and who did you maybe model your game after?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I start playing for Boris Becker.  When he won here the first time, I just started playing tennis.  So he was my idol forever.  I don't think I play like Becker, but he was my idol, for sure.  
 
Q.  How much do you know about Xavier Malisse?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Not much.  He's a very, very good player.  He's in semis also, so he must be playing very good here.  I think he has very good results at last US Open.  I think he do fourth round or quarters.  He beat Henman there.  I think he's a very good, talent player.  Is going to be a tough match. 
 
Q.  Did you not play him in the Juniors?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, never.  
 
Q.  What has been the biggest court you have played on?  You'll probably have Centre tomorrow.  What is the biggest court you've played on before?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Before, I play Centre in French Open.  
 
Q.  Lapentti was very upset.  He said because there were two South Americans, they were on Court  2.  It was very unfair that a quarterfinal was there, and it's going to be hard for you to adjust to Centre. 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think the same here.  He was talking with me before the match.  If I won, or he won, is going to be difficult tomorrow play first time in Centre Court.  We never play in the stadiums in Wimbledon.  I think is a bad decision from the referee.  But I don't know.  We have to play whatever they say, and that's it. 
 
Q.  Do you think it will be a problem going out on Centre Court on the most famous court in tennis?  How do you think you will handle that?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Is very different play in central or Court No.  1 and outside courts.  The visual is different.  The feeling is different.  And I think the players who was playing before in central court have a more chances or different, so they know the feeling, they know everything.  I just play Court No. 2 quarters, so is a big difference. 
 
Q.  Over the last couple of years, it's been very difficult to get clay court-type players to come to Wimbledon.  Do you think that will change now as a result of these results this year?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think every players, they come here, and he say, "We can't play here on grass."  And I think you can do everything.  I think it's not too difficult  -- is difficult, but not too much.  If you are focus, if you think you can do everything.  But I think if you come here and you say, "I can't play," you never going to do it.  But if you come and you say, "Okay, I'm going to try, I'm going to enjoy the games," that's big difference.  
 
Q.  Where did you first learn tennis?  Can you tell us a little about your hometown?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I born in Unquillo, a very, very small city.  I start playing when I was five years in hard courts.  I don't know.  The town is 20,000 peoples, so it's very, very small.  I like that.  I always back home.  It's great for me, Argentina.  Cordoba is great.
