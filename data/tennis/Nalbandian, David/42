  Q.  You must be bitterly disappointed with that?   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah.  I didn't play good.  I couldn't return any serve.  I miss a lot of chances.  That's part of the game.   
  
  Q.  You had a lot of breakpoints in the opening set.  You didn't manage to convert them.  What do you think went wrong?   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, I couldn't return most of the match.  I mean, not even in the first set.  Second, as well and third as well.   
 I think if I broke once in the first set, everything will change.  But nothing, nothing happened.   
  
  Q.  Were you impressed by Verdasco's performance?   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  He play okay.  He don't play great.  I just lose by myself.   
  
  Q.  So you think you lost it as opposed to he won the game?   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  (Nodding).   
  
  Q.  You had a racquet warning.  You appeared to lose your temper a bit in the first set.  What was going through your mind at that point?   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Nothing.   
  
  Q.  I don't know if this has been asked.  You wanted to watch the football this afternoon?   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah.   
  
  Q.  Obviously, now you're out, you can watch it.  Was that a decision, do you think, to change around the way you were going to play?   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  What?  What do you mean?  I didn't understand.   
  
  Q.  Is that right, that you had the match moved so you could watch the football this afternoon?   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, and?   
  
  Q.  No, I just thought if that hampered your preparations at all.   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Oh, no.   
  
  Q.  Are you a big football fan?   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, normal.   
  
  Q.  You watch a lot of football?   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Normal.   
  
  Q.  Which is what?  What is 'normal,' I mean?   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Not every single matches, but some matches I watch it.   
  
  Q.  Do you think Argentina can win the World Cup?   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think so, yeah.  Yeah.   
  
  Q.  Is that something you've done before, tried to get sort of your matches around football matches, is that something that you've done before?   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No.  I never play a match before -- I mean between the World Cup.   
  
  Q.  But they were okay to let you do that, they were fine with that, they were cool?   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah.
