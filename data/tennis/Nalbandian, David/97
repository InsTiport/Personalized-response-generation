THE MODERATOR:  Good evening, Ladies and Gentlemen.  David Nalbandian.  First question, please.  
 
 
Q.  How hard is that defeat to take for you? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Was very tough.  Was very tough play out there without serve.  I have a problem in the abdominal, so was very difficult for make a good service.  I think my fast serve was hundred miles or something like that.  So I think that's very difficult to me to play.  I think Tim did play very good.  He put me very, very much pression on my game, on my serve.  And I think he play really good.  
 
Q.  Tell us more about the injury.  When did it happen?  Did it get worse during the game? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, with Kucera two days ago. 
 
Q.  Did it get worse today, the longer you played? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah. 
 
Q.  Were you in a lot of pain?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Excuse me?  
 
Q.  Were you in a lot of pain? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  (Nodding.) 
 
Q.  Did you consider withdrawing? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No.  He had to play good to beat me.  
 
Q.  What did you think were the strengths of his game today? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I don't know.  Was tough.  He play really good.  I know wasn't my hundred percent, but I do all my best, what I can do?  Didn't was enough.     
 
Q.  What do you think of Tim's chances this year, having just played him?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  You never know. 
 
Q.  Can he get to the final and win it, do you think?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  You never know.  He have to play good.  He don't play good, difficult.  
 
Q.  Was it hard to come up against that Centre Court crowd?  You probably never experienced anything like that before.  How did that affect you? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Why I no have experience like that?  
 
Q.  You wouldn't have played on Centre Court against a British player before. 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I don't care about that. 
 
Q.  Didn't bother you at all?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  (Nodding.) 
 
Q.  But obviously helped him?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  And...?  Normal, no?  
 
Q.  You obviously learned a lot about playing on grass last year.  What more have you learned this year that will help you in the future? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, I think  -- I think too much I play really good.  I think I like to play on grass.  The Centre Court didn't was so good.  I think well, not so good.  Well, I like to play on grass and I think it's gonna be better in the future. 
 
Q.  After reaching the final last year, how disappointing is it to fall in the fourth round this year? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I don't know if is big disappointment because I cannot play all my best.  That's impossible to me today.  But I don't know.  That's the rules of the games, you know?  You may get injure, and you have to decide if you play, if you don't.  
 
Q.  You were saying that Tim would have to play good to reach the final.  Do you mean he would have to play better than he played today, or the same or...? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  If he can play better, he's best.  I don't know.  Is difficult.  He have to play minimum like today. 
 
Q.  In what way did the injury restrict you today?  What particular things did it make more difficult to do?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  For the serve.  I cannot serve. 
 
Q.  Just the serve? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah.  Sometimes forehand or backhand, but for the serve.  
 
Q.  To pick up the point about the way you learned from last year to help you this year, have you learned things this year about playing on grass and at Wimbledon that will make you even stronger next year? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Could be.  
 
Q.  Such as? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, I hope yes.  I think if you will play many times on grass, you get more confidence.  So I think I like play on grass.  I play good last year, I think I play very good this year, so I like it.  I think every year is gonna be better. 
 
Q.  And one year it will take you to the title maybe? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Maybe. 
 
Q.  Do you have the belief within you that one day you will win this title? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I wish.  
 
Q.  You believe? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Of course.
