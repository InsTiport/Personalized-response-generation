THE MODERATOR:  Questions in Spanish for David.  
 
 
Q.  You're now in the quarterfinals.  What is your impression after a clear victory? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Fine.  I think today I started playing well, and this didn't happen in my last match, because I made many errors the other day.  So today I played great tennis from the beginning.  That makes me happy and confident.  I know I'm doing well.  
 
Q.  Although they're all good players, the draw seems to be fine.  Are you thinking about the final?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, not yet.  I saw my opponents.  I saw they are tough.  I defeated Soderling in the first round that had just won Lyon.  Srichaphan was a difficult opponent, too.  
 
Q.  I mean, what comes next? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Here, with the altitude, fast court, you need to be really concentrated and return as well as possible.  Henman lost, but there is Johansson who played the semifinals at the US Open and has done well recently.  
 
Q.  How do you feel physically?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Perfectly well.  No problems.
