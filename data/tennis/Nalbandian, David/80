THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  You did very well in the second set, 3-love, three breakpoints you saved there.  It really seemed to spur you forward. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah.  Was so tough  - the wind, everything, the court is not so good.  I think even Spadea couldn't do his best game.  I think I not play my best tennis, but I happy to be in semis and try to do a better game tomorrow. 

Q.  Did you feel your serve got better?  You were down those three breakpoints for 4-love, and you hadn't been serving very well. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, I served better the games before, but today was so difficult - to hit the ball and the windy, was so windy so was very difficult.  I think I try to do my best, but it was very tough.

Q.  Were you concerned when you were down?  You could have been down 4-love.

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, it was going to be very difficult if I am 4-love down.  But I think I serve very good  - like you said before  - I serve very good that points.  I save  - I don't know  - two, three or four...

Q.  Three. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Three.  So if you lose that game, it's going to be very difficult to come back in the second set.  I think after that I try to come back, to try to make better my games, try to make the ball just in the court, not try to do a lot because was very difficult.  I think I do very good, and...

Q.  Dropshots were very good. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, I'm happy for that.

Q.  You use that often?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Sorry? 

Q.  Do you do that a lot? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Depends. 

Q.  Yeah, on the situation? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  You have to see what happen in the court.  If the other guy is playing very, very far away from the baseline, you have to do it. 

Q.  How do you feel physically?  You had a very tough match yesterday.

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I feel good.

Q.  Feel good. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think I'm gonna feel better tomorrow.  I have an off day to rest.  But yesterday was very, very difficult - play two matches in one day.  I think in the first match I stop, I don't know, four or five times.  So that's very long.  I was very tired.  I come back to the hotel yesterday at eleven, so it's very difficult day.  But I feel good today again, so I think tomorrow I'm gonna be better.
