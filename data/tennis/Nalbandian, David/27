   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 

 Q.  This is maybe the place to start that run of victories.  Hasn't been your greatest year so far. 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, I hope so, but you never know.  So I think I'm playing good at the moment.  Today was tough conditions, all windy and everything, and I feel that I played good as well. 
 Yeah, I think that if I win one or two more matches and get more confidence, maybe I can be dangerous. 

 Q.  What do you think the difficulty has been so far? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, I get tendinitis in the knee, so that's made me play with a little bit uncomfortable on the court.  We finished so late Davis Cup last year.  So it's tough to play good every single week. 

 Q.  What did you think of the atmosphere out there today? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  It's similar to Argentina.  It's very close.  It's really good.  I really enjoyed it when the crowd is like this.  Most of us, Argentinians are really nice. 

 Q.  Describe it for people who maybe weren't sitting out there.  What's it like? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, it's tough to say, but it's amazing.  I mean, everything's -- the atmosphere looks like we're in Argentina, so it's great. 

 Q.  You like when they hold the flags up and they yell all that stuff? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, of course. 

 Q.  Do you think that the Argentines and the Latin America fans are a little more boisterous and get more into it?  Why is that? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Than who? 

 Q.  Than maybe just the Americans. 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, I think so, yeah. 

 Q.  Why do you think that is? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I don't know. 

 Q.  They sing the national anthem during the rain delay? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, that was good.  That was good.  Stand up, and it was good. 

 Q.  Do you think that's good for tennis? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, I mean, I enjoy it.  I think most of the players enjoy it those kind of things. 

 Q.  I think it looked as if maybe Vince was getting frustrated. 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Who? 

 Q.  Spadea. 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I don't know.  Ask him. 

 Q.  We did.  He was looking -- he threw the ball at the people.  He kept looking at those people. 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  All right. 

 Q.  David, you next play Jarkko Nieminen, who you played many times before.  Very fast player.  Could you talk to us a bit about the challenge of playing him. 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  He's a good player.  He's tough.  He's lefty, so that's a little uncomfortable with his serve.  But I think if I play good, and I beat him, I have to be ready for next match, that's it. 

 Q.  You know he won today? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah. 

 Q.  Korolev, rather amazingly.  Does that concern you at all? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No.
