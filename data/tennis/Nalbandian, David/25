   THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 

 Q.  Your thoughts on that match?  How disappointing? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, of course, very disappointing.  I didn't play even normal, so very disappointed. 

 Q.  Why didn't you play normal? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I couldn't feel the ball, even me myself.  It was quite complicated today. 

 Q.  It's unlike you because you are known for always fighting back.  Most of your matches are five sets.  Why do you think that was today? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I already answer that. 

 Q.  What do you do during all of these rain breaks?  How do you handle that? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  It's tough.  I mean, locker room waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting.  Yesterday was incredible and we didn't play.  So bad. 

 Q.  What do you typically do? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Practice. 

 Q.  When you're waiting. 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Oh, waiting.  Waiting. 

 Q.  Reading?  Listening to music?  Talking?  Playing cards?  What do you like to do? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Everything. 

 Q.  Do you think it would make sense to have a middle Sunday? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Of course. 

 Q.  Did it surprise you? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No.  Always is like this here.  But I don't agree.  I mean, nobody agree. 
 The bottom half has to play today, tomorrow and after tomorrow.  So why?  Because nobody who take the responsibility to play all three days in a row is going to play.  So that's why doesn't care about us. 

 Q.  It's tough on the players, isn't it? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Very tough.  Very tough. 

 Q.  What would be your plan for the rest of the summer?  Which tournaments do you think you'll play? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Play L.A. Toronto, Cincinnati, US Open. 

 Q.  What will you do from now until L.A.? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Back home.  Going home.
