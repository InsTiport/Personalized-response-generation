MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  When he keeps serving aces on set points, as he did in that second-set tiebreak, what are you trying to say, "Just keep hanging in there, somehow my chance will come"? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, nothing.  So I think the serve is his best shot so is normal on the big points he make some aces or some good serves.  So I have to try to keep focus on my return and try to make the more breakpoints.  So I just try to keep focus on my return and I think I do it so well today. 

Q.  Have you been working specifically on your fitness since Cincinnati? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yep. 

Q.  And, obviously, it's working because you look very fit. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I'm so good.  I work so hard, so I feel so good.

Q.  Can you just give us an idea of what you've been doing? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Top secret.

Q.  Oh, top secret. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  (Laughing). 

Q.  Okay, secret fitness regime. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, many things. 

Q.  Do you feel like you've been underestimated coming into the US Open this year? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I don't know.  I think I'm playing so good this week and I try to enjoy every match.  That's it.  I'm enjoying it. 

Q.  How close do you think you are to your best form? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think today I play really good.  But also, I think I have to keep on my game, I have to on the second set.  I was break up in the second set and then I lose.  I think I play really good, but it's many things.

Q.  Did you sense he was starting to get tired? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  The first and second set was very, very close.  But always I have the break in the beginning, so in the match I always think I have the match in my control.  But after that, I think Mark, in the first set, when he break me in the first set, he start to play better.  He make three or four winners, forehand winners. So he play good that game, and then I lose some points and try to keep on focus on the game. 

Q.  What aspect of your game were you most pleased about?  Was it the backhand? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  The return. 

Q.  Especially on the backhand? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Return (smiling).

Q.  Doesn't matter which one?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, doesn't matter.  I think maybe he, in the second serve, he always  -- always he serve almost to my backhand.  So I return so well.  But when he serving to my forehand, I did so well also. 

Q.  How was the crowd support affecting your game today?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Nothing.

Q.  You didn't hear them? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yes. 

Q.  It helped? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  What? 

Q.  It helped?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  To who? 

Q.  The crowd, to you?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, of course.  I'm enjoy it. 

Q.  Is it Federer in the next round?  Can you tell us a little bit about playing him, if it is an advantage to go in the match against a guy you have beaten every time so far. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think he's a very good player, so I think it's gonna be a tough match if he won tonight. But I just enjoy my game tonight and I'm not gonna think about tomorrow.

Q.  If you do have to play him, would you prefer to play him here or Wimbledon?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Whatever.  I'm ready.
