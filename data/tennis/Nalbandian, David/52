THE MODERATOR:   Questions for David, please. 
 
 
Q.  Could you first clarify whether you had injury problems.  We all thought that you did?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I feel a little bit bad in the abs when I was serving.  So a little bit tough.  
 
Q.  How much did that affect you in the match? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  It was difficult to say how much, but a little bit of course.  
 
Q.  Did you only feel it in the second set? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Sorry?  
 
Q.  Did you only feel it from the second set onwards?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, from the beginning of the match.  Was all the time, yeah. 
 
Q.  First of all, your serving speed seemed to be a lot faster, then it dropped off, did it?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, little bit.  
 
Q.  Was that an injury at the start of the match or from a previous match?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  From previous, yeah. 
 
Q.  From the last one? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah.  
 
Q.  Can you believe you didn't win that match?  You had a huge lead, you had a break again in the fifth set.  I mean, are you stunned that you didn't come out ahead? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, I get a lot of chances to win the match.  So I can't understand how I missed that opportunity to win it.  So quite tough.  
 
Q.  What's your level of disappointment?  You've only played in one Grand Slam final before.  You were so close getting into another one. 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Is difficult to say, but high.  
 
Q.  If you won the second set more easier, say 6-1 or 6-2, would it have been a different story, do you think?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, maybe change.  But you never know.  But if I win easy the second one, I was two breaks up, maybe could change.  
 
Q.  Did either the fireworks or the fans bother you at all?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No.  
 
Q.  He's has had an extraordinary run through the tournament.  Why is he so difficult to put away? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Sorry?  
 
Q.  Why is he so difficult to finish off?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  He's very good player.  I mean, it's not easy.  He's playing good.  He beat a lot of very good tennis players on this tournament.  So was very tough to beat him.  
 
Q.  Are you surprised that his ranking was not higher coming in here? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  He will be better.  
 
Q.  Is this the sort of result that makes you want to relook at the way you approach the game?  Do you need to do things differently?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  From now?  
 
Q.  Yeah. 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Maybe a little bit.  But I don't -- I don't think that I lose the match for the injury or for many things.  I'm keep working same way so I'm doing as right now. 
 
Q.  Do you take something positive away from this experience? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah.
