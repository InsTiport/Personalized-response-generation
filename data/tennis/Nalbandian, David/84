THE MODERATOR:  Questions in English first. 


Q.  How was that out there today? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Excuse me? 

Q.  How was that out there for you today? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, I think every day feel better.  I think I play really good until 4-3 in the third.  And then I didn't concentrate a little bit and he start playing a little better.  I think was a great match. 

Q.  What is it about here that you like so much?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I like to play here.  I think the Rebound Ace,  I like it because it's not too fast.  The ball is getting higher, so I like it. 

Q.  Roger Federer said today he always feels tired after playing on Rebound Ace, even if it's an easy match.  How are you finding it on your body?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I feel great.

Q.  You had some little injury problems last year.  Are you fully over all of them?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I had the wrist problem, but now I'm perfect. 

Q.  Looking further ahead to the tournament, the second week, what are your feelings on that?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I have to win one more match and then I gonna think about Federer.  I have to see.  I don't know who's gonna win between Canas and Henman.  Every match is difficult.  If somebody's in the fourth round it's because he's playing good.  So I have to be careful and try to play better. 

Q.  Since the Wimbledon final and losing that one to Lleyton like that, has that made you sort of -- do you feel like you're impatient to get back into another one now, or do you think it's been a progress thing to build up to where you are?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think two years, I get more experience on my game, on my life.  I will love to play another Grand Slam final.  Always I dream when you win a Grand Slam, so I think I'm gonna be ready for the next final. 

Q.  Can you compare yourself, your game, from then to now? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  It's very difficult.  I think, like I told you before, I get more experience and everything, inside the courts and outside, that's make it much better.

Q.  How did you cope emotionally with that final?  Was there any problems, were you nervous going out there thinking it was a different game?  Would you handle that differently?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:   Is no difference.  Wimbledon finals, I play No. 1 in the world.  Lleyton play a great match.  So didn't was easy, but I think the next time's gonna be different. 

Q.  In what sense? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I don't know.
