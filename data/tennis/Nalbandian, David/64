THE MODERATOR:  Questions in Spanish. 


Q.  How would you analyze this match? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think the match was a good one.  We both played, as far as I am feeling, well.  We both played well.  We both had chances in playing a third set.  He had an incredible point, he broke my serve, he held his serve.  I think it was a great match. 

Q.  Do you think he played better?  Are you happy with your own play? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, I haven't seen stats or anything, but I didn't feel uncomfortable at all.  I think I played well.  I think the match was quite good.  I ended it with a lot of confidence.  Some points showed that. 

Q.  Where did it show, because he had peaks? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  My breakpoint in the third set was a key one.  There were a few other points that, in difficult situations, he recovered really well. 

Q.  You said your goal for this year was to be in the top three.  Do you think it's been a good year for you? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  There are positives and negative aspects, as with everything.  I would have liked to have had a position in the Masters, a guaranteed position, without having to fight for it right now.  I went through many circumstances.  Every situation is different. 

Q.  So you think you're out of the Masters? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, not yet.  I've going two tournaments still.  I have mathematical chances to get in.  I'm playing well.  I can win next week in Paris.  Things would change. 

Q.  Would you be an alternate if you went to Shanghai?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I'll have to think about it. 

Q.  (In English.)  You had better skill from the baseline, more control in the longer rallies.  That seemed to be why you won the second set.  Why did it change in the third set? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  (In English.)  Well, I take my chance in the first set.  I get a breakpoint, and he play an incredible forehand down the line on the corner.  I mean, nothing to do.  He played a little bit better at that moments.  Then when I was serving, he break me.  He play very good that point.  I do an easy mistake in 30-40.  I think the match always was close and was tough for both. 

Q.  (In English.)  You played him here last year, I think.  Was this a similar match or was it different? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  (In English.)  No, it was different:  I won. 

Q.  (In English.)  How was it different in the way the match went? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  (In English.)  He played much better this year than the last one.  He's winning so much matches with confidence.  He's playing good. 

Q.  (In English.)  Do you still feel confident about reaching the Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  (In English.)  Yeah, with two tournaments remaining, I think I'm playing good.  So let's try the best. 

Q.  (In English.)  Is that your one remaining goal for this year? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  (In English.)  Yeah, yeah. 


Q.  For the Argentine Federation, there's been an electoral process.  What is your opinion? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I didn't know there was an election process actually.  But I think players do not vote. 

Q.  But they're important in the issue. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  We'll see. 

Q.  What is your opinion about the final tomorrow, Nadal/Ljubicic? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  It's going to be a tough match.  They're both great players.  Ljubicic has been winning a lot of matches.  Rafa has nothing to envy.  It will be a wonderful match.
