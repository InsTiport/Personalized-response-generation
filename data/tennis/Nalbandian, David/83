THE MODERATOR:  English questions. 


Q.  You seemed to be continuing the strong vein of form.  Yet to drop a set. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, I think also today I play really good.  I feel very comfortable on the court, and maybe he was a little tired from the last match.  But either way, I think I play so good.

Q.  From the start of the year, you missed Adelaide because you had to go and have your wrist checked and that kind of stuff, it seems to have come together for you.  Are you feeling fresh?  Can you explain?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I feeling good.  I didn't play Adelaide because I had to check the wrist for be sure that I can play, I don't know, maybe 10 more years.  But actually, then I play three matches in Kooyong, and that's make me a very good feeling in the court.  I really enjoy the match. 

Q.  Is this as good a run of results as you've had and as good a form as you've had, do you think?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think so, yeah.  It could be.  I think is the best feeling what I have inside the courts.  So I feel really good inside the court and outside the court also.  That's made me more better player every time. 

Q.  Do you have any idea why it seems to have clicked for you?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Because I forget.  I don't know, the reason maybe is I'm working so hard to try to be the best, so maybe that's a point. 

Q.  Do you go through a period after you were in the Wimbledon final when people said, "That was very lucky that he was in the Wimbledon final.  He was beaten easily"?  Was that hard on you mentally for you for a while, people saying, "He's just a fluke"? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Is what the people think.  I don't think like that.  I can't do much about what the people think.  Just playing and trying so hard. 

Q.  Do you think that perhaps while that was a surprise, your form now really isn't a surprise?  Is that fair? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Of course was a surprise because I never play Wimbledon, was my first time, my first grass court tournament.  So of course was a surprise.  But after that, I think every time I play better.  Right now I feel so good. 

Q.  Did you play any other sports while you were growing up?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  When I was young? 

Q.  Yeah. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  A lot. 

Q.  Were you good at any others? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I do soccer, I swim, basketball, karate (laughter).  Horse, everything.

Q.  Why did you start playing tennis?  Can you remember?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Of course tennis (smiling).  I forget it.  When I was...? 

Q.  How old were you when you started?  How did you get interested in tennis?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Always.  When I was five years, I start play tennis.  Also I do all the other sports at the same time.  So I didn't have time to study to the school.  I do many, many sports.  But I think when I was seven or eight, I just play tennis. 

Q.  Did your family play as well?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, all of them. 

Q.  The new hairstyle, is that a sort of David Beckham thing? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No.  Just myself. 

Q.  It's the same style as his, though?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Not right now.  I think he have another look right now.

Q.  Does he?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think so.  I don't know.

Q.  Maybe Beckham copied Nalbandian. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  (Smiling).
