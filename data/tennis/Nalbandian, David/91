THE MODERATOR:  First question, please. 


Q.  Are you very angry now because of the calls? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  A little bit. 

Q.  Especially the one 6-all in the tiebreak.  Can you comment on that. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Is difficult.  You had to fight against everything, but...  The match is over and that's it. 

Q.  The tiebreak, was that the reason that you maybe lost the fourth set 6-1? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No. 

Q.  No? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  (Shaking his head no). 

Q.  You played to a fabulous level, a wonderful level in the first two sets.  How hard is it to keep on playing that way against someone like him? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Is difficult to play without serve and without backhand.  Also, is difficult play three games in a row.  It's also difficult play against Andy. He's a great player.  So, many things.  But I don't know. 

Q.  When you've had experience of Davis Cup crowds, is this similar, do you think?  If you were playing an American here, it's like playing in a Davis Cup atmosphere as well as Grand Slam atmosphere?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, sometimes the crowd, you hear so much.  But it's some important points maybe somebody call out or something, and it's difficult. 

Q.  Have you heard anything back on that shot, if you thought it was good?  Replays are tough to tell.

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  The replay was good or was out? 

Q.  It was kind of very tough to tell.  Very close. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Every time when it's close, everything is for them. 

Q.  Are you happy with the general performance, coming to the semifinals? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, I feel pretty good. 

Q.  Don't you think you maybe lost the match not in the tiebreak, but you had some chances in the third set earlier?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, I have many breakpoints.  But I think I didn't play bad that point, so he serve really good.  Not much to do. 

Q.  What annoyed you the most - the bad call, when they shouted "out" and you almost were stopped by that shout, or other situations in the match?  What has annoyed you most? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, I think the most important on the match, it was when I couldn't serve and I couldn't play my backhand normally.  So I think that was the more important things in my game, rather than the tiebreak.  Then you have one strange point when they call out, somebody call "out," and that's strange.  But the difficult was me, my serve, and my backhand. 

Q.  Why couldn't you serve and play your backhand?  What was the reasons?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I get a little injured.

Q.  What kind of injury? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Abdominal and wrist. 

Q.  When did that happen? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Which one? 

Q.  The injury. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Which one? 

Q.  The injury you just mentioned.  I didn't hear what you said.

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Abdominal is from the last match, from yesterday.  I feel today, the wrist. 

Q.  Do you think they were caused by fatigue?  You played three matches in three days. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, that's one thing important, you know.  It's very tough days, many, many games in a row.  So I don't know if because we didn't have a day off or something.  But it's difficult to play very tough matches three days in a row. 

Q.  How tired did you get? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  On the match? 

Q.  Yes. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I didn't feel tired.  I feel good. 

Q.  With everything considered, you had the match at hand in the third set.  You were up 6-5 in the tiebreak.  That's just got to be ultimately frustrating to not make the finals after that? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, I have a match won.  But he do a good serve.  What can he do? 

Q.  You've played against three of the biggest servers in the game in a row  - Philippoussis, El Aynaoui, Roddick.  How did Roddick's serve compare to those guys?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  He serve good.
