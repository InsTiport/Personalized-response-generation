  Q.  You have seen some great servers in your career.  Roddick hits a big serve, Federer hits a great serve.  Could Ljubicic, when you take into account speed and the accuracy of his serve, could he be the best server of the game?   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I don't know if he the best, but he serve really good.  Few ones that serve very good as well, that's Roddick, that's Federer, Calleri as well.  There is a few ones.   
 But when he play like this, it's very tough.   
  Q.  Today was his serve almost untouchable most of the day?   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah.  Almost perfect.   
  Q.  What makes it so difficult to return?  It's very accurate, or the same movement?  What makes it so difficult to read his serve?   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Everything.  He's very, very good.   
  Q.  You played so well against Ancic.  What happened today?  Beginning of the match...   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  He played better than me.  Nothing special.  Everything perfect.  He played better.  It's simple.   
  Q.  Do you think he has the game to beat Federer?   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I don't know.  He never beat him, so I think he even never beat Roger or just one, I don't know.   
  Q.  2002.   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think he's playing good right now, but you never know.   
  Q.  Did you try to change knowledge something during the game?   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I tried to play my game.   
  Q.  In your whole game.   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I tried to play my game, but I never couldn't make it.  So was tough.  Was windy.  He played incredible.   
 So was really tough.
