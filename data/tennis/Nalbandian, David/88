THE MODERATOR:  We're going to start in English and then we'll switch into Spanish.  English questions, please. 
 
 
Q.  What went wrong today, David? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, I think almost everything (smiling).  I didn't feel really good.  Of course didn't was my day.  But, also, I think Roger play a very good match, almost perfect.  The court was so fast today, it was hot.  The court was so fast.  That's helping him a little bit so...  Was a little difficult and a strange feeling for me.  
 
Q.  Did you have any more problems with your wrist? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, I didn't use it, so... (Laughter). 
 
Q.  I wondered if that was why, you were having a problem, you weren't using it as much as usual? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I would like to use a little bit more, but I didn't play many games so...  I didn't feel nothing.  I am happy for that.  So I have to continue be careful with the wrist and, well, not play so many games.  That's good for me.  
 
Q.  Are you clear now of having to have any major treatment for the wrist before next year? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, I have to take all the time for next year, be sure I'm not gonna have more problems.  So I don't know how many week I have to take it after this. 
 
Q.  But there's no threat of having to have surgery or anything like that?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Could be. 
 
Q.  Could be?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  (Nodding his head).  
 
Q.  What's the program now, will you go back to the specialist after? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, depends how I feel after the Masters.  So I have to wait.  
 
Q.  It's been a long time since there have been two Argentines in the Masters Cup.  You grew up with Guillermo Coria.  Can you talk a little bit about him and his game and if you guys have a rivalry, the kind of rivalry you have. 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I don't know.  I think we are good players, but not only us.  In Argentina, is many players.  Is not only two.  Of course we are happy for be here in the Masters, both of us.  But I'm ready and I think he's also ready for do many great things on the tour.  So we are young and I think I want to help to the kids for Juniors in Argentina for be more generation continue, like we are doing right now. 
 
Q.  You've played against him for many, many years, in Juniors, now in the pros.  What are the strengths in his game?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Guillermo's game?  
 
Q.  Yeah. 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  He's a great player.  I think he have a very good mind, very good legs.  I think he don't have nothing special or some very big shots.  But he play very good from everything.  So he serves good, forehand is good, backhand is good.  His mind is good so...
