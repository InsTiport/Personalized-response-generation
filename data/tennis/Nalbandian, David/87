THE MODERATOR:  English questions, please. 


Q.  Can you tell us why there's been such a long delay?  We were told some things had to be sorted out. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  My wrist. 

Q.  Was that a very difficult match to lose in the circumstances? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, I think was very hard match.  I think Andre played very good.  I also tried to do my best, but sometimes it's not enough. 

Q.  What were your concerns with the officiating? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  They can do a better job. 

Q.  With the technology and seeing the call is right, how does that make you feel after it? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think  -- I don't think.  Everybody thinks that the technology is not so good.  Everybody agree about that. 


Q.  You clearly weren't impressed at one stage with the way Mr.  McIngvale was supporting your opponent. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think it's a lack of respect towards the players. 

Q.  How do you look back at this Masters Cup?  Is it a special experience for you? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah.  I think always  -- always, you think you could do better.  But of course I'm not happy to lose, but I think the match of today I play really good.  But I'm not in the semis, so that's not good. 

Q.  Did you feel Mr.  McIngvale's actions were influencing the officials?  Was that one of your concerns?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I don't know.  That's very difficult to say.  I don't know. 

Q.  What did you speak with Mr. Darby about, the supervisor?  Why did you ask to talk to him?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Private conversation.  

Q.  Have you heard any complaints from other players about the support Mr.  McIngvale is only giving to Americans? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  They all think the same way, in the same way. 

Q.  Have you spoken to him at all since the match?  Have you spoken to Mr.  McIngvale since the match?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No. 

Q.  Have you ever come across anything like that before? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I don't remember that.
