THE MODERATOR:  Questions for David, please. 


Q.  How difficult was it for you to play a match so late at night?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  So late? 

Q.  Yeah. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, is tough.  I mean, every day we're sleeping at this time.  But I think the worst thing is the few hours you have left until the next match.  So I don't have much hours to rest.  I have to do many things, be careful with the things I'm gonna do.  So I think that's the more tough things.

Q.  What will you do in those hours? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Sorry? 

Q.  What will you do in the hours until your next match?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I need rest, I need sleep, I need work a little bit.  Try to recover more.  I don't know what time it's at but...

Q.  Three o'clock. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  But I'm going to be in bed around quarter to four.  Is not, yeah, is not easy.  I mean, I don't have many, many hours to sleep.  But doesn't matter.

Q.  Do you think in that regard will it make a big difference to you whether you play a day match or a night match in the next game?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Of course difference.  I mean, if you play during the day and if it's hot, you feel it.  I mean, if you have to play five sets when it's so humid, so hot, it's tougher than when you play at night.  But if you play at night and you play longer, long match, it's tough also. 

Q.  How are you feeling physically?  You haven't had an easy match yet.  How do you feel physically? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, I feel good.  Not any problems at the moment. 

Q.  I guess you've been waiting a long time to play Lleyton Hewitt. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Me? 

Q.  Yes.  You haven't played him since Wimbledon.  You must have been waiting a while? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah.  I think every match is different.  I always say the same.  Is gonna be tough for him.  He's playing in his country with his crowd.  Is gonna be quarterfinals from Grand Slam, so is gonna be tough match for both.

Q.  Will it be almost like a Davis Cup type match? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Maybe.  Maybe, yes.

Q.  How better a player do you think you are now than when you played Lleyton at Wimbledon? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, when I play with him, I was 20 years old.  So I think right now I'm feel more confident with my game.  Older.  Of course you have more experience on the five-set matches and Grand Slams and everything.  So it's gonna be different for sure.

Q.  There's been a few other players so far that have been upset about the way Lleyton carries on on the court, the "c'mons" and all that sort of thing.  How do you feel about it? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I don't know.  I didn't play against him yet.  But I don't know.  He play like that.  I mean, is not easy when you have one guy behind the net doing all the time that.  I think is not like a (inaudible) sport.  I mean, it's not very good for the sport. 

Q.  Did you speak to Chela about what happened the other night?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, no.  I didn't see him.

Q.  You didn't speak to him?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I didn't speak, no.

Q.  How will you react if Lleyton does that sort of thing?  I mean, how do you keep your emotions in control? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think if he do it when he won a point, it's okay.  But not when you do a mistake or easy mistake or something like that.  That's the worst thing, I think.  If he make a winner or win a very good point, that's fine.  But not if make a double-fault or an easy forehand, easy backhand, easy volley, it's not that way.  It's not working that way.

Q.  Do you think most of the players in the locker room feel that way?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think so, yeah.
