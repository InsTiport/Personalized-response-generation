 DAVID NALBANDIAN: When I come back I have a tour in the future in Argentina and
Paraguay. Afterwards I will finish with Ericcson Cup in Buenos Aires: When it comes -- I
will play professionals after Australia. I think Argentina has always very good tennis
players, but always in juniors and to the Agrentinian tennis players have been always very
difficult to make the transition to professionals. Time will tell and it will depend on
how I will perform. Basically in my free time on holidays, I like to go somewhere alone
and the further the better from the city. If possible to go fishing in a lake, for
example, something like that.
