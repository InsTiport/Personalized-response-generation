THE MODERATOR:  Questions in English, please. 
 
 
Q.  He just seemed to lift at the critical points, at the important points, Roger seemed to.  That was the difference maybe today?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, I think the difference was so close.  So not too much difference.  I think in the important points, in the big points, he played better than me.  That's the difference. 
 
Q.  He made 55 unforced errors to 30 in your case.  You must be disappointed in the result. 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I don't care about the statistics so...   The match is enough, to win or to lose.  Simple.  
 
Q.  What was the difference between last year and this year? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  What difference?  Because why I won?  
 
Q.  You beat him. 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  So?  
 
Q.  Just the main points. 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Every match is different.  I can't say I played bad.  So I think the match was very, very close.  So not much difference.  Just, I don't know.  I don't know how many points he won or how many points I won.  But the difference was in the big moments he played better, better than me.  I have a lot breakpoints and he served really good.  So he played little better.  
 
Q.  Was it a problem for you that you hadn't had a real hard test before in this tournament?  You won so easily every match before. 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No.
