  Q.  How do you feel on clay at the moment?  DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, not hundred percent.  But I don't know, the match today, it's difficult to take something positive.  I mean, I didn't play my best.  Q.  Was it too early for you?  DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Very early.  I don't know, this kind of tournament, it's ridiculous to play at this time.  Looks like, I don't know, futures - futures in, I don't know, nowhere.  So it's ridiculous.  Q.  You're not used to playing that early?  DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, no.  And when you ask to play a little bit late, so it's worse.  Q.  What is your main ambition at the moment?  DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, try to win a tournament.  I mean, I know that I can play good on clay as well, so I have to keep going, try to get more confidence every match that I play.  I didn't play lot of matches after Paris last year, Roland Garros, so I didn't play many tournaments on clay, so that's tough in the beginning.  But I feel that I can play better.  Q.  In which respect above all?  DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, I don't know.  I have to try to play my game all the time.  End of FastScripts...
