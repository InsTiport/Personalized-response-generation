THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 


Q.  Another quick match for you.  Are you playing the best tennis of your life around now? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, I think I'm play -- today I play much better than the other day.  But actually was very quick.  Is good because is a little hot and five sets.  When you win in three sets, is very good for my body. 

Q.  When you went to Spain about the wrist, it's a big trip to go to Spain, then he says, "No problem."  You must have been pretty worried. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Is going to be worse if the doctor tells me is bad. 

Q.  You must have been worried to go quite that far without an opinion?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, no, no.  All December I didn't feel pain.  So for me was very good.  But I didn't see the doctor, so I have to see the doctor first for one guy who study. 

Q.  He's the one that did the surgery?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah. 

Q.  You felt a little bit of something two weeks ago when you were playing?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, nothing. 

Q.  It was just a check?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Just check, yeah. 

Q.  Is this the best form you've ever been in?  Could David Nalbandian now beat David Nalbandian any other day? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think every day is different.  Every day you feel different.  Every day you work different for be better.  Right now I think I'm very good.  Always I trying to do my best.  If I can, I win quickly - better.  If not, I have to run a little bit more.  But I think I feel so good this year.  This tournament I feel great. 

Q.  Do you feel any closeness to Sargis Sargsian?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, we talk.

Q.  When you see him playing, you're hoping he wins?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah. 

Q.  Who were your heroes growing up in Argentina, not just tennis, but soccer or anything? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Maradona.

Q.  We've heard of him. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Of course.  And Fangio.

Q.  Your confidence at the moment, David, is it on a high after what you did at Kooyong last week and the way you're now playing here?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah.  I feel so good.  I work so hard all December, so I think I'm ready to play good enough today.  I think I can play better also. 

Q.  What kind of training did you do in December?  What kind of work did you do, your preparation?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Same preparation than other ones.  Well, not the same, but just work (smiling). 

Q.  Your fitness, is it just about right now, top fitness?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm thinking I feel so good.  I work so hard all December and some days of January.  I think I feel great.

Q.  You could play Wayne Ferreira or David Sanchez in the next round.  Have you played either of those two much?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I don't remember with David Sanchez.  I'm not very sure, but I play with Wayne one time three years ago here, and I lost in four sets. 

Q.  The match you played against Roddick in New York, did you learn anything in particular about yourself from playing that match or your tennis from playing that match?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I won more than what I lost.

Q.  You won more points, I'm sorry?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Just myself.  I (inaudible) myself.  That's great.

Q.  What were the physical problems for you in that match?  Was it stomach?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yes.  The wrist, of course, and abdominals.

Q.  And it got worse as the match went on?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, of course.  I started playing with a strain of abdominals.  3-All in the first set, I get injured in the wrist. 

Q.  Have you watched the tape of that match?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, not at all.  Some points. 

Q.  The line call?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Of course (smiling).
