MODERATOR:  With the win today, David improves to four in a lifetime against Federer.  He moves into the Round of 16.  Questions for David. 


Q.  Why do you play him so well?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Excuse me? 

Q.  Why do you play him so well? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, I feel good today.  I think I play really good, and he also play okay.  I think was a very tough match.  Very, very close.  I was always break up in the first set.  Then in the second, I was 5-2 and then he start to play better.  But I think in the end of both set I play really good. 

Q.  Is there something about his game that you like?  You seem to do well against him. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I like to play with him.  That's it (smiling). 

Q.  Is that because you know you can beat him? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Could be.

Q.  You're in a good run of form at the moment.  Are you getting more confident with every match? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yes, of course.  Yesterday I think I play also really good.  Today was too hot in the court, I feel it.  So... But I think I play better every match, and I hope to continue all week like this. 

Q.  What do you think about how so many of the Argentine players are doing so well lately?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Everybody ask me all the same every time.  I don't know.  I think we work too hard.  That simple. 

Q.  No reason why there are so many players now and there haven't been before?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Maybe we're good. 

Q.  Did you play against a lot of the other guys when you were growing up in Argentina?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  We training together or something like that? 

Q.  Yes. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, sometimes.  Not all the time. 

Q.  What were you thinking when he started to come back when you were up 5-2 in the second?  What was going through your mind as he started to even things up?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, nothing.  I think I have my chances in 5-3 when I serve, but he play very good that game.  And then I continue, continue playing well.  I never was down in the score, so nothing. 

Q.  Are you surprised to see so many seeds out in this tournament?  I guess it's 12 now. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No. 

Q.  You've had some distractions with problems back in Argentina, and security-wise with your family.  Has that been on your mind at all?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, I talk many times with my family.  Everything is okay. 

Q.  Is that just something that comes with success and being a star, that you have to worry about these things? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, everybody have to be careful right now, but we're gonna do nothing.  Maybe my parents are coming here or to Europe, I don't know.

Q.  But it's very worrying?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, of course. 

Q.  Do they travel with you much, or have they travelled?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, not too much.  My father didn't like it.  He enjoy be at home. 

Q.  You've already been in the Top 10.  You were in the finals at Wimbledon.  When you think about what you'd next like to accomplish, what do you want to do? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Win a Grand Slam and win the Davis Cup. 

Q.  You are a big motoring fan.  Can you talk about that.

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  What do you mean? 

Q.  That you are very close to the Peugeot Team, some guys. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, yeah, I'm very big fan.

Q.  You try to follow some competitions, some races?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Always I try to do, but our calendar, it's too hard, too long, and it's impossible to be in the races. 

Q.  You have seen some races?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, yeah.  I was in Greece after Paris. 

Q.  You like driving fast yourself? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yep. 

Q.  Has the tournament given you a car?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, but it's not my car.

Q.  So you're not driving too fast?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  (Shaking his head no).

Q.  Your car is a Peugeot, correct?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah.

Q.  A special one?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  206 World Rally Championship.

Q.  So you get pulled over by the policemen a lot?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  What?

Q.  When you're driving too fast, do the policemen come after you?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, no.  Not in the road, in the mountains. 

Q.  You're too fast for them.

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I try (smiling).
