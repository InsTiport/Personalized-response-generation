 THE MODERATOR: Questions for David Nalbandian.   
  
  Q. Since you were injured during the Athens Olympics, so you didn't participate, now that you're coming to Beijing, is there any difference between the Olympics and the other competitions? Now that the scores from the Olympics are going into your ranking, is that an incentive for the professional players?   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN: Well, yeah, I didn't play Athens. It was kind of tough moment for me, being there, don't playing.   
 Here I feel good. I feel like the organization is much better than there. I'm really enjoy it. All the team are enjoying the moment.   
 Well, I think the points for the ranking are great, because before the tennis players didn't care much, just few ones. And now with the points, everybody want to come. Is a very nice event. So that's why now it's much tougher than before.   
  
  Q. Would you describe the match you just had and talk about your opponent, the Chinese player, Shaoxuan Zeng.  
 DAVID NALBANDIAN: Well, I didn't know much about him. I think I played a very good first match. I think he's still young and he can improve a lot.   
 But very good first round for me. Now I try to look forward to the match in the tournament and try to be better every match.
