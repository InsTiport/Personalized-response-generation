THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 
 

Q.  Another teenager today, but not quite such an intimidating atmosphere, I don't think.
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, it wasn't the same, but... Was better.  I won in three sets, so that's good. 
 

Q.  Where did you think you took control of the match today?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think I played pretty good all the time.  In the end of the second I played very good in the tiebreak, and then he falls down a little bit in the beginning of the third.  So this makes me more confidence. I think he believe that he didn't have any chance left. 
 

Q.  He said he was tired.
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think so, yeah. 
 

Q.  Can you in any way compare the two players you've just played?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Sorry? 
 

Q.  Can you compare the two players you've just played in the last two rounds?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  You mean Murray and Gasquet? 
 

Q.  Murray and Gasquet, yes.
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Two different players, two different (scores?), two different country, two different match.  So not much to say. 
 

Q.  Two different futures?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Depends.  Depends.  You never know.  You never know. 
 

Q.  How are you playing now compared to when you reached the final?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Sorry? 
 

Q.  How are you playing this year compared to your matches before you reached the final?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I feel more confidence now, but you never know.  2002 was my first time that I play on grass.  So right now I have a -- this is my third Wimbledon, so I know more or less what's gonna happen on court. 
 

Q.  Are you looking forward now to playing an old man, 30-year-old Johansson?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah.  I never met him before, so is gonna be the first meeting. 
 

Q.  I don't know if you were asked this earlier.  Two Argentines in the Round of 16 for the first time in the Open era, a couple of Spaniards, Fernando Gonzalez.  It looks like some of the countries that have been producing traditional clay courters are having success on grass.  You've obviously had it before.  What do you think is the reason that we're seeing some of the clay courters doing better?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  They start believe that they can play good on grass, so that's why they are playing good now. 
 

Q.  Is it experience also?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, experience and, that I said, they start believe that they can play good also here. 
 

Q.  Is it because the courts are slower maybe than they used to be, do you think?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think is a little bit slowly, but not much difference.  Everybody is returning better than five years ago, so everybody has the same chance to win a match. 
 

Q.  Could I ask you, the people you admired when you were a younger age, when you were growing up first playing tennis, who were your favorite players, the people that you admired most?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  What?  I didn't understand. 
 

Q.  Was it Sampras or Agassi that...
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Oh, Becker. 
 

Q.  Becker?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah. 
 

Q.  And footballers, Maradona?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  But you mean for tennis? 
 

Q.  No, just in general.
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, of course Maradona was one of them. 
 

Q.  I just want to ask you a question about aces.  A lot of the players that are leading in aces have lost.  You're not among them, but do you think this is a statistic that is overrated, more important than really it is?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  You mean just aces? 
 

Q.  Yeah, just aces.
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I don't think it's the important thing.  You can win without aces if you have a well return and a good game. So statistics are okay, but is not a big point. 
 

Q.  Which serving statistics do you think are important?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Serving? 
 

Q.  In serving.  First serve percentage?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, percentage, it's the most. 
 

Q.  Service games held?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, no, percentage of first serves is one of the biggest point. 
 

Q.  How does it feel to be the most unpopular man at Wimbledon, having knocked out Andy Murray on Saturday?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  (Smiling).  Well, I just answered that question on Saturday, but was great.  Was great. 
 

Q.  Have any of the fans said anything to you, any of the fans as you've seen them around the grounds?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Not really, but Saturday on the street, yeah, somebody stopped me and tell me, "What a match." 
 

Q.  Will he have learnt a lot from that when he reflects upon that, his defeat to you?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Not really, no. 
 

Q.  I would have thought it would be a good learning experience for him, that?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know if he play before here, but I think he -- was his first time.  He do a good job on Centre Court.  Is not easy first time get on Centre Court and play good, and he make it.  So he do a very good step. 
 

Q.  What did you make of all the occasion on Saturday with the crowd following Murray and getting right behind him, as an Argentinian over here and you see how the fans react to a British tennis player?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I know that is gonna be like that, but was on Saturday.  Two days more now.  It's Monday, so another match going now. 
 

Q.  People say that you are playing a mind game.  Is that more important for you than other components of tennis?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  You can win a lot of matches just with the mind and not with the good tennis.  So mind, it's very important. 
 

Q.  And you do it very often during the match; you change, you learn from the situation.  Is it easy for you?  Is it normal for you to learn during the match?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  When you feel confidence and when you have very clear what you have to do, it's easy to see what's going on in the match or what's his big shots are or not. So when you feel confidence to do any shots, it's -- everything makes it easy. 
 

Q.  Today you felt from the very beginning that you are in control?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yep. 
 

Q.  Do you use gut or synthetic string in your racquet?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Use Luxilon. 
 

Q.  Why?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I like it. 
 

Q.  Because of the spin it generates or...
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I like it.  I play many years with that, so... 
 

Q.  You prefer it to gut?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah.  I prefer play with this and not with another ones.
