THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.  
 
 
Q.  That last shot must have felt pretty good. 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think every one was very important.  Was a very, very tough match, but I'm so happy to be in the final tomorrow. 
 
Q.  Did you ever see Mancini play? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I remember I was very, very young.  He was playing in Davis Cup, and I saw it by TV.  But I don't remember exactly how he play.  
 
Q.  What makes Costa so tough to play against?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think he have a very good serve.  And today also was windy, so was a little difficult to return.  But I think in the first set I try to do my best to return his serve, but I couldn't make any chance or something.  In the end of the tiebreak, I feel better and I try to go very far away from the baseline to return the serve.  That's make me a little bit of confidence.  And come back in the second set, I think I play really good - also in the third set.  But I think I have 15 breakpoints, and I couldn't make any ones before the 4-all.  So was very tough, but I think I played a very good game in the 4-all.  And then I served 5-4, played also good.  
 
Q.  David, you've now reached the final of Wimbledon, reached the semifinals of the US Open, now the final here; all different surfaces.  What is your best surface? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I like hard courts and indoors or grass, on fast. 
 
Q.  Even though you grew up on clay?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, yeah.  I think I played very good also, but I don't like (it) like grass or hard courts or indoors.  
 
Q.  Which of the two other players would you prefer to play - Mariano or Carlos - in the final?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think both are great players, and both are very good clay court players.  So it's gonna be very tough.  Any one who's gonna win today, it's because they play very good, and it's gonna be a tough match tomorrow.  
 
Q.  Those long games, he served.  He served a 15-minute game, he served a couple of 9-minute games.  Is it hard to keep your concentration during that?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  For me or for him?  
 
Q.  For you. 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, very difficult.  I have a lot of chances to break it.  Was very, very tough for try to keep focus on my return, on my game.  But I think I make it in the 4-all, so that's very important.
