  7-6, 6-1, 7-5

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. First of all, what are your thoughts on how Rafa is playing right now? How would you describe the match today?
 DAVID NALBANDIAN: I think I play a good first set. I had my chances. I couldn't take it. Rafa was -- I think he played good. He didn't do a lot of mistakes, which is normal in his game.
 I think he played very good, as well.

 Q. What are your thoughts about his level in general right now? Obviously he's lost the No. 1 ranking to Djokovic. How do you see things shaping up here for the second week at the Open?
 DAVID NALBANDIAN: Well, he's a great fighter, so he's gonna fight every day. 
 I believe that Rafa can improve a little bit more, and even during this week. Today was a little windy, a little tough to play sometimes.
 But I think he can play better.

 Q. About Rafa, forgive me if you addressed this: What do you think of his serve today? How effective was that? It seemed a little more conservative sometimes. 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN: Yeah, I think he tried to play with first serve today, maybe some tactical things.

 Q. Going for the percentage?
 DAVID NALBANDIAN: Yeah, I think so. Well, I don't know. You have to ask him.
