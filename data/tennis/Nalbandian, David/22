 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. How do you feel your level overall was in this match? We had the feeling it was a very high-level match.   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN: Yeah, I think was very tough from the beginning until the end. I think we play both a great level. I get a little tired in the second set and third set.   
 But he looks like play very good.   
  
  Q. What was the difference after the first set? Do you think he was attacking your second serves more, putting more pressure?  
 DAVID NALBANDIAN: His second serve?   
  
  Q. In the second and third set.   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN: Yeah, he try, but wasn't easy. I mean, he play good. He did all the shots good - even the serve, second serve bounce was high, so was tough to return.   
 But I think the match was tight for both, even the second and third. 6-2 was tougher than that on the score.   
 I feel that I play good. So I'm a little happy.   
  
  Q. Was there anything different about Roger? Look like the same guy to you?  
 DAVID NALBANDIAN: Well, today he played really a high level. I think one of the best matches on clay court for him.   
  
  Q. Do you think the main difference was on the physical side today?   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN: Well, maybe, yeah. I get a little tired in the second and the third. Was heat today, the first heat of the week, and I feel it.   
 He played great. I mean, he never falls down a little bit. Even the second set when I break back, maybe I thought maybe I can win the match at that moment. And he never give up. So he play great.
