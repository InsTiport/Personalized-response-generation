 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. You had a great fall last year. Some players, I'm wondering if you think they play better in the beginning of the year or end of the year?  
 DAVID NALBANDIAN: Who?   
  
  Q. Just players in general. Are they better at spacing out how they play over the entire year or do you think...   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN: No, it just depends. You never know. Sometimes you think you're great in the beginning, and you didn't get the best results in the year. They come in later.   
 Depends the surface, depends whether you like to play more. You never know.  
  
  Q. Some players, they win more titles in the first half and some in the second half. Do you think of certain players as being good starters and others as good finishers?  
 DAVID NALBANDIAN: No. Depends.   
  
  Q. You didn't feel that way last fall?  
 DAVID NALBANDIAN: No.
