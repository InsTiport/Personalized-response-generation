Q.  Weren't you too hard on him, 6-1, 6-1? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  You never think about this, and not against who you play.  You always play your best tennis - or you try to play it. 

Q.  After Wimbledon, you had a bad time.  Today's win is a good boost of confidence for you? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, I had a few bad weeks, but this happens in tennis.  Everybody faces that at some point.  But today I felt good.  I played my game.  I'm prepared for the next matches. 

Q.  What about your next match? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  With Canas, anything can happen.  I've never practiced with him.  I haven't seen him since I arrived.  I saw that he had some problems with his wrist, but he's a very good player. 

Q.  What do you think about the tournament? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  It's very good.  With the little time they had for preparation, it's amazing what they've done.  I hope they will have it here in the future, the next few years.  The surface is quite fast. 

Q.  A Wimbledon finalist shouldn't complain about the quickness of the court. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, you just asked me if it was quick.  Yes, it's quick (laughter).
