  Q.  A difficult situation.  Clearly you weren't feeling yourself out there.   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, the beginning was okay.  I had a headache, maybe a little bit of fever.  So didn't feel really good to try to push myself to play good.  Well, not much to do.   
  
  Q.  At what point was it clear to you you really weren't feeling well?  As early as the warm-up or at some point during the match?   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  From last night, maybe I start feeling -- I was sweating.  I had a headache last night as well.  Wake up, had the same thing.  When I was warming up, as well.   
 But I say I want to try, nothing to lose.  I'm not going to feel worse than this.  I tried, but nothing changed.   
  
  Q.  And the way Sanguinetti played, that didn't help you, moving you to all spots on the court today?   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, he played good.  Maybe if he give me a little bit of chance, I will take it.  But I really couldn't fight for all the time he play good.  I mean, I'm not going to be in the situation or the level to try to push.  So he didn't give me any chance.   
  
  Q.  We wish you a speedy recovery.   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Thank you.
