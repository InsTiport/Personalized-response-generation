Q.  What happened to you in this match? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I couldn't find my game.  I'm not happy with the way I played.  But also his game made me make a lot of errors. 

Q.  Santoro is an especially different player because he plays differently than everybody else. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, that's true.  You are not used to these shots.  He makes it difficult.  His strategy is very complicated. 

Q.  He was 6-Love, 3-Love up. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, I thought at any moment I could change the way of the match.  But I started really poorly.  He never made any mistakes.  I didn't find my way with him. 

Q.  Shouldn't you have used more power?  You didn't use power; you allowed him to play his complicated game. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  That was easy from the outside. 

Q.  Have you played him before?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, it was the first time.  He's a very strange player.  This was the first time against him.  It's doubly hard like that. 

Q.  What you did learn in this match?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  It's not that I played badly; it's his way of playing is so strange, he makes you play badly.  He's very quick.  He comes up to the net.

Q.  If you would have to play him again, what would you change this time? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Maybe I would attack more with the forehand. 

Q.  And he didn't make any mistakes, did he?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  It's true, he didn't make any unforced errors. 

Q.  After this week, you're quite happy with how you played. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  There are two more tournaments to go.  I will think ahead.  I'll try to improve my game.  I will play Basel and Paris. 

Q.  What will you do next year?  It will be difficult for you.  You have Wimbledon in the middle of the year. 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  First, I'm ending this year.  I will do the pre-season.  I will play in Australia. 

Q.  In your pre-season, will you think of changing your game, your strategy?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, I'll try to improve every aspect.  I want to improve my serve.  That's quite important.  Every aspect. 

Q.  Do you feel that you needed to improve the serve on this kind of surface?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, on any kind of surface.  Today I didn't serve very well, and he took advantage of my second serve, then came to the net.  I haven't served very well, not as well as I have up till now.  When you feel that you can't get your first serve in, your opponent gets more powerful.
