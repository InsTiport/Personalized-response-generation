  Q.  David, I guess that was a pretty tough match for you out there today.  Can you just run through your thoughts on that match.   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, it was pretty tough.  I mean, he played very solid, very good.  Uhm, I couldn't play deep as I wish during all the match, and he played really good.   
 He hit very good shots.  I always was playing on defense.  He play very good.   
  
  Q.  I mean, how disappointed are you not to be able to defend your title?   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, I was in a very tough group, so I play very -- three tough matches, and today was the fourth.  Sometime you win, sometime you lose.  I mean, it's simple here.   
 He played better than me today, so that's why he beat me.  But of course I would wish to play the finals tomorrow, but unfortunately it's not like this.   
  
  Q.  What are you looking for in your Davis Cup match?  Are you looking forward to it?   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, of course.  I mean, I'm going to practice in Europe next week with the team, and we'll be ready.   
  
  Q.  Just on that, David, you've played a lot of tennis.  Do you still feel fresh and ready to go for that Davis Cup final?  Obviously, you're motivated.  But fitness-wise, are you feeling up to it?   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, feeling good.  I mean, we have almost two weeks from now, so enough time to practice, enough time to prepare.  Like I said before, we would met the team in Europe on Thursday -- no, Wednesday.  We should be ready.   
  
  Q.  Is there anything differently that you would have done at the match today?   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, try to win.   
  
  Q.  But strategy-wise?   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Try to play deep, but I didn't make it.  I tried, but I hit very long sometimes, sometimes very short.  He take the chances.   
  
  Q.  What do you think about the surface after the several matches you played?  Different from last year?   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, yeah, much difference.  Bounce is higher and slower.   
  
  Q.  What do you prefer?   
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I prefer the other one.
