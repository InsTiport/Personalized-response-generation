THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.  
 
 
Q.  After winning the second set, can you explain why things just went so badly in the third and fourth set? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think I was a little tired from the match from the other day.  I don't know, I think I started playing really bad in the two sets.  Rainer didn't play good in the last game so, from the second set.  So I was thinking I have to take the chances in the beginning from the third set, but I didn't play really good there.  And, well, he played really good after that.  
 
Q.  Did you feel tired? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yes.  I just say I feel tired.  
 
Q.  How quick is he compared with other players about the court? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Feel the court is quickly?  
 
Q.  How quick is he compared with other players, Schuettler? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, of course.  I think is very fast.  Very, very fast.  
 
Q.  Does he drive you crazy?  He drove Blake crazy.  He gets everything.  Is that the problem? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Maybe.  
 
Q.  Are you surprised that he is in the semifinals in a Grand Slam?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  He's a good player, so he reach  - I don't know if the (inaudible), the other guys, but he's (inaudible) in the world.  He's a good player. 
 
Q.  How would you sum up your ten days here?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I enjoy it.  Not today, but I enjoy the tennis.  
 
Q.  Do you feel like it was an opportunity missed today? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Always you have a chance.  I don't think this one is gonna be my last chance.  I think the match from today I didn't play really good, but this sport maybe next week I play against him and you have the other match other day.  So I think you always have another day, another match, and you can win.  
 
Q.  Do you think there's an explanation why so many people about 30, 30 years old, are at a high level in this tournament?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah.  
 
Q.  The explanation is why?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I don't know. 
 
Q.  No explanation?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  (Shrugging his shoulders). 
 
Q.  What are you going to do this year in terms of playing on grass before Wimbledon?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I'm not sure yet. 
 
Q.  Will you play a tournament on grass, or will you not, do you think?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I have to think about that.  
 
Q.  Do you think you prefer the grass courts or the Rebound Ace courts of Australia?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think I like both.  This court, it's very nice, is not too fast.  I think the grass, it's more faster.  But I like both.  
 
Q.  It's been a good last 12 months for you, hasn't it?  I mean, looking back to Wimbledon, what are your memories looking back?  You got to the quarterfinal here; you made the final there.  Has the year gone much better than you thought it would? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah, of course.  I'm 21 years old.  So you never think before I started playing tennis, "Well, I want to be Top 10 when I was 20, 21 years old."  So it's very, very important for me.  
 
Q.  You went back to your ciudad, your home, it's not little, but a small place.  I think you told us at the US Open that they had a statue of you there, or was it a plaque? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  A racquet. 
 
Q.  Pardon me?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  A racquet.  
 
Q.  In marble or steel? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, I don't know.  
 
Q.  But it's there?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I don't make it, the racquet. 
 
Q.  It's there forever?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah.
