THE MODERATOR:  English questions first.  First question, please. 


Q.  Who were your heroes growing up?  What did you try and learn from them, and what can youngsters learn from your game? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, I don't think I am play really good today, but little difficult.  It's windy out there.  I just try to win the first match, so that's very important.  Win in three sets is not bad. 

Q.  But when you were a youngster, which players did you used to look up to?  Who were your heroes, your idols? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, Boris Becker when I started playing tennis.

Q.  Did you try and imitate his game in any way?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I don't play like him, any shots look like him.

Q.  What can youngsters learn from watching you? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I don't know.  When I was very young, I saw Becker playing.  But when I start playing tennis, I just try to be myself.  And then, well, I try to do my game. 

Q.  How is the wrist? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Is good.  Is perfect.

Q.  After you pulled out of Adelaide, did you go back overseas to get treatment?  You were reported to go to Spain?

Q.  How much treatment did you have in Europe for this?

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  What I do? 

Q.  How much time did you have? 

DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, all December.  Well, not in Europe, but Argentina, with exercise and everything.  So before Houston, I started with everything.  All December.

Q.  It's not a problem now?
