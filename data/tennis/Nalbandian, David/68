THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 
 
Q.  Did you expect such a game against Sanguinetti, such a tough game? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I know that he's a very good player, but he surprise me a little bit.  Physically, I think that maybe in the end of the first set maybe he feel a little bit tired.  But he continue fighting all the time.  Yeah, I think he impress me little bit, yeah. 
 
Q.  Roger Federer said after the match today when he was on court in the interview that if he had a preference to play either you or Davide, that he would prefer to play you because he struggled against you in the past, he said, "I'd like a crack at David."  Your thoughts on that?  Rather bold statement to make?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  We have a lot of history, many matches.  We play from Juniors, I don't know, six, seven, eight times.  It's going to be a tough match.  I think we both like to play each other, so it's going to be interesting match.  
 
Q.  The last two times you played he did beat you, but you have beat him five times in the past.  Do you take confidence from that, or do you think Roger has gone way beyond that level that he played when you were younger? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think that every single match is different.  No one is similar to another one.  So both, we gonna try to do the best.  For sure it's gonna be a very good match.  Who play best that day is gonna win for sure.  
 
Q.  Are you playing your best game right now? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I feel that I play much better today than the other days.  So that's good.  
 
Q.  Overall, are you satisfied with your season overall, what you have done so far? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, in the Grand Slams I always play good.  I didn't like to play many tournaments.  But, yeah, I gonna answer that question after this tournament (smiling).
