  6-4, 6-2, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. What was the injury?
 DAVID NALBANDIAN: No, the adds. (Adductors) I get surgery four month ago, and I feel a little bit on one part of the match. 
 Trainer help me with that, so I hope not a big deal.

 Q. Did it affect your performance at all? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN: Well, sometimes a little bit feels a little pain, but not much. Just a little bit. So didn't affect really, really much. I mean, he played much better than me today, so no excuse.

 Q. You obviously played Roger a lot over the years. Can you compare the way he's playing now to the way he was playing three or four years ago?
 DAVID NALBANDIAN: Well, three, four years ago I think he's playing the same level. He improve a lot from, I don't know, six, seven years ago.
 After that, he play incredible level all the time, every match, and especially here on grass. He's one of the most winner of the tournament, so he's a great player.

 Q. So do you think it's more that maybe Nadal and Djokovic have improved rather than him getting worse?
 DAVID NALBANDIAN: Well, Rafa improves a lot, and Novak as well. Novak has amazing year this time, so I think all of those guys improve a lot.
 If you didn't do that, it's impossible to be in the top. 

 Q. And just to come back to you, you've had a lot of injuries recently. How tough is it to keep coming back from that over and over again? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN: It is tough. The recovery is very tough, especially for your mind, at home doing just exercise, not training hard as we wish. 
 But it's very tough on the mind especially.
