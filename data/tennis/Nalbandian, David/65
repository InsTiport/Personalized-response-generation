THE MODERATOR:  Questions in Spanish.  
 
 
Q.  It looks as if your level is as high as last year's in Madrid. 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, it is difficult to compare how you are with respect to last year.  I do feel comfortable.  I think if I keep playing this way, I'll be in the final rounds.  
 
Q.  I'd like to know what your opinion is about the court and the altitude. 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Altitude is similar to a few other tournaments, cities that are geographically similar.  I think the court, however, is not perfect.  It could be improved.  But, well, it's quite good.  
 
Q.  What are those things that could be improved? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  It's not real firm, so the ball bounces with a slightly different speed in some places.  But it's also normal on indoor courts to find these things.  
 
Q.  You haven't given your opponent any chances to break your serve. 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, it hasn't been a match where I served best, but I served well on the important points.  The dome on the ceiling lets a lot of light in.  That was not comfortable when you tried to serve, when you tossed the ball up to serve.  
 
Q.  Are you looking forward to playing Hrbaty? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, Karlovic is also a very dangerous player.  Any of them can win.  They will be very different matches.  One is a great server.  That will be difficult to break his serve.  Hrbaty is a player that plays from behind the baseline.  That could be a very tough match.  I already played against him two, three weeks ago in Davis Cup, and that was tough.
