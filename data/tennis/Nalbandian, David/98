THE MODERATOR:  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, David Nalbandian.  
 
 
Q.  That was a tough old match.  How much has it taken out of you, do you think? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think was very tough (smiling).  Very, very tough.  Was many chances to me in the second and third set, but he play really, really, really good in that moment.  I think was an amazing match, many good points and, well, I have the lucky to come back in the fifth and play well.  
 
Q.  Is it kind of beginning to remind you a little bit of last year?  Are you getting the same kind of feelings you were having last year?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Last year third round I won in three sets.  I cannot remember. 
 
Q.  Matches like Lapentti, for instance, like last year. 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah. 
 
Q.  You're coming through tough matches. 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yeah.  I think this match is almost the same like Lapentti, like you say.  But everyone is different.  I think Karol today played very good.  It was very tough for me to beat him.  I had to do all my powers, all my best shots, everything to beat him.  
 
Q.  People were saying from the start of the week this is a very open tournament, there could easily be another Nalbandian this year.  Did you find yourself saying, "It could be the same Nalbandian this year"? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Why not?  
 
Q.  Did you feel from the start you could repeat the same as last year?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think so.  
 
Q.  How much has your life changed in the last 12 months?  A year ago...
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Always you ask me the same, huh?  Every press conference I answer the same.  They change it too much.  Was really unbelievable back home last year.  Was perfect. 
 
Q.  A new question.  What is it going to be like to play Henman on Centre Court, do you think? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I have to think on Monday, not right now.  Is gonna be tough, of course.  
 
Q.  The atmosphere is bound to be most people on his side.  You've had Davis Cup experiences.  Is it going to be a bit like a Davis Cup match, do you think? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Maybe.  But I don't think about that.  Is normal if the people is with him, so I don't care about that.  I think I have to do my job and that's it.  
 
Q.  You've beaten him twice before, but that wasn't on grass.  Do you think there will be differences this time?  If so, what kind of differences?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Is gonna be different for sure because is another surface. But I think is gonna be very close match, very, very tough.  Of course he don't want to lose.  Of course I don't want to lose.  So is gonna be difficult. 
 
Q.  Do you think it will have any effect that he's had a relatively untiring week, straight sets and four sets, and you've had it quite tough today, you've had more work to do. 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I feel great.  So I have one day off tomorrow, that's perfect.  
 
Q.  There was a point today when you were getting increasingly fed up with line calls going against you.  With the crowd and everything, did you feel there was a very strong feeling of support?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Because was so long, I was right.  It was so long.  I think the people know that and try to help me, but they cannot do too much. 
 
Q.  But those people probably won't be trying to help you on Monday, of course. 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Is normal.  I don't care.  
 
Q.  Has what you achieved last year changed your view of yourself as a player who is able to do really well?  I mean, no one expected last year.  You probably expected it, but no one else did.  Has that altered your opinion of how good you are and can be as a player? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  On grass or...?  
 
Q.  Anywhere, anywhere. 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Of course after that, everybody start to label I can do many important things.  But you never know what is gonna happen in the future.  So I think I'm playing good, I like to play on grass.  I like to play in fast courts.  So I think if I keep my mind on the tennis, I can do good things. 
 
Q.  Do you think that you did yourself justice in the final last year?  Do you understand?  Do you think you played as well as you could have played in the final?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, of course not.  
 
Q.  No? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Was very difficult to me, just playing the final, Centre Court, No. 1 in the world, he played really, really good.  It was difficult.  
 
Q.  But you'd feel better equipped this time if you got there again?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I hope so (smiling). 
 
Q.  You are on centre. 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think we play on Court 2?  
 
Q.  No. 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, sure?  (Smiling). 
 
Q.  Do you like Centre Court? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Yes, why not?  
 
Q.  Some people would rather play a Brit anywhere but Centre Court.
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, but I like.  I play good in grass, I like to play in the centre.  
 
Q.  What is the TV coverage back in Argentina for this match?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I don't know.  I don't see the match by TV, so I cannot tell you nothing.  
 
Q.  Have you got a big following in Argentina among sports fans?
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I don't know. 
 
Q.  You must know. 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, really.  I think so, but I don't know how many people is watching the TV.  I don't know.  Really I don't know.  You have to ask to the press Argentina, so... 
 
Q.  I presume you're a football fan, because everybody in Argentina is.  England and Argentina have a great tradition in football.  Do you think it will be similar in tennis on Monday? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, not here.  Maybe Davis Cup, but not here.  
 
Q.  Who has impressed you most, from the other matches you've seen?  Who has impressed you this week, watching? 
 
DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, I don't see too much.  No, no, no, I cannot tell you too much about that.
