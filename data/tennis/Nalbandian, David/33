 Q.  Could you give an assessment to your last three matches against Marat Safin:  New York, Paris and today? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, always we play a very tough match.  Today I didn't expect that I win that easy, but it's much better for me. 
 The other three matches are in the past. 

 Q.  Marat said this surface suits you just fine; you play well on this kind of surface.  What do you think? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Why they put this and they don't choose another one? 

 Q.  Maradona said that you played today the way Marat played when he was the world No. 1.  Do you agree? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think I played very good today.  Yeah, could be. 

 Q.  You'll be playing doubles on Saturday, then eventually playing a second singles.  Won't you be tired?  Maybe it makes sense to skip the doubles and not play the doubles. 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  No, no.  I will play tomorrow.  I will be ready for Saturday and Sunday.  This is just the beginning. 

 Q.  You said you played really well today.  I would like to know, what was the key to the match?  Marat said it was the surface that didn't suit him.  Was it the surface mostly or was it your good game that decided the match? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I think I play very good.  Maybe the surface helped just a little bit, not too much.  But I played very solid.  I think that was the key. 

 Q.  Last two hours before the match are very important for the preparation.  I didn't see you at the bench during the first match.  How did you spend the hours before your match?  How important is it for you to be prepared? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, in the beginning of the match, I was warming up.  I see all the way till the end from the locker rooms, doing my stuff, preparation for the match. 

 Q.  Marat Safin said you got lucky on the big points, at the key moments of the match.  Could you comment on this? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Lucky or not, I win in three sets. 

 Q.  This is your third time in Moscow.  How different is the atmosphere, the moral climate, around the tie now versus four years ago? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Now we have a lot of crowd, a lot of people cheering for us.  We feel it.  It's great.
