 Q.  What would you say about the match? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  Well, I win and I lose a point.  He didn't do much.  It was so windy it was difficult. 
 When I was solid and I played a good point I'd win it, and when I miss it, I miss it.  So he didn't do much. 

 Q.  Is it difficult to play against Nieminen because he's changing the tempo all the time?  He's hitting really slow and then suddenly he hits much harder?  Is it difficult to get into the game against him? 
 DAVID NALBANDIAN:  I've beat him many, many times, so I don't.  It's no problem at all.
