Q.  Nicolas, what was it like being out there with him today? 
 
NICOLAS ESCUDE:  I think today Andre can telling me more than "Thank you."  With all the opportunity I get during this match, and I miss all the opportunities.  So that's why I lose.  
 
Q.  Is he a guy who can win this tournament? 
 
NICOLAS ESCUDE:  For sure.  All the time when Andre play a tournament, he can win it.  But in Grand Slam, you never know.  So we're gonna see for the next round.  
 
Q.  What was the most difficult thing? 
 
NICOLAS ESCUDE:  For him?  
 
Q.  For you, against him. 
 
NICOLAS ESCUDE:  For me against him?  To get more concentrate, more regulate, and that's  -- I didn't do it today.
