 USTA: Questions for Nicolas in English? 
 
Q. Can Nicolas tell us how he feels to have made it this far in this tournament?
 
 NICOLAS ESCUDE: Right now, very tired. 
 
Q. What?
 
 NICOLAS ESCUDE: Right now, very tired. Yeah, I feel my legs are very stiff, but I'm
very happy to be in the Quarterfinals in the US Open. I was in the Quarterfinals one week
before. Right now I'm qualifying, in two days against Agassi, and I'm really happy. 
 
Q. Playing Agassi makes you happy?
 
 NICOLAS ESCUDE: Yeah. I have a play against him in Key Biscayne last year, and I lose.
This time, I hope I'm going to win. 
 
Q. What will you do differently?
 
 NICOLAS ESCUDE: The last time I play against him I was very impress, impressive to play
against him on center court. I found the play very fast, very quick. It was very in the
courts, and it was very difficult for me to play my game, but it's another match in two
days.
