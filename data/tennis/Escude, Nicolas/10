Q.  Did that surprise you, your win today? 

NICOLAS ESCUDE:  Yes, a little bit.  But it was a tough match, very tough match.  I was leading 3-love, break in the first set.  I was thinking it was a bad start.  And after, he play better, and I serve .  I was little nervous on my second serve, and he won the first set.  But I'm very happy to won this match, particularly against Lleyton, because he's very strong. 

Q.  What about chances against Andre now, who seems to be in fine form?

NICOLAS ESCUDE:  He beat me every time, all the time.  He beat me in Basel, US Open in quarterfinal.  And I never play against him on the grass.  It's gonna be a good match, I think.  I play well.  He play well.  I'm gonna do my best, try to do my best. 

Q.  Will your best be enough? 

NICOLAS ESCUDE:  I think so.  On grass. 

Q.  Was that one of your best performances of your career, do you think?

NICOLAS ESCUDE:  Yeah.  Here? 

Q.  Yes.  Against Hewitt. 

NICOLAS ESCUDE:  He beat me two times, and  -- but I think is not his best surface.  And for me, I play very well on grass.  So I more chance to beat him on grass.
