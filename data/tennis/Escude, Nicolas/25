Q. Did you notice Carlos being very injured during the match?

NICOLAS ESCUDE: I don't know. I don't know exactly. I don't know how feel like Carlos
during the match. About me, I'm just happy to win this match. I see him play most win like
this. I don't know if he have no injury, if he play better. I don't know.

Q. Did he say anything to you after he retired?

NICOLAS ESCUDE: Yes. He tell me low back injury and good luck.

Q. Is this tournament jinxed a little bit? It seems a lot of big names are getting
hurt.

NICOLAS ESCUDE: Me, it was a long time that I didn't win a match like this against a
top player in a big tournament, and I'm feeling very, very good right now. I mean, to beat
Carlos here, okay, he had an injury. I saw during the match he want to be the -- to win
the point early and it's not his game. And I said, okay, keep the ball in the court, go to
the net when you can go to the net.
