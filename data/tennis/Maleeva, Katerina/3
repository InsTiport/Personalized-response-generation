Q. Can you tell us about the emotion the out there both before the match and after? 
 
 KATERINA MALEEVA: Well, obviously it was very difficult for both of us to play against each other and I guess it is difficult for the people to understand that because they think that their money involved and they just cannot understand what we mean to each other and, I guess it is over, so.  
 
Q. Maggie, have you ever? 
 
 MAGDALENA MALEEVA: I am just glad it is over. I cannot say that if I had won I would have felt happier. Maybe I wish I had won and played the quarterfinals on center court. But I equally happy that my sister is going to be there. I wish I could play better, but I couldn't, and I am just glad it is over.  
 
Q. Why do you think you couldn't play better? 
 
 MAGDALENA MALEEVA: Because it was not my day.  
 
Q. Katerina, is there any joy in a victory today? 
 
 MAGDALENA MALEEVA: Definitely.  
 KATERINA MALEEVA: No, this victory doesn't mean anything to me. It just -- I know now that I am in the quarters and she is not. That is the only difference. I wish we could both be in the quarters, but...  
 MAGDALENA MALEEVA: But at the same time, we could have both lost earlier, so it is very good that one of us is in the quarters.  
 
Q. Maggie, have you ever beaten either Katerina or Manuela? 
 
 KATERINA MALEEVA: Not yet.  
 MAGDALENA MALEEVA: But I am better than them in the ranking, so --  
 
Q. But you have never beaten them in a tournament? 
 
 MAGDALENA MALEEVA: Always we practice, though.  
 
Q. Do you think that you get a mental block when you go out there and they are your big sisters? 
 
 MAGDALENA MALEEVA: No. It is not that they are my big sisters. It is just that they are my sisters.  
 
Q. Katerina have you beaten Manuela? 
 
 KATERINA MALEEVA: Yes.  
 
Q. You two go out there; you don't play in many tournaments with 32-- draws of 32 because there is too great a chance to meet isn't there, I mean- - 
 
 KATERINA MALEEVA: We played quite -- I would say quite a few tournaments together and I would blame it on myself now that we met because my ranking dropped and I wasn't seeded here. I mean, if I am seeded, yeah, we could still meet, but we could meet the earliest maybe quarters.  
 
Q. You said "blame." I mean blame each other for playing as well as you can and meeting each other? I mean, it is hard to think of that as blame. It is something that you really don't like doing that much that take "blame" from you-- 
 
 KATERINA MALEEVA: Yeah. I don't like it and it just that-- it hasn't happened in a long time and it happened the last two tournaments we play; in Canada I played Manuela and now I played Maggie and --  
 MAGDALENA MALEEVA: But that is the price we pay for being so good and competing at such a high level. I mean, if you have three sisters in the top 15 or in the top 20, it is always going to happen. So that is the price we have to pay.  
 
Q. Manuela, mom wasn't there today; was she? 
 
 KATERINA MALEEVA: I don't know. I didn't see her.  
 MAGDALENA MALEEVA: I don't think. She said she wasn't going to come.  
 
Q. She doesn't like to watch when you two play? 
 
 MAGDALENA MALEEVA: I don't think so. She didn't care who is going to win, so why should she watch.  
 
Q. Where was Manuela; do you know? 
 
 MAGDALENA MALEEVA: She was having a massage.  
 
Q. Do you think mom knows the result yet? 
 
 MAGDALENA MALEEVA: Yes.  
 
Q. She is on site; isn't she? 
 
 KATERINA MALEEVA: Yeah, she is.  
 
Q. Out at court 16 like she was last year? 
 
 KATERINA MALEEVA: I don't know.  
 
Q. How much time do you spend together at tournaments? 
 
 KATERINA MALEEVA: I would say a lot of time.  
 MAGDALENA MALEEVA: We don't sleep together but always -- we are always together.  
 
Q. Have you done a lot of stuff in New York, I mean -- 
 
 KATERINA MALEEVA: We have been quite busy. Not yet.  
 
Q. When you find out you are going to play, do you act differently around each other? 
 
 MAGDALENA MALEEVA: We just stop talking to each other. It is the same. It doesn't matter. We just try to be enemies on the court, but otherwise everything is normal.  
 
Q. You say "try." Is it hard to be an enemy on the court? 
 
 MAGDALENA MALEEVA: Very hard.  
 
Q. Katerina, do you do the same thing; do you try to be your sister's enemy on the court? 
 
 KATERINA MALEEVA: I don't try anything. I mean, I just go out there and play and I don't think too much. It is something that maybe very few people can understand.  
 MAGDALENA MALEEVA: There is no sibling rivalry between us. You have to understand that.  
 
Q. Are you kind of sick of talking about this? 
 
 MAGDALENA MALEEVA: Yes.  
 KATERINA MALEEVA: Yes.  
 
Q. Have either of you given any thought that the fact that this is Manuela's last U.S. Open and kind of last year on the tour? 
 
 KATERINA MALEEVA: She keeps saying this and I have can't imagine her not playing and staying home. I guess we will have to deal with it when it happens, but now I don't -- until it happens I don't think it will hit us.  
 MAGDALENA MALEEVA: I am sure she will come and watch me though. I need her badly.  
 
Q. Martina said she had a nightmare one day that she was beaten by the fourth Maleeva sister; any -- no other sisters, right? 
 
 MAGDALENA MALEEVA: No.  
 KATERINA MALEEVA: No.  
 
Q. Yeah, her name is Sukova.
