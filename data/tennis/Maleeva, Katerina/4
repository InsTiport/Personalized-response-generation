 Q. Did you expect such a tough match today, or how much did you know about Rubin before? 
KATERINA MALEEVA: Yes, I was expecting a tough match. I knew that she can play well when she didn't have anything to lose. And I knew how she was playing. 
Q. Did anything surprise you that you didn't expect; that you didn't know that she could do? 
KATERINA MALEEVA: No. 
Q. Did you know that your sister had won or was going to win? 
KATERINA MALEEVA: Yes, I knew. 
Q. I know you don't like to play against your sister. That didn't have any affect on the match; did it? 
KATERINA MALEEVA: No. Not at all. I wanted to win as much as any other time, and it didn't matter that I was going to play against her. Now, I guess, we won't have to play, so that is something good about my loss. But I guess if we have played, then it was sure that one of us was going to be in the quarters, and it is tough. But it didn't affect my game at all. 
Q. In the third game, your first serve seemed to just disappear; your service in the third game. 
KATERINA MALEEVA: Which third game? 
Q. The third -- yes, the third set. Your first serve, you didn't make any first serves in the third game. I just wondered if that probably had thrown your game off. Apparently it didn't, because you don't remember it. 
KATERINA MALEEVA: No. 
Q. Thank you.
