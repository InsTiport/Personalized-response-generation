THE MODERATOR:  First question, please.   
 
 
Q.  Is there anything that you think you would have done different, or she was just too good today? 
 
RITA GRANDE:  I think she was too good.  I try to play my best.  I try to mix my game and make her play bad, but she didn't play bad today.  She played good.  Was really tough, but I think I did everything.  
 
Q.  Coach, can you talk about the prospect of tomorrow.  You obviously have to win all three.  What do you tell your players?  How do you approach it? 
 
CAPTAIN CORRADO BARAZZUTTI:  We have to play the match first, so...  Well, the match is gonna be very tough for us.  We are 2-love for Americans, so anyway tomorrow we're gonna try to play and to win, and we'll see in the court what's happen.  Anyway so the American players play very, very well today.  They are in very good shape.  I think it will be very difficult for us.  But, anyway, we are here for to play till the end and to fight, and then we'll see in the court what's happen.  
 
Q.  Do you like the matchups tomorrow better than today?  Can you talk a little bit about how the singles players match up tomorrow compared to today.  Do you like it better? 
 
CAPTAIN CORRADO BARAZZUTTI:  Sorry?  
 
Q.  The matchup tomorrow. 
 
CAPTAIN CORRADO BARAZZUTTI:  Yeah? 
 
Q.  Do you like it better than today? 
 
CAPTAIN CORRADO BARAZZUTTI:  Yeah, yeah.  Sure.  
 
RITA GRANDE:  Yes.  
 
CAPTAIN CORRADO BARAZZUTTI:  I hope tomorrow is gonna be better, for sure.  We really need to win the first match of tomorrow because you understand that if you lost that match, we lost the match  - the tie.  So we have to do better, for sure.  We try.  
 
Q.  How do you like the surface?  Is the surface good for the games of your players? 
 
RITA GRANDE:  Yes.  The court is like some other tournaments, so I like it because I play in the States for so many times.  So it's not different to the US Open - you can go to the net, you can play from the baseline, you can do everything.  So it's good court; I like it.  
 
CAPTAIN CORRADO BARAZZUTTI:  I think anyway that kind of surface is very good surface for the American player.  
 
Q.  How is the traction?  Is it easy to move? 
 
CAPTAIN CORRADO BARAZZUTTI:  Yeah, it's okay.  It's okay.  But anyway I think Rubin play really, really well in this kind of surface, but I think they make for us the surface that they prefer.  It's right.  They do a good job (smiling).  
 
Q.  You mention the surface.  Are you saying the surface was at your disadvantage?  I mean, was it too fast?  Was it too slow for your players? 
 
CAPTAIN CORRADO BARAZZUTTI:  No, I think the surface is  -- it's okay, but maybe for us against this kind of player, maybe we need  -- we prefer another kind of surface.  But it was not too much at all, not too much fast.  But maybe against this kind of player, against Rubin, maybe for us it was much better to play in the clay court, for example.  
 
RITA GRANDE:  For sure (smiling).
