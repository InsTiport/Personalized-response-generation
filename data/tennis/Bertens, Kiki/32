V. KUZMOVA/K. Bertens
3-1, [Ret.]
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.
Q. Can you just talk about, I guess, why you had to retire today and how you were feeling yesterday and today?
KIKI BERTENS: Yeah, yesterday I felt good.  No problems at all.  I was practicing, resting, and I felt really well.  Ready for today.
And then this morning I woke up at 3:00, and then I felt really sick.  Vomiting, diarrhea all night long, all day long.  I felt a little bit better before the match.  I had some sleep, and I just wanted to give it a try, but then as soon as I start warming up right before the match, it started again.
Yeah, there was not any energy left.
Q. It must be a huge sense of responsibility if you feel that bad but you got yourself out on to the court anyway?
KIKI BERTENS: Yeah, I'm always trying.  You never know what happens on court.  I just wanted to give myself, give the chance to play and see what's happening.
But it was, no, it was better maybe not to step on the court today.
Q. Just in terms of, you know, how you're feeling right now, obviously to go out of a tournament with a loss is one thing.  To go out of a tournament like this, it can be rough, too.  Can you just, I don't know, just talk about the disappointment?
KIKI BERTENS: Yeah, of course.  It's really bad timing, I would call it maybe that.  It's been a great few weeks, and then if you feel like this during a Grand Slam where you felt good, it's just really annoying.  I just hope I feel better soon but probably that will be the case.
Q. What kind of conversations have you had with Raemon or anyone else about this decision before or after the match even?
KIKI BERTENS: Well, they cannot, like, decide for me what I want to do, so they can only see how I feel, but then it's still, like, their opinion.  But Raemon said to me, Okay, you just have to feel yourself, what do you want to do?  If you cannot make the decision, I will make it for you.
But I said, Okay, I just want to give it a try.  I was feeling a little bit better before the match, but then, yeah, what I said, as soon as I started running, then, yeah, everything got out again.
