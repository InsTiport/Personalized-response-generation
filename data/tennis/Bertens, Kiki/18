K. BERTENS/D. Yastremska   
6-4, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English first.   
 Q.  Wondering what happened at the end there, couldn't really hear from where we sat with what was being said between you guys.  
KIKI BERTENS: What do you mean? At the end of the match or what happened in the last game?   
 Q.  Yeah, what happened in the last game.  
KIKI BERTENS: The thing was like the kid in the corner dropped a ball, so I saw like her moving to get the ball during the point, so that was distracting me, so and then it's a replay of the point.   
 Q.  It hasn't been the easiest couple weeks for you, but how does it feel to be in the semi-finals of what might be your last tournament of the season?  
KIKI BERTENS: Well a little bit of a surprise, because I feel like my body's falling apart. But I think every match I'm just -- today I was just like, okay, maybe this is your last match of the season, so just give everything and that's what I did. So I'm just really proud and happy that I'm still in this tournament and that I can play the semi-finals on Saturday.   
 Q.  She can be such a big hitter. Was there anything you have to do to kind of mitigate that, because you hit very big as well, so what kind of adjustments do you make against a player who can go for that many winners and be so aggressive?  
KIKI BERTENS: Well, changing the rhythm, I think that's what she doesn't like. She really likes that every ball is coming at the same height, at the same pace. So just throwing in some slices, I think she's really struggling with that, I saw that already in Beijing and I think today again. So I think that's what I normally do already, but I think that against players like Dayana, even more, yeah.
