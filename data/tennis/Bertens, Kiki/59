E. SVITOLINA/K. Bertens
2-6, 6-4, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You had a really strong start to the match.  Curious what the key was and what made the difference in the end?
KIKI BERTENS: Yeah, I think it was really good match.  I think the first set I played really good, aggressive, and then I think I got broken.  A little bit unlucky in the end of second.  I think she also started to play better, more aggressive.
Then third set, yeah, my body felt a little bit tired, but I gave everything today.  She was just the better one in the end.
Q. It's been such a strong year for you.  Curious what it means to be in Zhuhai, to have been able to qualify for a year-end event, and what that does for your confidence and motivation heading into next season?
KIKI BERTENS: I think a lot.  I really see it is a bonus on a great year.  I think last year I ended the year outside top 100.  I was 104 starting the year and now I'm 22.  I am really happy with the year I had.  My second career title, my semifinal in Paris.
So I have some great memories about last year.  I'm really happy to have, yeah, this tournament as a bonus at the end of the season.
Q. Being that it's a round robin format, the fact you won a set gives you a perhaps a chance to go into the semifinal.  What will you take into your next match against Vesnina?
KIKI BERTENS: Well, it was also funny that I never played against Svitolina or Vesnina, so both first time.  It was really nice.  I think the only two players here that I never played, so that was really, really nice for me.
Yeah, I think in this format it's just like another match.  Maybe it's going to be my last match of the year, maybe not.  I am just going to put all my energy in there and give everything, and then we'll see what happens after the matches.
Q. You practice with Zhang Shuai way before the match.  Are you good friends?
KIKI BERTENS: Well, if she ask me to warm up again, of course.  I think it was fun.  The warmup was nice.  I watch her match and she played unbelievable match.
Yeah, I'm happy for her.
