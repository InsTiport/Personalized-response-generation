K. BERTENS/K. Siniakova
6-2, 6-2
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. You must be very happy, absolutely no drama today.
KIKI BERTENS:   Yeah, I think that was pretty important today, to not have a really long match.  Yeah, I think the conditions were good for me today.
Q. Were you at all worried if it did go long, today's match, if it had gone to three sets, were you at all worried about your physical condition?
KIKI BERTENS:   Yeah, I had no really idea how I was feeling.  I was still little bit stiff, of course, from two days ago.  But I was just focusing on every point, just being ready.
So I think that helped me today, yeah.
Q. Did you do anything specific in the recovery period after the match on Wednesday, anything specific you had to do to get ready for today?
KIKI BERTENS:   Well, I did a lot of recovery work, all the ice, ice baths, massages, stretching a lot.  Yesterday only I had a light hit, just about 20, 30 minutes.  I did some biking, and just resting.
Kept the body moving a little bit, but not too much.
Q. How did you enjoy the conditions under the roof?  How different is it?
KIKI BERTENS:   Yeah, I loved it.  If you compare it to the outside courts, it's so much different.  I had no idea because I didn't play on the court before.  But I really loved it.
Yeah, I think maybe I'm hoping for the first time I play on center court again my next match.
Q. You're going to hope it rains in Paris.
KIKI BERTENS:   Yes, yes, I do now.
Q. Is it a little bit quicker?  The clay is more stable, easier to slide?  What works well for you there?
KIKI BERTENS:   Well, on the outside courts I feel like it's really heavy to move.  Because of the conditions, because it's raining, the court is getting really wet, it doesn't dry any more, it feels really heavy to move on.
Here it didn't feel like because of course the roof was closed the whole day.  The clay was dry, it was not wet.  Also the balls don't get wet.  They're bouncing more.  It's easier to serve.
So, yeah, I think in general in every aspect of my game that's helping me a lot.
Q. Have you talked through your match for today yet in terms of how you played, all that?
KIKI BERTENS:   Well, I just spoke with Elise really quickly.  She was really happy with the performance, with the focus that I was there from each point.  It was a strange day today because when we woke up, we were like, Maybe you don't play today because it's raining the whole day.  Then they were playing.  The weather forecast, it changed a lot.
In the end I'm playing on center court in different conditions.  So, yeah, I think we just made the best of it quick.  Under an hour match, which I think helped me a lot with my previous one.  Yeah, we're just happy, going to recover again and prepare for the next one.
Q. It's your third round of 16 here in Paris.  What does it mean to you to kind of get into the second week again?
KIKI BERTENS:   It's always special I think when you reach the second week of a Grand Slam.  It didn't happen too much with me yet.  I'm just happy, happy to be here still.  I'm just hungry for more.  I'm just going to see what's going to happen.  I'm just going to prepare as good as I can, yeah, then we see again on Sunday.
