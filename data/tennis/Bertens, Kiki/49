M. VONDROUSOVA/K. Bertens   
7-6, 2-6, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  That was quite a back-and-forth battle.  How was it to play in?  
KIKI BERTENS: It was a tough one, yeah.  I think it was a good level.  I think in general the match was good.  Just a few up-and-downs from my side, and it was just not good enough today.   
 Q.  What was it that seemed to cause the momentum swings for you?  Was it the heat?  Frustration?  
KIKI BERTENS: No, the heat was fine.  I think we are a little bit used to that.  It was a little bit cooler than earlier in the week.   
It was tough for me to keep calm today, to keep my focus all the time, to just stay relaxed, to just play the points and not complain about anything.  Yeah, that was, I think, the key today.   
 Q.  Obviously Madison was a finalist here last year.  How far do you think she can go next year?  
KIKI BERTENS: I don't know what anything has to do with Madison and my match...   
 Q.  What made it difficult to stay focused out there today?  
KIKI BERTENS: I think I played a lot, so I feel a little bit tired.  Of course you just trying to keep on going, keep on doing your things, keep on focusing.   
But I think it was a little bit too much today.  I could not keep that calmness, could not just let it go.  It was just a little bit tired, just a little bit of everything.  I think just a little bit too much playing.   
 Q.  Was it just a little bit too crazy, too?  You have had great hard court results.  People thought you could make a deep run.  Was it too much too soon?  
KIKI BERTENS: I didn't really think about that.  I think it's more physically and mentally.  It's just been a few tough weeks, I would say.  I think enough is enough.  So right now, I did everything I could today.  I fought till the end.  It was not enough.   
She did it really great.  She played really two really great tiebreakers this match.   
 Q.  Playing on Louie Armstrong, some players say it plays a bit slow.  What did you find of the conditions?  
KIKI BERTENS: I didn't find really big difference from the other courts.  I loved the court.  It was a great atmosphere out there.  Great support for both of us.  No, I really liked playing out there.   
 Q.  What positives do you take away from this summer?  
KIKI BERTENS: I think only positive things.  Of course, this one really hurts and I will think about this one, still.  Winning my first hard court title, having my best career ranking right now, I'm leaving the States with a lot of confidence.  So I think it's only positives I can take from this one.   
Of course, also this match we learn a lot again from it, and in a few days we come back stronger.
