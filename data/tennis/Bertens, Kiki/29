K. BERTENS/M. Minella   
6-3, 6-2   
 Q.  Your match had been moved to Centre Court.  When did you learn the match had been moved?  
KIKI BERTENS: It was at 5:30 they told me, like, probably we're gonna move your match to Centre Court.  And I'm not the person who likes to play on Centre Court, but it is what it is, and I think it was just a good challenge for me to just go out there and play my first match on Centre Court and, just, like how I was able to manage the nerves and all that kind of stuff.  Yeah, I was happy with my performance.   
 Q.  As far as I'm concerned, when the match has been moved, has been announced to move, Serena is leading 5-3.  The director maybe think she will finish in, like, five or ten minutes.  Suddenly Giulia broke back and level at 5-5.  If the match go on to the third set, so you have to wait another set, would you get more frustrated?  
KIKI BERTENS: I have no idea than what was the plan.  So maybe they moved us again to another court.  I have no idea.  But it finish in two sets, so, yeah.
