B. BENCIC/K. Bertens
7-5, 1-0 (ret.)
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Tell us how you're feeling, what drove in the end to make this difficult decision.
KIKI BERTENS: Yeah, it was really tough, but I didn't feel well on court. I had some problems with my stomach. Yeah, just the energy was not there. A little bit dizzy.
Yeah, just too much to continue.
Q. Did you wake up feeling not well? Has it been something you were feeling throughout the week?
KIKI BERTENS: Well, I was really tired, of course, after the match against Ash. I didn't know that there was, like, that much energy left, to be honest. But then afterwards I slept a lot. Yesterday the same.
Yeah, this morning it didn't feel really bad. Right before the match, like two hours before, it became worse.
Q. Now that your season is done...
KIKI BERTENS: Finally (smiling).
Q. Can you talk about what the last few weeks have kind of meant to you. Win over world No. 1, playing here. You have to be proud of your effort this year.
KIKI BERTENS: Yeah, I think I gave absolutely everything this match -- I cannot even think any more and talk (laughter).
I think I gave absolutely everything this year and this week. I'm proud of that. Like five weeks ago, I said to myself, You're completely dead. I guess now I'm almost there.
Yeah, it's just every day I said to myself, Okay, just give it one more time, one more time, one more time. It was a few more, but I'm glad that I could, well, not finish it this way of course, but I know for myself I gave absolutely everything.
Q. Now that you can think about the off-season, what are your plans?
KIKI BERTENS: First, doing nothing for a few days. I think I can really use that. Spend some time with my fianc√© before we're getting married. I'm really looking forward to having a great time at home, as well.
Q. How much of the non-stop six weeks have an impact on wedding planning, your plan for the end of the season?
KIKI BERTENS: Well, yeah, it's going to be challenging with the dress fitting and stuff like that. But they promised everything is going to work out well. If they have to workday and night for it, they will do it.
I have some great planners back at home. My family did a lot. I think everything is going to be fine. We're just looking forward to a great day with our family and friends.
Q. A review of your season. What are you most proud of, what do you take with you from 2019 into the 2020 season?
KIKI BERTENS: I've learned so much again this year about myself. My confidence grew a lot I would say after the last year. I'm really proud I'm still in the top 10, which was a goal in the beginning of the season. I knew it was going to be really tough. But I'm still here, so really proud of that.
Yeah, we just rest now and work hard again to make hopefully next year even better.
