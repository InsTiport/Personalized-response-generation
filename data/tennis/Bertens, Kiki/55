3-6, 7-5, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You were up a set.  Where did the match go from there?  What didn't go your way?  
KIKI BERTENS: Well, I think the whole match.  I didn't really feel like that I was the better one also in the first set.  I think Julia played great from the beginning.  Then she made some errors.  I think I was a bit lucky to finish out the first set.  Really happy with that.   
A break down in the second quite fast.  But I managed to come back.  It's just a few points here and there, but I think she started to play better, more aggressive.  Yeah, in the third there was not so much I could do any more.   
 Q.  Despite this, you've had a great run.  How will you use this momentum going forward to US Open, other tournaments?  
KIKI BERTENS: Yeah, I think I will really take this like the way I played here, how aggressive I was, for the next few tournaments.  I'm really happy with the result here.  Could not believe it if you said two weeks ago, You were going to be in the quarterfinals.   
Yeah, I will take this one, learn from it, and move on.   
 Q.  How do you think Julia will do against Serena?  
KIKI BERTENS: I think she will do pretty good, yeah.  Of course, it's the first time for her in the semis.  It's going to be a really big match.  I think today she played great.  She had a great year last year also.  I think she's ready for a big fight.   
 Q.  What advice would you give her in terms of technical, strategic?  
KIKI BERTENS: I think it's just go out there and try to do the same as she did today; try to play aggressive, serve well, and go for her shots like what she did to me today.   
 Q.  What do you think would be a bigger challenge in the semifinal, the mental or physical aspect of the game?  
KIKI BERTENS: Both.  I think it's a mix of everything.  Of course, it's really exciting to be in your first semifinal.  I think she will have some nerves.  Yeah, she played great tennis already before.  She have been in big finals.  I think she can do it.   
 Q.  What is your general feeling sitting there now?  Hurt from the loss or pride?  
KIKI BERTENS: It's a little bit mixed.  Of course, I'm disappointed that I lost this match.  Yeah, what I said.  I think I didn't feel like I was really the better one today on court.  Of course, it's always a few points.  I was really close, of course, in the second set, but I didn't manage to get it.   
I will keep on fighting, keep on doing my things, keep on trying, but it didn't work out.  In the end I'm just really proud sitting here being in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon and playing some great tennis.   
 Q.  Does this give you confidence going into the hard court season?  
KIKI BERTENS: I think so, yeah.  I don't know how I did it, to play this aggressive.  For sure I will take this with me, practice again a lot on the things we're doing right now.  Just keep on going.   
 Q.  You had a nice hug at the net.  Words exchanged?  
KIKI BERTENS: I don't know.  I think she said, I'm sorry.   
I'm like, You don't have to be sorry.  I'm really happy for you.  You really deserved this.  Keep on going, you can do this.   
I don't know.  I think that was kind of it.  I'm not sure any more.
