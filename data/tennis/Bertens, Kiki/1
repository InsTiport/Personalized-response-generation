 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. If I can ask you what your Achilles surgery meant, I know it was a few months ago, but how do you think that affected your performance today?
 KIKI BERTENS:   Well, I think that the foot was fine today, so I think that didn't affect me at all.  But of course the match, I didn't have much match rhythm getting into this.
 Of course maybe that helps always a little bit, but I think Jelena was playing really well today.  I think she had a great performance.  Of course mine was not good, but I think it was more her than me today.
 Q. What are your next steps?  Do you get back into the exercise routine?  What are you going to do to bounce back?
 KIKI BERTENS:   Well, I still have doubles here, so I'm really happy that at least I have another match here in Doha.  Then I prepare as good as I can and go back to the practice courts, get the hours in and prepare as good as I can for Dubai next week.
