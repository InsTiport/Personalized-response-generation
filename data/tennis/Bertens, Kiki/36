K. BERTENS/A. Anisimova
6-2, 4-6, 7-5
(Transcribed from WTA recorded audio.)
Q. Talk us through the frustration with the rain delays, and how you coped and prepared for today.
KIKI BERTENS: Yeah, yesterday was a tough day, I would say.  But it was for everyone.  Long wait.
Today you have to play twice if you win the first one.  It was a little bit early this morning.  But tough match, tough conditions here in Rome.
I'm just really happy, yeah, to get through today.
Q. Talk us through the match with Anisimova.  She can be a tough opponent.  The last set was definitely topsy-turvy.
KIKI BERTENS: Yeah, no, it was really tough.  I would say first set 6-2 my side, but I think it was much closer than the score look like.
In the second set, I was a break up, but then she started to play better.  I was still searching a little bit for my game.
In the end it was just a big fight.  I'm just happy I managed to win.
Q. Thoughts on either Suarez Navarro or Cornet?
KIKI BERTENS: Going to be a tough match, long rallies again.  Physically prepare as good as possible again for another match today.
