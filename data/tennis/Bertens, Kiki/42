A. BARTY/K. Bertens   
6-7, 6-4, 7-5   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  In her postmatch conference, Barty referred to you as a great friend on the circuit.  What was it like playing someone you're close to?  
KIKI BERTENS: It's always tough, but it's always fun.  I think it's always fun to play someone you like than someone you don't like.   
Yeah, it was just a hard fight today.  I think it was a good match from both sides, and, yeah, Ash was just the better one in the end.   
 Q.  You pushed her really hard in that first set.  What kind of changed?  
KIKI BERTENS: I think in the first set I was serving really well.  I hit a lot of aces, and I felt really confident with the serve.   
Of course she had a set point already, but I managed to stay in the set and win the set.  I think it changed a little bit in the beginning of the second set.  She started there to play a little bit better, and I played two games like not so good.   
And then in the end, it's just a really good fight and it's just a few points.  Yeah, she was the better one.   
 Q.  Looking ahead to the final, it looks like Barty will be playing either Kvitova or Sasnovich.  Do you have any predictions for that match?  
KIKI BERTENS: It's going to be a great fight, I think, great final, as always, and I think she has the home crowd with her here.  Last year she lost the final, so hopefully this one she can take it here.   
 Q.  You have played Ash a few times, singles and then also in doubles.  Is there anything in particular that makes her such a tough player?  
KIKI BERTENS: Yeah, it's tough with her.  Like the backhand, she just kind of takes you out of the rhythm with the slice, and then if you play to the forehand, she likes to open the court with the spin.  Also her serve is good.   
Yeah, it's always tough against her.  She's a tough opponent but also really fun to play.   
 Q.  This loss gives you a little bit more time to prepare for the Australian Open.  How are you feeling for that?  
KIKI BERTENS: Of course, like my first match there is on Monday, but still, I really wanted to win this match and play a final here.   
But, yeah, now it's just going on again, and, yeah, prepare as good as I can for my first match in Melbourne.   
 Q.  How do you feel about your draw for Melbourne?  
KIKI BERTENS: Yeah, I play Riske in the first round.  She played a final in China, so I think she was playing well there.  And, yeah, we just see.  It's a tough opponent.
