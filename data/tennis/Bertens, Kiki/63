    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please. 

Q.   Looked like you got a little frustrated in the second set when you threw the racquet.   What were your thoughts at the time?
    KIKI BERTENS:   Well, it was just like I think one unlucky points for me.   I think only one point that I had, yes, had a little bit frustrations.
    I don't think that cost me the match or something.

Q.   What do you think was the difference in the third set when you came back?
    KIKI BERTENS:   I think she finish the match pretty good.   I think she played aggressive and just go for her shots.
    I think she did it pretty good, better than me.   I think it was a great match in the end, yeah. 

Q.   This is not about the match, but writing about coming up and financial burdens and challenges.   How much does it cost to play on the tour, and how do you meet those challenges? 
    KIKI BERTENS:   Yeah, it's hard.   Your coach, you have to pay him, and also all your staff at home.
    But I think last year I was already in the top 100 for, yeah, almost one and a half years, so I think it's for me pretty good everything. 
    Yeah.

Q.   Is that basically the dividing line, top 100?
    KIKI BERTENS:   Yeah, then you‑‑ yeah, and especially now in the Grand Slams, if you reach now fourth round, then, yeah, it's pretty good for me, I think.
    Yeah.
