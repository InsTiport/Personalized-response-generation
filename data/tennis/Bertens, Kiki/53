K. BERTENS/P. Kvitova
6-3, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You were so close to beating Petra the last time in Madrid.  How good did it feel to get it done today?
KIKI BERTENS: Really happy with that.  Really happy with the win today.  I think the conditions were really tough with a lot of wind.
I managed -- well, I tried to play many balls in the court.  Yeah, today that was enough, so really happy.
Q. It was close at the end.  What was going through your mind?  What helped you stay calm?
KIKI BERTENS: Yeah, it's tough, especially with the conditions and with serving for the match 30-Love up.  Yeah, she came up with a few good points.  Then I was like, Okay, you just have a few more chances here.  I was not really getting nervous already.  I was just trying to stay calm, trying to hit the balls back in the court.  That was it.
Q. You mentioned the windy conditions today.  What do you find the toughest between the extreme heat that we had the last few days and a very windy day?
KIKI BERTENS: Yeah, it's really tough to play with the wind, especially in the stadiums.  There's not that the wind comes from one side.  It's kind of, yeah, I don't know how you say that.
Q. Swirls?
KIKI BERTENS: Yeah, swirls around the court.  You never know what you get.  It's really tough.
I just tried to play some slices here and there, just tried to let her play an extra ball.  I think that's what I did really well today.
Yeah, it's different from the last couple days.  I think it was just like the balls were a bit harder, the bounces a bit higher.
You have to deal with the conditions, what you get, on these days.  It's tough for everyone, but you have to make the best out of it.
Q. Before this week you hadn't had a top-10 win on hard courts, now you have two in a row.  How well are you playing right now, in your opinion?
KIKI BERTENS: Well, it's maybe not nice to say, but I don't think that I played really well today or the last few games.  It's just enough.  I think that's what I do good at this moment.  When the level is good enough to play solid tennis...
I think that's what I'm really happy with, that I'm not playing my best but winning quite easy like the scoreline.  I think the level in general, I raised my game.
Q. Your thoughts on playing Ash Barty next?
KIKI BERTENS: It's going to be a difficult match, of course.  She's playing some great tennis.  Smart girl.  Also with a lot of slice.
I don't know what the conditions are going to be tomorrow, but we see then.  We make a good plan, and hopefully it's going to be a great match.
Q. You both play a lot of doubles.  Does that create a different dynamic?
KIKI BERTENS: Well, it's nice actually.  I like to play doubles, as well.  She, of course, also.  We're maybe the only ones here in singles and doubles.  I'm not sure.
It's just nice at the beginning of the hard court season for me to play a lot of matches.  Yeah, I just take every match.
