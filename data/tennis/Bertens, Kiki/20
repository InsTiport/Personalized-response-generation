A. BARTY/K. Bertens
6-3, 3-6, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Talk through the match. Do you think you could have done anything better on the match point?
KIKI BERTENS: Well, of course hit a winner (smiling). It's easier said afterwards.
I think it was a great match, a great fight from both sides. It could go either way. It was not me today. I think in general I can be proud of myself for my performance today.
Q. I know your ankle was giving you some trouble yesterday. How did it feel today?
KIKI BERTENS: It was fine. It didn't really bother me. Of course, I felt it, but it was not like I was restricted with running or anything. It's all good.
Q. What are your biggest takeaways from the tournament?
KIKI BERTENS: Well, just like that after a few tough weeks, you still can do pretty well, you can recover. I have to believe that every week I can do that. I think every match I played a little bit better also tennis. I think today was great.
Yeah, we just keep on going from here again.
Q. She started out very quickly. It seemed like even though you lost the first set 6-3, you started to make adjustments and get closer in the service games. What adjustments did you make that you felt were effective?
KIKI BERTENS: I think in the first set, Ash was serving pretty well. Straight like she broke me. I was struggling a little bit in her service games.
I think second set she had a few games that she had some more second serves, so I was trying to step in there a little bit, also on the first serve a little bit closer to the baseline.
Yeah, I think that worked better than when I was standing too far back.
Q. It seemed also you were kind of taking more balls to the forehand side from her. I don't know if it was trying to avoid the slice...
KIKI BERTENS: Well, I know she also likes to hit it cross. I'll do the same. I felt more like that we were 50/50 on that side. In the backhand slice, it's tough. You think you can really do something with the ball, but you cannot really. You really have to be patient.
Yeah, I used the backhand slice also a lot. Yeah, to be honest, Ash is much better on that, yeah.
Q. In terms of getting that matchup, playing it so tight, being close, what do you take specifically out of this match into Moscow?
KIKI BERTENS: Well, just I think that I played the right way, that I was coming forward, that I played aggressive where I could. So I think I just have to keep going like this, playing my own game. Yeah, like what I did today, just trying to do that again in Moscow, then we'll see what we're going to play next.
