B. STRYCOVA/K. Bertens   
7-5, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  I know she's crafty, moves well.  From your side, what do you feel let you down from your end today?  
KIKI BERTENS: Yeah, I think today was not a good match from my side.  I had to play more aggressive.  Yeah, I was not able to do that.  Nothing was really working.  The serve was not really there.  My strokes were not really there.  Had some opportunities, but didn't take them.   
Yeah, then it's tough to win.   
 Q.  I know last year was a big moment for you making quarterfinals here.  Helped you do well on other surfaces.  How do you feel about this loss now you know you could do a lot more here?  
KIKI BERTENS: Yeah, it is what it is.  Today here it ends in round three.  Last year was quarters.  It was unbelievable, of course.   
Yeah, still I think the grass season was okay.  I played a lot of matches.  I won a lot of matches.  But, yeah, still the game is not really there, I would say, for grass.  I have to play more aggressive.  I think I didn't do that the whole grass court season.   
Against a lot of girls, it was good enough to just play a little bit more from the defense, just to hang in the point, slice it back.  If you play already the previous rounds against Taylor, but also today against Barbora, you see that's not enough, that you have to do more, because they are better in that.   
Yeah, I was not able to step up my game.
