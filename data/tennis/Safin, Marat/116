THE MODERATOR:  First question, please. 


Q.  Bit of frustration for you there today.  What was going on? 

MARAT SAFIN:  Huh? 

Q.  Some frustration for you out there today. 

MARAT SAFIN:  No, I just got a little bit tired and had problems in my legs.  I couldn't really, like, couldn't move.  I felt a little bit like weak.  So I started to get annoyed by that because I didn't want to play like four sets.  I didn't want to get in trouble for the fifth.  That's why somehow I tried to keep it up and just keep the tension of the match.

Q.  Is there any reason for why you're feeling so tired?  Are there problems with your legs?

MARAT SAFIN:  No.  Because, I mean, it's obvious - it's difficult to come back, and it's difficult to play the same level as you used to play, especially if you been out for six months.  Then your muscles definitely get a little bit weak.  So bring back the power in the legs is a little bit difficult.  It's coming with the matches. 

Q.  It was a good win against a tough opponent, wouldn't you say?

MARAT SAFIN:  Yeah, I mean, it's a great win.  It's great to beat Jarkko.  He's a good player.  He knows how to play big matches.  He had some great wins.  It's a really good match for me, especially to win in four sets.  Even I had opportunity to -- I had a chance to stay in the third.  I made him a break 5-4, and then I just lost my serve.  But I am satisfied.  It's a great match to fight.  I mean, four sets, I make four sets, so it's quite good for me.
