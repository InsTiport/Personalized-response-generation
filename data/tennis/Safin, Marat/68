THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.


Q.  Just tell us what happened out there tonight.

MARAT SAFIN:  Just I don't know how to describe it.  Just really bad, I think.  Just that match told me that I better start thinking about the next couple of tournaments that are coming because the way I'm playing right now, I won't be able to make any good results. Today just I couldn't hurt him at all.  I was running from side to side, and I was not -- I didn't have any chance to beat him today.  That's really what bothered me.


Q.  Do you think he played exceptionally well?

MARAT SAFIN:  No, he played solid.  Like, I mean, he passed the quali, he beat Andreev in the first round.  He has nothing to lose.  He played decent tennis, but nothing spectacular. And just me, just I couldn't play my game.  I was running.  I mean, like this kind of game, I cannot -- this is not my style and I cannot just -- I'm not used to it.  So it's difficult for me to beat anybody playing this way.


Q.  Is it just the clay or...

MARAT SAFIN:  Just me, that I'm playing bad.  Really bad.
