S. BOLELLI/M. Matosevic
  6‑3, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Couldn't any momentum against his serve?   He really strong on his serve. 
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yeah.   Yeah, he served really well and played really well.   All credit to him tonight. 

Q.   How did you go out there tonight? 
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yeah, not good.   My preparation was my warmup today for my match.   I was surprised I was playing today.   I thought I would get a Tuesday start. 
Arrived late Saturday afternoon; wasn't able to practice yesterday, and I warmup today. 
So it was tough.   Tough preparation.

Q.   Did you ask for a Tuesday start?
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yeah.   Yeah, I thought I was going to get one.   I was told‑‑ like before I went to Hopman Cup they would ask for me.

Q.   So traveling just taking a toll? 
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   No, he played well tonight.   I don't want to make any excuses.   Yeah, wasn't the best preparation.   Hopman Cup was a great event.   I would jump at the chance to do it again.
No excuses. 

Q.   Do you still feel like you got enough matches under your belt now?
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yeah.   I feel like I got four matches.   Hopefully it's enough for Oz Open next week.

Q.   Going to Melbourne tomorrow? 
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   I've got doubles with Kyrgios on Wednesday.
