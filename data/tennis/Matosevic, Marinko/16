 B. TOMIC/M. Matosevic
  6‑3, 6‑4 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How do you assess your performance?  
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   I thought it was decent level match.   I thought Bernard several really well.   I think he was serving over 60% and he seemed to win all the big points and just couldn't ‑‑ after the early break in the first set just couldn't get in there.  
   
 Q.   It's very soon after the match, but can you draw some positives from it?   What do you take from it?   
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yeah, definitely.   I thought I served all right tonight besides that two bad games.   One break in each set.   I thought we didn't make many errors.   It was just mainly winners and forced errors.   
All credit to him.   He played too good for me today.  
   
 Q.   When was the last time you played him?  
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Nottingham challenger in 2011 in the quarterfinals just before he made his run to the quarterfinals in Wimbledon.   He beat me pretty handily there.  
   
 Q.   Obviously you can see changes in his game.  
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yeah, he's serving much better I though, and that's about it.   I think he's the same player when he made that run.   I think he's just serving a little bit better.   
   
 Q.   Looking forward to going to Melbourne now and hit the practice courts?   Big tournament down there obviously for you.   
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yeah, doubles tomorrow I think and then the big one next week, Australian Open.   Really looking forward to that.   I feel like I played pretty well last week against Nishikori.   I was a break up, lost 5 and 2, and then today one break in each set.   
I feel like I'm playing all right.   Just need a decent draw and a win under my belt and I'll be okay.
