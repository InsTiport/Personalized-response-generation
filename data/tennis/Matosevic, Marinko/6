 M. MATOSEVIC/J. Tsonga
  6‑2, 6‑4 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How is the ankle and the hip?  
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Well, I will see the physio soon.   Then I'll know.   The hip probably feels worse than the ankle.   
Ann Marie will be checking it out very shortly.  
   
 Q.   Could you tell us what happened with the ankle?  
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Well, I rolled it.   I don't know if there's footage of it.   I rolled the ankle, and then obviously I slipped for the hip.  
   
 Q.   At the time, what were you thinking?  
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   I've done it before   just innocently against Chela at the US Open.   Had a Grade II tear in every ligament in my left one.   Yeah, the left one was taped but the right one wasn't.  
   
 Q.   It looked like you thought you were in a bit of trouble.   
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yeah, I thought the same thing happened.   I thought it was going to blow up.   There is a little bit of swelling, but it didn't blow up like the last one.  
   
 Q.   Do you think there is any danger that you'll miss tomorrow?  
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   I'll see.   The hip did get worse as the match went on.  
Like at first I was worried about the ankle, and then like after that sitdown where he taped my ankle the hip started to feel bad.  
We'll see tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   I suppose you just have to do rest and hope that you can...   
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yeah, I guess so.  
   
 Q.   What's your thoughts on the victory?   You must be delighted with it.   
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yeah, I'm really happy with the win, obviously.   It would have been a perfect match if I got the double break in the second.   He played ‑‑I had one short one I missed.   He played one or two good points on the other one.   
But if I made that break point, it would have been the perfect one.  
   
 Q.   You said he taught you a lesson a few years back.   You must be very pleased to come through this today?  
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yeah, we played at Indian Wells in 2009 or '10.   I qualified beating Michael Llodra.   I played him second round.   
Yeah, I was really impressed that day.   It was like a year, year and a half after his Aussie Open final.   It was a lesson.   I still owe him 50 Euros for it.  
   
 Q.   That doesn't make up for today, then?  
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yeah, I guess in a way it does.   I don't know.   It's definitely a big win.   It's a good win.  
   
 Q.   Second seed obviously in the three matches that you have knocked out in the tournament.   How pleased are you generally with your form?  
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yeah, since the French Open, like I said, I feel really free.   I had good results up there in the Nottingham.  
Now, you know, I don't think about the slam thing anymore.   I'm just enjoying my tennis, to tell you the truth.  
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts on Stan?  
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   I will have a word to Lleyton about him.   Lleyton knocked him off first round last year at Wimbledon.   He had a good win today over Querrey.   I will ask him for his advice.   
Obviously he won the Aussie Open.   He's a great player.   I've watched him many times.   I warmed him up for his match against Berdych at the Aussie Open.   
Yeah.   Looking forward to it.  
   
 Q.   When you weigh up your injury for tomorrow, how much do you factor in Wimbledon?   
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   I'm not going to think about Wimbledon at all.   Queen's is a big, huge tournament.   Yeah, so not at all.  
   
 Q.   When you were saying the hip is worse than the ankle, where do you feel it the most in the match?   Moving sideways, up and down?  
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   I don't want to tell which way it is, but it's when I run to a certain side.   That's when I feel it the most.
