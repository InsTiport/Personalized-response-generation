M. MATOSEVIC/J. Benneteau
  5‑7, 6‑4, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Congratulations.   How much relief and how much elation?
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   The main thing is the relief.   I felt like I should have won in straight sets; I didn't.
Then I almost blew it in the third and I held on.   Yeah, very happy to win.

Q.   The first in Australia in the main draw. 
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yeah, I qualified in Sydney.   I beat a guy like 68, but never actually won a main draw match. 
It was good to win the first one.

Q.   Must be great to get the monkey off your back. 
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yeah.   It is.   It's been a horrible year.   I just wanted this year to finish.   But then I like I finished 60 or whatever over the year, yeah, but it's not the best.   But then I finished it off with a good win I guess.

Q.   You had a shoulder problem, right?
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yeah, I was on my way to finish another year top 50.   I felt like I was playing some good tennis.   I lost to Ferrer and I hurt it in Beijing.   That was my last match I played against Ferrer.   I haven't played since.
It's like, yeah, fluid in the bursa.   Yeah, it's like a shoulder impingement and seems to be getting better.

Q.   When did that get to the point you could train fully again? 
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Well, I didn't play Shanghai.   Flew to Europe to keep trying to play, but I couldn't.   Hurt to pick up a fork.
Then I took five weeks off from tennis and I came back and tried to play and it hurt after four days and then I needed ‑‑ I don't want to talk about the treatment I had, but yeah, I needed, yeah, obviously treatment.   It was pretty serious.

Q.   Why don't you want to talk about the treatment?   Because it's something radical?
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   No, I just don't want to talk about what I did.   Yeah, I want to keep it under wraps. 

Q.   So the ice helps obviously?
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yeah, ice is just a precautionary.   It's the first step after a match.

Q.   That was only a couple months ago. 
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yeah, when I did the treatment, that was mid‑November.   I got to thank Linda Watson.   She did Patrick Rafter's surgery and really helped me out with that.

Q.   How important is this win in the scheme of things? 
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Well, yeah, it is important, because obviously I didn't want to go into the Australian Open winless again.   It's happened the previous three, four years, so it's important.

Q.   You talk about the shoulder.   Was there a point you thought you may not come back from it at all?
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   No, I don't think it was that crazy.   I've never had surgery in my career or anything like that.   I've only had one‑ or two ‑ one major injury where I had an L4, L5 with my back.   I missed 7 months.   Yeah, and then did my ankle and tore every ligament in 2011. 
But I didn't think it was not crazy serious, but it was serious. 

Q.   Is that all?   You describe it as a horrible year. 
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   No, like tennis, I had a better year or tour, but obviously I was winless in slams again and winless in Davis Cup.   I finished the year 60.   I beat lots of good players:   Querrey, Dolgopolov, Robredo, Monaco, Verdasco, Davydenko, Blake.   Lots of good wins.   Benoit Paire, Tommy Haas.
Just, yeah, professionally at the highest level and personally it was a horrible year. 

Q.   You're being coached by Mark Woodforde. 
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yeah, I worked with Mark in 2011 but I had to share him with another player.   That didn't work out so well because, I don't know, me and the player, we don't get along, whatever. 
I've been trying to work with Mark ever since.   Then he was going to agree to coach me after the Aussie Open this year, but we‑‑ he couldn't or something.   He made commitments.   When he makes commitments he sticks to his word.   He finally agreed after Wimbledon.
It's like I had to chase him and he finally agreed after Wimbledon. 

Q.   Who were you not liking? 
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   No, it's all right.   It's not not liking.   We just don't see eye to eye.
