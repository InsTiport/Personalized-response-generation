THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How was that, Marinko? 
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   I did what I needed to do to win.   It was a good win. 
Yeah, looking forward to the next one. 

Q.   You promised you would play attackingly and you did.   Must have been pleasing that you could follow through. 
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yeah, just playing grass court tennis, and, yeah, it was a good win out there. 

Q.   You seem obviously very measured, quite low key.   Is it having got this initial win out of the way and you're kind of now focused on just winning more? 
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Which win are you talking about?

Q.   The win in France. 
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yeah, like I said, I'm just playing tennis now.   Yeah, good match. 

Q.   Was it just particularly draining out there? 
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   No.   It was fine out there.   It was like‑‑ what was I going to say? 
What was the question? 

Q.   Just was it particularly draining out there?
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Oh, no, not at all.   It was four sets of like pretty quick tennis. 

Q.   Couple of niggles at Queen's, injury niggles.   Back to full fitness now? 
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yep, back to full fitness.

Q.   Must be pleased that that's all done with. 
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yeah, it's never good to be injured.   It's always pleasing to be healthy.

Q.   Basically the same question.   You finished strongly in the fourth set, 6‑2.   Obviously feeling well and had plenty in the tank at the finish?
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   What's the question? 

Q.   Did you have plenty in the tank by the time you got to the fourth set?
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Of course, yeah.   How long did the match take? 

Q.   Two hours sixteen. 
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yeah, I can go a little bit more than that.   I played four hours in Australia in 43 degree heat. 

Q.   Can you gain a lot of confidence from this, another seed you knocked out? 
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yeah, every win gives you confidence.   Yeah, the only way to get confidence is by wins, so, yeah, very confident.

Q.   What are you are thoughts on the second round?   Looking like Chardy. 
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   My coach Mark Woodforde is gonna go have a look ar that.   Chardy is higher ranked, but Coxy is a pretty good grass courter. 

Q.   Are you all right at the moment?   Seem a bit flat. 
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   No, I'm fine.   Just had a nice shower and good stretch.   I feel a little bit sleepy actually. 

Q.   Is that usual after a match like that? 
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yeah, I didn't sleep great last night, so, yeah, I feel a little sleepy.

Q.   Were you anxious last night? 
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   No, not anxious, just like really relaxed.   I was watching the football. 
Yeah, I don't know.

Q.   Can you compare this win with the one in France?
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Just felt like a normal tennis match.   There wasn't like any crazy internal thoughts.   I was just free to play tennis. 
Yeah, that was it. 

Q.   How important is Mark's influence, especially on grass?
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yeah, very important.   You know, I worked with him before.   Since we started working together again, he's big on playing attacking tennis.   He really focused on this grass court season.   On hard court be tougher to do, but play to win, play grass court tennis. 
It's paying off so far.

Q.   The fans were bringing out the mad dog again.   Do you mind so much this time?
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   No, they were good.   I needed the support and they were very loud.   Hope they come out for the next match.

Q.   Initially you didn't sort of warm to that nickname.   Has that changed now, or your just happy to take the support?
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Very happy to take the support from any fan out there.
