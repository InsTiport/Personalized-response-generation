M. MATOSEVIC/L. Lacko
  7‑6, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Another good win.   How did you see it?
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yeah, it was good.   He's a good quality player.
I shouldn't have lost my serve in the first set.   When I had 30‑15 up I served a double fault, but then he played one or two good points.   And then I was too good in the break and too good in the second set.

Q.   You had a great start this week.   Spending a bit of time in Nottingham last week, did that help?
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yeah, got to the final in Nottingham, lost a good match against Marcos.   Yeah, lots of time on grass for sure has helped.

Q.   Tsonga next up. 
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   I played Jo before and he gave me a lesson in Indian Wells 2009 or '10.   Yeah, I have hit with him since then, so looking forward to it.   It's been a long time since we played.

Q.   And the way you're playing at the moment?   I guess you don't have any fear against anyone?
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   No, I'm good.   I'm free to play.   I'm looking forward to it.   Obviously he's a top‑10 player and been to the semifinals of Wimbledon, finals of a slam.   He's one of the best players out there.

Q.   Do you think this is a good opportunity for you against Jo being on grass?
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   He's a very good grass courter.   You know, any time you can play him it's a big challenge. 
But, yeah‑‑ I mean, yeah.   I think grass is his favorite surface, so I don't know. 
Just looking forward to it.   Tomorrow is it?   Yeah, tomorrow.

Q.   Are you aware your comments yesterday about women's tennis caused a bit of a stir?
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   I didn't until this morning.   I woke up to a bunch of messages.   And, yeah, I was surprised that it did because I thought my comments were pretty innocent.

Q.   Samantha Stosur called them today thick headed.   What do you think of that? 
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   I like Sam.   She's a lovely girl.   We have the same manager.   That's a shame.

Q.   I guess some people thought it was sexist.   Do you want to clarify anything? 
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   No, women are a big inspiration to me.   I didn't mean it to be sexist at all. You know, I didn't mean for that at all to come across like that.
But, yeah.   It's a shame it did.

Q.   Have you seen Andy today?
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yeah, yeah.   I spoke to Andy.   But, I mean, I didn't say anything against him.   His mom did a great job with him.   I was just talking about what I thought of women's tennis yesterday.

Q.   Why don't you like women's tennis?
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   I love women's tennis (smiling).   I love it. 

Q.   So you're obviously standing by your view, your opinion?
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   About what? 

Q.   You're standing by your comments yesterday?   That's your opinion?
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Well, what was my quote exactly? 

Q.   I think you said, I'd never have a woman's coach because I don't... 
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   I don't think highly of women's tennis. 

Q.   There's nothing wrong with saying there is a difference between women's and men's tennis, is there?   Because obviously men and women are different. 
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   I think you should ask the general public.   Like you guys always ask us players.   I think TV, crowds at their tournaments, stuff like this, that's your answer.   That's the difference between men's and women's tennis. 
I mean, ask the people.   Go by TV audience, go by attendance.   See what people want to go watch.   Then that's your answer.

Q.   Do you think it's been twisted around in the local papers?
MARINKO MATOSEVIC:   Yeah.   I mean, I'm good with Andy.   He's a great guy.   They're like saying I'm against him.   I said nothing against him.   I was like, His mom did a great job with him.   I'm sure AmÃ©lie will do a great job with him. 
But yeah.
