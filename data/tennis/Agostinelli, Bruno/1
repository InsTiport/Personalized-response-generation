 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. When was the last time you played Peter?  
 BRUNO AGOSTINELLI: Probably Under 14.  
  
  Q. It's been that long?  
 BRUNO AGOSTINELLI: It's been that long.  
  
  Q. Looked like you played him pretty tough out there. Is there anything you think you could have done that you should do or didn't do?  
 BRUNO AGOSTINELLI: Not really. I was a little nervous, obviously. I came from college and here I am playing the Masters. So I was a little tight in the beginning, and after the rain delay I came back out and felt a lot looser. I have no regrets, for sure.   
  
  Q. Where do you go from here? I know you're going back to school for a semester. Are you planning to get out in some of the tournaments?  
 BRUNO AGOSTINELLI: I hope so. I'm going to be playing probably starting in January if everything works out.  
  
  Q. Any Futures or anything you can squeeze in in between or...   
 BRUNO AGOSTINELLI: I'm going to try, but I mean, I'm bombarded with a lot of hours this semester.   
  
  Q. Is there anything that he surprised you with?  
 BRUNO AGOSTINELLI: I mean, Peter is a great player. He qualified for the Australian and French Open this year, so all credit to him.   
 He's a great player. I was just glad I was a part of all this.  
  
  Q. Does it give you confidence staying out there with him and taking him to a tiebreaker?  
 BRUNO AGOSTINELLI: I mean, definitely this whole week I've been practicing with a lot of the pros here and it's definitely -- it definitely makes your game build up and your confidence, definitely.  
  
  Q. Are you surprised to be here?  
 BRUNO AGOSTINELLI: For sure. I mean, I was playing -- like I said, I was in college playing a match and Martin Laurendeau came to watch me play, and obviously I went to Davis Cup, and everything just -- snowball effect. It's an honor, and I'd just like to thank everybody from Tennis Canada.  
  
  Q. Does that change your outlook? Were you thinking about playing again or this experience the last couple of months change your plans or anything?  
 BRUNO AGOSTINELLI: I mean, yeah. To be honest, when I was in college my goal was just to finish All American. Hopefully being an All American I could have gotten a good job coaching or something. That was really in my mind.   
 I mean, after this, obviously, yeah, I'm excited to go out there and start playing.
