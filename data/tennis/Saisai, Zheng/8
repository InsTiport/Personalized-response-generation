THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What did it feel like knowing the people of China wanted you to win?
ZHENG SAISAI: Every time I play like in China, like really I feel a lot of support. Also that make me really want to win, so I got extra pressure on me also.
I think that's why every time I got pretty tight. I was really during the match a bit pissed because I was like up and down a lot, I miss a lot. Also there's many times playing good, but just not that consistent.
But the crowd really helped me at the end. Whole match they were cheering for me. At the end they were saying, Let's go, Saisai. They push me. I feel the power. I really appreciate them at the end. This little power helped me through this match, yeah.
