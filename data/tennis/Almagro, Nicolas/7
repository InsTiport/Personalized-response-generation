THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   The Lance Armstrong interview today, I was wondering what your thoughts are on drug testing in tennis?

I don't know what happened.   
   
 Q.   My question is what about the authorities in tennis are doing.   
NICOLAS ALMAGRO:   You need to ask to someone better than me because I not going to say nothing.   Sorry.   It's a very important things, and I not going to talk.
