R. NADAL/N. Almagro
  7-5, 6-4, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. In the last game, 30-15 and the ball went into the net. Most players get angry, but you laughed. You put the shirt over your head. It was a great crowd-pleasing moment. Is sense of humor part of your personality and game for success?
 NICOLAS ALMAGRO: Yeah. In that point, we have too much pression, and when I had that mistake, I need to do something because I was very unlucky with the net. 
 But, well, I'm like this, and I try to enjoy when I play tennis. Today I think I did it.

 Q. What were your impressions of Nadal today? 
 NICOLAS ALMAGRO: Well, he was the No. 1 of the world few months ago and he's coming back. I think he need to -- he had chance to stay again at the top of the ranking, but I think he played better than me and he won the match.

 Q. Once he took the injury timeout at 2-1 in the third set, after that, did that play on your mind? Were you trying to make him run more or anything like that? Did that affect your game at all?
 NICOLAS ALMAGRO: I don't know what happened with Rafa. I know what happened with me. I have a little bit pain in my back, and I was waiting to call the doctor in the next change. 
 But if Rafa call, I prefer to call at the same time. Just this.

 Q. But did that affect your game from that point on?
 NICOLAS ALMAGRO: No, no, no. If I try to -- I was thinking to call the trainer the next change, but I prefer to do at the same time because this is much better.
 But my tennis was the same, before the trainer and after the trainer.
