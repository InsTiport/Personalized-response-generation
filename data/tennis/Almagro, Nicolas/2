  NICOLAS ALMAGRO:   I woke up this morning with a severe pain in my left foot that prevented me from even walking normally.   
After consulting with the doctor for a long time this morning, we decided together that it was better for me not to play today.   
I deeply regret this because I was expecting a lot from this tournament that I like so much.
