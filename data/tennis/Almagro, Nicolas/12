 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Well done. You survived a couple of breaks in the third and fourth. What happened in the last? How hard was the last set?
 NICOLAS ALMAGRO: The last set, I think he was serving unbelievable that two points. I couldn't do nothing. I put the racquet like this, and the ball fly out. 

 Q. Do you think he has the game to be able to go on and maybe take the title this year?
 NICOLAS ALMAGRO: Maybe. He's in the tournament. Me not. I go home. This is the most important. He's playing well. I think he has many chance to be on the semifinal or in the final. 

 Q. What about for you? The game was so long. How are you feeling now and is there a bit more belief for you?
 NICOLAS ALMAGRO: I feel now a little bit sad. No, but I'm happy. I was playing very good in the third and the fourth set. In the fifth I have -- I was very unlucky with that ball. 
 But now I want to think in my person, and my person said I need to go South America to play in clay courts and to be in top 10. But I need to work more now.
