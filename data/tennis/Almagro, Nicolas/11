  6‑4, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You've obviously picked up an injury.   Can you tell us what the exact injury is. 
NICOLAS ALMAGRO:   Well, I don't know.   If I know, I tell you. 
But really I feel pain since Nice a few months ago on my shoulder.   I didn't want to stop because will be one of the most important part of the year for me.   I play many matches on clay.   Well, right now it's impossible to play, to continue playing. 
This is Olympic Games.   This is one of the most important tournament on the world right now.   I decide that I want to play.   Right now I can't continue. 

Q.   Will you be sticking around, supporting the Spanish team?
NICOLAS ALMAGRO:   Well, of course.   We are a team.   We are really good friends.   We'll see if they can beat Dodig and Cilic and will be in the semifinals. 

Q.   In your last service game, were you distracted by someone in the crowd?   Looked like you were talking to somebody. 
NICOLAS ALMAGRO:   I look to my team.   I cannot play.   Someone say something on the public.   Well, I don't like it.   I say, C'mon what?   Only this.
