Q. You must be pleased with the reaction of your team after the first match and are you ready to beat Australia tomorrow?
PABLO GONZALEZ: Yes, we are ready. We have like seven or eight hours on court. I think it is important tomorrow. We finish late tonight, but I think it's better for us right now.
I'm happy for the team. I think is really good, amazing effort for Danny. We were close to the match against Goffin.
Doubles was so good for Colombia. The victory is so important for us in this moment and to keep the fighting in the group.
