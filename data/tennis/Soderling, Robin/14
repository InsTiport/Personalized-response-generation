 THE INTERPRETER: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. (Through translation.) How do you evaluate today's performance?  
 ROBIN SODERLING: Well, it was not perfect, of course, but I think I was hitting the ball okay.   
 But he played really well, so of course I wish I had played a little bit better, but it was not so bad.  
  
  Q. Do you think the weather affects your performance? Because there is fog and maybe it would be influence your eyesight.   
 ROBIN SODERLING: Well, it's the same for everybody, so I don't think so.
