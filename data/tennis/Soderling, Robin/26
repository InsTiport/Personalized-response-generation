  7-5, 6-1, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Could you give us your impressions about the opening of the game, your play in the first set? I'm thinking especially about the returns. 
 ROBIN SODERLING: Yeah, well, I think I served well the whole match. But it took it a while to get used to the returns because he served really well. 
 But I think from the end of the first set and on, I think I returned really well.
