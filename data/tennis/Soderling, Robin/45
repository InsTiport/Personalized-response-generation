THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  Forgive us.  It obviously looks like you'll probably be playing Tim in the next round.  He's almost gone two-sets-to-love up.  This is only your second year on the tour.  Is that right?

ROBIN SODERLING:  Yeah. 

Q.  Can you tell us a little bit about yourself.  We don't really know that much about you. 

ROBIN SODERLING:  Yeah.  As you said, it's only my second year on the tour.  I've been playing tennis since I was, like, five.  I played Juniors, a lot of Juniors past two years.  Yeah, this is my second year.  I think I've been playing really well. The first year was  -- it was really good for me.  I raised almost like 400 spots in the ranking. 

Q.  What's your sort of memories of Wimbledon growing up? 

ROBIN SODERLING:  I always watch it when I was a kid - always.  It was the biggest tournament.  Always watch it.  I was dreaming of one day playing here.  So now I'm here, and it's really nice.  It's a nice feeling.

Q.  That dream might be at Centre Court against the British No. 1.  How would you feel walking out there?

ROBIN SODERLING:  I don't know yet.  See on Saturday.  But probably it's a great feeling to play on Centre Court.  Tim is a really good player.  There is easier draws, for sure.  But, yeah, I will try and do my best, and let's see.

Q.  Do you have some of your family over here with you?

ROBIN SODERLING:  No, just my coach. 

Q.  Just your coach.  They won't be coming over at all for Saturday? 

ROBIN SODERLING:  Actually, I'm not sure yet, but I don't think so.

Q.  Whereabouts are you from in Sweden?

ROBIN SODERLING:  I born in Tibro.  It's a small city.

Q.  T-i?

ROBIN SODERLING:  T-i-b-r-o.  But I live in Gothenburg. 

Q.  Did your parents play tennis at all or...? 

ROBIN SODERLING:  Yeah.  My dad started playing when I was, like, four, and that's how I started playing. 

Q.  So he took it up and you sort of tagged along and went to the club with him?

ROBIN SODERLING:  Yeah, yeah (smiling).

Q.  What is your dad's name?

ROBIN SODERLING:  Bo.

Q.  And what does he do for a living?

ROBIN SODERLING:  He's a lawyer. 

Q.  Were you soon beating him? 

ROBIN SODERLING:  Yeah, I think I will beat him . I haven't played with him for a couple of years, but he beat  -- always beat me till I was, like, 10 or something. 

Q.  Do you play other sports?  Did you have people in your family who have a sporting background? 

ROBIN SODERLING:  Actually, my sister played handball.  That's all.  Not anymore, but she used to play.

Q.  Did she play to a good standard? 

ROBIN SODERLING:  Actually, I'm not sure about it.  No, I don't think so, but...

Q.  She didn't play for Sweden or anything like that?

ROBIN SODERLING:  No, no.  Not like that. 

Q.  What do you make of the grass?  I mean, you showed against Verkerk and today that you're very comfortable. 

ROBIN SODERLING:  Yeah, I haven't been playing on grass since I played Junior Wimbledon and that was two years ago, so I had no expectations at all when I came here.  But I have to say, yeah, I like it.  Playing really well for the moment on grass.  It's not that fast as I expected it to be.  It suits me well. 

Q.  How did you get on at Junior Wimbledon? 

ROBIN SODERLING:  I think I lost third round to a British guy.  I don't remember his name, though.  Played well.

Q.  And last year you...

ROBIN SODERLING:  No, I didn't play.  I didn't play much Juniors last year. 

Q.  Was there one player that you followed back in Sweden?  Who was a player that you most admired growing up, Swedish players? 

ROBIN SODERLING:  Actually, I didn't have any favorite players.  Like, I always liked to watch tennis  - always.  Every time I watch tennis on TV.

Q.  You didn't model yourself on anybody in particular?

ROBIN SODERLING:  No.  I think it's  -- I like the game more than just the players. 

Q.  What do you think, obviously, in Britain the nation gets behind Tim Henman and they expect so much of him?  Do you ever feel that when you're here?  Are the players aware of it?

ROBIN SODERLING:  I know, I know, but it doesn't bother me that much.  I try to concentrate on the match.  Hopefully, I have some guys who supports me.
