  Q.  Seemed like you had a lot of trouble finding your rhythm, a lot of errors, having trouble with your serve.   
 ROBIN SODERLING:  Yeah, I served really bad today.  I didn't hit many first serves in.  I don't know if it's me, but I'm not sure if the lights are very good.  I mean, I had trouble seeing the ball.  Maybe it's just me.  You know, I didn't play night match for pretty long, so it's a little bit different.  I don't know.   
 But I had trouble with my serve.   
  
  Q.  At 6-4 in the tiebreak, just run me through those two points.  You were in a pretty good position.   
 ROBIN SODERLING:  At 6-4, hitting a good lob, I can't really reach it.  I missed it by not very much.  And then also at 6-5, it's a long rally.   
 You know, he play really well on the four points there.  Not much to do.  I had some chances there.  Maybe if I would have won the first set, it would be a different story.   
  
  Q.  Early on, you weren't hitting out.  Were you trying to keep him from getting the pace?  Were you trying to take a little off the ball on your forehands?   
 ROBIN SODERLING:  Yeah, a little bit.  I think he's a player, he moves really well, he likes the pace.   
 But at the same time, that's why he's No. 5, because now he really plays well when, you know, his opponent is trying to take off the pace a little bit.  He's developed a lot of -- he's really developed that in his game.   
  
  Q.  Talk about your run here.  You must be pretty happy the way things went.   
 ROBIN SODERLING:  Yeah, I played four matches.  It's really good, you know.  It's not too many, not too few.  It's good.  I feel good for the Open next week.
