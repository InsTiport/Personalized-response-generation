 R. SODERLING/M. Granollers
  4-6, 7-6, 6-4, 7-5 
   
  Q. How was it for you today?   
 ROBIN SODERLING: It was tough (laughing). It was a really tough match. I guess I played a little bit better in my first match. I didn't really find any rhythm at all today, but I still won the match, which is very good.   
  
  Q. It looks like Federer is yet again the one to beat in this competition. What do you think is his strength and why?   
 ROBIN SODERLING: Yeah, he's always, every tournament he plays, he's the one to beat, I think. He's got a lot of strengths. He doesn't have any weaknesses at all. That's why I think he's so good. He handles every shot so well.   
  
  Q. What does Wimbledon mean to you?   
 ROBIN SODERLING: Every Grand Slam means a lot to me. Actually especially Wimbledon because I think this is where I had my first Grand Slam success a lot of years ago when I qualified and won two rounds in the main draw. So this may be my first good memory from a Grand Slam.   
  
  Q. Do you like the surface here?  
 ROBIN SODERLING: Yeah, it's okay. It's fun to play on grass a couple of weeks. I'm glad we don't play on grass the whole year, but for a couple of weeks, it's nice.
