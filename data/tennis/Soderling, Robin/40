R. SODERLING/G. Muller
  6-7, 7-5, 6-1, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. How did you feel after the French Open? You did so well in the first round here. 
 ROBIN SODERLING: It's always tough. This was my first match since Paris and my first match on grass, which is very different from the clay, so it was a little bit tough in the beginning. 
 But after a while, I think I managed to play better and better. After a while I think I kind of got into it. 

 Q. Everybody talks Federer is very strong. You obviously played against him. So what is the biggest point of how strong he is? Why?
 ROBIN SODERLING: Why? You know, he's a great player. I think he's so complete. He knows every shot. Serves well, forehand, backhand well, volleys well, moves well. 
 You know, that's why he's No. 1. That's why to me he's the best player in the history. Yeah, he's definitely strong. You're right about that.
