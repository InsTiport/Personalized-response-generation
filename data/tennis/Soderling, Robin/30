 J. DEL POTRO/R. Soderling
  6-7, 6-3, 7-6 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Took you a long time to break, until the third set, but looked like you were going to win. How disappointing is it you couldn't finish the match from that?  
 ROBIN SODERLING: I think it's pretty obvious losing 7-6 in the third in the semifinals here, it's pretty disappointing.   
 You know, it was a very tough match. We played okay, I think. Maybe I could have played a little bit better in the important moments and take advantage of my chances. But overall, you know, not much I could do.   
 I don't think I did anything wrong at the end of the match; he just played a little bit better than me.   
  
  Q. You faced Davydenko and Del Potro the last two evenings. How do you see the final panning out now?  
 ROBIN SODERLING: It's an open match. I think it's going to be a tough match. I think it could go either way.   
  
  Q. What will you keep from this Masters? Confidence? Disappointment?   
 ROBIN SODERLING: From this match?   
  
  Q. The Masters, this competition.   
 ROBIN SODERLING: No, it's been okay. I think I started the tournament really well. I played two good matches. I kind of played a little bit worse the last two matches. But overall I think it was pretty good. I played against the best, and I won two matches, lost two matches, so it's not too bad.   
  
  Q. It's obvious mentally you're tougher, you're moving better. But technically do you feel there's a small detail you're doing better? What have you improved technically in the past months?  
 ROBIN SODERLING: I'm not sure. You'll have to ask my coach. I'm just playing.   
  
  Q. It's been a long time since a Swedish player came to this tournament, Magnus Norman, your trainer. We were forgetting about Swedish players. But how do you see this?  
 ROBIN SODERLING: You know, it's been good. It's tough to sit here now, you know, thinking about this year. But it's been really good. I hope to improve even more for next year.
