  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. What are your thoughts so far on the event, the venue, how excited are you to get back out on court?
 IGA SWIATEK:   I'm really excited.  And actually, that's the first time after a Grand Slam that I'm not like exhausted, so I'm looking forward to my first match.
 I love the site.  I love that we can be outside a lot, and even though we're in a bubble, we can like spend time in the sun and just have fresh air.  So that's great.
 Yeah, I feel very good physically also, so I hope I'm going to play a good match tomorrow.
 Q. Several tournaments into the Melbourne Summer Series, this is the last tournament before you move on to the rest of the season.  Is there something specific you guys have took from the first few tournaments that you're working on now this last week?
 IGA SWIATEK:   Right now we're just working on details because I have only like few days between one tournament and another.  So we analyze what I did wrong during my last match against Simona and we have been working on that.  But there's no like pressure because I feel like I'm playing good tennis.  And, yeah, I mean, I am probably going to play a lot of tournaments this year, so I don't need to hurry and win right now.  I just want to enjoy being on court and we're basically working on some details.
 Q. How is the body?  How is the mind?
 IGA SWIATEK:   Actually, it's like surprisingly well, so I'm really happy about it.  Usually after Grand Slams I came back home to rest because I felt that like the Grand Slam is really intense time.  So that's the first time I'm playing a tournament right after and I feel like really well, so hopefully maybe I'm kind of growing up and right now I'm going to be ready to play week by week.
 Q. With a few days that you've had since playing in the Australian Open I'm wondering if your perspective on your tournament there as well as the match against Simona, if how you see it is different now than you saw it two hours after the match?
 IGA SWIATEK:   Well, basically after my match with Simona, I was like really mad at myself because I felt like I made like a lot of mistakes and unforced errors in the second and third set.  But after analyzing, and actually when I went to the press conference on the match, it was like enough time for me to realize that she just played her best tennis.  And after analyzing I like confirmed to myself that it was like a really good match and that day I did the most of what I could do and we have been working since then on some details, as I said, like receive and placement of serve.
 But there is not like magic I can change because I feel like I played pretty good tennis in Melbourne and also right now.
 Q. So how would you characterize the start of your season, then?  Do you consider the first two tournaments a successful start of the season?  Do you consider it something else?  How would you phrase it?
 IGA SWIATEK:   I would say it's successful because I know how hard this pre-season was for me and how my situation changed and I didn't have a lot of like calm time during my pre-season, it was so hectic, and, yeah, knowing that I feel pretty happy with my performance.  Obviously after winning a Grand Slam you want more than first round, but I played against Simona, and as I said, I played my best tennis, so I'm happy.
 Q. Once you were out of the tournament did you continue to pay attention to what was going on there and if so, what is your reaction to Naomi winning the title?
 IGA SWIATEK:   So I watched a few matches, actually two matches live on Rod Laver after when I was waiting for doubles and then I watched a few games of Serena against her and I'm trying to analyze more when I'm watching tennis, not only have fun watching the ball going right and left.  So I'm also kind of learning tennis from that perspective.
 But I also watched finals and, yeah, I'm really happy that Naomi won.  I feel like she's pretty strong right now and that's like her place to be.  So it's great.
 Q. On the topic of watching tennis matches live, there's a lot of tennis fans who have never been to a tournament, they have never seen live professional tennis up close.  What do you see courtside, or not courtside, but sitting in the seats on Rod Laver that maybe you don't see sitting at home watching it on TV?
 IGA SWIATEK:   Things that I'm actually kind of learning to watch matches more carefully and I used to not see like many important things, but obviously you can see the difference between the pace sometimes and how the ball is like coming up the racquet, because on TV it's really hard to see that.
 The whole atmosphere and like all the factors that players has that they have to deal with, yeah, I would say that.  But it's also different with audience and with fans.
 So if I was a tennis fan I would probably just, I don't know, wait until the pandemic is over and then it's a good time to see a match for the first time.
 Q. Obviously with winning Roland Garros and your ranking going up it's easy for us sometimes to forget that there are a lot of players that you have yet to play, that you haven't played yet.  So I'm curious, for you, who are the players that you haven't played yet that you are looking forward to playing for the first time?
 IGA SWIATEK:   Actually, I wish I could play against Garbine Muguruza.  I mean it would be a really tough match, but we played some practices and yeah, I just, I would like to know how things would look against her, because she's playing really solid game and she's playing, she can play fast, she can play top spin and slower and faster, so I would have to like adjust during the match.  That would be hard for me, but I would play against her.
 And against Serena, obviously, I mean if I win with Simona I would have a chance but I kind of wasted it, so hopefully I'm going to play her some day.
