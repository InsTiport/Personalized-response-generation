GUARACHI-KRAWCZYK/Melichar-Swiatek
7-6, 1-6, 6-4
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. Just talk about the doubles today.  Can you talk through that match a little bit.  Seemed like you got a little bit frustrated out there.  Is it going to be hard for you to put this loss behind you for tomorrow?
IGA SWIATEK:   Well, I don't think it's going to be hard because doubles is different story.  It's kind of like a different tournament actually.  I'm going to be okay on singles.
I tend to get a little bit more frustrated in doubles because I feel like I'm playing also for my partner.  It's some kind of new pressure for me because I'm not used to that.
Also, I felt like I had my chances and I miss it.  I wasn't really happy with my game like sometimes today because this match was really long.  I wasn't playing, like, the whole match bad, but I feel like I didn't use, like, every chance that I had.
So, yeah, basically that was the reason I got frustrated little bit.  But, yeah, I'm going to be okay on singles.  Singles is totally different story, so...
Q. I know you said that doubles is different.  Do you think having a competitive match today can maybe help you tomorrow?
IGA SWIATEK:   Yeah, I think so.  I mean, I said from the beginning that doubles really help me to stay in the rhythm.  Every day I have to wake up and I have a match in front of me.
Yeah, like mentally I'll be okay on singles because I'm preparing every day to play my best tennis.  I don't have days off, so I'm really staying in the rhythm.  I think this match on Saturday can be really long, so I think it's good that I played some points under pressure.
So, yeah...
Q. You work with a very young coach.  How is your relationship?  When and how did you begin to work together?
IGA SWIATEK:   We working together since 2016.  It's, like, long way.  And, yeah, he's pretty young, but he's also really ambitious.  He has a good eye.
Yeah, so I guess even though he's young, we are kind of learning together.  He's really supportive.  So, yeah, everything is going great, okay.
Q. When we spoke to you yesterday, we didn't know who you were going to play in the final.  What do you remember about playing Sofia in Paris?
IGA SWIATEK:   I remember that I wasn't really aware that she was playing good WTA ranking on this tournament because I just didn't look at the draw.  I actually didn't care who I'm playing with.  It was my first Grand Slam, so I was just enjoying the moment.
I remember I just played good tennis, but I don't remember a lot actually because it was four years ago.  But tomorrow is going to be totally different story, so...
Q. I think earlier in the tournament you said had you made the final in Roland Garros last year that you would not have been ready for it, it would have been completely overwhelming for you.  Do you feel like you're ready for tomorrow?
IGA SWIATEK:   Yeah, I mean, I feel like I'm ready.  I also feel like I don't have to win.  I'm pretty okay with both scenarios.  Of course it's going to be sad because I would be so close if I'm going to lose.
I'm just going to focus like it's another match.  I feel like the pressure isn't on me.  So, yeah, right now I'm just enjoying that I have like a great run in singles.  Yeah, I think if I'm going to win, it's going to be crazy and super overwhelming for me.
But as I said yesterday, even though there's, like, chaos around me, when I'm coming on court, I feel like my mind is really clear.  I can just focus on playing, going back to basics.
Yeah, I'm going to be okay no matter what.
Q. Most of the slam titles over the last two years have been won by very young players.  Do you take any inspiration from that?  Watching the likes of Naomi and Sofia and Ash Barty, has that made you think that you don't necessarily have to have a lot of experience to be winning these titles?
IGA SWIATEK:   Yeah, that's true.  But I also know that all these titles, like the young girls played against experienced players.  They were kind of underdogs.  Right now I'm playing with Sofia.  She's, like, 21, right?  Or 22?
Yeah, I feel like we both going to play with no pressure and we're just going to show our best tennis.  So, yeah...
