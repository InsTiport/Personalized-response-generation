MELICHAR-SWIATEK/Muhammad-Pegula
6-3, 6-4
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. What has the week been like for you to kind of have to balance both singles and doubles?  How happy are you to get the win today and still be alive in both competitions?
IGA SWIATEK:   It's amazing for me.  I never would have thought that I'm gonna be in semifinal in singles and doubles, so it's kind of crazy, because I had to play a match every day.
But it's good for me, because I'm still in the rhythm.  Also, doubles really, I think it's helping my performance in singles also because I'm, like, learning new stuff and I've never had a chance to play doubles with such experienced player.  It's amazing for me, and I'm really happy.
Well, the only tough thing about that is that I'm getting tired.  But still I have, like, one day to recover before tomorrow, so I'm gonna be ready.
Q. Yesterday you asked if Rafa still play after you.  Did you watch his game and is he your favorite player?
IGA SWIATEK:   Actually I watched, I don't know, 20 minutes but we didn't have time because we need to rest.  Yeah, he's my favorite player.  He was the only player I watched when I was younger.
So, yeah, I really like him.  Yeah, I just wish him the best and I hope he's gonna get another French Open this year.
Q. Once you say your favorite meal is watermelon, and I'm wondering here in Paris are you able to find and eat that?
IGA SWIATEK:   What?  Sorry?
Q. Watermelon, once you say is favorite meal.
IGA SWIATEK:   Oh, yeah, actually I'm eating a lot of watermelon here and also mango because fruits here are the best, like, every year.  Yeah, I'm eating a lot.  I just took it to go, actually.  So good timing.
Q. Sort of similar to a prior question.  A lot of people worry about a singles player deep in the draw playing doubles.  You have gotten through in straight sets pretty much.  Can you tell me not the negatives but the positives, what are some of the more specific ways that you feel the doubles is helping you, keeping you loose, I guess, and then maybe working on some shots that you wouldn't have a chance to work on?
IGA SWIATEK:   Well, basically I'm playing a lot of volleys, and I'm always being aggressive because we are like power players, me and Nicole, so we are always going forward.  Also, I get a chance to practice approaches, so it's pretty nice.
But also I'm just getting more experience in tactics in doubles, and I have never had a chance.  So I'm just developing as a player, I guess.  And also, as I said before, I like that I get to keep my routines every day the same.  So I don't mind that I don't have days off.  Yeah.
Q. How did you and Nicole pair up?
IGA SWIATEK:   So I guess her partner didn't get visa to Europe, so she just texted my team.  So, yeah, basically she approach me, which was amazing for me, because I never would have thought that a player like that would text me.
I guess she really liked how I played in Western & Southern, because we played against each other.  That's why, basically.
Q. What will be your program this afternoon and tomorrow morning?  When will you speak of strategy with your coach?
IGA SWIATEK:   We're going to talk tomorrow, for sure, in the morning.  Right now I'm just gonna do whole recovery.  So I'm going to do stretching and work with the physio.
I'm gonna probably sleep more, because I didn't get to sleep yesterday.  It was pretty tough to sleep.  So I'm gonna just rest and stay in the hotel.
Tomorrow morning we're just gonna do quick warmup, like, 25 minutes, and I'm gonna talk with my coach and psychologist about the match.  I'm gonna be ready (smiling).
