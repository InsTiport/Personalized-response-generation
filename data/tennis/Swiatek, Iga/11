I. SWIATEK/Q. Wang
6-3, 6-0
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. I was watching you last year at Wimbledon girls' singles, and I honestly didn't picture it happening this fast for you.  Would you say the same?  Did you expect to be here so quickly at this level, your game doing so well against the professional girls?
IGA SWIATEK: Well, I didn't know what's going to happen.  And I felt confident in juniors, but I only played ITF's in the pro past.  So I didn't know if it's going to be -- if I'm going to go there fast or need some time.  But I'm really happy that everything is working out.
And, yeah, obviously when I was playing here last years juniors, I didn't know that I'm going to play in main draw and be in third round.  So it's amazing and I'm really happy.
Q. You have a wide open section of the draw.  Now that you have got a couple of wins under your belt, are you excited about what potentially can happen?  What are your expectations for the rest of this tournament?
IGA SWIATEK: Actually I don't have any, and that's kind of cool because I'm not stressed or anything.  I don't expect to win because I'm, like, new here.  So I don't even know who I'm playing next.  I'm not prepared.  So we'll just see.
And I hope I'll play my best tennis.  Even if I lose, I just want to feel good on court and show my best.
Q. And about your game, what would you say it is about your game that has enabled you to make this transition from the juniors to the WTA level?
IGA SWIATEK: I don't know if it's about game.  Maybe more about the confidence or the peace of mind sometimes and being able to focus.
And just I think going from juniors to senior, I guess I wasn't that stressed.  I just felt that I knew here I don't have to win anything, so that's why I could play my best.
And it was quite, like, normal to me just to go to another level.  I've done that all my life, so why would that be different.
