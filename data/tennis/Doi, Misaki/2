THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
   
 Q. Just about today's singles match, how tough was that for you?  
MISAKI DOI: Yeah. I mean, I tried to be aggressive, like make her run, but her defense was very good.   
It was very difficult match for me.  
   
 Q. Nonetheless, you're the first Japanese player in the ladies draw to get to this round for ten years, since Ai Sugiyama. That's an achievement for Japanese tennis, right?   
MISAKI DOI: Yeah, I think so. It's a very good thing for Japanese tennis, yeah.   
   
 Q. Where do you think Japanese tennis is at at the moment for yourself and Kei Nishikori? Do you think tennis is in a good place right now?  
MISAKI DOI: Yeah, I think so. A few more young players like Osaka or other good players there, so I think it's good. Yeah.   
   
 Q. Did you get to hear about Kei's match today?  
MISAKI DOI: No. I didn't see it because I played doubles. I have no chance to see that match.  
   
 Q. He suffered an injury.   
MISAKI DOI: Yeah, yeah.   
   
 Q. Finally, what are your plans now for the coming weeks?  
MISAKI DOI: After this tournament?   
   
 Q. Yeah.   
MISAKI DOI: I just go back to Japan and then relax there a little bit. Then I go to U.S., Stanford and Montreal and I gonna play Rio, mixed.  
   
 Q. Is that something that's a very big priority for you to play in the Olympics?  
MISAKI DOI: Yeah, very big. I mean, for a (indiscernible), so it's big, like a dream. I'm very looking forward to play there.
