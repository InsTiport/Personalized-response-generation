THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. I'd like your opinion about the bubble here in France and how you feel in it and how you compare it to the US Open.
MISAKI DOI:   Well, I don't feel much different.  Of course sometimes it's raining, and then it's very cold, so I feel maybe a little bit tight.  But for me it's not because of the ball, so I still like it.
Q. I was also curious about your feelings about the restrictions and the bubble here in Paris and how different it is.
MISAKI DOI:   Bubble.  I think, this is just my opinion, but US Open was a little bit better, but still -- I don't know.  Like they do PCR test every five days or we have some distance and we have to put the mask on except practice or fitness, this kind of thing.
So it's a little bit tough on the players, but I'm happy to be on the court and I can play some tournament.  This is great thing, so yeah, I'm happy with that.
Q. Why was New York better?
MISAKI DOI:   Which part?  Oh, because the big thing, no spectator in US Open.  Also like no, less more people I think and more distance.  For example, at the hotel, US Open just player, coach, and then for the tournament.  But Roland Garros some more people in the hotel.  So like these things a little bit different, I think.
