 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Can I just ask what you thought of Bethanie's outfit today, the jacket with the tennis balls on it? 
 MISAKI DOI: (Through translation.) I was surprised. 

 Q. Would you ever consider wearing something like that on the tennis court?
 MISAKI DOI: (Through translation.) I don't think I am suitable for that costume. 

 Q. Was that the best win of your career?
 MISAKI DOI: (Through translation.) Yes. 

 Q. First time you've played at Wimbledon; were you nervous? 
 MISAKI DOI: I was really nervous today. 

 Q. You were leading in the second set and in the third set and was broken back. Did you think then that you had lost, that she wouldn't be able to go on and win at that point? 
 MISAKI DOI: (Through translation.) I'm a challenger, so I think I should be aggressive to beat her. 
 In second set, she was really aggressive when I lead. 

 Q. This year, is this the first time you've played on grass?
 MISAKI DOI: (Through translation.) I played when I was a junior here, Birmingham.

 Q. Li Na being the first Asian Grand Slam winner, has that been an inspiration to you? 
 MISAKI DOI: (Through translation.) There was no Asian Grand Slam champion ever, so I feel I can do. 

 Q. Have you spoken to Li Na at all for advice?
 MISAKI DOI: No. 

 Q. Kimiko, has she spoken to her? 
 MISAKI DOI: (Through translation.) No.

 Q. Do you know anything about Zheng Jie? 
 MISAKI DOI: (Through translation.) This is first time. I never play before.
