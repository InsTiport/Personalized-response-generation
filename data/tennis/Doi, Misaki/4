 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. I guess you're pretty happy to be in the third round. How much have you been inspired by Kimiko?   
 MISAKI DOI: (Through translation.) Coming from the same country, Japan, obviously I've been inspired a lot from her, from Date.  
  
  Q. Did you have the chance to watch her match yesterday?   
 MISAKI DOI: No, I haven't seen the match.
