  7‑6, 6‑3, 6‑3 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Would you talk about the first set.   You kind of had to work your way into the match a little bit.   
GAÃL MONFILS:   Yeah, I mean, I think Marinko had a tough first four games, and then he get into it.   Then it was really windy.   It was really hard to handle it.   
I think at one stage we just tried to put the ball in and see what happen.   Obviously I was a bit better than him in the breaker.   Then I think I played a little bit better, maybe made less mistake, and then it was easier.  
   
 Q.   Were you surprised by the way he came back after you took that 4‑0 lead?  
GAÃL MONFILS:   Not really.   I think because he put the ball in, and then I think I played like very short.   
   
 Q.   How is your ankle?   
GAÃL MONFILS:   It was fine.  
   
 Q.   It was just your shoe?   
GAÃL MONFILS:   Yeah.   I mean, the back of my shoe like rip up a bit.   Then I had to change it.   
   
 Q.   The player who was in here before you, Marion Bartoli, has had some problems with the French Federation.   They're saying even though she's the top‑ranked French player, they won't let her play the Olympics because of lack of Fed Cup participation.   As one of the top French male players, would you support her getting exemption to the Olympics?  
GAÃL MONFILS:   You know, I don't think I'm the person to ask.   I really like Marion and everyone.   I mean, I'm just looking NBA and then tennis.   Actually I'm so bad.   I can't help you on that.   
   
 Q.   Did you have any problem with the heat today?   
GAÃL MONFILS:   I mean, everyone told me, but no.   With the wind ‑‑ I mean, actually, warmer.   I like when it's really warm.   But today was cool.   
   
 Q.   Do you think in general when you come down to the Open you have the mindset it's going to be hotter down here and you're trained for that?   
GAÃL MONFILS:   I mean, yeah.   Heat for me is nothing, you know.   I'm from the Caribbean.   Most of the time I'm out there in November, it's very hot.   
I've been in Barbados, which is hot.   With the wind today, it seems like it was 20 degrees.   That's it.   
   
 Q.   How much of a goal are the Olympics for you this year?   I know grass isn't your best surface.   
GAÃL MONFILS:   Well, I mean, it's definitely something I want be part of.   We never know.   Even we are four spot for the French male.   I want to be part of this history.   I will work to be in the team.   Then, yeah, it's in the grass, so I will do my best and see.   
   
 Q.   Do you want to play just singles or play doubles?   Have you thought about that?  
GAÃL MONFILS:   More I can play for my country, I mean, more happy I be.   I be so happy and proud if I can play doubles, as well.
