  6‑2, 7‑5, 5‑7, 1‑6, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions. 

Q.   It was a pretty incredible match.   Can you talk about the first two sets and how you were feeling?
GAÃL MONFILS:   Which one? 

Q.   The first two sets, you had some injury problems. 
GAÃL MONFILS:   Yeah. 

Q.   Can you talk a little bit about the injury. 
GAÃL MONFILS:   I had a sore back, and then that's it.

Q.   In the third and fourth sets, how did you come back?   Did the trainer help you?
GAÃL MONFILS:   Yes, the trainer help.   I get warm a little bit.   I get nervous.   I think mentally I was a bit tougher than him at that time and then we have a new match. 

Q.   The fifth set, the momentum shifted back and forth.   What were you thinking when he broke you back?
GAÃL MONFILS:   I mean, to be honest, I was lucky to be in the fifth.   I was serving like 120, 130, a couple time maybe 200.   But my second serve was 100. 
You know, you just play.   Was like fun for me. 

Q.   After the last game when the interruption came with the ball on the court, that must have had an effect on you. 
GAÃL MONFILS:   I was just poor.   Two double‑fault.   That's it.

Q.   This is the second straight Grand Slam where you had a crazy five‑setter that you wound up losing.   It was very entertaining.   How much do you enjoy the show of it?
GAÃL MONFILS:   This one was tough because, you know, I had the sore back.   But it was really cool.   For sure the crowd help me.   That's why I choose to keep going, because I could easily give up. 
But it was like a nice atmosphere.   I just try to luck in the match and fight, so it was cool.
