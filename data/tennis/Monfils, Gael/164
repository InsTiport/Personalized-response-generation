 Q.  Your thoughts about the game? 
 GAEL MONFILS:  I think he played very well, you know.  Before the match I knew it would be tough.  He was just stronger than me today. 
 Q.  And the way you played?  You played really good yesterday.  How do you think you played today? 
 GAEL MONFILS:  I think medium.  You know, I think he like my game and I made today little mistake, some easy, because his defense is unbelievable, you know.  He can get every ball, so it was very hard to make a winner. 
 So I play -- I think I play okay.  It was good. 
 Q.  Which do you think are the ways to stop Nadal?  He wins every match, leaving two or three games to the opponent.  Do you have the key? 
 GAEL MONFILS:  On the clay court it's tough because it's physical, he's very strong.  He get every ball.  And when you play a little bit slow, he can attack your serve.  To find a weakness, I don't know.  It's very hard.  I have to see again the match maybe. 
 But it's tough. 
 Q.  Is it extra hard because he's left-handed? 
 GAEL MONFILS:  Yeah, yeah.  Is very difficult because it's like when he is in defense and when you attack, you know, down the line, he made with his forehand a ball, you know, very up and is going down with the lefty.  So you can do nothing after and is very hard. 
 And his serve, you cannot very aggress him because with the spin, lefty spin, so it's very hard.  So it's very tough. 
 Yeah, I think is help him a little bit, yeah.
