 R. NADAL/G. Monfils
  6‑1, 6‑2, 6‑3 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How hard was it to keep fighting in that third set when you couldn't quite break his serve?  
GAEL MONFILS:   Well, it was not very hard.   You know, just keep fighting.   
You know, that's tennis.   That's always tough, you know.   Even when your opponent's playing very good, there are not many opportunities.   
But I think my spirit was to keep trying, so it wasn't hard.   
   
 Q.   Is this the best Nadal you've ever seen in the last years?  
GAEL MONFILS:   Definitely today was in great shape.   Much better than Doha, for sure.   
For me, yeah, I would say today was one of the best I haven't seen for a while.
