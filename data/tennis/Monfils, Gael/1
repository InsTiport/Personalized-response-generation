 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. What do you think your opponent was doing most effectively against you today?
 GAEL MONFILS:   I think he was just playing his game.  I've been practicing with him the last two weeks here with him.  Just was playing his game, not much more than what he's able to do today.  It was way enough to beat me today.
