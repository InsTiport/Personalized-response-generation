7-5, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  We saw you had a medical timeout during the match. So can you tell us what happened and how is your body feeling right now.  
GAEL MONFILS: It was tough for me to breathe today a little bit. It's a heavy condition here, so it was a little bit tough for me to get my breath back, so that's why I was a bit struggling. And I was worried about that and I talked to the doctor for help.   
 Q.  So what makes you feel you should continue finishing the match?  
GAEL MONFILS: Because it's the end of the season, so every match is very important. And I tried to fight with what I had today and obviously it was not enough, so I'm quite disappointed.   
 Q.  We know that you arrived in Zhuhai a few days before the tournament started here and you also took part in some activities here, including some community activities. So could you tell us about your understanding and your impression of this tournament here in Zhuhai. And second, could you talk about your next plans in the near future.  
GAEL MONFILS: I don't understand.   
 Q.  Could you talk about your plans for future matches.  
GAEL MONFILS: Okay. And before?   
 Q.  You arrived in Zhuhai a few days before the tournament kicked off and you took part in some activities, including some community activities, could you tell us about your understanding and impression of the tournament here in Zhuhai?  
GAEL MONFILS: I didn't understand that, so I don't know. But my plans is definitely to go to Beijing next week and play Shanghai after. I didn't understand that. Do you understand that?   
 Q.  What are your impressions of the tournament here in Zhuhai?  
GAEL MONFILS: To be honest I didn't see too much, but the city it looks very nice and actually with brand new buildings. I like it because I think it's kind of cool. And the facility here is amazing. I think the center court is very nice, needs more air, but it's a very nice structure. And the court, the outside court, it's great. So the facilities are very, very good.   
 Q.  Your girlfriend Elina Svitolina told us that you helped her a lot in tennis. Could you give us an example in detail?  
GAEL MONFILS: Well, we both help. I help her, she helps me. We have the knowledge to play tennis for ages, so we just give some tips, advice. And, yeah, pretty much some times we have some tennis talk, you know, it's easier for both of us to understand each other because we know exactly what we feel on the court, the situation. I mean, it's always easier to advise than to do it, so sometimes it's nice to have someone that would a hundred percent understand what you actually are doing on the court and what you are feeling, so I think that's why both we are helping each other.
