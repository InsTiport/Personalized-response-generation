6-3, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Your first experience playing at the O2.  How was that?  Do you think nerves played a part?  
GAEL MONFILS: It was okay.  I love it.  Big court with a great atmosphere.  I simply love it.  It's a big court, wide on the side, and super deep.   
But, no, it was fine.  It was fine.   
 Q.  Was there anything different you could have done?  
GAEL MONFILS: Yeah, definitely maybe have one more week of practice.  I came here with not even a week of practice.  I came here with three, four days for real practice.  Even when you're 100%, it's tough to beat those guys.  He's 4 in the world.  With three, four days' practice, it's really tough.   
I was really happy to lost with just a break in each set.   
 Q.  What do you expect from your second match?  It's against Dominic.  He played a great first part of the match.  
GAEL MONFILS: I play Dominic?   
 Q.  Yes.  
GAEL MONFILS: It's going to be a tough one.  As I say, not much time for me to recover.  To be honest, a bit sore.  I can feel it straightaway, so it's not a good sign.  It's a while I didn't play with pressure, I guess, in a tournament, with competition.   
I have a good recovery tonight and tomorrow.  But Dominic is a fantastic player.  He play from the baseline.  Maybe give me a bit more time than Milos.   
I don't know.  I see.  But I think I'm going to focus on my recovery.   
 Q.  If you had to give a percentage of how you feel physically, how would you say your shape is?  
GAEL MONFILS: Very good.  I mean, when I say 'very good', I don't know how to say in English, it's not a pain, but I just feel it.  That's even good.   
But honestly I won't say I'm like on my top physically because I can see after two, three run, I start pumping, my legs are getting heavier.  I saw myself way fitter.   
 Q.  You and Milos are carrying injuries.  I don't think he was able to really get into his running.  Did you think that would give you a chance?  Both of you were kind of the walking wounded.  
GAEL MONFILS: Yeah, I heard that.  But I'm telling you, this guy, he played very good today, like, with confidence.  When you hurt for more than two, three weeks, you not play like that, guarantee you.
