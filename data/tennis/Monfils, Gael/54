D. THIEM/G. Monfils
6-3, 1-6, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How would you assess that performance?
GAEL MONFILS: It was a tough one.  I think today was tough one.  Dominic was better than me.  I think I didn't play a great match, but I gave everything I had.
Q. How was your fitness out there?
GAEL MONFILS: Not my best.
Q. How was your mentality for the moment?
GAEL MONFILS: I give my best, as usual, fighting with everything I had.  That's the only matters when you step on the court.
Q. How are you going to prepare yourself for the next rounds?
GAEL MONFILS: Still the same thing.  Try to recover because obviously I'm not good enough to play back-to-back.  So hopefully, you know, I'll be much better.
