 Q. If I could ask, what was the nature of the injury? How did it happen?
 GAÃL MONFILS: I've got inflammation with my shoulder, my right shoulder. 

 Q. How does this settle with you coming here, Wimbledon, having to bow out? 
 GAÃL MONFILS: I mean, I know it's an injury because I've been an injury for long. I think now with more experience I'm sad, but still, I know it's the right decision. So I stay confident in my decision and I'm not worried about -- because I know it will be a couple weeks, but still will be good after.
