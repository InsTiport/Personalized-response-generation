 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Throughout the years you've created magic and atmosphere with the fans in Paris.  To go out on Suzanne Lenglen and have it be like it was, empty, how difficult was that for you today?
 GAEL MONFILS:   I have no words to say anything, to be honest.  Definitely was not a great one.  Was I think the worse one 100% for sure that I had.  But that's the condition.
