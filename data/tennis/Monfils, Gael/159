7-5, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions. 

 Q. A first victory. What do you say about? It?
 GAÃL MONFILS: I'm happy. Even more than that, it's my first victory in Monte-Carlo. I'm happy about the match. I didn't play too bad. 

 Q. How was your preparation on clay? Did you go to Spain? 
 GAÃL MONFILS: No. I don't remember what I did. Oh, I stayed a bit longer in Miami. I arrived late. I spent only one or two days in Valencia because I needed a break, and then I came here. 

 Q. For many players it's their first tournament on clay. You had more time to prepare. 
 GAÃL MONFILS: I came here earlier because I believed I had to play the quallies. 

 Q. How did you get used to the clay? 
 GAÃL MONFILS: Even before the Starace match, I had won another match, so I am more confident and I'm more used to the surface. 
 I'm happy also I was able to finish the match without any physical problems. 

 Q. Is that something you are afraid of? 
 GAÃL MONFILS: I do fear something might happen because I got hurt here last year. But I see that my body is resisting to practice, to matches, and apparently the change of surface didn't affect me this year. 

 Q. Is this something you feel? Are you afraid because of last year? 
 GAÃL MONFILS: Yes, I always feel that. But I had no pain since I changed surface, so I'm very happy about that. 

 Q. You served well during the match. You had only one breakpoint against you. 
 GAÃL MONFILS: Yes. Even before I was hurt, I was serving well. During the match, I didn't make any miracles, I just played with changes of rhythm and very far behind the baseline. 

 Q. Do you want to be more aggressive? 
 GAÃL MONFILS: Yes, I think it's better when I go to the net. Before I was hurt, I was going to the net often, especially in the French Open. But today I was thinking about other things. 

 Q. What does the No. 15 around your neck represent? 
 GAÃL MONFILS: It's my favorite number. It comes from my family, on my father's side. It's a sort of good luck charm. It's something with my father and my uncle Marius and another tennis player in Guadeloupe.
