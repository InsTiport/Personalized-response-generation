G. MONFILS/S. Johnson   
2-6, 7-6, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.   
 Q.  Could you describe exactly when the match changed in your favor.  
GAEL MONFILS: At 4-3 in the second set.  At that stage, I started putting the ball in the court.  I was able to move better.  I was able to make it more difficult for him.   
From then on, I was able to get some more opportunities and I was able to make him have some doubts.   
 Q.  What happened before that?  
GAEL MONFILS: Well, first I was not confident.  I had trouble moving.  When I came here, I felt little pains here and there.  It took me a long time in the match to start feeling better and more fluid.   
 Q.  The new generation is pushing the top 20 more and more.  Are you feeling it's more difficult to win matches because of the new generation now?  
GAEL MONFILS: I don't believe it's only the young people.  I believe the whole top 100 is extremely strong now.  No match is easy any more.  There's this new generation coming up, of course, but even someone who is only in the top 90 plays extremely well nowadays.  You have to be even more careful with these players.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
GAEL MONFILS: Well, today I was able to win the match.  Now, as soon as you're not 100%, matches become more difficult.   
 Q.  You are not part of the outgoing generation, your career is not over yet.  What do you think about the new French players coming up?  
GAEL MONFILS: I think Lucas Pouille is really the one who is the most promising player.  He's already top 20.  He's about to be even better than that.  Lucas for me is really the one.  He is the new generation.  He's already playing at a top level, and he's going to do even better.  Very soon we're going to see Lucas at the top.   
 Q.  Can you compare France with other countries like Canada with all the new, young players coming up?  
GAEL MONFILS: I don't really know about other countries.  I don't know.   
 Q.  Whenever you come here, you have the support of the crowd.  It's the same wherever you go, more or less.  Do you get used to this kind of support?  People were cheering for you more than your opponent.  How does that feel?  
GAEL MONFILS: It felt good.  In the beginning of the match, I was playing very poorly.  It helps a lot when the crowd supports you and pushes you.  Also it helped me relax.   
In the beginning of the match, I was not able to play at all.  The crowd gave me a lot of energy and encouraged me.  It was great.
