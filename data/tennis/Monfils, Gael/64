G. MONFILS/J. Sousa
6-3, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. Congratulations on your win last Sunday in Washington, D.C.  How do you find the conditions in Washington versus here in Toronto?
GAÃL MONFILS: Yeah, it's different conditions.  You know, I think the court is getting slower here.
It's for sure less humidity and a little bit colder.  Balls are flying more.  It's quite a big change, actually.
Q. You have actually been having a very consistent season, and your title in Washington was a reflection of that.  Is this confidence that you can keep building on for the rest of the season?
GAÃL MONFILS: I don't know.  I even ask myself this question.  I think I put good work with my team.  What I try to do is keep working with them, and then the result I see later.
Q. Obviously you're focused on yourself here, but you're probably aware by now that Roger Federer has essentially shut things down for the season and will not be competing in Rio.  Just wanted to get your kind of reaction.  Roger Federer will not be competing in Rio and his season is now coming to an end.
GAÃL MONFILS: Oh, yeah?  Why?
Q. Injury.
GAÃL MONFILS: Oh, yeah?
Q. What are your thoughts on that?
GAÃL MONFILS: Well, I'm sorry for him.  I just -- I'm sorry for him.  I don't know.  I haven't read, but I'm very sorry for him.
I love Roger, so obviously -- I just finished my match.  I have no idea.  I'm very sorry for him, that's for sure.
Q. Obviously he had the meniscus tear, and I don't know what else.  I know you have had a lot of knee injuries, as well.  Can you talk a little bit about the rehab process?  You know, why is the knee a tricky injury for a tennis player?
GAÃL MONFILS: For Roger, I don't know.  But for myself I know I had this growing up fast.  I think I grow very fast.  We all have these -- well, quite a lot athletes.
And then, for sure, for us, we use our knee very, very, very much.  Every surface, every court, you know.  So for me it was tough to balance, you know, my power between my hamstring and my quadriceps and even my calf, you know, to have enough support for my knees.
So it's something -- it's a daily treatment, I would say.  Sometime, yeah, it takes long to feel 100%.
Q. Just to go back to Roger for a second, with him out for the rest of the season, though, and at Wimbledon we saw Djokovic go out early in the draw so some of the younger players like Raonic made it all the way to the finals.  With some of these players either out or showing they have some weaknesses, does it open up tournaments for players like that that are up in the top 20 and looking for still their big, big wins?
GAÃL MONFILS: Well, to be honest, I don't really look at that.  You know, I think I more look at myself, what I can achieve.
I think when I'm in my top and with consistency I can beat quite a lot of players in the top.  So the only thing is honestly you like to win with the best in the draw, no matter what.  I mean, for me, you know.
And when I hear that, I'm sorry for Rog, you know, because even though an adversary but he's someone that I really like.
You know, I think everybody is working hard no matter what.  You play Novak or you play someone else, you know, it's tough now, you know.  It's very tough.
Q. Could you talk a little bit about working with Mikael this season and what he's added to your game or to your mentality?
GAÃL MONFILS: You know, I'm quite quiet on this.  I just say that I have good work with him.  He's changing for sure a lot of stuff, as you can see.  What, I won't tell you, and how, I won't tell you either.
Q. Everyone wants to know the secret of success.
GAÃL MONFILS: Well, I have no success yet.
