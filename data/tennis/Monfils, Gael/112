A. MONTANES/G. Monfils
  6‑2, 2‑6, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French. 

Q.   You had a diesel start.   The last two sets were good. 
GAÃL MONFILS:   I was not good at all for the first set.   I had trouble getting my legs going.   I was slow.

Q.   Was it because you're back in France, because you were away for a long time?   What made you tense?
GAÃL MONFILS:   I was not tense.   I was tired.   I was not able to run properly. 

Q.   When did you arrive?
GAÃL MONFILS:   Saturday night.   It's not easy. 

Q.   During the last two sets you were hitting good shots and serving well.   We thought you could make it.   Why didn't you win? 
GAÃL MONFILS:   I don't know.   If I knew I would have won.   If I had the key as to why I lost, I wouldn't have lost.   I'm just pissed off. 

Q.   What is most frustrating?
GAÃL MONFILS:   Losing.   Defeat is the most frustrating thing. 

Q.   Maybe this is the part of the process you have to go through. 
GAÃL MONFILS:   Nobody said you should lose to become a good player.   Some come back and win immediately.   I'm pissed off. 
Losing first round is bad.   But I'm not worried.   If I'm not winning, I just have to work more. 

Q.   What is your schedule?
GAÃL MONFILS:   I don't know.   Work, work, work starting tomorrow. 

Q.   How about your relationship with Eric?
GAÃL MONFILS:   It's good. 

Q.   Did both of you set a deadline for you two?
GAÃL MONFILS:   I answered that question several times.   There was even a press release about this. 
This is dealt with specifically by the French Tennis Federation.   I am not all the time with Eric.   It's already very nice from the Federation to give me this opportunity. 

Q.   It's tough?
GAÃL MONFILS:   Super tough. 

Q.   What do you want to do right now?   Go and play a soccer match or what?
GAÃL MONFILS:   I want to go back to work.   I prepared well for this tournament.   It's really bad that I lost this first round.   I'm pissed off. 
Of course, I've been through that kind of thing already.   But still pissed off. 

Q.   This match can be encouraging because there were good parts of the match.   You did good things. 
GAÃL MONFILS:   Nothing is positive in that match.   The only thing I want is to win.   There's nothing else to build up your confidence than winning.   I don't care if I play well or bad, I want to win. 

Q.   But do you have fun on the court or not?
GAÃL MONFILS:   A bit of both.   Maybe I prepared too well and I no longer have that little crazy side of me on the court anymore. 

Q.   You seemed very controlled on the court today.   Maybe you're working on this too hard. 
GAÃL MONFILS:   No.   Eric tells me to focus on the simple things, which I try to do.   The question is, is it good for me.   Maybe if I have more fun, it will help me win.   Who knows. 

Q.   You want to set the court on fire?
GAÃL MONFILS:   Yes, exactly that.   I would like to have an answer to this.   For the time being, I just have to work. 

Q.   What did he have that you didn't have today?   Maybe confidence? 
GAÃL MONFILS:   I don't know.   You should ask my coach.   A coach knows that kind of thing.   I was hitting harder, serving better, and he wins.
