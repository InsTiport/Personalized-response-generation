  Q.  Well played, Gael.   
 GAEL MONFILS:  Thank you.   
  Q.  What was the difference between this match and the match in Lyon where he beat you?   
 GAEL MONFILS:  The surface, first, the court.  It was an indoor.  Now, outdoor clay court.  I think now I know how he played.  I knew before the match it will be no more easy to return his serve.  So then after, I made a strategy with my coach to play against him.   
 And the difference, it was I think I was maybe more fresh today than him.  I make not many mistake and just play well, so I think that is why I won today.   
  Q.  The court was faster?   
 GAEL MONFILS:  Not really, I think.   
  Q.  Do you think he was affected by an injury?   
 GAEL MONFILS:  You know, the thing is maybe ask the trainer, but he continued to play the game.  So, for me, you know, it was I don't know exactly because you see in 5-2 second set he break me again.  He start to push the ball and run, so it was very hard to know if he was very injury or not.   
 So maybe yes, I think so.  But, you know, you have to stay focused on the match.   
  Q.  What about you, I saw you rolling your ankle?   
 GAEL MONFILS:  Yeah, I twist a little bit, but it was a bad move.   
  Q.  It's okay?   
 GAEL MONFILS:  Yeah, no, it's fine.
