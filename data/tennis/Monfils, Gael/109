THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Congratulations on a great tournament.   
GAÃL MONFILS:   Thank you.   
   
 Q.   You managed to get back into the match.   What do you think made the difference in the end?  
GAÃL MONFILS:   Well, plays tough.   First of all, I think I start very slow, the match.   But also I think Rafa put pressure on me like from the first point.   So it was very aggressive, actually, like first game, and then was tougher, you know, for me to adjust.  
Actually, you know, I thought like the fourth/fifth game was very tough, because actually this week he didn't play like this in the beginning, so he was tough, you know.   I just see like a strong Rafa on his baseline, hitting very hard the ball deep.   And is not that I was surprised but it was tough.   You know, he was really tough.   
So then I just start to hang around a little bit and just wait for the second set to be my turn, like, you know, I knew I would try to serve first.   I think I managed to have like 15 more on my first serve.   You know, I think I was 210 to 211, you know, I try to play like with more power and stronger, so make him feel that I'm not done with him, or I mean, he's not done with me, and I accept the challenge.  
So then it was a battle, you know.   Then I think I had the opportunity to close earlier the second set, and then I think I had a bit luck, because in the breaker was very close.   I have a good shot.   It was okay.   
Then I think I had first opportunity in the third set, and I didn't make it, because I think it was ‑‑I don't know.   I did not take the opportunity at 1‑All, Love‑30.   Had a good rally, you know, and I remember that I say to myself, I need to hit this forehand, actually, because we have been in backhand, forehand, backhand, forehand, and then he goes to my backhand again.   
Then I went, Okay, I'm going again.   I had this short forehand, I think.   I guess I just was a bit too nervous maybe.  
Then at the end of the point I just had very bad forehand in the net.   I think that was the first turn of the match, because that was the opportunity to actually put him Love‑40 and maybe chance for the break.  
Then I have others, because I had twice Love‑15, and I knew that he would slice it, and I couldn't target my return, my backhand return today.  
That laid me down a lot today.   Then I had those Love‑40 to get back actually in the fourth, and he made a decent passing shot, actually.   I came forward, and good passing shot backhand cross, and then also I think I could be a bit more aggressive, you know, a little bit.   
Then at the end, it's still Rafa.   Rafa is strong, hitting hard the ball.   It's always tough to play against him, and at the end he was a bit better than me today.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel confident going to Australia after a week like this?  
GAÃL MONFILS:   Yeah.   I had I had a good week.   But still, you know, I need to work hard still, you know.   It's not that easy I think to keep a good game like this.   You know, you need to work every day.  
So I have a week, so I have to decide what I gonna do.   But still work hard, and then I be confident the first day in Australia.
