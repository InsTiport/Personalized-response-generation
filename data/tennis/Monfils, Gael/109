  6‑3, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Very well played, GaÃ«l. 
GAÃL MONFILS:   Thank you.

Q.   You played so well.   You have not had a close match yet.   Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
GAÃL MONFILS:   Well, I think maybe both.   I think it's good because it mean that I am in shape, and I am playing very good and actually I can keep the level through all the match.
And it's bad because for sure tomorrow I think is going to be tighter.   Actually, I haven't been in that position, so for sure it's going to be interesting to see.

Q.   What is causing your good form?   Is it because you're now injury‑free or motivated or both or other things?
GAÃL MONFILS:   Well, I have always been motivated, but it's a good point to say that I feel my body great.   It has been a while, you know, that, you know, as you say, I'm injury‑free and I can move and recover good.
I think I have done a good job this year   even had a longer period without playing, but as I said, when I had the problem with my knee I work hard all my other part of body and definitely the knee, but I felt much better last year.   Then I start to feel much better this year, so hopefully it gonna be going like this for all the season.

Q.   You were just talking about good things and bad things.   Is it a good thing or a bad thing that you're playing without a coach at the moment?   You have always been a free spirit.   Does it allow you to express yourself a little bit more?
GAÃL MONFILS:   Well, even, you know, when you have coach, you are not playing for him.   You just express yourself.   But same, I think it's positive way and negative way, you know.   It's for sure positive way because it make me do the thing on my own and also try to build every day like motivation, strong motivation, and believe that I can beat the top player.
You know, every day is not that easy every day sometime to run, do the gym, and go on the court, but actually I have to do it.   So give me more maturity. 
Then I think it's negative because sometime it's not that easy.   You know, sometimes I feel lonely.   Just like I'm doing all my stuff all alone.   So that is tough.   Sometimes to debrief, actually I'm just watching sometime some videos alone.   That's tougher, and, you know, it's always nice to share like tactic, to share like ‑‑actually, I have no one to tell me before the match, you know, some tips and everything, so this is tougher.

Q.   Where did you do your offseason work?   Because you come here and you're firing on four cylinders. 
GAÃL MONFILS:   Well, I have done a bit in Los Angeles and a bit, I do a week in just a bit outside Paris, and then I did the rest at home in Geneva. 
Well, I think I had a great one.   I think it was great.   You know, I had a couple of people who helped me.   So actually, I was happy with that, and I guess it was not a bad job with them.

Q.   Who were they?
GAÃL MONFILS:   I work with Rory Cordial.   It's the former physio fitness coach of James Blake.   I work a bit with him in the States.   I work with Gerald Bremond just outside in Paris with Tennis Sarcelles.   And then actually I work with my home, at home, I just work alone and I have a few sparring partners.

Q.   Two times that you beat Rafa were here, been in the finals two times.   Is there something about playing here that particularly suits you?
GAÃL MONFILS:   Yeah, definitely.   I like the condition, you know.   I think I like the balls, the court.   I think the court is fast, but still I can manage to run and to cover good the court.
I like play nighttime actually, I would say, because I always play night.   So is great.
Actually, I just like the atmosphere, you know.   I think it's nice, and there is a lot of French persons here.   I feel like it's a bit like playing in France, so it's better for me. 

Q.   A lot of players obviously start a new year with kind of renewed optimism, GaÃ«l.   How are you feeling coming into 2014 in general?   Are you looking forward to what you can achieve this year?
GAÃL MONFILS:   Well, for sure I have a couple of high goals in mind, you know.   Then, you know, just trying to manage to do it, actually. 
But, you know, for this year I'm just also try to be myself and don't give up, you know, any matches.   You know, when you're happy I think you have like positive stuff happen, so, you know, I try to just be happy and don't even think about any negative stuff.
