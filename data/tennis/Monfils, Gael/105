P. CARRENO BUSTA/G. Monfils
  6‑3, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French, please. 

Q.   Your feeling right now is you were up against a wall?   What bothered you in his game? 
GAÃL MONFILS:   He has a typical game of a clay‑courter.   What bothered me is that I have not spent enough hours on clay yet.   I wanted to come here earlier, but I couldn't do that. 
It's just the beginning of the season, and there are some shots I couldn't find.   He was better than I was today. 

Q.   You seem frustrated. 
GAÃL MONFILS:   Well, every year I come here I always lose against the same player.   They're good baseliners.   They have no particular strong shot and they often come from the quallies. 
It was MontaÃ±Ã©s last year.   This year it's him.   It's always like that.   They play solid and I get bogged down into their game. 
I am frustrated. 

Q.   How do you explain that? 
GAÃL MONFILS:   Because they are more ready than I am.   He played well today.

Q.   What are you going to do next?
GAÃL MONFILS:   I'm going Bucharest.

Q.   So for you it will all come back to more hours on clay? 
GAÃL MONFILS:   Well, I'm coming back from an injury, my ankle.   Things just don't come together like that.   I must make some adjustments.   I have a week now to work on all that and also to work physically. 
It is just the beginning of the claycourt season.   It's the time for preparation.   It's fine if I can win good matches, but the goal is to be fit for the French Open. 

Q.   Was it also frustrating because you were very close?
GAÃL MONFILS:   Well, he had that first set.   I had some opportunities in the tiebreaker, but I made bad choices.   I need some more adjustments to my game.   That dropshot, for example, was not a good idea. 
But it's good for me to play against those players because, no doubt, I'm going to play them in the first rounds of the French Open.
