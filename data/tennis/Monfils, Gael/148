 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. You're on the American Express billboard. Unusual they highlight a foreign-born player. They see you as an entertainer as well as a great athlete. Do you see yourself as an entertainer?   
 GAÃL MONFILS: Yes, I think, yeah. I was quite surprised also when they asked me to did that thing for them.   
 But I think I not the only one, because I saw Caroline Wozniacki. I did also with Sam Querrey.   
 We had something. I mean, I think they try to show like the young person, the young gun coming out. Actually we here for a couple years.   
 But, yeah, I think it's good for the image. Yeah, I like doing this. So it was fun.
