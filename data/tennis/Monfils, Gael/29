S. TSITSIPAS/G. Monfils   
4-6, 7-6, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What was the difference between winning and losing this evening?  
GAEL MONFILS: Well, there's a winner and a loser.  I'm the loser today.  He's the winner.  That's the big difference.   
In term of the game, I guess I had some opportunities.  I couldn't made them great today.  I think I was up a break, and I didn't serve that good starting the second set.  It was big confirmation when he broke me back.  Less first serve, less accuracy.   
Then I think I got those opportunities in the third set.  I think the forehand that I missed at the breakpoint, I could have to make it.  I have to make it.  I have to be able to make it.  I have to pick the better target.  I think I should go outside in.  Definitely easier after.   
Apparently I think the ball also was out.  It was tough for me to call it.  Maybe to have more guts to call for the challenge.   
 Q.  How difficult is he to play?  
GAEL MONFILS: He's a great player.  He just broke the top 10.  He's one of the best player in the tour.   
 Q.  Is this a match where perhaps you felt like you were the better player throughout but somehow you lost it?  
GAEL MONFILS: I don't know if I was better or not.  Just going to keep, like, the positive side.  Some negative side is a few points, a few choice.  I need to be better, that's it.  I need to be better to win those big matches.  That's what I'm doing so far.   
 Q.  What do you think are the biggest takeaways from these few tournaments this month?  
GAEL MONFILS: I don't really think about that.  I have a couple wins.  I like to keep working, keep believing that what we doing with the team is good, try to go.   
 Q.  The ITF and the ATP is headed towards two separate...  
GAEL MONFILS: That's tough.  I just lose 7-6 in the third.  That's not a question I want.  Thank you.   
 Q.  Are you leaving right away to Indian Wells or you don't know yet?  
GAEL MONFILS: Yeah, maybe.  Honestly, I just come off the court.  I have no idea honestly.   
 Q.  How is your body feeling?  
GAEL MONFILS: I'm tired.  I'm tired.  Obviously disappointed.  I need few minutes to get back.
