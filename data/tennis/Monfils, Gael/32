G. MONFILS/S. Querrey
5-7, 6-4, 6-4, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You timed this press conference perfectly, at the halftime.  How annoying was it to be scheduled at the same time as the match (referring to the World Cup)?
GAEL MONFILS: I knew it.  At the end you have to think about you first.  My first question when I go out to the court is, What was the score?  It was 0-0.  I tried to rush.
I was lucky enough to see Raphael Varane score.  Perfect so far.
Q. Can you describe what your injuries were during the match and how you overcame them.
GAEL MONFILS: I think I went to the opposite direction.  It was not the stretch who hurt me.  I felt on it.  I felt my groin was super tight.  It's hard to describe.  It was, like, something was tight, and I couldn't release it myself.
The physio just, you know, press on it and stretch it.  It finally popped a little bit and release.
I ask him, like, Could I go for it?
He say I should be fine.
I think it took me a couple points just to feel right, just move on with that.
Q. It was just one episode?
GAEL MONFILS: Yeah, it was one episode.  I think when I come, Sam served good as he did, then it was time for me just to have confidence on my movement.  But it was okay.
Q. How do you think you came back to win this match?
GAEL MONFILS: I think I was playing good.  Just had a bad service game at 5-6.  Hit three forehand in a row.  I was timing good the ball, I think.  He was serving big at the beginning, so it was tough for me to read his serve.
I knew I just have to wait a little bit, as I say, be patient, I will for surely have opportunity on his serve.  Just take them and keep going what I'm doing with my serve.  That was the key.
Q. Will France win the World Cup?  Will Monfils win Wimbledon?
GAEL MONFILS: We try to go win this match I think step by step.  Me, I'm very far of winning anything now.
Q. This is your 10th appearance here, into the fourth round for the first time.  Did you get the sense that it had been that long?
GAEL MONFILS: No, it was for sure long.  But, you know, I think it took me years and years.  Also had to put myself in a good opportunity, to put myself in a good balance with my body and my believe on a grass court.  Then, as I say, the last three years were much better.  I just couldn't I think take the opportunity.
Today I took it and I'm happy about it.
Q. Marion Bartoli has criticized your work ethic when it comes to Grand Slams.  Is that a bit unfair?
GAEL MONFILS: You know, it's easy to criticize people when you don't know them.  So I won't even pay any attention about it.
Q. You play Kevin Anderson next.  You played him five times, beaten him all five times, but never played him on grass.  How would you describe what it's like to play him?  How do you think it might be on grass?
GAEL MONFILS: Big serve again.  Big serve.  He's going for it.  He's a type of guy who never really likes to rally.  He want shorter the points, even against a guy like me.
It will be a tough one, even more on grass.  It will be a tough one.  I think Kevin has been maintaining his level for a while now.  He's a very solid player now.  No more ups and down.  He's always strong, I guess.  I think his believe is stronger than ever.  It's going to be a tough one.
I just have to have a strong game plan also on Monday, still believe that I can beat him on grass even, then we will see.
Q. How would you compare your level right now to other times in your career when you've come to Wimbledon?
GAEL MONFILS: Well, I came here with more believe that I can do better than the last months because the last months I've been struggling a bit with my body, with also the way I was practicing, as a human being also.  I just came here with a strong believe will be a big change.
Obviously is a big change.  I'm in second week of Wimbledon.  I doing better I think bunch of stuff that the last month I been struggling with.
I feel I play better and better every match.  We'll see on Monday.
Q. Obviously your first round was a difficult one against Gasquet.  Did that help you get switched on from the very start?
GAEL MONFILS: I think every match is tough for me.  Every match is tough for me.  But surely helps me to believe that I like the grass actually, to believe that I can do good.  Beat Richard in three set was just a great result, then show me the way I think, yeah.
