THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Before we get to the tennis, could you please share your thoughts on Kobe Bryant?  
GAEL MONFILS: Yeah, it was really tough this morning. You know, is the first thing, you know, when I woke up, bunch of messages. Definitely when I found out that, I was really, really sad, because it was someone that for sure I was looking up growing up and someone very special.   
To be honest with you, really devastated by that, because it means quite a lot for me, and I know also for Elina, and definitely all my thoughts and prayers for his family.
