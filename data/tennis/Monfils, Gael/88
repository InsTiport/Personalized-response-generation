G. MONFILS/A. Dolgopolov
  7‑6, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French. 

Q.   It was a nice match to watch.   Was it nice to play? 
GAÃL MONFILS:   Yeah, really nice.   He was very creative.   It's good for me.   We played a good game. 
He does things differently.   He's not easy to pass.   I really enjoyed it. 

Q.   We always wonder what he's going invent.   Is that difficult?
GAÃL MONFILS:   Well, sometimes he makes two or three mistakes, so you think you're all right.   Suddenly he plays three wonderful returns.   That's annoying.   But I tried to play each point being positive. 
I must say it is annoying because he can sometimes play an impressive shot and then make a mistake.   So you feel you're in control, and he comes up with a beautiful shot. 

Q.   It was a high‑quality match.   Don't you agree?
GAÃL MONFILS:   Yes, we played well.   We had good shots and rallies.   It was good tennis. 

Q.   Now you're going to play Federer.   How will you approach the match?
GAÃL MONFILS:   Normally.   I'll just recuperate tonight and get ready. 

Q.   You were saying you don't know what to expect with Dolgopolov.   But you do know what to expect with Federer. 
GAÃL MONFILS:   Well, you never know.   You don't know how he's going to play.   Sometimes he can be more patient.   Sometimes he's less patient.   I think we need to adapt to the conditions.   Today was heavier.   It might be quicker tomorrow.   You have to adapt to the player you're playing across the net. 

Q.   Is this match going to be similar to the Davis Cup match?
GAÃL MONFILS:   It's going to be different.   You always ask me this.   In Davis Cup you asked me if it was going to be the same as in the US Open.   In the US Open, you asked me if it was going to be the same as in Cincinnati.   In Cincinnati, you asked me if it was the same at Shanghai. 
Every time it's a different match.   Here is a different tournament. 

Q.   You're coming closer each time when you play Federer. 
GAÃL MONFILS:   Yes, I'm happy with my improvements.   I raised my level here.   Here I usually don't play very well.   This time I played a good match. 
But tomorrow will be another level. 

Q.   Federer told us about the fun you had together playing doubles.   Did this bring you closer? 
GAÃL MONFILS:   Yes.   All those who participated in this event became closer friends because we loved it.   We had a lot of fun and we made a lot of jokes. 

Q.   Is the match tomorrow going to be a test?
GAÃL MONFILS:   Not really.   I would set the French Open apart.   Here I'm playing at a reasonable level.   I'm not injured.   So if I get a good match tomorrow, I will take it. 

Q.   But you don't want to admit this match was really impressive?
GAÃL MONFILS:   Well, yes, I played well.   I have some hopes for tomorrow, of course.   I'm happy to play at this level early in the season because I didn't have a very good start of the year.   I really want to play well during this clay court season.   Those two matches here will help me. 
If I can keep it up until the French Open, I might be able to do something in six weeks from now.
