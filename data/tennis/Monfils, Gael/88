THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French.   
   
 Q.   This match is this line with the good match of yesterday.   It was a great match.   
GAÃL MONFILS:   As I said, it's good if I can win, if I can step up my power a bit further each time.   I played well yesterday, and I knew today I had to play at a higher level.   I was able to do that, so I'm very happy.   
I'm surprised I was able to increase my power so quickly.   I played solid and I played better than yesterday.   I was able to hit hard from the baseline, to be aggressive.   I'm very pleased with that match.   
   
 Q.   Did you find the key to play him now after the match in the US Open and the Davis Cup?   
GAÃL MONFILS:   The key is too much to say.   But I am solid and I move well, so I know when I play well on clay, I am difficult to beat.   
Now, as to Roger in particular, of course I have a precise tactic against him.   But three or four times during that match he changed his game and I had to adapt.   I can't really talk about having a key for that because each point is different from the other.   
   
 Q.   He said you were less aggressive than in Lille.   
GAÃL MONFILS:   Well, in Lille we were playing on hard court, indoors.   I would rather say here is more like the US Open.   I was able to impose on him a good quality of shots.   But for some shots, I was not hitting that hard.   I was able to hold the line.   
What I wanted to do is show him that I was there and I was hitting forehands right and left to show him for me the court seemed small and I was everywhere.   
   
 Q.   Are you surprised you're in such good shape so early in the season?  
GAÃL MONFILS:   Oh, well, if I could do like in Marseille or even a little bit better, that would be great.   It's the first time I come here without being injured, feeling good physically, having a good feeling with my game.   
I think if I do well this week, I won't play until the French Open and I'll take no risks (smiling).   
   
 Q.   You're afraid too lose too much energy?  
GAÃL MONFILS:   Not at all.   But I was never able to prepare properly.   I believe there is no such thing as a good preparation.   You can't prepare too much and you can't prepare not enough.   
I need to take it week after week.   
   
 Q.   You're going to play Bucharest where you have a wild card.   
GAÃL MONFILS:   Well, yes.   Last time I was there, I played a semifinal that stayed unfinished.   I'm a competitor and it bothers me.   Also I like that tournament.   It's a small tournament.   It's a bit different from other places.   The conditions are good.   They suit me.   
I want to play well there.   I want to win a title.   I want to earn points.   So that's why I thought about Bucharest.   I asked them, and they said it was okay, I could play.   
Also I have a bye there, so I'll have time to recoup.   It's different now because I feel physically and mentally in good shape.   I hope I will be able, for once, to be able to play a full clay court season, which hasn't happened.   
   
 Q.   Does a win against Federer mean more than a usual match?   
GAÃL MONFILS:   That is a tough question.   Whatever I say, you can criticize me.   
But I'm happy I won that match because I played a good tennis match.   But it's not finished.   It's not over yet.   This was the Round of 16 only.   But I know that when I'm in good shape, I can play very well.   Top ten is not far away.   
   
 Q.   Since you have a lot of humor, but question will be do you sometimes also sleep at night with your outfit because you don't have a contract with your sponsor for the night, do you?   
GAÃL MONFILS:   Well, the situation is that I made a mistake when I chose an outfit out of what they had sent to me.   
But, no, I don't sleep with it on.   I don't sleep with my racquet either.   Do you sleep with your tape‑recorder?   Maybe I should ask your wife (laughter).   
   
 Q.   After your hip injury, is it a miracle you're so fit?  
GAÃL MONFILS:   All the credit has to go to Gaetan.   He did it.   When I fell, maybe if I had had a bit of time, I would have been able to finish the match.   But I had a huge bruise.   What helped me a lot was this Chinese medicine and acupuncture.   
I keep an open mind.   I'm ready to try everything I can to recoup quicker.   So I really have to congratulate him.   Also what he does well is mixing it up.   On the one hand, he takes care of my injury.   On the other hand, I still can work on certain things, which is great.   
He struck the right balance, and that's why I was able to get better very quickly.   
   
 Q.   Bucharest was the last time you played your opponent for the next round.   What do you think?   
GAÃL MONFILS:   He's very aggressive.   He can be extremely dangerous.   He uses a lot his first serve.   He has an excellent forehand.   His backhand is consistent, as well.   
He tries to dictate the game with his forehand.   His arm is very quick.   I hope my doubles match will not take away too much energy from me.   
I do have a plan to play Grigor.   I was lucky to beat him in the US Open, but it was a tight match.   I must be aggressive, like I was today, and try my best.   But I have to play well.   
   
 Q.   You said doubles were important to you.   Why so?  
GAÃL MONFILS:   Doubles are important first because I'm sick and tired hearing people say I'm unable to play doubles.   Second, because Jo and I want to do well.   We want to win matches.   Also it's a way of helping our Davis Cup captain because then I become credible in doubles.   For that, the best thing to do is win matches.
