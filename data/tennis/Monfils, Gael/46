THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Welcome to Eastbourne.  Your first time here?
GAÃL MONFILS: First time, yeah.
Q. What are your first impressions?
GAÃL MONFILS: It was very nice.  The weather was nice.  The sea, it was nice.  The club is big.
No, it was actually nice and surprising good weather here.
Q. You have had a chance to test out the courts?
GAÃL MONFILS: Yeah, right now actually just finish.  Good practice courts.  I mean, it felt quite good, actually.  It was great.
Q. How does the grass feel?  How does it feel?  Are you moving well?
GAÃL MONFILS: Much better.  Much better.  I think better and better.  Last week played a good match.  It's never easy for me to come on grass, but I think this year I gave a go, and it was better and better.
Today was slightly better, so tomorrow is going to be better and ready for the match.
Q. Some strong players in the draw this year, obviously.
GAÃL MONFILS: Yeah, I haven't looked at the draws much, but I heard.  I just hear that Novak is here, too.  I just saw Richard.  I knew he was playing here.  Definitely I think for sure it's good players, 250, very strong, good preparation before Wimby.  You expect to have good matches here.
Q. What are your expectations for the week?
GAÃL MONFILS: I want to play good, you know.  I want to play good.  If I come here, it's definitely to have matches under my belt.  If I can go all the way, you know, I'll do my best.
Q. Away from tennis, what will you get up to in Eastbourne?  Are you going to have a look around and take in some of the town, as well?
GAÃL MONFILS: I heard the weather won't be that good tomorrow till Friday (smiling).  So I will see.  I will see, but definitely will have a look around the city.  We just arrived and I have been very surprised and actually happy about it.  We will have a turn.
