THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What do you think of your progress so far in the tournament?  
GAEL MONFILS: I'm all right. I like it. I like the way I am now. I like the way the crowd is behind me. I love the energy here.   
I'm happy.   
 Q.  Happy the birthday.  
GAEL MONFILS: Two minutes, then it's bad luck (laughter).   
 Q.  Can we say the US Open is your second home, besides your home Grand Slam, you reach the best results here, semifinal?  
GAEL MONFILS: Here is definitely the second for me, the second slam in my heart, the second biggest tournament in my heart for many reasons. Also New York, my idol is Arthur Ashe. Always something magic happen. I feel very good here.   
 Q.  One of the things that was noticeable was the reaction to your style of play. What sets you apart?  
GAEL MONFILS: That's more the question for you. I just myself on the court. I think people, they love me because I play with my heart, I fight. I think for the rest of the tournament, as well, the others, they're different. It's always something special with me. You never know how and what I can do on the court. I think that's why the people like that, a little bit a mystery part of me.
