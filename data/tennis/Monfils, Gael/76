THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What is your summary of the match?
GAEL MONFILS: I think it was a tough match, tricky match.  Was never easy to play against Stephane.  He's going for some shots, some crazy ideas, some crazy tactics.
I feel I manage to win in straight set, and I think I did pretty good on that.
