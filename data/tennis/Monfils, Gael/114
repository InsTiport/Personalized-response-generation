  6‑1, 7‑5 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   What happened?  
GAÃL MONFILS:   Well, obviously I think today my opponent was better than me.   I think he went for his shots more than me, and obviously at the end he was like blowing in like every ball.   You know, he was better than me today.  
   
 Q.   The first set you especially seemed, compared to last night, you seemed more sluggish.   Took you almost the whole set to get going.   
GAÃL MONFILS:   Yeah, it was tougher because I felt a bit heavier, and, you know, it was my first tough match yesterday.  
You know, I struggled a bit with my recovery, so I'm alone so it's a bit different.   I have to get used to, and, you know, just adjust a couple of stuff to be better.  
Actually, he was playing very fast at the beginning, and it took me a while to adapt and, you know, to just to see how he was playing.  
   
 Q.   He's got a fairly extraordinary style of playing, hasn't he, with sort of one strike?   Not only that, but when he wins his points, he wins them in big sequences.   How disruptive is that?   How difficult is that to play against?  
GAÃL MONFILS:   It's tough because he not give you a lot of rhythm.   He just is going for every point, I would say, a winner.  
I think my mistake is I was maybe too focused to return first and then try to catch his backhand.   I think I should maybe open it more on his forehand to get his backhand.   
And then today it was a good day for him also, I think, because he was hitting clean winners.     
   
 Q.   He's also played a lot of matches here and previously; whereas you've played very few.   Was that a factor?  
GAÃL MONFILS:   Well, for sure it's tough for me without any matches in my belt.   But still, I think today he was better than me.   It's like no excuse.   The player I was against was more aggressive, and he go for his shots and made it.   
   
 Q.   In terms of your long‑term preparation, is this still satisfactory, though, this week for you?  
GAÃL MONFILS:   Yeah, you know, it's good, you know.   Even it's a tough loss but, you know, it's one more match on my belt.   
I mean, competition, win, lose, I'm still in competition, so, you know, now I just need to prepare for my next tournament.   That is the most important thing.
