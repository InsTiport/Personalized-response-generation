THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How did you feel out there?  Looked like you were in pretty good form.  
GAEL MONFILS: Yeah, fairly good.  I feel good.  Nothing special.  I feel good, yeah.   
 Q.  Are you approaching the slam any different than other slams this year?  
GAEL MONFILS: No, not really.  I think I my approach my slam like I approach my season.  It was in a good way.   
So I still in the good way; I'm good track.   
 Q.  You have yet to drop a set here, which is quite an accomplishment through four rounds.  What is it you think that's just working well for you?  
GAEL MONFILS: I think I play good.  I play very tough tennis, you know.   
I think for sure a little bit luck, because I was a break down eventually today.  I managed to come back very quick.   
But my guess is luck and also I think I just played very strong.   
 Q.  As we approach the second week, who do you think is the favorite to win the men's singles right now?  
GAEL MONFILS: I think is no question about that.  Is Novak, I think.  Novak is the favorite.  And then you get Andy also; then you get Stan.  I think you've got a lot of guys.   
 Q.  It's possible you'll play Rafa in the next round.  We don't know what will happen in the match today.  If it is Rafa, what are your impressions of what he's done to get back to the level where he's playing right now?  What sort of challenge will it be for you?  
GAEL MONFILS: What did you mean get back to the level?   
 Q.  After his wrist injury and missing two majors.  
GAEL MONFILS: Yeah, I'm not surprised, yeah?  Rafa is very strong.  He's like legend of the sport, I think.  So, you know, I have no surprise he play very good in Rio.  So, you know, when he came back he was very strong in Rio.   
So, you know, for me is not a surprise.  He done it a couple years ago also.  He come back and actually won everything.  I serious think he won here also.  I think it's pretty normal.   
 Q.  What's it like for you when you play him?  
GAEL MONFILS: It's great.  Unbelievable.  It's great.  I like to play him.   
 Q.  Why?  
GAEL MONFILS: Because I know him for a long time and we always have good battles, you know.  Even when we have been young and now.   
So I always like to play Rafa.   
 Q.  How much did your title in Washington, D.C. affect your confidence coming into the US Open this year?  
GAEL MONFILS: I have no idea, you know.  To be honest, I was very happy to catch it, you know, but I think I was still on a good trip here before, before I got this virus.   
For sure it's been a good accomplishment for me, but to be honest I was I think in the right track I think till the 1st January of this year.   
 Q.  Going back to your enjoyment of Rafa, when you see him across the net, what gives you the pleasure of playing against him and what is the biggest challenge for you to play against him?  
GAEL MONFILS: Like I really like because I know it's going to be physical, you know.  That's what I like, you know.  I think I'm playing the game for this.  It's going to be physical.   
As a big competitor that I am, I think he's a very good one.  Actually, better than me, but a very good one.  It's always enjoyable to be -- to face him, because it's always great battles, and I like this.   
 Q.  You mentioned the Olympics.  What was it like to see what Del Potro did there, and what are your thoughts about his comeback from years of wrist injuries?  
GAEL MONFILS: Is the same.  Those guys are top, you know.  I think we have to give them credit, but also they are naturally gifted like a lot.  I think physically they are still the best.   
They are the best at what they do.  Just come up here and in Rio for Juan Martin, but we know this kind of tennis he has.  He's always one of the best of the sport.  For sure he belong to the top 10, no question about it.   
 Q.  You seemed to tie your shoe in the middle of the match today.  What happened there?  
GAEL MONFILS: To be honest, I have no idea what happened.  Sometimes those points don't mean anything for me.  Just -- I don't know.  I just lose it.
