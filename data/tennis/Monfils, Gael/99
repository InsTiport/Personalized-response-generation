G. MONFILS/M. Jaziri
  7/6, 7/5, 6/4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You were talking a lot throughout the whole match and your level was going up and down.   Can you talk me through that.   You seemed to be talking to the umpire a lot. 
GAÃL MONFILS:   Well, no, I was just talking about some stuff, like funny stuff. 
You know, on grass is never easy for me.   I'm very relaxed.   I'm just the coolest than ever on grass. 
Then is hard for me to play like solid tennis, I will say, 'cause I can't move.   Actually I can't move.   I don't feel comfortable. 
So I try to play just some part of the match.   It was fun, so it's good for me. 

Q.   I think I heard you say that you had some physical troubles in the first set. 
GAÃL MONFILS:   In the second game, yeah.   Second game, I think it's very slippery.   Here is a bit different, the grass in Wimbledon.   I start to get used to. 
Then I think I pull a little bit my hamstring, the adductor.   It's hard.   I'm scared always to run full power on grass.   Then after the second game, it was like, Okay, I will take it easy. 

Q.   You were down a break in each of the first and second sets.   Can you talk about how you managed to get back?
GAÃL MONFILS:   You know, I'm very relaxed.   For me, it's like shot after shot, just focus on my serve.   If the ball is very short, I try to hit it and come to the net. 
Is like ‑‑ I won't say easy.   But when you know the guy is nervous, I knew he was nervous, he's up a break, it's never easy to close it.   Especially when you see the opponent is very relaxed on the court, I knew he would get tight.   He give me double‑fault, easy shot. 
So just take advantage on that. 

Q.   Your next matchup, what are your thoughts on facing him?
GAÃL MONFILS:   For me on grass, he is a good player.   He's like super good.   For me is more like I trying to stay, you know, on me a little bit 'cause I can play anyone.   It would be the same for me. 
It's hard for me to play on grass court.   Basically, no matter what, is going to be tough match for me. 

Q.   So is every win a bonus for you?
GAÃL MONFILS:   Yes.   Definitely, yes. 

Q.   Not many players are that relaxed on the court and can talk to people around them.   Have you played someone who does that?   Were you thinking maybe it's a bit distracting for the opponent?   Does it distract you if someone you're playing does that?
GAÃL MONFILS:   I wish 'cause, you know, I just have fun.   And basically for I will say a normal player, I think every coach will tell you that you should focus on your game, not on the opponent. 
So if the guy look at me, yeah, it can be a little bit tricky for him.   Still I think the best one I manage to stay focused on them, you know. 
But for me, I don't care.   You know, is like if the guy talking to anyone, it's fine.   If he can talk to me, it's even better.
