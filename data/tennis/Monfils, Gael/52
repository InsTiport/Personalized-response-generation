R. NADAL/G. Monfils
6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How do you feel you played tonight?
GAEL MONFILS: I had ups and downs, you know, in my game tonight.  I think I really struggle with my return.  Could not make enough return at the beginning of the match.  So that was a little bit inconvenience.
Then I think I serve so-so, I think only 58% today.  It would be a big help to have a better serve.  I couldn't reach at the beginning all the spots, you know.  Not much accuracy, you know.
So it was just a battle to get back.  I was in shape in the match to get the momentum back.  Somehow I find it back.  Was much better.
Still, you know, even I was leading a little bit, you know, had a couple drops, then Rafa was for me different balls, redirect a little bit different.
It was tough for me to really find a good rhythm, you know, through a period of the match.  And then I think I was much better at the end.  Couldn't close it 4-3, 30-Love.  Had an easy forehand.  Well, look easy, but...
Obviously I think the legs wasn't so much.  I was very straight.  I think I could have one more step.  I think I missed two, three forehands in a row.  I could have one more steps.  I think the legs was a bit too high.  Could have done better.
Then Rafa fight, find the way, fight.  I would say he is a true champion so he deserves the match.
Q. What's the most difficult thing about playing against Rafa?
GAEL MONFILS: I don't know.  It's like everything, you know.  I think he's playing great.  He's great returner.  Tonight serve okay.  I think 72%, something like that.  Obviously I couldn't return.  I saw that he was serving not bad.
Redirect the shot very good.  Good defender.  You know, yeah, he's on top of the game.
