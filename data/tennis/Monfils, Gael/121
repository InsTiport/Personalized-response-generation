G. MONFILS/V. Troicki
  6‑2, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   That was very encouraging, wasn't it?   It was a pretty good performance?
GAÃL MONFILS:   Yeah, it was a good match.   I mean, better conditions, as well, a bit warmer, less wind.
I felt the ball better today, so, you know, I was happy.

Q.   Last night you played a long way behind the baseline.   Tonight not quite so much.   Is that something that you are happy to do because you enjoy doing it, or do you feel you should sometimes move further up the court?
GAÃL MONFILS:   It's like yesterday, I think if I was too close behind the baseline, I mean, it was easier to Benjamin to play a sinker, if I was like a bit forward and then loupe the ball, it was like better for me.
But tonight, you know, I was ‑‑I was ready to put on my best night and overpower him and just control the court.   So it was a tactic, I think.   That's why I play like this tonight.

Q.   So are you encouraged sort of both for this week and also for Australia that things are improving?
GAÃL MONFILS:   Yeah, I mean, definitely.   You know, I work hard physically.   So the best encouragement tonight was the movement and also like I was like I feel like fast and powerful forward, backwards, and side.   So that's why it give me confidence also to stay close off my baseline.
I was happy.   And, yeah, if I keep going like this, I will have a good chance to be ready for the Australian Open.

Q.   Do you like playing Rafa?   He runs almost as fast as you, doesn't he?
GAÃL MONFILS:   Yeah, it's always tough to play against him, but, you know, it's always also a good experience, I think, because he's a big warrior, fighter.   I like this kind of match. 
And, yeah, I think tomorrow I need to find the weakness and also take advantage of something.   I don't know really yet, but I have an idea, and hopefully it will work tomorrow.

Q.   I think Nadal has got an 8‑1 winning record against you.   What are you going to do to beat him?
GAÃL MONFILS:   Well, I have an idea, you know.   I just keep for myself.   Always, like I say, statistic change and so it's the new year, so we will see.
