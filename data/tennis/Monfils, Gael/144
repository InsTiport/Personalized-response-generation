 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. When you spoke to the trainer, what was that about?  
 GAÃL MONFILS: I twist my knee in like the first serve of the game, and I think the tape move a bit and it was a bit loose. I want he work with it and also try to stretch a bit my knee, because it was sore.  
  
  Q. Were the knees a problem or anything?  
 GAÃL MONFILS: Actually, yeah. The court was bit of problem during the whole match. After, the action was way better because I walked on it for 30 minutes, so it was better, but during the match it was a bit problem.  
  
  Q. What made the difference today?  
 GAÃL MONFILS: Today for me really hard, you know, on grass to feel comfortable, to feel my movement. As everybody know, my movement is good skill of mine, so play without and not feel really comfortable.   
 Before the match it was okay, and just after the first serve in the match, I start to be more careful and start to be a bit nervous about my movement. So for me it's really tough to match.   
 Rainer is moving good on grass. He played really strong tennis to close the match, and then it was a tough surface.  
  
  Q. The conditions obviously very frustrating out there? The conditions, frustrating?   
 GAÃL MONFILS: Yes, I mean...  
  
  Q. We had a lot of Paris.   
 GAÃL MONFILS: Exactly. We get used to.   
 The thing really frustrated is I can't move that good on grass and I don't feel yet, you know, step, every step. You know, for me is a bit hard.  
  
  Q. What do you think you'll do next? Will Roger make you play another event?  
 GAÃL MONFILS: Actually we're gonna talk about what we do.
