THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Can you just comment for me on the atmosphere both out there before you moved into the big house and then inside?  
GAÃL MONFILS:   Like what do you want to know exactly?   
   
 Q.   Exciting atmosphere.   You were having a lot of fun out there.   I've never seen a guy laugh on a set point before.   Then when you moved to the Centre Court it was...   
GAÃL MONFILS:   We knew it before the match.   They told us that we might change if we go for a long match.   You know, we had been a bit angry because we thought that after the third set we would move directly on the Centre Court.   
Then we played and it was tough, because the last game when I broke Gilles it was really tough to see.   So it wasn't fair for Gilles actually that we switch.   
But it was great.   You know, been with Gilles for a long time so is always nice to play with him.   First time we play in Wimbledon, so was good, you know.   We bring always fun.  
   
 Q.   In Centre Court, when you went into Centre, there were some people who obviously got in but it was still relatively empty.   Those people were enthusiastic, but the atmosphere was a little bit strange.   You played some good tennis.   
GAÃL MONFILS:   It was nice.   I think it was nice.   It was a little bit people, and I think they like it, you know.   They was in the game.   
No, it was cool.   I really like it.   I enjoy it.
