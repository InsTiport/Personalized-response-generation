D. THIEM/G. Monfils
[Walkover]
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Can you explain what happened, when it happened, et cetera?
GAÃL MONFILS: It's been a couple days I felt my left Achilles a little bit.  Day after day I was treating with my team.  And last night was, after the match, was actually not so good.
So this morning when we do another treatment, it was worse.  I tried a little jog this morning, and I couldn't really actually push on it.  Then we tape it.  Then I hit a little bit tonight, and I felt that I cannot be 100%.  Like, I have this pain, and it wasn't the right choice to play.
And I just made some ultrasound with the doc here, and we could see, like, a big inflammation.  So actually said I was pretty accurate.  That he could see that definitely it was the best choice I made tonight.
Q. So is there a risk that you're going to be out for a couple of weeks?  What are your thoughts?
GAÃL MONFILS: Well, that, for sure, is a risk, honestly.  It depends how fast I will heal.  Definitely try the other treatment tonight.
At least I would say, like, days, week, one week, and maybe I will take it really easy with everything and then see how I feel, if I feel that, you know, I can play Miami or not.
If not, as usual, I need to wait.  And if not, I need to wait, wait, and -- so far it's tough to say how long, but I will stay positive and hope in couple days I'll be fine.
Q. Injury withstanding, what do you make of your tournament overall?
GAÃL MONFILS: Very disappointing, to be honest now, because I was playing great, playing great tennis, feeling strong.
As I was saying all week, I have been working hard.  You know, it's never easy to get a walkover when you feel good.  Especially I was feeling great physically, moving good those weeks, been very good.  I was very fast and strong.  Played very aggressive.
So I'm on the right track I think for the next tournament, which is hopefully soon.
Q. Can you in any way describe or put into words the frustration you go through yet again with all the injuries that you have experienced in your career?
GAÃL MONFILS: You know, for the first time, I guess, people will understand that it's not -- you know, a lot of my injuries people think it was because I was lazy or not doing the job, and I always tell them that, you know, it's part of luck sometime.  It's part of our job.
Sometime some people are more fragile.  And I guess I'm kind of fragile on some part of my body.  That's why, you know, I always try new routines.
I guess, you know, I need to stay tough mentally, because it's never easy.  But I have been through that.  You know, I have been through that.  You know, I have no fear, I know, for this one.
As I said, this year I'm ready to do all sacrifice, and we need to put the work to get back to the top.  So that's a little step back, but I will jump higher.
Q. In the past, have you pushed yourself at times when you shouldn't have and now you realize that?
GAÃL MONFILS: You know, I had this same experience actually here against Dominic a few years ago.  I played this match.  I lose 3 and 2, and I couldn't move well.  And then I played it.
And four days after, back home, I was with crutches.  No one knows, but I know I was with crutches.  It was a bad decision.  So definitely now, a few years later, I won't do the same.
