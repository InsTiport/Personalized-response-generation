THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.


Q.  What happened today seemed logical to you?

GAEL MONFILS:  I still believe the score is a bit tough on me.  I had my chances, but I didn't convert them.


Q.  For example, the breakpoint at 3-All?

GAEL MONFILS:  I had two, but mainly during the rallies I was getting too excited.  My dropshots were not very good. However, I played good tennis.  He played the important points better than I did.  I was not far behind.


Q.  Precisely, didn't you spend too much energy during the first six games?

GAEL MONFILS:  No, usually I start off pretty bad.  So if I'm able to attack from the start, it's even better.  But what happened is I was too excited, I rushed too much, my dropshots were just average.


Q.  Were you impressed by his topspin and by the way he moves?

GAEL MONFILS:  He does good topspins, he runs well, but I wasn't impressed.


Q.  Is it better to play him on clay or on other surfaces?

GAEL MONFILS:  It's everywhere the same.


Q.  Do you believe you had the right shots to bother him?

GAEL MONFILS:  Yes, I even could have won.


Q.  Can you draw some lessons from this match for the French Open?

GAEL MONFILS:  Yes.  For a first round, I played a solid match.  I hadn't played on clay for one year.  To tell you the truth, before the season, I was a bit afraid because I got injured last year.


Q.  Were you bothered by the light?

GAEL MONFILS:  I wasn't seeing very well.  That's why I asked them to put the lights on.


Q.  When did you start playing again on clay?

GAEL MONFILS:  About a week ago.


Q.  During that match, did you learn that against a player like Nadal you can enjoy yourself?

GAEL MONFILS:  Yes, but in better conditions.


Q.  At the end it started raining.  Did you believe that you would have a chance to recuperate?

GAEL MONFILS:  Only rats think that.


Q.  What is your program going to be from now on?

GAEL MONFILS:  I have to discuss it.  I'm going to Barcelona to play the quallies.


Q.  You're not going to do physical training?

GAEL MONFILS:  I have to discuss it.  I'm playing well.  Maybe I should play qualifications.  Everything will depend on what is going to happen this week and in doubles.
