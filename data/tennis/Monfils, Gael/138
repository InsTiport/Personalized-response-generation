 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. What is it about the US Open? You've had great success here; the crowds love you here. Is it something about being in New York, the atmosphere? 
 GAÃL MONFILS: Yeah, I love the atmosphere. I love the city, also.
 I mean, actually the States when I was young, and I was like looking for two things: One, the Orange Bowl, and another thing the US Open junior for sure, and I didn't. I fail like twice in final in Orange Bowl. I came here with injury the year when I won the other three. 
 So, I mean, here is like now I'm in seniors, so I really want to win this one, also. I love the surface here; I love the crowd; I love the Ashe Stadium. So I feel very good and comfortable here.

 Q. What were the conditions like today on the grandstand in terms of the weather and the wind?
 GAÃL MONFILS: Awful. I mean, for me, awful. For me to play my game, it was tough to swing my balls; it was tough to adjust. My movement was not that good I think around the ball to make the small steps. 
 So I just try to compete and put the ball in. And actually, I think I was just happy, because physically I was there. But I think tactically and tennistically it was not a great match. 

 Q. Did you notice any differences between the way he was playing early in the match and later in the match? Because obviously he was a little banged up. 
 GAÃL MONFILS: Um, not really. Not really.

 Q. Compared to other Opens, how are you feeling mentally and physically? You know, you're getting into the last final week. You have hopefully a few matches less until it's that final match. What's going through your mind right now?
 GAÃL MONFILS: I feel great physically. I mean, before the Open I was strong; I work hard like physically, so I feel great even if I have like long match. Basically I feel great. 
 I hope the conditions will be better, and then I have like couple interesting like match to come - one against Richard - so I will try to play the best tennis I can. I know I can made it through the quarters, so I will try to take my chances on Monday.

 Q. Do you think there's a lot of differences between your's and Richard's game?
 GAÃL MONFILS: Yeah, a lot. I think Richard is more talented than me in couple ways. Like he can adapt more about the conditions. Then I think I'm stronger than him physically, and maybe a bit mentally, also. 
 Sometime he is like too defensive, like me. So actually it will be a good match, and we will see who's going to put like more pressure on the opponent.

 Q. You're known for those incredible slides on the court. What do they feel like... 
 GAÃL MONFILS: When I do it? 

 Q. Yes. 
 GAÃL MONFILS: I don't know. Simple.

 Q. Is it something that just came from your clay court play?
 GAÃL MONFILS: Exactly. Yes. You know, sometime I won't know -- you know, like if I ask me to do it right now, I think I can't. During the match, I'm on. So, I mean, I don't know yet like how to do it, but maybe I will -- I will teach my kids. (Smiling.)

 Q. Do you think your style of play leads to your injuries? Can you work off-court to prevent injuries in the future?
 GAÃL MONFILS: I think my injuries is more about my body. I think the style I play, I think my knee -- I grew too fast and my knees have a problem, and then I had like wrist problem, because eventually I fell on grass court. But everyone can fell on grass court.
 But then I don't think my style play have something with my injury. 

 Q. Are you thinking about the match against Argentina for Davis Cup? I mean, do you think about that when you're on the court? 
 GAÃL MONFILS: Not at all, because the captain he doesn't -- I mean, obviously we don't know who's on the team, so maybe I'm not on the team. So I don't think about it.

 Q. Do you think France is actually the favorite to win that match?
 GAÃL MONFILS: I don't know, because we don't know who's on the team for you guys. We know exactly who's gonna be on the team. But us, we don't know is on the team. Can be everyone. 
 So we wait and see after the Open who Guy will choose, and then we will have an idea.
