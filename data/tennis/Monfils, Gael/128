F. GIL/G. Monfils
  7-6, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions in French. 

 Q. You were right yesterday. You said you should not give him the opportunity to be brilliant. From the baseline, that's where he is the best. 
 GAÃL MONFILS: Perfect analysis. It's just it. I knew I was going to start the match playing like that. But today I was hitting better than yesterday. I was not able to change my rhythm, to come more to the net, taking maybe the risk of missing. 
 I played a few short balls that he was able to attack. That was a kind of match you need to avoid. 

 Q. We could see you wanted to play faster and you were getting frustrated because you couldn't. 
 GAÃL MONFILS: Yes. I know I have the capacity to play a lot faster, but today I wasn't a hundred percent. When he was playing cross-court to my forehand, I was always far away from the ball and I lacked the stamina and the confidence to hit harder or to take the ball earlier and make him run. 
 When he was playing those loops on my backhand, I should have hit cross-court. 

 Q. Don't you think it's normal after a two-month break? Did you expect to play at your best immediately? 
 GAÃL MONFILS: You always hope you will. I should not think that it is only a comeback. I should try to play the best I can as soon as possible. I tried to set some goals for myself. 
 As I said yesterday, today's match was more complicated. I was speaking with a friend, and he said that players like Gimeno or Gil are not the best choice for me to play coming back after the injury because I have to battle from the baseline, and if I have no confidence, it can be a real trap because I'm not aggressive enough. 
 Playing an aggressive player might be easier because he might either play a winner or miss. 

 Q. You never played a set in a tiebreaker as long as this one, 1 hour, 26 minutes, did you? It seemed after, you had nothing left. 
 GAÃL MONFILS: Mentally maybe a little. But I was getting frustrated, and he was playing better and better. After a while I started being angry at myself. I was telling myself, If you want to win this, you need to do this and that. I wasn't succeeding. 
 But I also have to say that the son of a bitch played pretty well. Honestly, he played a good match. 

 Q. But he's not more than top 50, I believe. 
 GAÃL MONFILS: Well, he played a quarterfinal. He beat good players already. 

 Q. How are you as far as your schedule is concerned? 
 GAÃL MONFILS: I'm not worried about keeping the time. I have plenty of time to see how I will be doing with the next tournaments.
