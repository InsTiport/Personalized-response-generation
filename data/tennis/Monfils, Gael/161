  Q.  What happened to you?   
 GAEL MONFILS:  I pulled a muscle when warming up.  I didn't believe it was a serious injury so I went to the match, but I just couldn't take off.   
  
  Q.  Is it your right thigh?   
 GAEL MONFILS:  It's hamstring of my right leg.  It happened while warming up when I started to run to get a dropshot.   
 I felt a pull.  I tried to stretch.  I thought it would be okay, but, in fact, it was impossible for me to run.  Each time I felt like an electric shock.   
  
  Q.  Were there any warnings before that particular warming up?   
 GAEL MONFILS:  No.  I had a little pain in my back, but otherwise I prepared myself very well.   
  
  Q.  How long will it take now?   
 GAEL MONFILS:  I had an ultrasound and they said ten days.  It's going to be difficult for me to play in Barcelona.  When I get back I would talk with Dr. Montalban to see if I can go to Barcelona, but it seems difficult.   
  
  Q.  Did you make the decision to stop because you didn't want to take the risk of getting hurt even more?   
 GAEL MONFILS:  Yes.  And also because my strength is that I run very well.  Now out of eight games I only scored seven points because I just couldn't run at all.  It was very frustrating, and on top of it I was running the risk to hurt myself even more badly.   
 He played two dropshots and I couldn't go get them because it was hurting too much.  I didn't want to take anymore risks.   
  
  Q.  Did you practice in Luxembourg?   
 GAEL MONFILS:  No, in Sofia Antipolis.  I had a good ten days tennis there.  I had good feelings with my tennis, and physically also.  And now I am totally disgusted.   
  
  Q.  Do you have projects for your game?   
 GAEL MONFILS:  I want to play solid from the baseline and give away nothing.  I had managed to play being a lot more calm, less crazy, with much more consistency.   
 Now I will to have wait the next tournament to put it into place.
