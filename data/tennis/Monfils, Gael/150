  6-3, 7-6 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Were you surprised at all with Ferrero's play today, the strength of it?  
 GAÃL MONFILS: No, not really, because I heard before he was playing good, and also -- I mean, I saw in his results was more consistent and he had great weeks, weeks ago.   
 And if he's playing good, I know how he is playing. He's playing very hard on the baseline and trying to take the ball early, open up a lot. I mean, I wasn't surprised.  
  
  Q. And finally, the knee, are you having difficulty with it?   
 GAÃL MONFILS: No, the knee is okay. I just, after the match, 20 minutes to ice it. My knee, it is all right.
