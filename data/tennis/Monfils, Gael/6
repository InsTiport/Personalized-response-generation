 6-2, 6-4
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. I'd like to know if, of course it was one of your first matches, if you were paying the toll because of this, and how much you were bothered by the blackout, electric blackout that came in the middle of the second set?
 GAEL MONFILS:   Well, it was not a great match for me, obviously.  No, I mean, I just played very bad today.  Is nothing -- it was a blackout.  Yeah, it was nothing about my performance today.
 So, you know, it happens.  It was unlucky for the tournament, but this special event was nothing about my very bad performance today.
