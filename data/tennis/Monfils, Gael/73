G. MONFILS/G. Dimitrov
6-7, 6-3, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. The next match is going to be Nishikori or Bautista Agut.  Any opinion on this?
GAEL MONFILS: Both is going to be tough either way.  I think Kei is very good player.  Has been very consistent so far from these three years.  I think he have a win over me.
Bautista Agut is also a strong player, big fighter.  He plays great tennis.  Always tough to beat him.  I think either way it's going to be a tough match.
Q. Finally, what type of player you think it's going to be able to beat eventually in this tournament or in the future Novak Djokovic?
GAEL MONFILS: Well, a player definitely, what type, I don't know.  Someone that have a good inspiration, good keys, and can make him play different.  We saw couple player try to chase him a little bit for sets, for games.
But right now he's on the stop of the game.  He's the best on every shot.  Every shot he have an answer and every question that we give it to him.
I guess someone with great inspiration.  I feel last year, you know, who beat him was only guy be able to have great inspiration that day.
