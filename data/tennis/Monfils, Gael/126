G. MONFILS/A. Bogomolov
  6-2, 7-6

 THE MODERATOR: Questions in English. 

 Q. I was with you in Washington, saw what you had to go through last weekend. Watching you today, couldn't quite tell if you were still a little tired from the Legg Mason or if you were conserving energy for later in the tournament. How do you feel physically and have you recovered from that long weekend in D.C.? 
 GAEL MONFILS: Yeah, today I was tired maybe a little bit. Still I think I had a long time adaptation because it's totally different here. The court are faster. Obviously, I didn't find the rhythm quite easy today. 
 It was a bit tougher for me. 
 THE MODERATOR: Questions in French. 

 Q. Can you talk about switching from Washington to here. Is it different, although it's raining in both places? 
 GAEL MONFILS: Here it's 10 times faster. The court doesn't bounce very much. It was tough adapting to this surface. 
 In the beginning, it was difficult for me to return. It's completely different here. On top of it, there's more wind. 

 Q. How about your legs?
 GAEL MONFILS: Physically I'm all right, more or less. I felt well in the beginning of the match. After I might have seemed less energetic, but it was just because I was a bit bothered by a few little things. 

 Q. You play singles and doubles. Do you need matches?
 GAEL MONFILS: I need to build up my confidence. It's good for me playing doubles because I can improve my serve. I can also improve a lot on my game in doubles. It is also very good for my singles.
