THE MODERATOR:  This is Gael's first professional tournament in the US, as well.  
 
 
Q.  You're undefeated. 
 
GAEL MONFILS:  Good.  
 
Q.  You're undefeated.  Your first win in a US tournament.  What are your feelings about how you play?
 
GAEL MONFILS:  Yeah, I feel pretty good because I think it was very hard to win this match today.  Normally I like play in US, so I'm feel very good.  
 
Q.  This is your first trip to Indian Wells.  Can you tell us about what you've seen so far, how you like the tournament, Stadium Court, that type of thing? 
 
GAEL MONFILS:  Yeah, here is very good, very big stadium.  It's very nice.  I think the city is very good, too.  The weather is very good and very hot, so it's difficult to play because last week I was in Strasbourg for Davis Cup, and it was less then.  So it's a little bit hard to play, but it's very good.  
 
Q.  You were part of the team or a practice partner? 
 
GAEL MONFILS:  Fifth.  
 
 
Q.  Big difference?
 
GAEL MONFILS:  Big difference, yeah.  
 
Q.  A lot of the team come here year after year say they enjoy this tournament because of the relaxed atmosphere.  Do you feel relaxed, although it's your first time here? 
 
GAEL MONFILS:  Yeah, yeah, it's very relaxed, yeah.  Tennis courts, after you go to the hotel, it's very cool.  I don't feel the pressure.  So I think it's good.  
 
Q.  It's a good way to start off in the US?
 
GAEL MONFILS:  Yeah.  
 
Q.  People say you're a good basketball player.  Can you dunk? 
 
GAEL MONFILS:  Yeah.  
 
Q.  No problem? 
 
GAEL MONFILS:  In Europe, yeah.  But I think in US, it's a little bit -- 
 
Q.  It's not 10 feet? 
 
GAEL MONFILS:  I don't know in feet.  I think in US is a little bit...  
 
Q.  The goal is a little shorter?
 
GAEL MONFILS:  Yes.  
 
Q.  You haven't tried it in the US?
 
GAEL MONFILS:  No, not in US.  
 
Q.  It's 10 feet high all over the world. 
 
GAEL MONFILS:  Not in Europe.  For the three points in US is different.  
 
Q.  For the goal?
 
GAEL MONFILS:  Yeah, I think is different, too.  
 
Q.  I thought it was universal. 
 
GAEL MONFILS:  I think it's different, too.  I don't know exactly.  But in Europe, yeah.  
 
Q.  You have to make a transition from being a junior star to playing on the adult level.  How difficult do you anticipate this is going to be? 
 
GAEL MONFILS:  It's not very big difference.  Is only I think for the physical is different.  But only the tennis, I think it's the same, same level for the Top 10 in Juniors.  But the physical is very different.  
 
Q.  More physically demanding, right?
 
GAEL MONFILS:  Yeah.  
 
Q.  What is the best part of your game today?
 
GAEL MONFILS:  Passing shot, it's special.  
 
Q.  It's special?
 
GAEL MONFILS:  No, because today I don't feel very good my backhand, my forehand, my serve.  Only the passing shot was good today. 
 
Q.  You had such a wonderful junior career.  What are your goals for this year?  I'm sure you'll be playing at Roland Garros. 
 
GAEL MONFILS:  Now it's a little bit different because I think I will take this year to see everything on the tour, to learn how to play, how to be with the professional.  I don't have an objective for this year.  Maybe during the year I will have, but now I want just to see how to play and learn.  
 
Q.  Are there any French tour players right now that are giving you advice that you look up to that you've created a bond with in any way?
 
GAEL MONFILS:  Yeah.  I speak a lot with Sebastien Grosjean, with all the team Davis Cup, Clement, Paul-Henri Matthieu, Michael Llodra.  They told me something about the tour.  It's okay.  
 
Q.  Is there anyone out there that you have always looked up to that now you're playing at the same events with?  The French players are giving you pointers, but who have been the players that you've always looked up to on the tour that you're now out here with?
 
GAEL MONFILS:  Yeah, now nobody.  Only I have my coaches.  
 
Q.  A lot of the French players, when you look at all of the French players, the men and the women, they seem to approach the game a little bit differently than other countries.  I'm wondering if you have any thoughts on why this is, the way that the French play?
 
GAEL MONFILS:  I don't know.  They born like this, I don't know.  
 
Q.  Is it something in the way that you think or the way that you're taught when you're coming up?
 
GAEL MONFILS:  No.  I think just about my game, not to watch anybody else.  I have to grow up only by myself.  
 
 
Q.  Do you know him?
 
GAEL MONFILS:  Yes.  
 
Q.  How do you think that match will be for you?
 
GAEL MONFILS:  I don't thinking yet.  I don't know.
