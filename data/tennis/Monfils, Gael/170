THE MODERATOR:  First question, please. 


Q.  You tired? 

GAEL MONFILS:  No. 

Q.  How do you feel after that? 

GAEL MONFILS:  No, it's okay.  Pretty good. But during the match, during the end of match, it was a bit more difficult.  But I'm feel okay. 

Q.  What did you make of your first set? 

GAEL MONFILS:  I was nervous because it was my first Grand Slam and I was too exciting and I was not focused on my game, only to play I don't know how.  And after I relax a little bit and I try to make my game against Ginepri. 

Q.  Was it good to be on an outside court where there's less pressure?  Just a small crowd? 

GAEL MONFILS:  No, you know, I put pression (sic) on me, just me, because it was my first Grand Slam.  Outside court, big court, it's same thing. 

Q.  Your serve, it's a bit like Andy Roddick.  Tell us, did you look at his serve a bit?

GAEL MONFILS:  No, no. 

Q.  The action is a little bit...

GAEL MONFILS:  Yeah, but when I was young, I was serve like this so (smiling)...
