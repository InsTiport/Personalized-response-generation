 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
  Q. What can you say about this match? Did your knees bother you?  
 GAÃL MONFILS: No. I'm playing with it and I'm getting used to it. The clay court season is a long season and I'm going to go into it quietly. It was just not a good match.   
  
  Q. Did you have problems moving on the court?  
 GAÃL MONFILS: Well, it was my first match on clay with very tight bandages I have around my knees, so I need to get used to it.   
  
  Q. You were up 3-1, and you seemed to be into the match. What happened after that? Did he put pressure on you?  
 GAÃL MONFILS: There's not much to say about that match. I'm just trying to get used to clay court conditions. I need to work more with Roger and then confidence will come back.   
  
  Q. Are the bandages very tight?  
 GAÃL MONFILS: Yes. They keep my knees very tight. I have pain when I take them off.   
 In fact, my knees hurt when I climb stairs. And on the left knee, I have a big bump.   
  
  Q. Ideally you should stop playing for three months?  
 GAÃL MONFILS: I should not play.   
  
  Q. Are you losing flexibility because of that?  
 GAÃL MONFILS: Well, I can't bend my legs all the way. In fact, I'm putting those bandages very tight because it eases the pain.   
  
  Q. Does it hurt you a lot?  
 GAÃL MONFILS: It was really hurting when I was in the United States. Those bandages are good to me when they were very tight.   
  
  Q. Are you going to Barcelona?  
 GAÃL MONFILS: Yes, if everything goes well.   
  
  Q. There was some whistling at the end of the match. Could you understand the crowd's feelings, as they had expectations of you?  
 GAÃL MONFILS: I've always been whistled at. There are still other French players in the tournament, so it's not that bad.
