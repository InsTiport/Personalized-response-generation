  R. FEDERER/G. Monfils  
6-3, 6-4  
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. What did you think of your match?   
 GAÃL MONFILS: Not bad. I started off well. I was aggressive. And then, I don't know, I changed. I was watching him playing instead of staying aggressive or very dynamic.   
 He gave me trouble in the game of 2-1 on my serve. After that, I was trying too much to run around my backhand and playing forehands instead of staying more simple and using my backhand. This opened wide angles for him, and it was easier.   
  
  Q. Do you have any regrets?   
 GAÃL MONFILS: Yes. I should have been more into the match. Instead, I was too happy.   
  
  Q. Do you feel you should change your approach before this kind of match since Federer has been losing more often lately or do you always stay the same?  
 GAÃL MONFILS: I am always the same. I was never afraid of anyone. I always approach a match in the same way.   
  
  Q. In the middle of the first set you stopped using the same tactics and you had trouble getting back into the match?  
 GAÃL MONFILS: Well, I was happy with the way I was feeling the ball and that I was hitting. I really believe today I could have done something against him.   
  
  Q. How can you compare his game today with the other times you played him? You had two matches in two months against him.   
 GAÃL MONFILS: Well, here is on clay. I believe today he didn't play as good as in Miami.   
  
  Q. Were you staying behind the baseline because you didn't play enough matches or did you want to be more reassured about your game?   
 GAÃL MONFILS: No. I believe everything is coming back fairly well. My clay court game is falling into place. What I'm trying to do is put all the pieces of the puzzle together. I believe I should be doing that a bit faster than I am.
