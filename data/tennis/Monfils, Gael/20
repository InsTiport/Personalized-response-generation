(Transcribed from ATP recorded audio.)
Q. How bad is the ankle?  How proud are you of fighting through it?
GAEL MONFILS: I don't know.  I going to find out in a couple minutes.  I was happy that I fought no matter what.  As I say, I felt good this week, tried to give my best.
I think I showed today also that I was a fighter.  Now I hope is not that bad.  Honestly, I don't know.  I need to relax and see in two hours if I'll be fine to play another match.  The match is going to be a good one.  I don't know if my body is ready yet, but I find out.
Q. Roberto is such a fighter, a wall.  It was going to be physically demanding against him.
GAEL MONFILS: Yeah, he's not missing.  He's very accurate.  Yeah, you need to step up and be patient, yeah, be very aggressive.
