G. MONFILS/M. Shanan Zayed
  6‑0, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Congratulations.   Can you just talk to us about the match and how you felt on court?
GAÃL MONFILS:   Well, I think it was a good start, a good start.   I think my opponent was a bit nervous today, and then it's always tough for a young player to play I think a player at his home tournament.
But actually, you know, I played simple and then I was happy.

Q.   Is it difficult sometimes to play someone and stay concentrated throughout the whole match, someone whose level is not necessarily like yours?   Because in the second set you did lose your serve once, right?
GAÃL MONFILS:   Yeah, twice.   I think I lost my serve twice.   But then I was just trying stuff.
Obviously he was playing a bit better and put the ball in.   He had two breaks.   That's good.

Q.   Is your shoulder fine?
GAÃL MONFILS:   Yeah.   Hopefully. 

Q.   Do you prefer to have a comfortable match like that to start with or something a bit more difficult? 
GAÃL MONFILS:   Well, for sure I prefer more difficult.   I think for me prefer play a tough opponent because I need matches.
So it's okay.   I take it.   You know, I'm happy.   It's a win.   It's a win, it's a win.
But, yeah, for sure tomorrow will be interesting.

Q.   Do you expect to get more match nerves because you have played so few matches in the last few months, too?
GAÃL MONFILS:   Yeah.   I expect like tough match like tomorrow for sure I will have a tough match.
You know, it just sometime it's good to have match like that, but obviously, you know, at this point I prefer to have a tough match.

Q.   How do you get on against Philipp Kohlschreiber?
GAÃL MONFILS:   Well, it will be interesting because it will be my first time out on the court against a tough opponent.   I know Philipp is tough to move, is tough to play against him.   He's always a rival with long matches.
No, I expect to be aggressive and try to just be myself again, and, you know, I will try to enjoy.

Q.   Is your performance more important than the outcome of the match?
GAÃL MONFILS:   Yeah, I think my performance for sure will be, will be pleased to have a nice performance.
But a win is still a win, but if I can win and play good, why not?
