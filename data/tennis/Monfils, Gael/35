7-6, 7-5, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  I don't know how aware you are, but a speed gun went a bit faulty on one of your serves, and we all thought you had done the fastest serve in Wimbledon history, 150 miles per hour.  
GAÃL MONFILS: Yeah, I saw that.   
 Q.  But later on it was taken away.  They said it was a faulty speed gun.  Were you aware of it?  
GAÃL MONFILS: I saw 150.  But then I don't know if it's good or not.  It was cool (smiling).   
 Q.  It would have been nice?  
GAÃL MONFILS: It would have been nice, yeah.  But 150 is super fast.   
 Q.  How did you feel about it?  
GAÃL MONFILS: It was strange, actually.  But anyway.  I'm happy the way I am.  Still my record is 142, so it's very cool.   
 Q.  You must be very proud to beat such a big player?  
GAÃL MONFILS: Yeah, today was good.  Today was good.  Was happy.  Straight sets.  Stats can be better, but, yeah, I think I was solid today.  Was happy about that.
