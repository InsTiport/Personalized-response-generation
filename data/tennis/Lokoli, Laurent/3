  THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English? 
    LAURENT LOKOLI:   Before we start, I can tell you that the Twitter account is not my page, my Twitter page.   I don't know ‑‑people have seen Twitter.   I'm not one of these guys with Twitter or Facebook.   Anything you can see, it's not me.   I have not done anything. 
    I wanted to say that before we started interview.     
    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French.

Q.   What about this buzz all around you?   That's probably something that you created on the central court.   There were incredible moments that lasted.   Is this something that frightens you, or is this like a driving force for you?   Because all of a sudden, you know, it explodes, as you said. 
    LAURENT LOKOLI:   Well, I think I told you that, yes, it started.   I hope it's going to continue.   It's a light that we have lit that I hope is not going to be put out.   Some players would be afraid of all that. 
    On the contrary, I think I'm on the right tracks, but then I will have to continue.   It's all very nice to have these people around you wanting you.   Means that your results are good and that things are going along smoothly. 
    But then I'm not yet flying.   You shouldn't do this.   You have to be calm and think about the tournament that's going to start tomorrow for me.   That's something very important, you see.   It's always important to be a professional.   Even though I'm young, I know it's the most important thing that is to be in my bubble, calm.

Q.   How can you be that cool‑minded when you've launched perhaps not a character, because I suppose that's what you are, but you're creating some things probably not easy.   Or do you feel can you do this easily?
    LAURENT LOKOLI:   Yeah, of course, certainly everything is natural.   That's the way I am.   That's my style, my status, is that of a showman or sometimes they call me in Spanish "el loco," the crazy man.   I like this nickname, even though it's the first time I heard it.   But it gave me a smile. 
    And then I very much appreciate the image that people have of me, that is, it's me, very natural.   As I said before, I want to be accessible and kind. 
    And also I'm someone who, how can I say, feels very much concerned about a number of events in the world, which was the case in the Balkans with Novak.   And as I said before, I very much like the player and the man he is. 
    That's the reason that I wanted to come back on the courts, to give a little happiness to all of these people who, you know, unfortunately have suffered from the floods.   It's awful.   I hope that they'll manage and that they will get fans, quite a lot of fans, and that it's going to go better for them.   That's the only thing I wish.

Q.   Were you close to GaÃ«l Monfils before this dance battle?   Is he a source of inspiration from the music or tennis point of view?
    LAURENT LOKOLI:   Well, maybe I talked to him once or twice, I think, but that's the maximum.   Or in the fitness room during the year.   That's all we would say, hello, hello, and that's all. 
    But this time, of course, you know what happened.   Singers, singers who meet in the locker rooms.   You know what might happen is there is this feeling that emerges, and we like cracking jokes and who is the best of us.
    You know, we are fighters, and we like that, something we enjoy, to always win.
    But I like GaÃ«l's personality, even though I don't know him that well.   That's true.   That was huge.   He's so kind as a player.   Frankly, he made me laugh in the locker rooms.   He was dancing already in the locker rooms.   I think he's so endearing with such an aura, a charisma, which is huge. 
    And then the court, who can dare and say he's not a monster.   He's got all the best shots as a tennis player.   Physically he's a titan, you know, he's got such an incredible forehand, such a player. 
    And frankly, I think that GaÃ«l can do a lot better than what he does at present.   He can truly, I think, he's in the top 10, the world top 10.
    When I was a child I remember that he was a showman himself.   I was watching TV at the time.   You know what I wanted at the time?   I wanted to be him, to do what he was doing, because that's something I like, to show off a little.   Well, to be a showman, rather.

Q.   What about your very first minutes here as a player in Roland Garros?   As opposed to when you would come here as a child.   But what about the very first minutes and hours?   Was there something that really caught your eye?
    LAURENT LOKOLI:   Do you mean as a player or during the qualification rounds? 

Q.   No, I mean, when you entered the draw. 
    LAURENT LOKOLI:   Well, you know, two different mind‑sets.   When I was playing for the qualification, what I wanted to do is show that I could get qualified.   I was very much focused, which is the case today still.   You know, I wanted to prove something.

Q.   (Off microphone.)
    LAURENT LOKOLI:   Well, you know, when you play during the qualification rounds, you know, Suzanne Lenglen, I know the court, I'm always here throughout the year, I know the courts here, so playing for the tournament itself is something incredible.   It's my first Grand Slam.
    You know, when you think about it, you're going to play this tournament.   It's incredible, fantastic.   But then what you're saying is that, Okay, if you get qualified, that's a different world, another tournament for me. 
    And, you know, I was praying, praying to be against Roger Federer for the first round.   You know, you want to play against your idol.   It's the way it is.   You want to put out your best tennis.
    But the draw is such that I'm not going to be playing against him.   It's the way it is.   Maybe I can play against him another time.
    But otherwise, yeah, that's true, a major tournament, a huge one.   If I were to choose a Grand Slam, it would be this one for me to stand out, that's for sure.   This is the thing that really matters. 
    Well, I was very much impressed, that's true, by all of that.   You know, the crowd and whatnot, it's great.   Everybody who has come from Corsica for this event.   And the buzz in Corsica, I'm so very happy about this, to be able to talk about my island, Corsica.   You know, it's amazing, extraordinary. 
    And then when I got qualified, now I'm in the main draw.   That's when I realized that I was with the top 10, the best players in the world.   And then when I was back in the locker rooms, I'm not far from Novak Djokovic's locker room.   So look at this.   It's so incredible. 
    And it's the rest, as well, not just the locker rooms.   There is the rest.   There was also something, an event called the Kids' Day.   It was incredible, fantastic.   I have so many memories already.
    I hope it's going to continue.   But as I said before, you know, I think I'm someone who is smart and simple.   So the most important thing is to say, All this is really nice, I love it, but now I'm a player in the main draw.   My dreams will not stop now.   I'm not going to tell you what my dreams are, I will keep them to myself. 
    But I have to keep cool and I know who I am and where I stand, and I know at present I have the lowest ranking on the main draw, and I have been able to show that I can play good tennis.   But, you know, I have to focus on the tournament.   Maybe I'm going to lose tomorrow or defeat the other player, but I'll put out my best tennis, and Roland Garros for me is an extraordinary experience for me.   I hope there will be many more to come.

Q.   Can you tell us more about the places you have been to or the people who are important for you up to now? 
    LAURENT LOKOLI:   Well, on the Continent, you said, since I have arrived on the Continent, you're saying?   Well, first, my family, they count a lot, but unfortunately there has been dramas in my family, and that's why I've got this temper and character.   That's why I'm this man today that you can see. 
    I reached the world of adults earlier than many other teenager.   That's something very important I wanted to underscore, so with the people whom I lost I move forward, with them still being in my heart and in my head.   I'm very strong in my head. 
    And I discussed a lot with my parents.   My parents, you know, they always supported me.   And also, you know what they told me?   They never said something that was like patting my back.   They said, if you want this, you have to work hard for this always.   My father, he was working so hard when he was a professional player.   I discussed this a lot with him, and my mother, she worked hard, as well, always.   She had all her certificates and diplomas.   She's worked so hard. 
    My parents, it's not like they come from an easy environment.   I know that life is not easy.   It's a tough thing, life is.   And if you potentially have to use it and work hard, and, yeah, I was well surrounded. 
    My best friend Antoine Rioli, who I'd like to say hello and say thank you to.   He's big.   He's a big person.   He's given me a lot in terms of, you know, human relationships.   He's given me this taste for many things.   And to seize all opportunities, to enjoy them, and also come up when I was feeling down as a tennis player.   It's not easy when you're down as a tennis player. 
    I was lucky, I was well surrounded and supported.   And also, I got the total support from the League, the Federation.   They were always with me.   And they knew I could do something good.
    As I said, last year at the same time I was ranked 1,100, so I went up 800 ranks because I worked well.
    But my game was not that good, that is, it took me time before I could find my game, my style.   It's based on many things, you see.   And then I managed to put together all the parameters so as to develop and draw up my game philosophy, my style.   That's the most important thing.
    And without the support of my family, my friends, and also all those of La Porta Marina restaurant, and I wanted to say hello to them, it's thanks to them, as well.   Without them I wouldn't be on the courts. 
    On the courts I'm alone, of course, but it's all the ones who surround me.   It's part and parcel of the good images in my head, the things that make me move forward and continue as a player.
    It's the most important thing and positive things, good vibes from my people.   They're wonderful, they're great, and they're still supporting me.
    So, to me, this really is the most important thing.

Q.   You were talking about your game philosophy.   What type of tennis player are you or would you like to become, and what's your tennis style?
    LAURENT LOKOLI:   I think I'm powerful as a player.   I can be an offensive player.   I like coming up to the net.   I like provoking things, you know.   I don't really like to wait, even though I can be a good defender, as well, when things are getting tough, when the other players are attacking me.
    I like having the upper hand on the game with my forehand.   And also, I like hitting hard, hitting hard, etcetera.   I like hitting hard into the balls.   And when I can, I come to the net.   And also, serve and volley is what I like.   So an attacking player as much as I can.

Q.   When you were young did you hesitate between football and soccer and tennis?   Do you play football at all?
    LAURENT LOKOLI:   That's true, when I was really a kid.   I liked both sports.   And, well, all of us when we were kids, we'd kick the ball at school, you know, with friends at school.   We would play with friends at school.   That's the memories I have, in any case.
    Yeah, I had to choose.   And then my father said, You've got to choose now.   And he was right.   I wanted to be good in either of these, and I chose tennis, because I thought that's the sport I want more than football, because I was watching or I would watch Roland Garros with Nadal, Federer, Agassi, and all these major players.   I thought, I want to be like them one day. 
    And I chose tennis therefore, because this really was the reason for me to do something.   Well, football is the sport I like as well very much.   I support the Sporting Club of Bastia, so I try and see as many matches as I can. 
    I'm a lefty, so that's a bit strange.   But that's strange.   Sometimes I play with friends as well in a room, that is, indoors football, with friends and that's all.   Nothing special about it.
