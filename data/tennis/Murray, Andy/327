 A. MURRAY/M. Granollers
  6‑4, 7‑6 
  
ANDY MURRAY:   I was pretty nervous before the match, which is a good sign.   I remember after the US Open last year, I kind of went into the Asia swing.   I didn't feel nervous on the court.   I felt pretty relaxed and loose, not too worried about what was happening.   
It was a bit different today.   I was pretty nervous beforehand.   That was a good sign.   I'm pretty ready to move forward and not think too much about Wimbledon and concentrate on the US Open.   
   
 Q.   Good to get that first win under your belt?  
ANDY MURRAY:   I think if I'd lost today, it just breaks the momentum a little bit.   The more matches I can get in the next few weeks, the better.   
No matter how much you practice, it's still different when you go out there.   You get a little bit nervous.   It's a little bit windy and you can lose your timing in practice.   You just hit through that and you move through it, it doesn't make a difference.   When you're out there in match conditions, it's different.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
ANDY MURRAY:   I think in some ways.   It's nice, probably never feel that same pressure again.   That's why I was nervous today.   That's why I'm really happy.   It wasn't my best tennis, I didn't play perfect tennis, but the nerves were there and that's a good sign.   
   
 Q.   Did you actually understand the introduction?  
ANDY MURRAY:   I heard a little bit.   
   
 Q.   Looking forward to hearing it in English?   
ANDY MURRAY:   It's nice.   Because before, all of the matches when I was playing Roger sometimes, his announcement, they would have to start at the beginning of the warmup and would barely finish it by the time you sit down.   It's nice to have won one or two of the big tournaments.
