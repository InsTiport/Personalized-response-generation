A. MURRAY/G. Dimitrov
  6‑3, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   I know you were probably keeping an eye on other people's results, but is it quite nice to secure that spot to London with one of your results rather than somebody else's?
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, I mean‑‑ yeah, it was.   I don't really know what else to say so that.   Obviously it was nice to not have to worry about what everyone else is doing.
Yeah, it was good. 

Q.   Considering where you were at the US Open ranking‑wise, how do you rank this as an achievement?   It's not winning a title, but getting into London as high as you have now, what sort of the achievement is that for you?
ANDY MURRAY:   Well, yeah, I mean, it's nice, but I did feel like I was starting to play good tennis at that period of the year.   Obviously at this stage of the year last season after New York I didn't play at all because of the surgery.
So, you know, I've enjoyed playing indoors throughout my career.   I like it.   Yeah, it's been a strong, strong few weeks.
In terms of an achievement, I don't know.   For me I would be more happy that I've been able to play this much tennis.   My body has felt good.   I've recovered well from long matches.   I've kept going. 
Would've been easy after some of the weeks and some of the matches to have, you know, waited to see what everyone else is going to do and not played here or whatever. 
Because, you know, last few weeks have been tough, but I've had some good wins.
Yeah, it's been good.

Q.   What is it that you like about playing indoors?   It's not as big a part of calendar as it used to be, but pretty much you pretty much play as much as possible. 
ANDY MURRAY:   Well, I grew up playing indoors, so I was used to it from a young age.   I guess it's like some of the Spaniards growing up on clay, I grew up on indoor hard courts.   So that would be my most natural surface, really.
I played on it before I moved over to Spain.   Until I moved over to Spain at 15, that was the surface that I practiced on three, four, days a week.   When I was back home I always played on that surface.   That's why I like it. 

Q.   How would you assess your performance today particularly compared with some of the other matches you've had in the last six weeks? 
ANDY MURRAY:   There were no downs really in the match.   I mean, some of the matches that I've had against the top, top players I had some periods in the match where my level had dropped off a little bit, and, you know, the best players capitalize on those moments.
I didn't have any of them today.   I played well from start to finish.   I made it very difficult for Grigor.   Hardly made any mistakes at all throughout the match.
So it was good.   I don't think he had any break points either, so obviously served well and played well behind my serve.   That helps, especially indoors. 

Q.   Just going back to indoors, do you like the sort of rock concert element, the light show and theatrics that go on here and the O2?
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, I always think if you get a good atmosphere indoors you feel it more because you don't lose any of the noise out of the stadium.   Everything stays inside, and it always seems like it's a bit louder.
Yeah, I mean, I guess it depends on where you're playing.   The atmosphere here is good.   Especially when you're playing against the French players it's very good.
The O2 has always been great there.
Yeah, often depends on how full the stadium is, and also, I don't know, how close the people are to the court.   That always adds to the atmosphere, in my opinion. 

Q.   Can you tell us a bit more about the little autograph you left on the camera lens.   Was it a kind after jibe at your critics?
ANDY MURRAY:   No, it wasn't a jibe, it's a bit of fun.   I mean, of people are going to ask me all the time why I've had such a poor year by my standards, then, yeah, you're allowed sometimes to say something in response to that.
I don't tend to do that often, but, look, it's been a hard year, a tough year, but it hasn't been a bad year.   Could have been a lot worse.   Coming back from a surgery is not easy at all, and I learned that.   The first few months of this year it was very difficult, and I had to dig deep at the end of this year in some ways to salvage the year, if you like. 
But, yeah, it's been a good year.   Not been my best year, but I would've signed up for being in this position when I had the surgery last year, I think. 

Q.   Just some thoughts on your next opponent. 
ANDY MURRAY:   It will be tough regardless of who it is.   GaÃ«l obviously loves playing here.   He has big support here.   The fans love watching him.
And Novak has played some great tennis over the last few months winning Wimbledon, and is No. 1 in the world again for a reason.   He's obviously going to be very motivated as well trying to finish the season No. 1. 
Be a tough match.
