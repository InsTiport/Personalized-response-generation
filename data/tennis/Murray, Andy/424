  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How have things been going with you for the last couple of days here?   Obviously you've been practicing hard.   How's it been?
ANDY MURRAY:   It's been good.   It's been really warm, good, tough conditions to train in.   Very windy, as well, today.   It often gets like that during the tournament, so it's actually been really good to get used to that. 
I mean, conditions are very different the last week in Indian Wells, so the only positive about playing badly there is that I got an extra few days to get ready for the tournament here, get used to the conditions a little bit longer.

Q.   No aches and pains? 
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, everything feels good.   Again, I mean, there's only a few things that, you know, after last week you need to look forward and then look at all the positives.   You know, that's another thing, is the few extra days to sort of rest the body. 
It's quite a long start to the year with the training I did before Dubai, as well.   Good to just get a few days to let things settle down and get ready.

Q.   Have you been hitting mainly here or at the university?
ANDY MURRAY:   I hit here every practice except one.   I hit at the courts off site in the Key Colony.
But, yeah, I have been here the rest of the time.   The courts at the university are much quicker than here.   They repainted the ones here only a few weeks ago.   They were just starting to do that when I was training here before Dubai.   So the court is a bit slower.

Q.   Are you finding the courts here faster than Indian Wells?   What's your take on that?
ANDY MURRAY:   I mean, the courts at Indian Wells are very slow.   They're also very slow here, too.   I mean, the ball, because of the dry air in the desert, is faster than it is here, so the court plays a bit slower here.

Q.   With the Olympics approaching this summer at Wimbledon, how are your feelings going into it?   Are you starting to feel any pressure escalating, or going one day at a time?
ANDY MURRAY:   Not yet.   I have been asked now pretty much every week.   I'm sure that will build up more and more in the leadup to it, but I have a lot of other things occupying my mind now other than the Olympics.   But it should be great.
You know, I think with it being at Wimbledon as well that will probably add an extra‑‑ add a little bit extra pressure, but also make it extra special, as well. 
Yeah, I was involved in the last Olympics.   I didn't play well, but it was a great experience being around all the other athletes and stuff.   So hopefully I can have a good run there, and I look forward to it.

Q.   Fernando GonzÃ¡lez is going to retire this tournament.   Do you have any opinion about his career or his decision? 
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, well, about the decision, it's completely his decision.   I don't have an opinion on that. 
I have an opinion on his career, though.   I think everybody would agree he's one of the most exciting players to watch.   He had a massive forehand, one of the biggest probably ever.   He could hit winners from anywhere on the court.   Great character.   He's quite up and down emotionally, but that's something that made him fun to watch.
Yeah, I practiced with him quite a lot and I get on very well with him.   He's a really nice guy, too.   So I wish him well with his retirement.   He had a fantastic career.

Q.   He is trying to find some good players to play in Chile in order to get his retirement... 
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, he obviously doesn't think I'm a good player because he's not asked me yet (Laughter.)
But, yeah, I'm sure there will be a lot of guys that will be up for playing some exhibitions against him and stuff.
