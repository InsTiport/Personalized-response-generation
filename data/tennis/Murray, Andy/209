 A. MURRAY/V. Troicki
  6‑3, 7‑6 
   
 Q.   One great effort today.   Now what before the final?   
ANDY MURRAY:   Well, just go and see my physio, get straightened out, get some food down me, and shower.   
Yeah, just get myself ready for the final now.   
   
 Q.   What about Kevin Anderson and his serve?   Are you looking forward to taking that on?  
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, I enjoy playing big servers.   It's always a challenge.   
The return has always been the strongest part of my game.   I will need to return well later if I want to have a chance at winning and I look forward to it.
