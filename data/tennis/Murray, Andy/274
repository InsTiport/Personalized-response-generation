  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Your back issues are resolved.   You've got AmÃ©lie on board.   Does this feel like a new start, a new chapter almost in your career?
ANDY MURRAY:   I don't know.   I mean, obviously every time you start with a new coach, you bring something different, a different perspective.   You know, there is a different sort of tennis language, if you like, a different way of speaking about things.   That's obviously different. 
But, you know, I feel good.   I train hard.   In a period after Wimbledon I didn't take too much time off.   I feel like I'm ready to play some good tennis.

Q.   The Daily Mail this morning had a piece about you going firm with AmÃ©lie for the rest of the season.   You must be happy with how it's going if that's the case, and I wonder if you have been surprised during these last couple of months at how the media focused on her being a woman rather than her credentials as a coach and a player. 
ANDY MURRAY:   I haven't read anything after Wimbledon.   I haven't really seen anything that's been said, because often it's wrong and incorrect information so I don't read much of it. 
But I have really enjoyed working with her.   I feel like she's helped me a lot.   Yeah, it started off well, in my opinion.   We had a good training block in Miami, worked well.   She integrated well with the rest of the team and the physical trainers, you know, listened a lot to what they had to say.
Yeah, it's been a good start.   You know, now it's about me producing the results on the court.   I feel like I put myself in a good position to do that.   I had a good few weeks over in Miami.

Q.   You have had some success here in Canada.   How do you compare playing in Canada versus tournaments and Grand Slams overseas?   Any difference in terms of the atmosphere, the environment?
ANDY MURRAY:   No, I mean, every tournament is different.   You know, the atmosphere at the tournaments I played in Canada has been very good.   I think also right now with the way things are going with Canadian tennis I would expect they would have some really, really good crowds here.   I was hearing on the TV today they were expecting record crowds.   So, you know, that's great. 
Yeah, it's always a good atmosphere.   The night matches, as well, they get fantastic crowds.   And even today, there is no main‑draw matches being played and it's packed.   You don't see that at many tournaments.

Q.   Are you able to clarify what's happening with AmÃ©lie now if the other report is correct basically that there is a long‑term partnership now betweenyou?   
ANDY MURRAY:   I'm planning on working with her for the foreseeable future.   I sat down with her the day after Wimbledon, and I really enjoyed working with her over the grass court season and she enjoyed working with the team, and then that was it, basically. 
You know, we obviously made a plan for the next few months and the buildup up to the US Open.   She was over in Miami for two weeks, as well, and then she's going to be here. 
Danny is going to come to Cincinnati, and then Danny and AmÃ©lie will both be there at the US Open.
Yeah, that's the plan for now.   But I plan on working with her for longer than post‑US Open, for sure.

Q.   It was suggested that she's agreed to be that 25 weeks on the tour with you.   Is that correct?
ANDY MURRAY:   Well, yeah.   I told the press that quite a while ago, to be honest.   But, yeah, that's the plan.   And, yeah, she will ‑‑ you know, I don't want to get into, you know, the exact number of weeks, because I was also told that, you know, like Edberg was going to do nine weeks with Federer this year and he's been at pretty much every tournament since the Australian Open. 
We have agreed to work together, and I think from both sides we're kind of willing to do what it takes to make it work long term. 

Q.   What's AmÃ©lie's exact role with you?   Can you be more specific as to which aspect of your tennis she's working on with you?
ANDY MURRAY:   She will be my coach, so she will do the same role that every coach does for every player, you know, which is to work on all aspects of the game tactically, psychologically, a little bit technically but not so much, to be honest, and then, yeah, scheduling. 
Yeah, everything.   She will be involved in all of my training blocks and, yeah, pretty much what every coach does for each player.

Q.   Is there any added pressure on you when you've won a tournament in the past like the Rogers Cup in '09 and '10, is there any added pressure, if you've won something in the past to win it again or is it just another tournament?
ANDY MURRAY:   No, I think, you know, each week, you know, you enter a tournament‑‑ I mean, a lot of the higher seeds don't play that many tournaments during the year.   They maybe play 17, 18 tournaments.   So most tournaments are important. 
Right now, you know, I mean, Novak obviously hasn't played since Wimbledon, Roger hasn't played since Wimbledon, I didn't play since Wimbledon, Wawrinka, you know, and then some of the big guys, Berdych and Raonic, those guys have played only one event.
So, you know, it's important to get matches in before the US Open, as well, and, you know, here is the start of the summer and, you know, with only two tournaments to get ready for the US Open, very important to do well here.

Q.   You're at 10 in the world now.   How much does that bother you or does it motivate you?   Does it factor into your preparations at all?
ANDY MURRAY:   Well, yeah, I would defend myself and say there is a reason for that.   I did miss, you know, the whole of the end of last season after the US Open with back surgery, you know.   And then also you don't just come back after surgery and feel great straightaway the first few months.
So, you know, I was happy with the French Open.   That went well.   You know, Wimbledon obviously not quite as well as I would have liked, although I felt like I played some good tennis before my loss there.   I felt like I was playing pretty well.
Yeah, the rankings don't lie.   I need to, you know, start winning more matches, to push my ranking back up there.   The main goal for me is to try to win Grand Slams.   That's what motivates me.   That's why I want to train, yeah. 

Q.   You talked about getting plenty of matches in before the US Open.   Last year you had a really good run here in the doubles.   Were you tempted to use that again to sort of build up your match sharpness or did it just not work logically?
ANDY MURRAY:   No, I wasn't originally going to have a bye in the tournament because I would have been‑‑ before Rafa pulled out, I was told I was going to be playing on Monday evening a little while ago.
So I planned all of my training and everything around playing my first match on Monday evening and, you know, arranged to come here on Thursday to get here a little bit earlier to get used to the conditions. 
Yeah, I had been asked by a couple of the guys‑‑ Colin had asked me to play doubles, and I said to him, Sorry, but I'm not going to have a bye so I don't want to play.
Then, yeah, obviously I found out Wednesday afternoon/evening when Rafa pulled out, so I had thought about it, but not this year.
