A. MURRAY/D. Young
  6‑4, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You like playing him, don't you?
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah.   I mean, I played well against him the last couple of times.   Obviously today was a very different match to Davis Cup; completely different conditions.
I mean, you know, the tactics that you go into the match with completely change because of the weather and the wind.
But, yeah, I have played well against him the last few times.

Q.   How punishing was it heat‑wise?
ANDY MURRAY:   The heat was okay.   I mean, the wind obviously cooled you down a little bit when you were at the end changes. 
I mean, it's obviously extremely humid, but it was more the wind that made, you know, the tennis tricky. 
Obviously sometimes it can be ridiculously hot, and that makes managing the points and, you know, your emotions and I guess your physical condition, you need to manage it a bit during the match; whereas today it was just very tough weather to play good tennis in.
So I just tried to play smart, and it worked.

Q.   Is it fair to say you're possibly more familiar with the conditions out there than you are in Wimbledon Centre Court conditions?
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah.   I never practice at Wimbledon on the centre court.   You're not allowed to. 
So I spend hours, hundreds and hundreds of hours practicing on that court; whereas at Wimbledon obviously played quite a lot of matches there, but I don't know if I played more matches on the centre court Wimbledon or center court here. 
I have played quite a few on both, but then, yeah, each week I would practice, I don't know, when I'm here, 14 hours at least on that court.
Over the last seven, eight years, I have spent a lot of time on it.
