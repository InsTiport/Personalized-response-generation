 A. MURRAY/M. Matosevic
      6‑3, 6‑1, 6‑3 
  
    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please.   
   
 Q.   Have you served that well in a little while?   Looked pretty good.   
    ANDY MURRAY:   I served fairly well a couple of weeks ago, I said at the time, in Madrid and stuff.   Even though the rest of my game wasn't where I wanted it to be.   I said at the time I was feeling like I was serving well.   
    It was a good serving performance today, especially when I was down in games, in the game I got broken right at the end it was not down to my serving, really.   I just missed a few other shots.  
    But it was good serving.  
   
 Q.   That was a very comprehensive victory.   There were moments you were getting pretty cross with yourself, calling yourself an idiot and all that kind of thing.   
    ANDY MURRAY:   I think when you guys are that close to the court, you're going to pick up on everything that's said during the match.   
    But, you know, from a player's perspective, beginning of the sets and in the early rounds of slams when you get up a set, the beginning of sets are very important to try and get ahead whilst the opponent's head is down a little bit.   
    And there was a couple games right at the beginning of the set where I had opportunities to break.   One very long deuce game.   I had Love‑40, and maybe it took me six or seven breakpoints to get it.   
    But, you know, I was just trying to make sure that my intensity was there every moment, especially at the beginning of the sets.  
    I managed to get ahead early in all of them, and that helped.  
   
 Q.   Kohlschreiber next.   I'm assuming you're expecting a tricky match there?  
    ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, very tough, very tough match for me.   I played him once before on clay and I think I got three games or something.  
    It will be very tough.   He obviously won the tournament last week.   He's not dropped a set here, I don't think.   So, yeah, he will be very tough, very good player.  
   
 Q.   What do you remember of that match in Monte‑Carlo?  
    ANDY MURRAY:   I remember not playing particularly well.   I was very disappointed after the match.  
    Over the years I have had a few matches like that in Monte‑Carlo where I've lost fairly comfortably, lost to Stan last year very quickly, as well.   
    Beginning of the clay court season I have had some tough matches over the years, so I don't remember a whole lot about it in terms of exactly what happened during the match.   It just wasn't a pleasant memory for me.  
   
 Q.   HBO show, "NHL," they mic up the players during the games.   You hear the things they say to each other, colorful cursing, it can be entertaining.   Do you ever think how entertaining if you were ever mic'd up during one of your matches, talking to yourself?   
    ANDY MURRAY:   I think a lot of the players it would be very interesting.   I think the players that speak in English everybody picks up on that.   
    But some of the stuff, and I have said it before, some of the stuff that guys say in other languages a lot worse than, you know, the couple of words that I tend to use on the court.   There is a few phrases that some of the guys use, and they're not pretty.  
   
 Q.   Spanish, you're talking about, particularly?  
    ANDY MURRAY:   Well, yeah.   Yeah, some of the ones in Spanish aren't great.   Some of the Italian phrases, as well, are not so good.   Some of the Serbian phrases also aren't great, either (laughter).  
    I'm not the only one that talks to myself.   Yeah, I think what I say is fairly mild compared to the guys that speak the other languages that people don't pick up on.  
   
 Q.   Are you glad that no one can hear it ever except if they are sitting right next to the court or do you wish there was a way for people to sort of hear the monologues these players give sometimes?  
    ANDY MURRAY:   I don't think people really need or want to hear that stuff.   Yeah, I think, you know, it's fine just watching the matches.   
    I think sometimes you can obviously pick up on the microphones, that are kind of all over the court, I think it's sometimes nice to hear what the players are discussing with the umpires, you know, when there has been whatever, a line call or a problem on the court, that's interesting.  
    But then someone saying, whatever, crap, when they miss a ball, I mean, I don't think anyone really cares about that.   
   
 Q.   There are lots of rumors about who is going to be your next coach.   Last one was AmÃ©lie Mauresmo.   How do you feel about that?   Is it annoying you?   Do you have fun about it?  
    ANDY MURRAY:   Well, you know, to be honest, ever since, you know, I stopped working with Ivan, there has been a lot of different names that people are mentioned.   Obviously AmÃ©lie this week.   There was Wilander.   There has been Bjorkman, John McEnroe, Navratilova, Leon Smith, who is the Davis Cup captain, Bob Brett.   There has been a lot of people that people have talked about.   
    You just have to, yeah, just kind of put up with it.   When the time is right I will make an announcement.   But nothing to say just yet.  
   
 Q.   And some was rumored to be your next coach, is one good or some names not all good ones?  
    ANDY MURRAY:   No, they are all very, very good.   Some ex‑players, some very good coaches, as well.   It's not like any of them have been bad names.   I like all of the people that have been mentioned.   I have a good relationship with most of them, as well.   Some of them I don't even know, really.  
    So, yeah, no bad names there.  
   
 Q.   None of these names are the next coaches for you?   That's all rumors?  
    ANDY MURRAY:   Not that I'm aware of, no.  
   
 Q.   Apart from the serving you must be pleased over the way you attacked his second serve?   
    ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, I returned very well in the second serve.   I attacked it very well.   My timing was there on both sides, forehand and backhand side on that shot.  
    Yeah, that was, yeah, for me, was the best part of my game today.  
   
 Q.   I'm not expecting any names, but have you talked to any potential female coaches?  
    ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, I've spoken to a few people, male and female.   You know, I've also spoken to, you know, a couple of people, you know, to get some advice as well.  
    Yeah, also, male and female, not people that are necessarily going to coach me, but people that could advise me on certain people.   Yeah, that's it.   I think that's what most players do when they're searching for a coach.   
    Right now in the middle of a tournament is not really the time when I'm sitting down and speaking to people and making phone calls.   That doesn't happen in the middle of a Grand Slam.  
   
 Q.   Every Grand Slam these days feels the need to modernize and get bigger and better.   Are you slightly somewhat disappointed that courts like the one today are going to be demolished and the great atmospheres that we have loved on courts like this you'll no longer be able to enjoy them anymore?  
    ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah.   I mean, obviously, you know, as players, when you come back to tournaments like this or the four slams really.   You know, sometimes there's nice changes that are great for everyone, and, you know, the tournament need to do to grow.   
    But that's not necessarily, you know, the players may not ‑‑might miss playing on courts like that.   It's normally pretty full.   You can get a great atmosphere, everyone ‑‑you guys are very, very close to the court.   The fans are very tight to the court, so it's a good one for viewing.   
    But who knows?   Maybe the court that they put down there might be even better.   I don't know.   
   
 Q.   What was it that you liked so much about Taylor Townsend yesterday?  
    ANDY MURRAY:   I love the way she played tennis, basically.   She played ‑‑she's just a really nice player to watch.   She hits the ball great.   She's very talented.   She volleys.   You don't see that much now ‑‑don't really see it on the men or the women's tour at all.  
    She had dropshots, she had angles, good attitude.   Yeah, she was just very fun to watch.   She's going to be a very good player.  
   
 Q.   Just to go back to the female coaches issue, do you think it would be good for tennis if one of the leading male players had a female coach, like a good message?  
    ANDY MURRAY:   I don't know.   I guess that's for everyone else to decide.   But, yeah, I don't know.   I mean, I'm sure people will talk about that, you know, when it happens, whether it's with me or with another player.  
    But I don't know.   I have no idea.   
   
 Q.   Would there be a stigma, do you think, attached to a man having a female coach or not?  
    ANDY MURRAY:   For me, I don't care.   I don't really care whether some of the other male players like it or not.   That doesn't ‑‑that's not something that really bothers me.   
    I was coached by my mum for a long time.   I have had her around at tournaments for a long time.   There has been ex‑players and stuff that have said, Oh, your mom shouldn't be around or she shouldn't come and support you or come to watch.  
    You know, it's silly.   Everyone is entitled to have the team around them that they want.   Everyone works very differently.  
    You know, some men might not work well with a female.   Some men might work well with a female coach.  
    It's just whatever your preference is and whatever your needs are.   That's basically it.
