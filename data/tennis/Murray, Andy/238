B. CORIC/A. Murray
  6‑1, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   What can you say after that?   The kid played incredibly well. 
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah.   I mean, I think, you know, he didn't make many errors.   He played very solid and he moved well.
I made way too many mistakes from the beginning of the match right through to the end, early in rallies, rushing points.
Quite similar to the match I played against Simon in Rotterdam, actually, which is, yeah, disappointing, obviously. 
But, yeah, he moved well, made a lot of balls, very few errors.   Made it tough.

Q.   Why do you think it happened that way?
ANDY MURRAY:   I don't know.   I just came off the court one minute ago.   I don't know exactly why that was the case, but yeah.   I mean, I'm pretty sure I know how the match went, and I don't think I'm being wrong in saying that I made a lot of basic errors, especially early in the rallies, I'd say more obviously in the first set than in the second, but yeah, wasn't good enough.

Q.   In a match like that, how difficult is it to adjust in the middle of a situation where you know things aren't going quite right?
ANDY MURRAY:   I have been quite capable of doing that in the past.   I tried a few different things today.   I tried to serve and volley a few points, tried to move forward a little bit more with, I guess you could say, some success.   Like in the last game I won a couple of points moving forward.   Then the third time I did it I missed a basic smash.
Yeah, like I was break point down I think at 3‑2, serve and volleyed, had a good volley and he hit sort of like a chip lob over my head, as well.   He came up with some good shots when I tried to move forward, and I also made a few errors at the end of the match that I would have hoped to have made.

Q.   How much had you seen of him playing since that first time you played him?   He's come on a lot since then. 
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, you know, players tend to, at 16 through until I would say 20, tend to make quite big strides.   You know, I would say his game style is similar.   He makes good decisions on the court.
He's stronger now.   He serves a bit better.   Defends better now, as well, because he's going to get stronger as he gets older.   So that's normal. 
Yeah, I mean, his ranking is obviously ‑‑I don't even know what it was when I played him the last time, but his ranking would suggest that he's made some big improvements.

Q.   Roger said yesterday quicker courts give lesser‑known players some help.   Would you agree?
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, I mean, I guess you'd say that maybe there would be more upsets on quicker courts, but this is a surface that I quite like playing on.   I like playing on quicker hard courts. 
You know, it was maybe‑‑ you know, I don't think the errors I was making today were down to the speed of the court, but normally on faster surfaces, if someone serves very well, it's harder to break.   That would make sense. 

Q.   When you went on court, how did you feel?   Did you feel normal or okay? 
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, I mean, I felt fine.   You know, I felt, yeah, I felt okay.   I wouldn't say I felt bad when I went on the court.
I would definitely say I was a little bit sluggish at the beginning of the match, but in the second set I definitely started to move a bit better and play a little bit better.   But, yeah, I started the match not good. 
You know, when you're playing at this level, you can't really get away with that.   So, yeah, I will need to try and improve on that, which, you know, it's strange because first couple of matches, similar sort of thing in Rotterdam.   I played, I felt, extremely well.   I moved very well.   Then at the same stage was a similar performance.   I was just rushing and making way too many mistakes.   I don't know why that was.

Q.   You're not a guy to sort of get videotaped and analyzed too much, but seeing as the same thing has happened pretty much two tournaments in a row, will you analyze them with AmÃ©lie or... 
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, I don't know if it's down to sort of me needing to analyze the match.   I mean, I know pretty much what happened.   It's more sort of a feeling that I had, and I definitely know that I rushed in both matches and made too many errors early in rallies and almost, yeah, kind of got stuck in how I wanted to play.
I was going for too much sometimes, and then like the 30‑All point in the last game, I was playing like six meters behind the baseline.   So there was no sort of balance there, you know.   That's something I'm going to have to figure out, you know, when maybe I'm not hitting the ball as well as I would like.
You know, if you're trying to play aggressive tennis, you're not hitting the ball that well.   You need to know how to just back off a little bit, play high‑percentage tennis.   When that's happened the last couple of weeks, I have not adjusted well at all. 

Q.   It's obviously not like losing in a Grand Slam or even a 1000 tournament.   What's been lost by this defeat for you?   Very much or not very much at all?
ANDY MURRAY:   Well, I guess you have to kind of look at the next few months and see what effect it would have on me.   It's my job to obviously not allow it to affect me. 
But we have the Davis Cup in what?   Eight days from now?   After that, Indian Wells and Miami.   So there are some big events, some very tough matches next weekend.   Yeah, we will see what effect it will have on me.
