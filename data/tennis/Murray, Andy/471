 Q. (Question about the match.) 
 ANDY MURRAY: It was tricky. The court is playing very, very slow for a grass court, quite a lot of rallies. I had a little chance at the end of the second set, didn't take it, and obviously he got back into it and started playing better but I managed to turn it around in the end.

 Q. You mentioned the court speed being the ticket. How did you find it after the weeks on clay?
 ANDY MURRAY: It's tough. The movement is something that takes a bit of time. I actually moved pretty well today considering it was the first match. It's good to get through.

 Q. The obligatory ankle question: How was it?
 ANDY MURRAY: Yeah, it was all right. It was a little bit sore at times. I've just got to get used to the new surface. 
 It's a little bit sore. It's getting better every day. Just got to keep doing the right things. 

 Q. Tipsarevic is up for you next. He's a player who's given you problems in the past. 
 ANDY MURRAY: He's a very good player. I lost to him here a few years ago. He's a good grass court player, tricky opponent. I have to play better than today if I want to win that one.
