A. MURRAY/J. Chardy
  6‑4, 3‑6, 6‑3, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English. 

Q.   How concerned did you get in the course of that match, second set and early third?
ANDY MURRAY:   I mean, I wasn't overly concerned.   I had a lot of chances in the second set.   He had one break point, which he obviously won.
But, I mean, throughout the course of the match I was creating many more opportunities than him.   I wasn't overly concerned.   I just had to, you know, take my chances when they came.
I did that in the third and fourth sets. 

Q.   The last time you played David on clay was three years ago here.   How different of a player are you from that time on this surface?
ANDY MURRAY:   I mean, I'm sure both of us will have changed and, you know, probably improved since that time.   I feel like I have a better understanding of how I need to play on this surface than I did back then, probably.
But, you know, David is a fantastic player on all of the surfaces.   But, you know, here he's had his best results, I think.   Out of all of the majors, he obviously made the final here.   You know, he's made some semis, as well.   Obviously be a big test for me, that match.

Q.   After all the rain and everything yesterday, was there a bit of an issue with the back of the court at the end in front of where your team was sitting?
ANDY MURRAY:   No, it wasn't that.   It's just obviously that court is quite tight.   Sometimes you get quite close to the linespeople.   It's just one of those things that obviously from the player's point of view, you get a bit distracted when you know you're sliding close to someone.   Like when you're about to take your racquet back, obviously you don't want it to hit the person.   Also, you want to try to play a stroke, as well, if you can. 
It was more, just more that.   It was nothing to do with the wetness of the court.

Q.   GaÃ«l sometime ago he lost against Roger and he said he wants to be more like the top players who seem never get ill, no sickness, no flu.   Do you think it's a discipline question, the reason why maybe you'll get less sick than other players?   Do you do something more careful? 
ANDY MURRAY:   Less sick? 

Q.   Less sick, like no flu or something?   Because you get more careful on when you get out with more coats or anything? 
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah.   I mean, I have obviously had my fair share of injuries throughout my career. 
In terms of illness, I mean, I don't go out late.   You know, I know a lot of my friends that go out and party very late, you know, often wake up with sore throats the next day, you know, and can get sick.   You know, you need to make sure you rest properly.
Obviously with the amount of traveling and stuff we do throughout the year, you do pick up little bugs.   But I never really say anything about that, you know, throughout the year when you do get sick.   Because it's not all of the time you feel perfect with the lifestyles that we live.
But I try to ‑‑yeah, I try to sleep properly, try to rest properly, eat properly.   And yeah, I have been quite lucky in that respect, I would say.

Q.   You played two very aggressive players who hit a lot of winners, but also give you a few unforced errors.   How difficult or how much of a challenge will it be now to play Ferrer, who is almost the opposite?   He's more consistent, maybe slightly more resilient?
ANDY MURRAY:   Well, I mean, it's going to be a tough match, because he's one of the best players in the world.   On this surface he's, you know, for sure of one of the top sort of four or five players in the world.
You know, obviously the higher ranked players you play, the less opportunities they give you, the less mistakes they give you, especially in important moments.   Which maybe someone who is more inexperienced, you know, may rush at certain moments or make bad decisions.   You know, that's not something that David does.
So, yeah.   I'm going to have to work extremely hard in that match and be very patient and try to dictate the play as much as I can.

Q.   17 straight quarterfinals or better at the Grand Slams.   I'm just wondering, that's obviously a terrific record. I'm just wondering how much sort of pleasure that gives you, that sort of unshowy consistency sort of compared to perhaps more the headline‑grabbing titles that you have won like Wimbledon, US Open?
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah.   Well, I don't think there is loads of players that have done that.   I mean, I have said a lot over the last five, six months that, you know, unfortunately, I'm playing against guys that make some of the things I have done look pretty average because of how good they have been. 
You know, Roger went through a period where he was making Grand Slam finals pretty much, you know, consistently and then he had the semifinal streak.   I know it was ridiculous, as well.   Then obviously his quarterfinal streak, I don't know how many it was, but it was something like 30‑odd ‑‑

Q.   34? 
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah.   So, yeah, in comparison to that, it's nothing.
But, you know, in terms of the history of the game, there is not loads of players that have been that consistent at these events. 
So yeah, that's something that I look at, and I'm very, very proud of.   Yeah, glad I have managed to maintain that consistency even when I've had, you know, obviously some tough periods over the last couple of years with the injuries and the back.

Q.   How much did you enjoy that with the crowd and everything?   They were getting quite into it at some point. 
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah.   I mean, it's very difficult to feel flat, really, when you play in an atmosphere like that.   You know, the whole crowd's pretty pumped from the beginning of the match. 
You know, it felt, for me, anyway, like it was a high‑quality match, as well.   I enjoy playing that way.   It was for sure the best match I have played in this tournament so far, and, yeah, the crowd created a good atmosphere.
I always enjoy that.   You know, that's one of the challenges of being a professional sportsperson.   You know, when you come up against sort of home favorites and the crowd aren't there for you, you need to, you know, find a way to use it to motivate you.   I feel like I have done that well.

Q.   Slightly off topic, you tweeted a tennis coach the other day an apology for your language after he criticized you, he was showing some young kids.   You said that was your failings, trying to be a role model.   Is that something you think about a lot?   Is that something you really want to try and improve upon?
ANDY MURRAY:   Well, yeah.   I mean, it's something I have always tried to improve upon. 
I feel like I'm much better now than I was before.   But, yeah.   It's just an unfortunate thing now that's very ‑‑ you know, I think with tennis it gets picked up on a lot.   You know, often when we go for our towels, the microphone is right there and you forget where you are sometimes.
Whereas in some of the other sports, you know, like football, for example, I don't think that the language they use is, you know, that pleasant all the time, but obviously the camera is not there on them all of the time, and the microphone, so you don't hear it as much.
Yeah, it's just unfortunate.   I would rather I didn't do it, but unfortunately, it's one of the mistakes I make as a human being, and I try to be better.
And I feel like I have improved it but far from perfect.

Q.   Although Roger is ranked second, there hasn't been a lot of focus on him in this tournament, your streak and Novak and Nadal.   Do you think at his age that he's legitimately someone that could make it to the final weekend here?
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah.   I mean, for sure.   I think obviously, you know, if he can get past, if he can get past Stan, he's coming up against either Kei or Jo.   Jo has played in a slam final and so has Kei. 
But the difference in experience at this stage of an event, you know, Roger trumps them, you know, comfortably in that respect.   And, you know, he hasn't used up too much energy, I wouldn't have thought.   Obviously playing the match against GaÃ«l over two days, maybe that helps.   I don't know.   You know, it was not two long sets yesterday or two long sets today.
I'm sure he will go into the match with Stan fairly fresh.   There is absolutely no reason why he couldn't win the event, but anyone that wants to win this event is going to have to play great tennis because of the level of the field that's still left in it.
