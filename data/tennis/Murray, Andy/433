  6‑4, 6‑2, 6‑0 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   You looked like you really enjoyed yourself out there tonight?  
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, it was good.   I mean, it was tough for a set and a half.   A tough match.   I mean, he put a lot of pressure on my serve.   He came to the net a lot.   Saved quite a few games where he had breakpoints or 30‑All games.   
Once I got up a double break in the second, we played a lot of entertaining rallies, fun points.   
Yeah, I played well.   So it was enjoyable.   
   
 Q.   Is it the matchup that you like?   You like the target at the net, that kind of thing?  
ANDY MURRAY:   Well, like I said, it's tough 'cause he's very good at what he does.   You know, he volleys very, very well.   From the far end of the court it's tough because there's a breeze and he's coming on to you all the time.   
It's tricky, but I've always played well against lefties.   I've enjoyed playing against guys that come forward, too.   So it was a good matchup for me.   
   
 Q.   Different styles of game.   Where would you say yours is at the moment?   How do you feel your game is?  
ANDY MURRAY:   Well, tonight was good.   My movement was way better than the first two matches.   I moved great tonight.   That's a good sign for me 'cause when I move well, the rest of my game goes well.   That was the most pleasing thing for me about tonight.   
But, yeah, I mean, I need to keep improving, do things a bit better each round.   Tonight I did a lot of things better, so I look forward to the next one.  
   
 Q.   You sort of joked tonight about Ivan and a golf course.   I know it's been a couple weeks.   Is there anything you can pinpoint already as to what he's done for your game?  
ANDY MURRAY:   Obviously having someone with that experience is going to help in many different ways.   You know, he had a great mentality, the middle and the latter stage of his career.   I think that's something that will rub off on me.   
You know, we've been just sort of keeping it pretty low‑key.   We haven't been practicing here on the days off.   We've been practicing off‑site, just getting our work done, you know, relaxing.   That's been it so far.   
But, like I say, before the tournament, it was only five or six days we've been working together.   He'll be seeing things in my matches that, you know, I can't work on just now, so I'll do that after the tournament's done obviously.   
   
 Q.   An unexpected fourth‑round opponent.   You've already had a sight of him this year.   
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, he was very good when I played him.   When I played him in Brisbane, the first six games he was unbelievable.   He hardly missed a ball.   He was hitting the ball huge, going pretty much down the line on every shot and cleaning lines.   
I mean, to me it's not that unexpected.   I saw a little bit of the match today.   I didn't quite know what was happening with GaÃ«l.   But, yeah, he's won a couple of long five‑setters.   He's obviously in good shape.   Yeah, when I played him in Brisbane, he was hitting the ball very well.
