Q.   Andy, perhaps not quite as straightforward as the two games yesterday.   What will you take from that?
ANDY MURRAY:   I thought the first set was good.   He started playing much better in the second set.   There was a lot of good rallies. 
He was playing very aggressive at the end.   Yeah, just managed to hang tough, get the good start in the tiebreak, and did well to finish off.
It was tough conditions again today.

Q.   I assume when you started play yesterday you'd have taken three straightâ€‘set victories to get you into the semifinals?
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, you know, all the matches are tough here.   You know, it's the first week on grass, and obviously I haven't played any matches for about a month. 
So, you know, I'm happy with the way it's gone so far.   Obviously a tough match, you know, tomorrow in the semifinals but I'm looking forward to it.

Q.   Will you fancy a match against Tsonga tomorrow?   I'm sure that would be a big game that would get everybody involved. 
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, whoever it is is going to be tough.   Jo is one of the best grass court players in the world.   I have had some tough matches with him in the past. 
It will be a good test for me.   He's been playing very well lately.
