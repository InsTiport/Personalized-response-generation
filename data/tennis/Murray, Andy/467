  Q. You're smiling broadly after a much better performance than the one against Xavier Malisse.   
 ANDY MURRAY: I thought it was a very high quality match. We both played very well, especially at the end of the second set. A lot of good rallies and long games.   
 Yeah, really good test.  
  
  Q. Everybody here is on ankle watch, and every time you grimace, we're not sure whether you're just grimacing or it's the ankle. How was it?  
 ANDY MURRAY: I grimace after most points, anyway. (Laughter.) I fell down a couple times. Luckily the ankle is fine. It's the best it's felt to date.  
  
  Q. The serve on certain occasions got you out of jail, including a second-serve ace at 133 miles an hour. That's going somewhere.   
 ANDY MURRAY: Yeah, that was lucky. You know, I just went for it. Obviously it came off, but I have been working on my serve a lot the last year or so. It's one of the most important shots on grass, in particular. I need to keep serving well.  
  
  Q. Well played today. Thanks very much.   
 ANDY MURRAY: Thank you.
