THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Given the circumstances and what you've been through in the past 24 hours, how do you rate that performance?   
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, it was good.   I wanted to try and start the match with as much energy as possible, and if I could, get off to a lead early.  
I mean, obviously he played a very long match yesterday, so I felt like if I could get ahead that I would be able to use that momentum well.   It would also give me a bit of a lift really.   
Yeah, then after the start he was getting quite frustrated in the second set, so I fed off that as well and managed to play a good match.  
   
 Q.   How did you pull up physically today?   How much sleep did you get?   Give us a timeline as to when you got home, got to bed, when you had to get up and prepare to come here.   
ANDY MURRAY:   We basically left here probably about3:00.   No, I got off the court.   3:30.   I showered and left pretty much immediate.   Probably 4:15, 4:30 I was in bed.   Then got up at 9:00.  
Yeah, tried to sleep a little bit more before I came to the courts today and practiced and got ready.   
   
 Q.   Can you just talk us through yesterday.   Mentally how did you deal with the fact that you went on court past 1:00 a.m., which sounds completely crazy.   How did you deal with that?   
ANDY MURRAY:   Well, it was very difficult.   I think me and Philipp both were quite frustrated on the court.   I wouldn't say the level of tennis was particularly good or that it was a very entertaining match.  
That's what happens in those circumstances.   You aren't going to get guys playing their best tennis when you're on court at 3:00 in the morning.   
Yeah, you kind of go on court frustrated, and then obviously if something doesn't go your way you get quite frustrated.   
Like I said, I think both of us at different times in the match obviously when things aren't going your way, it's easy to get down on yourself.  
Obviously in the third set that happened to him.   But just, yeah, wasn't thinking that much after the match.   I just wanted to go to sleep and try and recover for today.   
   
 Q.   Don't you think you should have been moved to another court yesterday?   
ANDY MURRAY:   That probably would've made good sense, yeah.   
   
 Q.   You asked?   
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah.   I mean, we spoke a little bit about it, but we didn't‑‑ no one came to see us until midnight.   
So that's how the situation was handled.   
   
 Q.   I wanted to ask you about the French Open and how you're feeling and what your expectations are for the coming French Open?   
ANDY MURRAY:   Well, I think things can change in a few weeks in an individual sport, so my expectations right now I wouldn't say I have thought much about them.   
But, you know, I want to try and finish the week here as best as I can, and then obviously, my opinion, the conditions in Rome are more similar to Roland Garros.   
Obviously you're not at altitude there.   Hopefully I can get a few matches in in Rome as well.  
But for me, it's been a pretty good start to the clay court season.   It's been positive in many ways.   I'll just try to keep that going through until the French.   I'll start thinking about that tournament as soon as I'm done with Rome.   I normally get to Paris pretty early to prepare, and then sort of take it from there.   
   
 Q.   Can you tell us please, how did you learn AmÃ©lie was pregnant and how will you deal with the situation?   
ANDY MURRAY:   I learned when she told me.   That was how I found out.   We spoke on Skype.   I'm trying to remember exactly when it was, whether it was post‑Rotterdam or pre‑Rotterdam when she told me.   
But, yeah, we just spoke about it on Skype.   Yeah, I mean, the most important thing is for both of us to be quite open about everything over the next few months.   Yeah, I mean, it's really kind of up to AmÃ©lie.   It's obviously a life‑changing thing having a child.   
I think just need to give it a bit of time and see how she feels afterwards and what her priorities are, and that's it.   But if things don't work out, that's fine; if they do, then great.   But there is more to life than obviously tennis, and having a child is extremely important.   I would imagine it would her No. 1 priority.   
But it's possible that she can mix the two, and that's why I think me working with Jonas will be very good as well.   He's a good addition to the team, and he'll be able to travel, which is good.   
   
 Q.   Your results on paper on clay would suggest this is the best you've ever played on the clay.   Is this the best you've ever felt on clay?   
ANDY MURRAY:   I would probably say physically, yeah.   The last few years on the clay I felt I would say pretty bad.   I didn't enjoy playing really on this surface.   I was just hurting really a lot of the times when I was training or preparing for this part of the season.  
Then, yeah, in matches obviously‑‑ played against Marcel a few years ago in Rome and wasn't able to finish the match.   Obviously missed the French Open as well.   
Yeah, last few years on the clay have been extremely tough for me.   Definitely been better than the last few years.   I have played well on the clay in the past.   I've had some good runs in Rome and Monte‑Carlo and at the French.  
But it's been a good start, and I'm really happy with how my body feels in comparison to the last few years.   Big thanks to my team for all of the work they've done on getting me to this stage.   
   
 Q.   Sorry to go back to this subject, but when Hewitt and Baghdatis played that hugely long match that ended so late at the Australian Open, the Australian Open made a policy decision that they would put a cut‑off point to put matches on court.   This is the second time this year that a guy has had to go on court after 1:00.   Do you think the tour should put a straightforward nothing after midnight, nobody should go on court after midnight decision?  
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, I mean, I guess it's tough to say exactly, but I don't know many sports that play after midnight really at all.  
I love watching boxing and they fight late, but never at 1:00 in the morning.   That's where I do think you can get the right people involved and speak to doctors and people that understand the body and how it works for athletes and say, Look, it's actually not possible to compete at your peak condition past whatever time it is, and then make a decision based on that, rather than just saying, Oh, you know, midnight or 11:00.   
Just speak to the relevant people and make a decision based on that.   I spoke to Agnieszka Radwanska this morning, and I think she said on the WTA Tour they actually have a policy.   They won't put them on court after midnight.   I don't know if that's true or not.
