  6‑4, 7‑5 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How does it feel to be back on grass?  
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, it was good.   Yeah, I mean, I always enjoy coming back here.   
It was not an easy match.   He's a good player, obviously.   You know, he takes the ball on and the ball shoots through the court pretty flat.   He likes a quicker court.   It was a tricky match but it was okay.   
   
 Q.   New shoes?  
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, new shoes.   Actually feel like I moved well today, which is pleasing.   
Obviously normally the first couple of days on the grass when I played here I have actually, you know, slipped a lot, you know, and fell over a couple of times.  
But I felt like I moved and changed direction pretty well today.   That was good.  
   
 Q.   How long have they been in the making?  
ANDY MURRAY:   First pair of shoes I tried were in March in Miami.   That was the first time I tried ‑‑actually, I tried a pair a couple of pairs at Davis Cup but just literally to feel them, not really properly test them.   
And then Miami in March was the first time I really tried them.   The clay court shoes got close, but yeah, these ones are good.  
   
 Q.   I guess usually here your sort of sole focus is 100% Wimbledon, probably still is.   I'm just wondering if you're looking at more of a three‑week package here with obviously the big Davis Cup match here afterwards?  
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, well, I think ‑‑I mean, I have said like this year I want to try to perform better in more events just because I feel like, you know, you're not going to win every single tournament, but I think the more opportunities you have to play in finals and semifinals against the best players, it's beneficial when you get to major competition.  
So I want to try to do well here, because I think that's the best preparation for Wimbledon to play matches here.   Yeah, I mean, obviously Davis Cup is important, as well.   It's a very, very tough match that France, I would say, would go into that match as favorites, but it's one that is winnable if everyone plays to their highest level.  
   
 Q.   JosÃ© Mourinho, did you have a chance to speak to him at all?  
ANDY MURRAY:   No, I didn't see him.   I only saw that he was watching Rafa's match.   I was warming up by then.  
   
 Q.   Could we ask how vocal you were in the discussions about actually playing the Davis Cup quarterfinal here?  
ANDY MURRAY:   Vocal in terms of speaking to Leon, you mean?   
   
 Q.   Yes.   
ANDY MURRAY:   I spoke to Leon just about playing the tie on grass, and then obviously in Indian Wells was around the time when we were getting asked about it.   
Obviously Wimbledon, the courts at Wimbledon are fantastic, but you can't turn them around in the space of a few days, whereas Queen's, for me, the courts here are unbelievable.  
So that would have been the best surface for us to play on, the best possible grass courts.   I like playing on grass, but I think, you know, some guys like playing on grass courts where there are bad bounces and   maybe is a bit slippy or whatever, whereas I don't think that really would work for my game.   
But I didn't speak to Leon about playing the tie at Queen's.   I just wanted to try to play on grass, and then it was down to, I guess, the LTA to find the best venue for it.  
   
 Q.   Do you have a view on the policy on Wimbledon wildcards?   Wimbledon is announcing its first batch of wildcards today and the LTA have scrapped their previous recommendation that players need to be ranked in the world's top 250.   British players have a wildcard.   Instead they want to look at each one on a player‑by‑player basis.   I wondered if you have a view on that policy.   
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, I think it's good to do that, because obviously, you know, some guys can have some injury troubles.   Some guys could be ranked inside 250 and have terrible attitudes, you know, and maybe it's not deserving.   Some players could have fantastic attitudes and maybe are just outside.   Some guys play much better on grass than others so may have more of an opportunity to win matches.   
And then, you know, also when you have some young guys now, you know, an 18‑ or 19‑year‑old that's ranked 280, 300 in the world is very good for their age, they'd probably be in the top 5, 6, 7 in the world in their age if that was the case.  
Yeah, I have no problem with it being done on an individual basis rather than having a set criteria.  
   
 Q.   Looking ahead towards ATP finals, what's your opinion for it to stay in London, and how long do you think it should stay there for?  
ANDY MURRAY:   I like it's in London, because at the end of the year it's nice to stay at home.   I mean, that's just a selfish point of view.   I know some of the players, you know, would maybe rather it moved.  
But they have done such a great job there, and I think, you know, that the crowds and how successful the event is almost, you know, I don't know, justifies it staying there.  
You know, I don't know.   I think I would say this is maybe the longest it's been in one place for.   I don't know if Madison Square Garden had it for longer.  
But it's a very successful event.   They run it very, very well.   It's obviously good for me personally that it's there, because it's close to home at the end of a long year.  
   
 Q.   Do you ever get bored?  
ANDY MURRAY:   Well, if that was the case, then I'd be pretty bored right now (laughter).   I have played here like 10 years in a row, and that's what it's like on the tour.  
But I also love going ‑‑I love going to different places.   I wouldn't be against it moving.   I'm just saying as it's there now, it's good for me.   
But, you know, obviously the tour is trying to‑‑ the ATP are trying to make the best decision possible.   You know, there are people way better qualified than me to make those decisions.  
   
 Q.   Putting your coaching hat on, give us a verdict on Verdasco and the danger he poses.   
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, he's very dangerous.   You know, when he is on his game he's an extremely tough guy to beat.  
You know, you can sometimes go a couple of games where you don't get to see the ball because he's, you know, serving big and, you know, hitting his forehand huge.  
Then there can be periods in the match where he makes a few mistakes and it's up to you to capitalize on them and also to try to play a very sort of solid, stable match because he does tend to have ups and downs throughout.   If you can sort of stay consistent and solid throughout, you'll get some opportunities.  
But it's not an easy thing to do against him.   He does hit the ball so hard, and, yeah, he's flashy.   He doesn't give you so much rhythm.   It will be tough.
