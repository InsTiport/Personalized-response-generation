N. DJOKOVIC/A. Murray
      6‑3, 6‑4

    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.

Q.   Andy, at the end of the first set, at the beginning of the second set, there were quite a few times you looked into the air when you served.   What was wrong at that moment? 
    ANDY MURRAY:   I don't remember doing that at the end of the set.   I did it at the beginning of the match.   I explained yesterday why that was.   But I don't remember that causing me any distractions at the end of the first set or the second set today. 

Q.   What was going through your head after you let Djokovic take game one of the second set off those four errors?
    ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, that was a bad part of the match for me.   Against the best players, you can't really afford that.   It was a loose game.   I rushed a little bit. 
    That's really one of the things I need to try to do a bit better, I don't know, regroup a little bit faster.   I've done it quite well the last few weeks. 
    If you're playing against the best players, and you rush points like that, especially in conditions like this, that's not going to help. 
    But I managed to get myself back into the match.   I played some good tennis in the second set.   Just wasn't enough. 

Q.   How would you judge your performance overall as a barometer of where you are at the moment, your form at the moment?
    ANDY MURRAY:   I think I'm playing well.   There's some things I could have done better today. 
    But, look, I mean, Novak obviously plays extremely well in these conditions on that court.   It's slow, pretty heavy conditions.   You feel like you can really go for your shots.   You aren't going to make errors. 
    In these conditions he obviously moves exceptionally well.   It's tough to get many free points or hit winners.   Over the course of the match, that builds up a bit. 
    I was doing a decent job of it myself, but I just made a few too many errors today.   I played some good stuff.   But the period the middle of the first set, and the beginning of the second set, I could have done better. 

Q.   You should still be pretty happy.   You took the wild card to play here.   Can you talk about that. 
    ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, it's been a couple good weeks for me.   Like I said, I feel I'm playing well.   My body's responded pretty good to playing an eighth match in ten days, so that's positive.   I got a lot of matches, some momentum.   Obviously, I would have liked to have done a little bit better here.   But I lost to the No.1 player in the world.   There's no disgrace in that. 
    You always want to try to do a little bit better.   Hopefully I can make some improvements next week.   I've always enjoyed playing in Shanghai.   I played some of my best tennis there.   I hope I can do the same again. 

Q.   At the US Open you said the World Tour Finals and qualifying just wasn't something you were going to concern yourself too much with.   It's looking like the race is going to be tight towards the end of the season.   Is it something now that's on your mind or are you just taking it tournament by tournament?
    ANDY MURRAY:   What I was trying to say at the US Open was that my schedule was going to be dictated more how I felt and what I wanted from the end of the year rather than just trying to play to get into the Tour Finals, because I don't think that's necessarily the right way to go about it. 
    But the reason I came here was to try to, like I said, get some momentum, try to win some more matches, get into the latter stages, play against the best players, and get used to playing at that level consistently again between now and the end of the year. 
    But if I play well, I'll give myself a chance at getting to the O2.   When I step on the court, that really shouldn't be something I'm thinking about. 

Q.   Djokovic was able to win 74% of his second service points.   Why did you struggle so much with his second serve?
    ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, that's one of the parts of the match I could have done better.   Normally when I play against him, that's been something that I've been able to attack, try to do better. 
    I'm not sure exactly why that was.   He did serve well today.   But second serve return is normally one of the stronger points of my game.   I guess if you were to look at statistics, that would be the difference in the match. 
    I could have served a little bit better myself and could have returned better on his second serve.   But it's always easy to sort of say you should have done things better.   But there's a reason why he's No.1.   He has a good second serve.   He returns a second serve very well, too.   When he's playing well and he's confident, it's tough. 

Q.   Is AmÃ©lie coming to Shanghai?   Why was the decision for her not to be here in China with you?
    ANDY MURRAY:   Because we have agreed to work together for a certain number of weeks.   If she was to come with me every single week, then by the Australian Open I wouldn't have any more time to work with her. 
    So the decision was that she will do the tournaments in Europe.   I've been here with Danny many times and had a lot of success in Asia.   There was no reason to change that. 

Q.   The cooperation with adidas, the contract with adidas, it will end at the end of this year.   Will you renew this contract or find another sponsor?
    ANDY MURRAY:   I don't know exactly what's going to happen yet.   You know, it has to work both ways.   It's not just my decision or just adidas' decision. 
    I'm sure we'll discuss it over the next few months and more likely at the end of the year when I'm done playing.   But we've had a good relationship together.   I've had most of my biggest results or successes when I've been with adidas.   It's worked well. 
    But I don't know what the future holds.   Just have to wait and see. 

Q.   On the court, you are cute.   Many fans love your smile.   Apart from the competition, what is your evaluation on your personality and character on court?
    ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, I've never been described as 'cute' on the tennis court before.   That's a first (smiling). 
    Yeah, to be honest, when I'm on the court, my whole career I've been working more towards being more like myself off the court.   Sometimes I can get too negative and down on myself. 
    But I do always try to fight as hard as I can when I'm playing.   That's something that I've done from a young age.   But often when I'm playing, I'm way, way too hard on myself.   That doesn't always help. 
    It's something that I'm working on all the time, try to be more like myself off the court when I'm playing tennis because I'm a lot calmer when I'm away from the court.
