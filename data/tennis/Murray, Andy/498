I. LJUBICIC/A. Murray
  6-3, 6-2

 THE INTERPRETER: Questions, please. 

 Q. What went wrong out there? How are you feeling?
 ANDY MURRAY: I thought he played well. He served very well. I made quite a lot of mistakes, so a combination of the two probably didn't help that much.

 Q. Was there any particular aspect of your game that you thought was letting you down? Was it serving or returning?
 ANDY MURRAY: No, just -- I just didn't hit the ball that well and made quite a few mistakes.
 You know, if you play someone who serves well and you make a lot of mistakes on your own service game, it puts a little bit more pressure on you. That was probably it. 

 Q. So what's your plan? You gonna fly to Shanghai tomorrow morning?
 ANDY MURRAY: Yeah, I haven't made any plans yet, but I'm sure I will be there tomorrow, yeah. 

 Q. He's a very unorthodox player, isn't he? He doesn't play two shots the same, one after the other. Does that make it difficult for you to get into the kind of rhythm you'd like to against him?
 ANDY MURRAY: I've normally played pretty well against him in the past, so I don't think that was the problem. I mean, he was hitting the ball big tonight, like he was trying to end the points pretty quickly, so it's a bit harder to get into a rhythm. 

 Q. Do you feel like you are physically okay right now? You're going to play Shanghai? Do you think you can maintain the body to play well in Shanghai? 
 ANDY MURRAY: Yeah, I hope so. You know, I obviously played a few matches here, which will be good going into Shanghai, so, yeah, I'm sure I'll play well there.
