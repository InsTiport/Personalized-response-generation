  7-5, 6-3

 THE INTERPRETER: Questions, please. 

 Q. You told us the other day you're a little bit sore, a little bit stiff. How are you feeling after the match tonight? It seemed like you had a little trouble getting into the rhythm out there. The smog was bad today. How did it feel?
 ANDY MURRAY: Yeah, it took me a little bit of time to get into the match. Yeah, I mean, it was different conditions today compared to the other day when I played. It was quite cool on the court, so it slowed the ball down a little bit.
 I was leaving the ball pretty short, so he was able to dictate a lot of the points, so that's why I struggled a bit early on, but I played a little bit better towards the end. 

 Q. What do you think is the most important contributing factor to your victory?
 ANDY MURRAY: I thought -- I don't know, actually. You know, both of us made quite a lot of mistakes.
 You know, I did serve quite well at times, but, you know, it was a pretty up-and-down match, so I don't think there was one thing in particular. I was a little bit, I guess, more solid than he was, especially in the second set, and that was probably the main difference, but there wasn't too much in it. 

 Q. I know you have one more match to get through. I asked Robin earlier, and he said he looked forward to playing you in the semis. How do you feel about that?
 ANDY MURRAY: Yeah, that obviously would be a good match. I'm more focused on the next round, to be honest. 

 Q. You can see. 
 ANDY MURRAY: Yeah. But he's obviously had a very good year this year, probably playing the best tennis of his life. Obviously difficult to play against someone who's -- I think he's No. 5 in the world just now, so it will be a very tough match.
