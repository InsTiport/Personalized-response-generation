 A. MURRAY/V. Hanescu
  6-3, 6-2 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. A comfortable start that you like?  
 ANDY MURRAY: Yeah. I thought I played well. I thought I moved pretty good, you know, and returned well. And I didn't serve my best, but, yeah, 3-2 against him's a good result. He won a clay court tournament last year and made the quarters last week. So it was a good win for me.   
  
  Q. Do you almost go into a first match on a different surface allowing yourself to not play that well; almost like it's okay to get it out of the way as much as anything?  
 ANDY MURRAY: Well, I mean, I think for me I wanted to use this week to try and get some matches and to, yeah, try and get used to playing on the clay again and work on some things.   
 And at the start of the match when I got broken, I was sort of moving like I was still on a hard court. And then, you know, after four, five, six games, I started to move better.   
 I hope with each match, you know, I just start to, I guess, remember how to play on clay. I'm sure I'll keep getting better.   
  
  Q. As far as the actual clay is concerned, Roland Garros, obviously Madrid you don't know, but here or Rome...   
 ANDY MURRAY: I mean, all of those tournaments can be quick. Roland Garros can be. A lot of it just depends on the conditions. Sometimes in Rome I've played in the evening there and it's so slow. If you play during the day, it can be unbelievably quick.   
 When I was in the States, I was watching some highlights of Stepanek against Federer in Rome last year, and the court was looking like quicker than - I don't know - a hard court.   
 So a lot of it just depends. I mean here today it's fast. The balls are not fluffing up that much. It was relatively quick conditions.
