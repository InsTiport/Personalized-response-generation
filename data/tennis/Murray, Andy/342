Q.   Well played, Andy.   Up against a tricky opponent your first match back on grass.   How did it feel out there?
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, it's tough obviously with the stopping and starting yesterday and then coming back to finish the day.   It was tricky. 
He had some chances on my first couple of service games when we came back out today, and I created a few more chances at the end of the set and just managed to win the tiebreak.
It was a good test for me and hopefully a good warmup for this afternoon's match.

Q.   How did it feel overnight when you have a match delayed like that?   You were on and off court so many times yesterday.   Do you sleep well when you have to come back out again today?
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, I slept pretty well.   The hardest part is just the waiting around.   I mean, really, we came off maybe three times yesterday and then they called us off about 6:30 yesterday.   So we were here from probably 10:00 until 7:30, because when the match gets called off, see the physio and stuff, so this is quite a long day. 
You know, today the same thing again.   There will be a lot of waiting around for my match this afternoon now, and it's important to make sure you sort of relax and don't waste too much energy between matches.

Q.   You have that extra match today against Matosevic.   What can you tell us about him?   What do you know about him?   Are you going to protect your water bottles when you're up against him?
ANDY MURRAY:   He's a talented player, a good ball striker.   I think he did quite well in one of the grass court tournaments last year, maybe in Eastbourne. 
He has a good serve.   He'll make it tricky for me.   You know, he's a big hitter and I need to be ready for that.
