    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
   
 Q.   Just give us your verdict on the match.   Very good win for you.   
    ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, it was a good win.   First set I didn't make many errors.   I played solid.   I returned well.   I moved well throughout the match.   
    Second set, you know, both of us had some opportunities.   From my side anyway, there were a few more errors in the second set.   But, you know, I stayed tough in the important moments and managed, yeah, to get a good win.   
   
 Q.   Last Sunday was your first title since winning Wimbledon.   This was your biggest ranking win since beating Novak in the final.   Was it the best match you played since then?  
    ANDY MURRAY:   I don't know.   I mean, I have played some good matches this year.   I played some really good tennis against Rafa in Rome.   The match with Novak in New York for me was a good level.   Also some of the tennis I played at Wimbledon wasn't obviously against guys that were playing as well as Cilic, but I played some really good tennis at Wimbledon as well.   
    Now it's just starting to become a little bit more consistent again.   I feel like I'm harder to beat just now than I was.   At the beginning part of the year, I was quite up and down and inconsistent.   But I'm starting to build some momentum, get that consistency back.   That equals, you know, good wins against better opposition.   
   
 Q.   Do you think that consistency and momentum will be key tomorrow to beating Novak?   How do you feel about that match going in?   
    ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, I mean, it's always difficult against Novak.   I mean, I haven't played him here, but his form here, he's never lost, which is very impressive.   I'm aware it's going to be an extremely difficult match tomorrow.   
    But, again, it will be very good for me to get that match and see if I can make some improvements from the US Open.   If I play like I did at the US Open, I'll definitely give myself an opportunity in the match.   
    Obviously a bit different here, conditions and whatnot, best‑of‑three as well.   It's going to be a good test, and I look forward to it.   
   
 Q.   You said this match may not have been the best match you played, that you played well in other ones.   But is this couple of weeks the best stretch of form you've had since Wimbledon last year, or is that too microscopic of a view?  
    ANDY MURRAY:   That started at the US Open.   I said at the time I started to feel like I was playing better there.   Obviously I played well against Jo.   I played a good match against Novak.   I just want to try to carry that through to the end of the year.   
    You know, it isn't always just about playing well, it's about finding ways to win when you aren't playing well.   I haven't played great in every single match the last couple weeks, but I've been winning.   That's very important 'cause at the beginning of the year, some of the matches I was playing well and losing, was up in matches and not closing them out, whereas the last couple of weeks, even in some of the matches like against Monaco, I didn't play great at the start, but managed to turn it around.   The same the first round here, too.   
    That's been the most pleasing thing, is winning matches when you aren't playing well.   It's a real test of where your confidence is at.   I'll need that for the rest of the year.   
   
 Q.   The victory in Shenzhen last week, does it mean your cooperation with AmÃ©lie Mauresmo is more efficient?  
    ANDY MURRAY:   I said the same when I started working with Ivan.   I would say next year will be a good test really to see the improvements I've been making, the things I've been working on.   
    You know, I'll have time at the end of this year to spend more time on the practice court to improve some things, to work on some things with AmÃ©lie and Danny.   
    Yeah, I mean, I have enjoyed it so far.   That's important.   Hopefully the results will start to come in the next few months.
