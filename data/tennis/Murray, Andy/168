A. MURRAY/J. Sousa
6-2, 3-6, 6-2, 6-2
(Transcribed from ATP recording.)
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How do you feel the match went?
ANDY MURRAY: I thought I struggled.  At the beginning I think he was extremely aggressive, very intense.
You know, so he was getting into position to dictate a lot of points with his forehand.  Once I started to hit the ball a little bit cleaner towards the end of the match I was able to get him in his backhand corner and dictate more of the points.
It was tricky.  I didn't feel great.  You know, the match against Groth, though I returned well; I didn't get to hit that many groundstrokes; didn't feel I was in a great rhythm; wasn't hitting the ball clean at the start.
He was hitting the ball great, close to the lines, and making me do a lot of running.
Yeah, I just tried to keep fighting.  At the end I was actually hitting the ball well and felt better at the end.  It was good to get through that one.
