A. MURRAY/J. Isner
  6‑7, 6‑4, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   One break in the match.   That came right after you lost a tough tiebreaker in the first.   You had three break points at that point.   He came back, but you got the job done.   Can you take us through the importance of that first game in the second set to get the break?
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, well, I mean, it was obviously important having ‑ I mean, against him most games are, really.   You don't get many opportunities.
So you need to be ready all the time for when one comes along, and I made a few more returns in that game.   He maybe lost his concentration a bit.   He missed, I think, four or five forehands in that game.
And, yeah, that's in a match of I don't know how long we played for.   I'm guessing it was over a couple hours.

Q.   2:23. 
ANDY MURRAY:   There's not many opportunities, so when you get them, you need to try to capitalize.   I managed to do that.

Q.   You played some really good defense there saving match point.   Unbelievable plays.   Can you just take us through that game when you were serving and got yourself out of trouble to take it to the breaker in the third?
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, it was tricky because the sun was right in, well, in both of our eyes from that end of the court.   You know, I served a couple of double faults.   I served extremely well for the whole match, really. 
Then, you know, at that point when the sun is is in your eyes, throw the ball up and you can't really see it.   So you need to kind of decide, you know, am I just gonna try and put the first serve in, or, you know, am I gonna try and go for it. 
When it's 6‑5 in the third set, ideally you want to try and get some free points when you can.   Maybe made a slight mistake trying to do that.
Yeah, but I just managed to find a way to get through that game.   I hit some good passing shots.   I was hitting the ball very clean for the majority of the match.   I wasn't mishitting many balls. 
When I was getting into rallies I was able to dictate a lot of the points, but in that game in particular it was just, yeah, instincts, really.

Q.   Right after the match social media was really buzzing with how much they enjoyed this.   For you being in it, was it one of the bigger matches of the year as far as just how grueling it was?
ANDY MURRAY:   Yes, I mean, it's a very important match for me to win.   I had lost a few close matches, matches like that over the last few months.   So, yeah, it was important for me to come through. 
You know, it was completely packed crowd from the first point right until the end, as well.   So it was a really, you know, good atmosphere to get ready for the rest of the tournament, but also the US Open, as well. 
It was very good.

Q.   Looking ahead to your next match to play Roger or GaÃ«l.   I'm curious, what's the most kind of jaw dropping shot you've ever saw GaÃ«l hit?
ANDY MURRAY:   Obviously, to be honest, most of the matches he plays he comes up with a few unbelievable shots.   Really the stuff that impresses me more than the actual kind of a trick shot or a shot through the legs is just his athleticism and the balls he's able to chase down. 
That's, for me, what's most impressive.   You know, in most matches, I mean, he's obviously on display a lot.   Especially on these courts, as well.   I think on grass it's quite hard for him to move the way he does, but on the hard courts he can change direction unbelievably quick. 
Yeah, I love watching him move.

Q.   Is it hard to keep his scrambling abilities and his defense abilities out of your head when you're playing through the rallies of having to do too much, going for too much on the lines?
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, that can be a tendency.   But, I mean, it's something that, you know, you just need to make sure that when you are playing against him you don't do that and remind yourself of it before the match and during if you feel like you're trying to rush points a bit.
But you need to play the right shots, play the same shots that you would against anyone else, and just expect a few more of them are going to come back, and you know, be ready to hit an extra volley or, you know, expect him to come up with a few unbelievable gets.
That's it. 

Q.   I know you just got off the court not too long ago, but I was wondering if you had any correspondence yet with AmÃ©lie, and will you have any with her prior to your next match?
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, I message her every day.   She messaged me right after the match.   But her and Danny, I'm sure, will be speaking to each other most days. 
And then, yeah, I'll speak with both of them when we get to NewYork.

Q.   Is there any aspect of your game right now that you're focusing on heading into the US Open?   If there is one, how did it play out for you today?
ANDY MURRAY:   The focus is winning right now.   Not so much how I'm hitting the ball or moving or anything like that.   Just trying to win.   That's all that's important just now.

Q.   What was it like to be in the middle of the match and hear Serena Williams say that you act like a baby on the court or whatever she said?
ANDY MURRAY:   Oh, I didn't hear that bit. 

Q.   That's why she likes you. 
ANDY MURRAY:   Okay (laughter).   Yeah, I didn't hear exactly what she said.   Yeah.   That's nice that she enjoys watching me.

Q.   You have played John a few other times, obviously.   What is it like playing somebody who hits so many aces, not really getting a rhythm in the match?   How do you cope with that?
ANDY MURRAY:   It depends.   It obviously depends a bit on which court you're playing on.   Here especially it's incredibly difficult to play against him because it's quick.   And also, the ball's bouncing extremely high on the second serve, as well. 
Yeah, you need to take care of your own service games, and then, like I said at the start, you just need to be ready for when ‑‑you know, because if the opportunities don't come, then that's too good.
Sometimes that can happen against a player like him.   He can serve unbelievable and you don't have a chance. 
But most matches you're going to get, you know, the odd look here and there.   When you get that chance, you need to be there to take it.   That's it. 

Q.   You were warming up this morning, returning serves for Jerzy Janowicz.   Was that preparation for John Isner's big serve?
ANDY MURRAY:   No, it was just because we were both playing on that court.   Yeah, there was no reason behind that.

Q.   The atmosphere, I mean, not to say that's a small court by any means, but it's a little more intimate.   Was it enjoyable for you?
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah.   Well, to be honest, I mean, I think most athletes would tell you that you'd rather play in a 4,000 seat stadium that's completely full than a 10,000 seat stadium that's half full.
It's just a better atmosphere.   It feels nicer to play like that.   And, yeah, it was nice out there. 

Q.   Just returning to if you play Roger, is that going to be a match you look at and say, I need this win for my confidence because it's Roger; shows me where I'm at right now; or is it one of those, I just need a win?
ANDY MURRAY:   Regardless of who I play, like I said, I want to play a lot of matches just now.   I want to get back to winning events and being in the finals of the big tournaments, and winning matches like today is a big step for me.
Yeah, obviously if I play against someone like Roger, that's another great test.   Regardless of the outcome, it can be a perfect test.   You know, the US Open is just 10 days away, and normally against him you'll see exactly where your game is at.
But, yeah, I'm looking forward to whoever it is.
