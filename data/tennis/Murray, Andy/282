  6‑4, 6‑4 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Does the quick turnaround of surfaces make that an even better performance?  
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah, I mean, it's hard.   It's not that easy.   But the hardest part is actually getting used to the movement, because when your body gets used to sliding into shots and that starts to become natural, and then to stop yourself from doing it, it's a really bad habit to get into on the grass.   You really don't want to move like that for a number of reasons.   It's not particularly efficient on the grass.   You can hurt yourself, as well.   That's normally the hardest thing.  
I thought I was quite disciplined with my movement today.   I moved pretty well.   I wasn't sliding about too much.   Yeah, it was a good start.  
   
 Q.   How did it feel with having AmÃ©lie in your player's box than having Ivan before?  
ANDY MURRAY:   It's different having a different coach, obviously.   You know, any time you start new with anyone, yeah, it's obviously going to be slightly different.  
But, yeah, after a few matches and stuff, it just becomes the same as usual.  
   
 Q.   What kind of input is she giving you so far?  
ANDY MURRAY:   I just went on court with her the first time today.   Nothing much is going to change there.   
I mean, we spoke a bit about the match and the tactics and then chatted a little bit afterwards.     But, yeah, this week, you know, there's not going to be any big changes in my game.   I also wouldn't expect any before Wimbledon.   
But we'll definitely work on some things after the tournament is finished here.   We will chat about the stuff that I will be working on over the next few days, and then when I get the chance to after the tournament is finished here, I'll get four or five days of practice where I can work on some things.  
   
 Q.   Your first time back on grass since that famous moment a year ago.   Does it bring all the memories flooding back now with what happened?  
ANDY MURRAY:   No.   To be honest, it didn't really.   I was looking forward to getting back on the court.   I mean, I enjoy playing here.   I love being back on the grass.   Grass is a surface I have always enjoyed.  
Yeah, I wasn't thinking too much about last year or anything.   I was just, yeah, trying to get off to a good start.   I think because there is such a quick turnaround, you don't have time to think about anything else.   You know there is going to be some nerves there because you haven't had the sort of preparation that you like.  
Also getting matches just now is, you know, it is important to try and get some matches under your belt here if you can.   Today was a good start.  
   
 Q.   I assume you had a lot of options to think about in terms of coaching.   What made you go in AmÃ©lie's direction?   What did you think she could bring to your game?  
ANDY MURRAY:   Well, after I spoke to her the first time I just really liked her, you know, for a number of reasons.   She was calm.   She asked a lot of questions. She listened.   She listened a lot.   
Yeah, I liked ‑‑yeah, I liked chatting to her, so then I decided to sit down and speak to her and had a good chat with her about tennis, I spoke to her a bit about my team and things I wanted to work on.  
I enjoyed speaking to her.   She was very easy, very easy to talk to, easy to communicate with.   I thought it would be a good time to, yeah, maybe try it out.   
With all coaches, you know, most players will have a trial period, you know.   With Ivan and stuff, that was obviously done in December.   Just now obviously it's going to be playing some matches and spending a bit of time on court.   Hopefully it will work out.  
   
 Q.   Assuming it becomes a long‑term arrangement, can you clarify roughly how many weeks a year you would expect AmÃ©lie will be traveling with you?  
ANDY MURRAY:   I don't know exactly yet.   But when I chatted to her, there was a number that I threw out, you know, which is, you know, what I would like.  
But, yeah, we haven't agreed specifically on anything just yet.   We'll see in a few weeks.   There is a number of weeks that I would like.   
Yeah, we'll see what happens.  
   
 Q.   But would you expect it to be similar to Ivan?  
ANDY MURRAY:   More.  
   
 Q.   More?  
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   More than Ivan?  
ANDY MURRAY:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Before you kind of made the final decision, did you consult with the members of your team and say to them, Look, this is the kind of direction I think I'm heading, and are you comfortable or how do you feel about that?  
ANDY MURRAY:   No.   But after the grass court season I'll sit down and speak to them about it.   I think with all of the ‑‑with most of the coaching decisions that I've had, I kind of ‑‑like with anything, there is a trial period, and it's up to me to make a decision on who that person is and whether or not, you know‑‑ maybe if it doesn't work, it doesn't work, but I'll sit down with the guys after I'm finished at Wimbledon and see whether or not, you know, we think it has been a good few weeks and whether we think it's something that will work long term.  
You know, when I'm deciding on a permanent coach, then that's when I'll obviously consult them, and obviously I will chat to them a bit over the next few weeks, as well, and see how it's all going.  
Afterwards, you know, I'll make a decision with the guys.   If everything is going ‑‑ well, obviously chat with AmÃ©lie, too, because, you know, it's not just me that makes the decision.   If AmÃ©lie hates working with me and finds it very difficult (smiling) being around me, then she won't want to do it either.  
We'll sit down after Wimbledon.  
   
 Q.   You're being regarded as something of a trend‑setter, no male players have chosen, of your quality, has ever chosen a lady to work with him.   What's the excitement of having a lady in your corner other than a chap?  
ANDY MURRAY:   Lady and chap?   Man and woman.   Let's stick with that.   (Laughter.)  
Yes.   You know, at first when I thought about it, that was‑‑ you know, it was obviously a consideration, because for a few years I haven't worked with a woman.   But then, yeah, after I gave it a little bit of thought, that's not something ‑‑I haven't thought much about that, you know, the last few days.   
Like now the decision has been made, it's not something that I'm thinking about.   I think it's more about the qualities that she can bring that will help me and my tennis and my team as well.  
Yeah, I hope it works out long term because I like her.   She's a good person.   I hope it works out well.  
   
 Q.   Do you see any advantages to her being a woman?  
ANDY MURRAY:   Well, to be honest, I don't know because not every woman is the same.   Not every man is the same, either.   
Every person has individual qualities, you know.   Some men are very sensitive.   Some women are very sensitive.   But I also know a lot of men that aren't.   That's all.   And there is also women who aren't.  
It's about, you know, the total package that she can offer.   I mean, in terms of what she achieved on the court, she obviously achieved a lot in her career.   I think she's a strong character, as well.   And then, you know, away from the court is really the communication and the relationship that you can build up with that person is going to decide whether it's going to work long term, because in terms of what she achieves on the court, then obviously, yeah, she knows how to win.   She was the best in the world.   She won Wimbledon and major events.   
Yeah, it's just, you know, off the court and when we're having discussions about tennis whether it clicks or not.   We won't know just yet.  
   
 Q.   You have been around the courts the last couple of days.   What's the reaction been in the locker room?  
ANDY MURRAY:   Well, I mean, the first day, I mean, quite a few people asked me about it, if it was true or not.   And then since then, yeah, no one ‑‑ you know, people haven't really been asking me, haven't been asking me loads about it.  
A couple of people have asked me whether it's long term or if it's just over the grass and if it's just a trial period or not.   But, yeah, you know, not loads ‑‑I mean, the ones I'm close to, yeah, I have spoken to them about it.   A lot of the British guys and stuff I have chatted to about it.   Yeah, the other guys haven't spoken too much about it.
