S. LISICKI/M. Rybarikova
  7‑6, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Well done.   Are you pleased with the way you're playing? 
SABINE LISICKI:   For the first grass court matches I think it's pretty good.   There is always room for improvement I think, but the more I play the better it gets.
That's how it feels to me.

Q.   It was an unusual first set, wasn't it?   You had a lead and then you almost lost it.   Three set points against you.   Why was it up and down like that?
SABINE LISICKI:   Well, she's a great grass court player.   She's won this tournament before.   She plays a different style of game, and it's pretty good on grass. 
You know, nothing surprising that she will make some good points, too. 

Q.   Did you feel that in the second set you may not be completely in control, but you were definitely on top? 
SABINE LISICKI:   I actually did feel in control.   I felt that I was hitting the ball better and that I was building up the points better, was hitting cleaner.
So as I said, with the longer I played I think the better I played.

Q.   Looked as if when you played your game and played it the way you wanted to that you would win.   Do you feel that's the case when you play almost anybody on this surface? 
SABINE LISICKI:   Yes.   Not only on this surface.   (Laughter.)
Yeah, obviously I love to play on grass.   Everybody knows that.   I'm really happy to be back here. 

Q.   This is just a generic question I'm asking some of the players:   If you were at tournament and they had like walk‑on music for the court and they said, Okay, you pick a song; we're going to play it when you come on court.   Is there one particular song that you might say, This is what I want? 
SABINE LISICKI:   No.   There is not a particular song.   It would change whatever I like to listen to right now. 
So, yeah...
