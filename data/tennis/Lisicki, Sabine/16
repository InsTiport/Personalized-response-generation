      6‑2, 6‑3 
  
    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Comment on the match.   Are you happy with the way you played?  
    SABINE LISICKI:   Yeah, I think so.   Tricky opponent.   I had no idea how she plays.  
    In the beginning you kind of want to see, play your game obviously, but get to know hers, as well.   I think I dealt well with that.  
   
 Q.   Just coming into the tournament, just talk about what you feel that you're playing, what are your visions going into the final Grand Slam of the year?  
    SABINE LISICKI:   Well, I have never reached the second week here, so I think that's the first thing that I would like to reach.  
    I obviously didn't spend as much time on the court training‑wise after Wimbledon because I had to take care of a little injury, but I did the best I could.   
    And I think every match is getting better and I'm getting happier with the way I play.  
   
 Q.   What was the injury?  
    SABINE LISICKI:   I had some wrist problems.  
   
 Q.   You feel any pain?  
    SABINE LISICKI:   No, that's why I took my time.   I knew out of experience if you don't take your time to cure it, then it might take it over.   
    I wanted to make sure everything is fine so I'm pain‑free when I come back.
