S. LISICKI/B. Jovanovski
  3‑6, 6‑2, 8‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Quite a tough one for you?
SABINE LISICKI:   Yeah, I was a bit nervous, which I didn't expect in the beginning, so didn't start off too well.   But I kept fighting.   That's what counts in the end. 
I got through, so I get another chance to play better the next time. 

Q.   What was the problem today with your serve?   You had multiple double‑faults. 
SABINE LISICKI:   Yeah, I don't know.   As I said, I was a bit nervous.   My toss was a bit off. 
We'll go out there tomorrow and practice it, so I should be fine. 

Q.   Why were you nervous against someone you should have beaten so easily?
SABINE LISICKI:   It wasn't about the opponent.   It was just playing at Wimbledon.   I don't know.   I was surprised by myself. 
But I handled it well in the end, so I was fine. 

Q.   Were you complaining to the umpire about the noise she was making?
SABINE LISICKI:   Yes. 

Q.   How bad did you find it?
SABINE LISICKI:   It was distracting.   You usually hear the sound of the ball, but I couldn't really hear it because of her grunting.   But that's why we have the rules, the hindrance rule. 
So, yeah, that's what I talked about to the judge. 

Q.   How does it compare with Sharapova and Azarenka?
SABINE LISICKI:   Yeah, it was completely different, but off‑putting, as well. 
Grunting is part of the game, but it shouldn't be off‑putting and be an advantage for the opponent, the one who is doing it. 

Q.   You don't grunt, do you?
SABINE LISICKI:   Sometimes I do, yes, but I hope it's not as bad.   No one ever complains, though.

Q.   Didn't seem to make much difference to her, though.   She still carried on. 
SABINE LISICKI:   Yeah.   Didn't have anything to do with that.
