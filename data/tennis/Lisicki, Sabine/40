 S. LISICKI/S. Kuznetsova
  6-2, 7-5 
  
 THE MODERATOR: First question, please.   
  
  Q. That was a close one in the end again. Did you feel any nerves in there when had you to finish it?  
 SABINE LISICKI: Well, a bit I think when I was 5-2 up. I served at 5-3 I think having new balls, so I didn't play that game well. But, you know, I just kept fighting. I missed some opportunities at 5-4, but I managed to serve well at 5-All to go up to 6-5 and just fought to finish up the match.   
  
  Q. The reason why I ask is that I remember your final against Caroline Wozniacki in Charleston where you should finish the match and...   
 SABINE LISICKI: Yeah, well, I mean, I guess it happens. You're nervous. It's the first time I'm in the second week, and I just kept telling myself, You have nothing to lose; just go for your shots. That's what I did in the end. It turned out to be good.   
  
  Q. What are your expectations of the match against Caroline?  
 SABINE LISICKI: I didn't actually know till now that I was playing against Caroline. I haven't really thought about it yet. I think I have some time to do that.   
  
  Q. How do you remember the match in Charleston against Caroline Wozniacki?  
 SABINE LISICKI: Well, I played good there. It was 6-2, 6-4, but I had the match pretty much under control.   
 So, well, I'm looking forward to the match here.   
  
  Q. Who is favored in the next match, as you see it?  
 SABINE LISICKI: I don't know.   
  
  Q. How would you see Caroline Wozniacki as a player?   
 SABINE LISICKI: Well, I mean, she got to the top 10. She fought her way to the top 10 and is playing well. She won Eastbourne, so I think she can play on grass.   
 But, you know, I'm pretty young, too. I'm climbing up the rankings. I'm happy about the way I'm playing here right now.   
  
  Q. Could you see your father during the match? Did you look at him much? Did you have any thoughts about him as he was there?  
 SABINE LISICKI: A bit. But I think I am the main person on the court and I'm the one who is playing the match. So, you know, I just kept fighting myself. My dad cannot help much, you know. So just played it.  
  
  Q. But were you looking?  
 SABINE LISICKI: Yeah, sure.  
  
  Q. Both you and Caroline have Polish origins. Do you speak Polish to each other?  
 SABINE LISICKI: Yeah, we know each other for, I don't know, six, seven years.   
  
  Q. And you're good friends?  
 SABINE LISICKI: Yeah.
