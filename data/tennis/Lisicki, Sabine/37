S. LISICKI/A. Sevastova
  6-1, 6-1

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Well done today?
 SABINE LISICKI: Thank you.

 Q. How did you feel that match went? Was it as perfect as it looked from the scoreboard? 
 SABINE LISICKI: Well, there was a lot of waiting yesterday and today as well. Well, I lost the first seven points of the match. 
 From then on, I think I played very good. I served solid, and, um, yeah, just did the things that I had to do.

 Q. Does did it feel like 2009 yet? Are you that comfortable just yet?
 SABINE LISICKI: Well, I don't really compare it to 2009. I played very well in Birmingham, so... 
 You know, I'm coming off a title, so I feel very good. I'm just happy to be back on the grass and just enjoy ever minute of it.

 Q. What effect did that title and victory in Birmingham have on you for your confidence? What did you take from that? 
 SABINE LISICKI: Well, a lot of confidence, of course. You know, after two years not playing on grass I didn't know how I'm going to play on it, so I just wanted to go in and play as many matches as possible.
 It went pretty well. Yeah, a lot of confidence and just the feel for the grass as well. It's different to anything else.
