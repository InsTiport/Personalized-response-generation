S. LISICKI/P. Martic
  6‑4, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Can you just tell me how you feel about winning today after some disappointments the last couple of months?
SABINE LISICKI:   Definitely good.   I mean, it's my favorite tournament, so it's nice to be back and winning your first match, especially after how I did last year.   Just exciting to be back.

Q.   How did you find that court?
SABINE LISICKI:   Good.   I mean, the atmosphere is totally different than on the bigger courts, but it's really nice, too. 
The crowd is really close, and they were great.   So, you know, as long as you play at Wimbledon, there is no better place.   So doesn't matter which court.
