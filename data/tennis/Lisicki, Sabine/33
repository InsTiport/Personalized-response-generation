M. SHARAPOVA/S. Lisicki
  6-4, 6-3

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. When you play, do you find yourself playing for yourself or for your country or your family? Where do you get your inspiration?
 SABINE LISICKI: You know, I love playing tennis. It's just my passion. I enjoy myself so much out there. Uhm, you know, my family always supports me. I love to have the support of the crowd. So the crowd drives me. 
 It's like everything together. It's like a whole package. 

 Q. What did you find today was the difference between you and Maria?
 SABINE LISICKI: Uhm, well, I had my chances but I didn't take them. I think that was the biggest difference. She took her chances; I didn't. I was up 3-Love and I had chances to go up 4-Love or 4-1. 
 In the end it's just little points that make a huge difference. I didn't make them, unfortunately. But, you know, I still learned a lot out of that match. The last time she beat me quite easily, and now was pretty close. I'm really looking forward to the next one.

 Q. Do you feel your more to your form you were before you came on crutches? Do you feel you're nearing your form again?
 SABINE LISICKI: Yes. I think I'm better. Also mentally just stronger. I'm calmer, as well, have more experience. I know how quickly everything can be gone. So I enjoy it even more than before. 
 So I think I'm not just a better player but also the whole thing, I just enjoy it more.
