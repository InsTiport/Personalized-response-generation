  R. NADAL/A. Beck  
6-4, 6-4, 7-6  
   
  Q. Could you describe the thing that makes playing with Rafael so special, your feelings against him and the way that is so different than when you play against other players?   
 ANDREAS BECK: It's just not a game, what he's playing. You cannot describe it. It's unbelievable. I was thinking all the time, what the hell is he doing? He's running all the time, he catch every ball, and I told it in German, I think he's one of the best players in world. So he's the No. 2, yeah. He's the best player at the moment, I think, in the world.   
 But I was very enjoy the game, and I like -- I hope that I'm playing next time again against him, so maybe he's playing in Stuttgart, and then we'll see what happens.  
  
  Q. Did you feel any hope in the first set when you were holding serve and arriving to the tiebreaker?  
 ANDREAS BECK: No, I had all the time no chance against him.   
  
  Q. Do you feel like he's the big favorite, or maybe Djokovic?  
 ANDREAS BECK: Maybe Djokovic, yeah.  
  
  Q. You are friends or what (laughter)?   
 ANDREAS BECK: No, but yeah, I think it's just --  
  
  Q. And he has to beat Roger and Rafa both?  
 ANDREAS BECK: I have to say, I don't care who is winning now. I hope one of the three players is winning because they are playing, at the moment, in another league. So we will see what happens in two weeks.
