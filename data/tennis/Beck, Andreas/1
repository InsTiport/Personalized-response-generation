  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   What happened?   
ANDREAS BECK:   Um, the reason, of course, is the lower back.   I was practicing in the morning warming up, and probably I made a wrong step.   That is the reason why I have to pull out, unfortunately.  
I couldn't serve, so I think it doesn't make sense to play, especially now against Roger.   For me, it's the best decision.   
   
 Q.   Frustrating?   Disappointing?   What is your emotion?   
ANDREAS BECK:   Of course I'm disappointed, and I feel very sad at the moment.   I wanted to play against Roger.   It's always nice to play and a pleasure to play against him, of course.  
I was very looking forward to go on this beautiful court and all, to play before the people there, for the crowd.   Yeah, I'm missing still the words to say anything positive.   
But I have to, because it's the beginning of the season and I have to be careful to myself a little bit.   And, yeah, I think it's the best decision.
