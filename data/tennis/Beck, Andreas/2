 A. BECK/J. Acasuso
  7-6, 1-0, Ret. 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. What's your opinion on the injury of Acasuso, that he quit the game?  
 ANDREAS BECK: What happened?   
  
  Q. Yeah. What's your comment?   
 ANDREAS BECK: Well, I spoke after the match with him and asked him what happened with him, and he thought he got a pain in his feet, and I thought it came during the match at like 5-4. But I don't really say anything about him, because, I mean, it's very bad to lost like this with the injury, so first of all, he has to speak with you, then, what happened.   
  
  Q. Do you have any expectations of performers of Shanghai Masters Series, expectations for performers?  
 ANDREAS BECK: For the games? For this tournament? Well, it's difficult to say, because it's -- every round, it's unbelievable tough.   
 I think the best 50 players are playing the tournament, and the next round is Stepanek or Ferrero. Both players are incredible players. Stepanek, top 20 player; Ferrero, he was No. 1. So I just go on the court, try my best against the guys, and we will see what happen then.  
  
  Q. Good luck.   
 ANDREAS BECK: Thank you.
