6-4, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. A bit of a streaky match generally.  What is your take?  How well do you think you played today?
NAOMI OSAKA: Well, I think the first set was kind of dicey because I think we were both warming up a little bit.
Then in the second set I felt like I had the momentum till 4-1, and then I sort of like relaxed too much.  It felt like she didn't care anymore, to be honest, and she started hitting everything.  Hitting a sort of high-risk sort of game.  It was a bit overwhelming.
But I sort of tried to focus and just like -- it's not push-back, but sort of like wait until she hopefully dies out a little bit.  It worked, so...
Q. When you relax, what goes through your mind?  Does your mind wander to other things away from tennis?
NAOMI OSAKA: Not really.  It was like very chill, like there's no way I'm going to lose this set sort of feeling.  Then, of course, I had to bring the drama and go to a tiebreaker, so...
It's not like I go somewhere else.  I focus, but it's not really there.
Q. You're undefeated in your career in the first and second rounds of Grand Slams.  How happy are you with that?  You're pretty new at this.
NAOMI OSAKA: It sounds really good when you say it like that.  (Smiling.)  I mean, I'm happy with the way I play at slams 'cause they're very important to me, but I kind of wish I could transfer the feeling like to the other tournaments, you know.
Yeah, overall I'm like really happy with that, so...
Q. Do you think you can trick yourself when you're playing not at the slams to kind of have the same level of intensity and desire and ambition that you seem to have here?
NAOMI OSAKA: I try.  It's really hard 'cause the atmosphere is a bit different.  And today was really awesome, like the crowd and stuff.  Yeah.
Q. Did you feel like they were behind you?
NAOMI OSAKA: Not name calling, but there were like these Chinese people that were sort of against me.  But it was still very fun because it's like people are engaged, you know.
But, yeah, I felt like people were behind me.  I really appreciate it, so...
Q. Do you think these days you sign more autographs or you take more selfies with fans?
NAOMI OSAKA: Like do I sign more autographs or sign more like selfies, or like...
Q. Percentage-wise.
NAOMI OSAKA: Like percentage selfies or percentage autographs, or in a whole?
Q. In whole.
NAOMI OSAKA: I think at Grand Slams I do.
Q. Do more selfies?
NAOMI OSAKA: Oh, both.
Q. Which do you do more?
NAOMI OSAKA: But I think recently, because I've been doing well at the slams or whatever, people know me more.  I think so, if that answers your question.
Q. I'm wondering, do you do more of one versus the other.
NAOMI OSAKA: Oh, okay.  Sorry.
Autographs.  I do more autographs.  But I kind of like taking pictures more because it's faster.
Q. Do you feel like you're pretty well-known at this point?
NAOMI OSAKA: No.
Q. No?
NAOMI OSAKA: No.  (Smiling.)
Q. Next match you're playing against an American.  You mentioned an engaged atmosphere for this match.  What do you think it will be like for the next one?
NAOMI OSAKA: I don't think they'll be cheering for me, but I already played Coco.  I mean, I know what it's going to be like no matter what.  It's funner if I'm like the underdog sort of.  It takes pressure off me.
This match, it felt like I was expected to win a little bit, and that made me nervous.  The next match should be fun.
Q. How much do you know about Madison?  Do you watch her play tennis?  How familiar are you with her game and what do you expect if you do play her?
NAOMI OSAKA: Well, I practiced with her once before.  I'm kind of familiar that she hits really hard.
But like I feel the past two people I played, they sort of warmed me up if I do play her, because they both had good serves and hit really hard.
Q. Where did you practice with her?
NAOMI OSAKA: At Evert.
Q. Did any Beyonce songs pop in your head this time?
NAOMI OSAKA: No.  I'm sorry, no.
