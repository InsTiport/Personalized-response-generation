K. KANEPI/N. Osaka
6-3, 2-6, 7-5
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Stupid question:  Why did you win today?
NAOMI OSAKA: I didn't win.
Q. Oh, you didn't?  Sorry.  What do you think made the difference today in the end?
NAOMI OSAKA: Well, I think I was a bit emotionally unstable.  Like, I think she would be more positive than negative.  Like, she didn't have any outbursts or anything, and I had a lot.
Q. Where do you think some of those emotions were coming from?  Maybe thinking too far ahead or the way you were playing?
NAOMI OSAKA: Oh, this sucks.  (tearing up.)
I kind of feel like I didn't play as good.  Like, in my match against Kerber, I played really well, and I just didn't feel the same level my last two matches.  Sorry.
Q. What will you learn from this experience, ultimately?
NAOMI OSAKA: Just -- I think I stressed myself a little bit after playing Kerber, and I just had more expectations with myself.  So I think the next Grand Slams, if I happen to beat a really good player, I'm just going to take that one match at a time and just play within myself.
