N. OSAKA/S. Sorribes Tormo
6-3, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How are you liking your first time at Wimbledon?
NAOMI OSAKA: Well, I like it better now since I won my match.  I think I would be pretty disappointed if I lost.
It's really pretty here, I think, so...
Q. Grass would seem like a natural fit for your game on paper.  Does it feel that way for you so far here, with your aggression and power?
NAOMI OSAKA: I've been practicing pretty well on it.  I don't really have that much experience playing on grass.  I feel like every practice and every match is a new, like, lesson for me.  So I want to say that it suits my game.
Q. What was your feeling when you were broken at 6-5, when you had match point?  How did you concentrate on the tiebreak?
NAOMI OSAKA: Well, I kind of wanted to cry, but then someone shouted, Don't cry.  I was like, I probably shouldn't cry (smiling).
I just tried to really focus because, like, tiebreakers are sort of good for me.  If you break someone one point and hold your serve, that's basically you win the tiebreaker, so...
Q. You play Strycova next.  She's a player with a lot of variety.
NAOMI OSAKA: I actually just, like, practiced with her yesterday.  She's really nice.  They call me the Shinkansen.  Yeah, I mean, I hold her well because we've practiced a few times.  I'm kind of looking forward to the match because I know she gives, like, 100% of her energy, and I do, too, so it will be interesting.
Q. What was that you said she called you?
NAOMI OSAKA: The Shinkansen, which is like a Japanese bullet train.  I don't know why they do that.
Q. Barbora called you that?
NAOMI OSAKA: Yes.
Q. Do you know why she calls you that?
NAOMI OSAKA: I don't really know.  But it sounds cool, so I'll take it (smiling).
