 Q.  What did you love about your game today?  It was a very, very good performance.  
NAOMI OSAKA: Yeah, I mean, I tried to be as consistent, or consistent as I can.  She's a really good player.  It's kind of unfortunate that she got injured.  But, yeah, I mean, playing against her even when she was injured was still really tough, so...   
 Q.  Nice to back up what you achieved last year.  You're becoming a formidable player on the tour.  Either Serena or Karolina, of course.  You seem to be taking it all in your stride, just keeping fairly levelheaded.  Your level of play, you've had some adversity in this tournament, so it must be nice to come out today and play with that conviction.  
NAOMI OSAKA: Yeah, I mean, for me today, I just had one goal, and it was to try as hard as I can and not get angry.  Yeah, I didn't do that well in the last two rounds, so that was my only goal, and I think I did it well, so I'm really happy with how I played today.   
 Q.  Quick thought on Serena or Karolina.  What lies ahead next in your thoughts on that match coming up next?  
NAOMI OSAKA: Yeah, I played them both, and they're both very great players.  Sorry.  I know that it's going to be tough no matter who I play.  Honestly, I'm just trying to go inside because it's a little bit hot right now.   
 Q.  You want me to let you go, don't you?  
NAOMI OSAKA: Yeah, I'm sorry.
