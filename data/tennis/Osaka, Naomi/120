7-6, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Talk about the heat, how tough it was out there.
NAOMI OSAKA: Well, I didn't really think it was hot.  I think it has to do with the fact that I live in Florida.  I actually really like the heat more than the cold, so...
Q. You practice a lot in intense heat, and that's helped you?
NAOMI OSAKA: Yeah.  Actually, yeah, I like the heat a lot.
Q. How do you think your game improved during the off-season?
NAOMI OSAKA: I did a lot of fitness.  I think that was one of the main things I worked on.  Other than that, just more mentality.
Q. How far do you think you might be able to go here?
NAOMI OSAKA: I think everyone has a chance.  I feel like I came here to win, so hopefully I can do that.
