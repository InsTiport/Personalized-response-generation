N. OSAKA/A. Riske
6-4, 6-0
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You adjusted well after the break in the first set. Did you change anything? Was it just a question of getting into the rhythm?
NAOMI OSAKA: I mean, I think getting into the rhythm. But also I feel like I was hitting too hard, if that makes sense. It seemed like she was the type that would use my pace, especially on the forehand.
I just tried not to give her too much.
Q. How did you prepare for this match? She has such a good history in China. She'd come into this week after the final in Wuhan. When you were preparing for this match, what were some of the keys for you tactically?
NAOMI OSAKA: I mean, I didn't really do much. This is going to sound so ridiculous. All I know is that I read something on Twitter that Sabalenka said she had a good backhand down the line. That's basically all I was thinking about.
As far as tactics go, I didn't really do anything too extreme.
Q. You haven't lost a set in Asia through this swing from Osaka to here. What is particularly clicking either in your game from an execution standpoint, or is this more of just you're relaxed, happy to be in Asia?
NAOMI OSAKA: Hmm... I'm relaxed, but I'm a little bit angry. Like it's an angry relaxed. Because, like, I know after Australia I was like, I'm going to have fun. It was not fun. I did not have fun. Then after US Open, I know I said I was kind of 'satisfied' with that. But honestly no.
So, yeah, I took a week break. I was sorting out my thoughts. I was thinking that I have to at least end the year well. Osaka is coming up, and I always play well in Japan, like I have to win that tournament, and I have to do well in the Asian swing, so...
Q. 'I have to win Japan, I have to play well at the end of the year,' can that kind of thought process it be counterproductive that you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself that you have to end the year well? Does that make it hard to be relaxed?
NAOMI OSAKA: Surprisingly it's worse when I tell myself not to have pressure. My ADHD, which I didn't go to a doctor, I'm just self-diagnosing, but my ADHD, if I tell myself to relax, I play three-set matches. Out here, if you see I'm kind of 'angry' right now, I can get through straight-set wins. It depends on if I'm really hyper-focused or not.
Q. The angry relaxed, have you found that balance in yourself? Are you managing that really well during the match?
NAOMI OSAKA: I mean, this match or every match in general?
Q. In general.
NAOMI OSAKA: In general I think, yeah, I start off the beginning, like, with the same game plan, then I try to adjust depending on what the person does. For the most part once it reaches a certain point...
Today I was kind of happy because the first set was really tight. I was thinking that it's been a while since I've kind of had to be really serious.
I think it really depends on who I play.
Q. You could get Andreescu next. She's a bit in the position you were in last year, winning the US Open, getting into this whirlwind. Have you seen her play at all in the US Open final? How would you see a match against her?
NAOMI OSAKA: No, I did not watch the US Open after I lost. Sorry (smiling). I knew that she won, though.
But, yeah, I was watching her play Toronto when I was there. It's pretty obvious, but she seems to be -- well, she is an amazing player.
I don't know. I feel like she's doing better than I was last year, so it's all cool. I have to learn from her, too.
Q. A little bit more on playing Andreescu. What did you notice when you did get to see her play in Toronto? What do you think it will be like to match up against somebody else who is another star of this younger generation that you kind of own?
NAOMI OSAKA: I'm older than her, very much so (smiling).
Yeah, I noticed that she seems to be very, like, just focused. She plays a lot of three sets. Is it just me? I think someone that plays a lot of three sets, it shows that they don't really care about the -- like they can just keep building off.
Obviously she won a Grand Slam. That's one of her very good traits. But for me, I don't really like talking too much about who I'm going to play because they still haven't played their match yet. It's still undecided.
