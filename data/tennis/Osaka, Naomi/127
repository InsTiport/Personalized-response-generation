THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What do you take from this match today?  What was your experience of the match?
NAOMI OSAKA: Well, it was really fun for me.  I also learned a lot.
Q. Were you expecting her to give you such a hard time and to be so dominating?
NAOMI OSAKA: Yeah (smiling).
No, I just watched her matches, and I saw that she's, like, kind of on the line and, like, going forward, you know.
I already kind of knew that going into the match, and I just think that the way that she was playing, and, like, her plan was a bit more like she executed it better than me.
I don't know.  I just think she knows more about tennis than me.  I just have to, like, have more experience and stuff.
Q. What goals did you set for yourself for the season?
NAOMI OSAKA: Is the season a year or, like,  it's Australia and then...
Q. Did you set any goals from here to the end of the tennis season?
NAOMI OSAKA: Yeah.  Well, I wanted to do well here.  I mean, that's kind of -- well, technically, I did do well.  Like, I don't think I played a bad match.  I have a lot to learn from it, but I wanted to get to the quarterfinals, which is kind of like, eh.  But whatever.
But, like, going forward, I know that I can play well, because usually after, like, a loss I play better, because I learned from it.
I'm sorry, I'm totally, like, not answering your question.
Goals for the season, I wanted to get into the top 20, win a tournament, and then get to the quarterfinals of a slam.
Q. Was there anything in her game today that surprised you?
NAOMI OSAKA: I think her serve.  I think the first-serve percentage was pretty high.  I didn't -- like, I couldn't look at the stats.  Like, I'll look at it later, but that was kind of surprising for me.
I was kind of wondering if, like, my return was really bad or her serve was really good.  But I think it was her serve.
Yeah, it was really good, her serve, today.
Q. How do you think you played today compared to your previous matches?  Do you think you played as well, or is it a completely different day, completely different game?
NAOMI OSAKA: Well, the thing is I didn't start the year off that well.  Like, I injured myself.  That was really bad.  So I couldn't really play that many matches.  So I have, like, really nothing to compare this match to.
But if I compare, like, this match to how I played at the end of last year, I would say it's at a decent level.  She plays different from the girls that I played in Tokyo, so I can't really say, like, if it was good or bad or not.
I know that I'm feeling better now, so I can, like, play more tournaments and hopefully do better then.
Q. (Off microphone.)
NAOMI OSAKA: Like, she's more aggressive.  I can see -- like, I heard her talk, and she sounds really intelligent.  It's just, like, oh, my God, I sound illiterate or something.
Yeah, I can see that she's very focused.
Q. Just the British accent that gave you that idea?
NAOMI OSAKA: No, she uses big words, you know.  Like, big words.  Even I don't know -- like, I can't say the words that she's saying.  It's so hard to explain.  She uses big words in her accent, and it sounds really smart.  (Laughter.)
Q. Do you feel like your mental game has improved, as well?
NAOMI OSAKA: I think, yeah, I tried not to get that upset with myself, because I know, like, everybody's going to, like, lose a match and everyone just has to learn from it.
So I try not to slam my racquet.  But, yeah.  I think I was a bit more composed now.
