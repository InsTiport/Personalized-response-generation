N. OSAKA/D. Cibulkova
6-3, 6-3
(Transcribed from WTA recorded audio.)
Q. Tough schedule with the rain delay yesterday.  Talk about how you're feeling.
NAOMI OSAKA: Yeah, I mean, I feel pretty good today.  I was expecting a really hard match.  That's what I was given.
Given the circumstances, yeah, I feel pretty great.
Q. Anything about your game that you felt went well?
NAOMI OSAKA: I think for me today, especially my serve was really good.  I just tried to be really calm compared to the last match that I played.
Q. Thoughts on your next round, either Georges or Buzarnescu.
NAOMI OSAKA: Yeah, I've played both I want to say, like, twice.  I know that they're both really great players, of course.  Julia, she's really hard to play for me.  Buzarnescu, I played her on grass, so I'm assuming on clay it's going to be different.
