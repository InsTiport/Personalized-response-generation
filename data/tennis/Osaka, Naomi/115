6-2, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How do you evaluate how it went today?  
NAOMI OSAKA: For me, I think it went pretty bad, like, not in a negative way.  Just I think I could have enjoyed it more, being on Centre Court.  It was my first time.  To always see it on TV, to just go there and not really enjoy the moment, I think that was the part that I regret the most.   
 Q.  Was it a slightly eerie sensation, less full than usual given the England match?  
NAOMI OSAKA: I mean, I wasn't really looking around.  I didn't really notice anything.
