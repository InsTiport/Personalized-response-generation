7-6, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our boy's champion.
Q. How does it feel to be a Grand Slam champion?
SEBASTIAN KORDA: It feels pretty good.  It's definitely special, including being here in Australia.  I mean, my sister won her first title here, as well.  My dad won his only Grand Slam title here, so it's very special.
Q. What were your expectations coming in?  Did you really give yourself a chance?  Did you expect to be in this position now?
SEBASTIAN KORDA: I mean, every tournament I go to, I always want to win it, no matter if I'm playing a challenger event, a futures event.  I always think I can always have a good chance of winning it.
Q. Have you spoken to your dad since winning?
SEBASTIAN KORDA: No, I haven't.  I just looked at my phone for the first time.
Q. Is he on there?
SEBASTIAN KORDA: Yeah, he is.
Q. Where is he at the moment?
SEBASTIAN KORDA: He's back home in Bradenton.
Q. Did he consider coming here, especially when you got to the finals?
SEBASTIAN KORDA: No.  He was supposed to come, but didn't end up.  I came up with my USTA coach, Dean Goldfine.
Q. Talk a little bit about Dean.  He's been with a lot of great players, such a motivator.
SEBASTIAN KORDA: Dean, he motivates you every single day, even when you lose a match.  The day before, I mean, he wants you to get on court, he motivates you, wants you to start playing so you can have a good chance in the next tournament.
Q. Your playing style is quite laid back.  Do you find coaches try to encourage you to show a bit more intensity?
SEBASTIAN KORDA: I mean, it's just kind of how I am on court.  I mean, I never give up on anything.  I always try my best.
But it's just, I guess, how I am.  Of course, I would love to be like a Nadal, but I can't.
Q. Have you ever seen video of your father winning here?
SEBASTIAN KORDA: Yeah, no, I've seen his match on YouTube a lot.  I watch it at least maybe once a month (smiling).  A little bit of motivation.
Q. The whole match?
SEBASTIAN KORDA: Most of it, not the whole thing.
Q. Does he know you do that?
SEBASTIAN KORDA: He knows I've watched it multiple times.
Q. What do you think of him as a player?
SEBASTIAN KORDA: I mean, he was definitely top of his game when he was playing.  I mean, he was an incredible player.  Very talented.  He still is unbelievable.
Q. Do you hit with him a lot?
SEBASTIAN KORDA: Yeah, no, every time I'm home.  He's my main coach.  He's the main one I play with when I'm back home at IMG.  I play with all the other guys there, but usually when I practice, it's usually just him.
Q. You're not beating up on him yet?
SEBASTIAN KORDA: No.
Q. People talk about your dad a lot, but not about your mother, who also had a very good tennis career.
SEBASTIAN KORDA: My mom is exactly like my dad in everything.  She's the person who runs the family.  Everything goes through her.  Without her, we wouldn't be anywhere.
Q. Do you practice at the USTA?
SEBASTIAN KORDA: I train at the IMG Academies and a little bit at the USTA in Orlando, yeah.
Q. Most 17-year-olds don't want to listen to their parents.  Your dad is your coach.  How does that work?
SEBASTIAN KORDA: Sometimes it's difficult, definitely.  But he knows everything about the game.  You can't really argue with him.
Q. He seemed to not be pushy, though.  Two years ago, the USTA wanted you on the team for the French and Wimbledon.  He wanted you to go to school.  Has that been a help?
SEBASTIAN KORDA: Yeah, I mean, definitely.  He doesn't push me.  It's my choice.  It's what I want to do with my life.  He's there to support me and help me any way he can.
But definitely I'm the one who wants it the most.
Q. How come you didn't end up playing golf?
SEBASTIAN KORDA: It was a little bit too boring for me when I was little.  I liked fast-paced stuff.  I played ice hockey till I was 10 years old.  It's pretty fast.
Q. (Indiscernible.)
SEBASTIAN KORDA: We had a really good team.  I think we were No. 2 in the U.S. and Canada for 2000s.  Yeah, I mean, I did that until I was 10 years old, then chose tennis.
Q. What is your memory of what Jessica did in the city golf-wise?
SEBASTIAN KORDA: I remember I was actually sleeping when she won it.  My parents woke me up with them screaming in the kitchen.  But, I mean, of course, every time she plays, I follow them.
Q. What is your plan this year?  Are you going to play more futures and challengers?
SEBASTIAN KORDA: Yeah, I'm definitely going to try to play more futures, challengers especially, maybe try to get into a couple of ATP tournaments.  Whatever happens.
Q. Are you going to continue to play the juniors, at least the majors?
SEBASTIAN KORDA: Yeah, I mean, I'll try to play French Open and Wimbledon and US Open.
Q. Not that many father and son pairs in tennis.  Most former players push their kids away from tennis.  Do you have any idea why you're different?
SEBASTIAN KORDA: Yeah, I mean, most parents push their kids away.  I really fell in love with the sport.  I wouldn't take no for an answer to play it.
Q. Did your parents try to say no?
SEBASTIAN KORDA: My dad, of course, tried to push me away a little bit.  He would always take me to tournaments with Radek Stepanek.  I fell in love with it.  Ever since he's supported me as much as he can.
Q. What were his reasons for saying no?
SEBASTIAN KORDA: I don't know.  I don't know really.  Just didn't really want me to play.
Q. Will you try to get a wild card at Delray?
SEBASTIAN KORDA: I don't know yet.  Haven't thought about it.
Q. Do you speak Czech at home?
SEBASTIAN KORDA: We speak Czechlish.  It's a mixture of Czech and English.  With my sisters, I speak mostly English.  With my parents, Czech.
Q. Do you play golf?
SEBASTIAN KORDA: Yeah, no, I play a lot of golf when I'm home.  I play about three times a week, four times a week.  Whenever I can, after practice, 4:30, I'll go play some holes.
Q. When you play with your sisters...
SEBASTIAN KORDA: I never play with my sisters.  I stay away from that.  Too much competition.
Q. What is your handicap?
SEBASTIAN KORDA: 2 right now.
Q. Regular men's tour?
SEBASTIAN KORDA: I'm pushing for it.  Maybe after my career, I'll play some golf.
Q. Was this tournament always the focus for you, Australia, your dad's connection?
SEBASTIAN KORDA: I mean, I never really thought about ever coming here.  Last year I played the futures in Florida.  This last year, me and my best friend, Nicolas Mejia, we decided, Let's go to Australia and see what we can do.
Q. Is it right that you wanted to win this tournament as a 50th birthday present?
SEBASTIAN KORDA: Yeah, definitely, that was the main goal here, was try to get this tournament for my dad on his 50th birthday.  My mom's birthday is on the 5th of February, so it's special as well.
