6-4, 6-4, 2-6, 6-4
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. Can you put into words your feelings at the moment.  Obviously that would be the biggest win of your career.  What have your mom and dad said so far?
SEBASTIAN KORDA:   I'm over the moon.  I'm super happy with the way I played, the way I stayed calm.  Yeah, I just played a really good match.  Super happy with it.
Q. Any word from your mom and dad?
SEBASTIAN KORDA:   They watched the whole match.  My sisters, as well.  Everybody is pretty hyped up right now.  No, it was the first person I called when I walked off court.  We were all so happy.  Yeah, just a great moment.
Q. How do you maintain a good level after this?  It's obviously a big high.  There's another match to be played yet.  What do you do to just keep things on an even keel?
SEBASTIAN KORDA:   Kind of just what I've been doing every single match.  Just going through my routines, doing the same things every day pretty much.
Yeah, I mean, I'm super happy to be here playing on clay here in Paris.  You don't get to experience it throughout the whole year.  Yeah, it's tough not to be happy here.  Having a good mindset.
Yeah, I'm just looking forward to every single practice, every single match.  Been a good trip so far.
Q. Can you just talk about the importance of having Mike (indiscernible) in your corner?
SEBASTIAN KORDA:   Yeah, he's a big help.  We started working in December or November together.  Yeah, he's a super positive guy.  We just have a lot of fun just working together.  The results are showing for it.
He's built my body to where we both think where it should be.  He's been a super big help for me.
