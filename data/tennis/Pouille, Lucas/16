L. POUILLE/A. Seppi   
6-2, 3-6, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Okay.  Questions, please.   
 Q.  How good did it feel to get a win?  It's been a while  on tour.  I know you had the Davis Cup wins, but it's been a while.  
LUCAS POUILLE: It feels great, especially after these kind of matches.  You know, 7-6 in the third.  I had some opportunities but didn't make them.   
And then I came back from a break down in the third.  Yeah, it feels always great to get a victory like this.   
 Q.  Why do you think things weren't working for you in these matches the last few weeks?  
LUCAS POUILLE: Okay.  I think it was a match where, especially in Monaco, where I did not play well at all.  I was not feeling the ball well, was not feeling well.   
And then lose one match, two match, you lose a bit of confidence.  And you still have to come back.   
It was a bit different in Madrid, where I played pretty well, very well.   
So, yeah, I think that's it.  I just try to work hard and try to coming back.  But, yeah, it's good to win.
