6-3, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What are your thoughts on that?  
LUCAS POUILLE: Well, I think he played some great tennis tonight.  Even if I think I had some opportunities, especially in the second set where I got the break, 3-1 up, I couldn't conserve it.   
Yeah, I think it was tough match.  I was not serving well at all.  I think I have very, very low percentage of first serve.  That was not good because, you know, few easy points with my serve would have been good with my energy.  I think that didn't help me.   
But, yeah, I think he was very solid, played some great tennis when he had to.   
 Q.  You played a lot of matches in the last month.  You could be forgiven for feeling a little bit tired today.  
LUCAS POUILLE: Forgiven, I don't know.  I'll be forgiven by who wants.   
I mean, I know I tried.  I tried very hard until the end.  He was, yeah, just better than me today.  Now I need some rest, need to travel to the States.  It's a long travel, long jetlag with 12 hours.  I really need to try to be ready for Indian Wells.   
 Q.  Which one do you prefer, Indian Wells or Miami?  
LUCAS POUILLE: Good question.  I think Indian Wells because, I mean, I love the place.  I think it's an amazing place.  There is few maybe places like this in the world.  I would say Indian Wells.   
 Q.  Overall a fantastic week for you.  
LUCAS POUILLE: Yeah, fantastic, I don't know.   
 Q.  Getting to another finals is not a bad thing.  
LUCAS POUILLE: No.  It would have been better with a victory, so that's why it's not fantastic.   
No, it was a good week.  Very positive things, a lot of positive things.  We'll see how it goes for the few coming weeks.   
Anyway, I'm very happy with the way I played, with the way I managed the translation between Marseille and here because it was really close.  I don't know, I didn't really know how to deal with it.  But I'm very happy with the way I did.  Now I need to look forward.   
 Q.  What is your aim for this year?  
LUCAS POUILLE: Aim?  Reaching top 10, trying to be in London at the end of the season.  That's definitely one of my goals.  Winning as many titles as possible, go as far as possible in the Grand Slams especially.
