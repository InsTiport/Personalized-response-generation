M. ZVEREV/L. Pouille
2-6, 6-1, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French, please.
Q. Did you think you were past the most difficult part when you won the first set?
LUCAS POUILLE: No, I didn't believe this was the toughest part.  Even if I won 6-2, I know I was not serving well.  I was giving him opportunities to break me.  My level of game was not good.  In the second set, he played better and I was continuing to have a poor level of game.
After, he was the most aggressive player.
Q. How did he give you trouble?
LUCAS POUILLE: My game gave me trouble, rather.  My game was not at a good level from the beginning to the end.  He was serving well, playing well.
But it's just me.  I didn't play well during the match.
Q. Were you tense maybe?
LUCAS POUILLE: No, I didn't feel tense.  I think it's just the kind of match you need to forget and move on to something else.
Q. What happened?  You have no idea?
LUCAS POUILLE: Well, I never had the same feeling that I had during practice.  I'll just forget about this match.
Q. You had good preparation and everything.  What happened?
LUCAS POUILLE: It would be easy if we could know in advance how we're going to feel on the court.  I just need to think about something else now.
Q. But even stepping back, you don't have any idea now what happened?
LUCAS POUILLE: Well, I'm just off the court for one hour.  It's too soon.  I have no particular explanation.
Q. Is your schedule going to change after this loss?  Are you going to play next week?
LUCAS POUILLE: Yes.  I am in Budapest next week.  My schedule will not change.
