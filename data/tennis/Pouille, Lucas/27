L. POUILLE/M. Jaziri
6-7, 6-4, 6-4, 7-6
Q. Your next opponent will be Janowicz.  Could you say something about him?  You played once?
LUCAS POUILLE: Yeah, we played once in St. Petersburg, I think.  It was 7-6, 7-6 for me.  It was a very close match.  I mean, he's a great player.  On grass he's very dangerous.  He has a huge serve, so he's not easy to play.
But, yeah, I will be ready and I know it's going to be a tough one.
Q. Do you expect the match will be more difficult than today or less?
LUCAS POUILLE: Sorry?
Q. Do you expect that Jerzy will play better than today's opponent?
LUCAS POUILLE: I don't know.  It's a different kind of players.  I know he's a good player, but I don't know if it's going to be more difficult or not.  We never know.
