THE MODERATOR: Questions.   
 Q.  A lot of the seeds seem to be struggling in the men's and women's draw.  Just wanted to get your thoughts on why you think that is.  
LUCAS POUILLE: I have no idea why the seeds are losing.  I mean, I can talk about me, but talking about them, I mean, I really don't know what is happening here or the reason.   
 Q.  Personally for you.  
LUCAS POUILLE: Because he was better than me today.  That's it.  I think that's the only reason.   
 Q.  Is the grass at Wimbledon harder to play on than grass elsewhere, would you say?  
LUCAS POUILLE: No, it's actually easier to play here than somewhere else.  The courts are much better, so it's -- yeah, it's definitely the best grass court on tour.   
 Q.  What do you think of France's chances in the World Cup?  Given that the men's singles final and World Cup final are the same time, which one would you be watching?  
LUCAS POUILLE: Definitely soccer if it's France.  Otherwise I don't know.  But definitely soccer, not tennis (smiling).   
 Q.  What did your opponent do good today?  
LUCAS POUILLE: I think he played well the whole match, especially the fifth set he was very aggressive, returning well, and putting a lot of pressure on my serve.  Yeah.  That's it.
