THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
   
 Q. For people who are just getting familiar with your game, how would you describe your style of play?  
LUCAS POUILLE: I think, yeah, I'm playing aggressive, trying to approach the net as much as possible, trying to dominate the point, to be on the baseline, and not to be so far away and run every time.   
Yeah, I think aggressive player.   
   
 Q. Before the tournament started, what were your expectations? Now what does it feel like to be in the quarterfinals?  
LUCAS POUILLE: Before the tournament, was to win one match on grass. Yeah, now, of course, I'm very happy, very emotional with the win today. I try to recover as good as possible for Wednesday. It will be my first day off tomorrow, so it will be good.   
But, yeah, now trying to reach the semifinal.   
   
 Q. We don't know who your next opponent will be. What do you think the mental challenge will be for you to play on such a big stage in the quarterfinals?  
LUCAS POUILLE: I think it will be one of my most important match of my career so far. To reach the semifinal of a Grand Slam, of course, it's important. If it's Jiri Vesely, it's the same for him. If it's Berdych, he has already made final here. We'll see.   
But for the moment, I'm just trying to enjoy and I will get ready for Wednesday tomorrow.   
   
 Q. What are the reasons for you that you made such a fine development within the last 12 months?  
LUCAS POUILLE: I think I worked very hard. Yeah, I changed couple of things. End of December I was in Dubai. I practice hard under the sun. It was hot, difficult conditions. That's why I think I can play every day here. I was able to do it.   
At the end I was maybe, yeah, more fresh than him. Yeah, I think that's the main reason.
