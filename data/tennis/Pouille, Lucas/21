L. POUILLE/Y. Sugita   
3-6, 6-3, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  He wasn't easy to beat, was he?  
LUCAS POUILLE: No, he wasn't.  Definitely not.  I knew it would be a tough one.  As I said yesterday, he won plenty of matches in the past six, seven months.  He's a very good player.   
I knew I had to play some good tennis to win.   
 Q.  What do you think you did best?  
LUCAS POUILLE: I think after a lot of first set, I started to be a bit more aggressive, especially in the return.  I was very close from the baseline, even sometimes inside the court to return the second serve.  That put him under pressure.  I think that made the difference.   
 Q.  You may play Krajinovic next round.  You played against him in Marseille.  
LUCAS POUILLE: He won already?   
 Q.  No, you might play.  He plays next match.  What do you think about the match in Marseille?  
LUCAS POUILLE: It was close.  He's a very good player.  I mean, he made the final in Bercy last year at the end of the season.  It was not so long ago.   
I think, yeah, he going to improve his ranking.  I think he's going to become top 20 very soon.  I know it's going to be a very tough match if I want to reach the final.   
 Q.  Difference between indoors and outdoors, who will that favor?  
LUCAS POUILLE: Good question.  We will see tomorrow night.  Hopefully for me.
