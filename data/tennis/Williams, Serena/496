 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Talk about the craziness of being here at 1:35.   
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Exactly. This is definitely insane. This is definitely a weird, different schedule. At least I can say I've done something like this before.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about your singles match, where it seemed to turn.   
 SERENA WILLIAMS: It turned when I didn't do what I needed to do. Just didn't work out, so...   
 You know, I had chances to go up 4-1 or 3-1, I don't know, and I ruined it for myself pretty much.   
  
  Q. Do you feel like you just lost concentration?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, I was cruising. There's no reason I should have lost. So, you know, at least going into the Open, I hope I have another opportunity and things will be different.   
 I just didn't -- you know, I missed some key shots that I probably shouldn't have missed. You know, that was that.   
  
  Q. As far as the schedule, did you assume at some point maybe the doubles would be pushed off or did you know you were going to have to sit here and wait?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I just assumed I was going to be playing. I figured there wasn't any rain. So I felt like I would be playing the whole time.   
 Go home, guys. Thank you.
