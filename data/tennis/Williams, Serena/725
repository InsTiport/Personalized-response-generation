WTA: Questions for Serena. 

Q. You look like you weren't moving very well. Was that part of the problem?

SERENA WILLIAMS: I mean, it was -- I don't know. I mean, everything she hit was either
on the line or a winner. So, I mean, what can you do? 

Q. Even when you had opportunities, you were missing shots you normally get. 

SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, I usually make those shots. I mean, I didn't have all that many
opportunities. The ones I did have, I didn't make it. You don't take your opportunity,
then someone else will. 

Q. The other day after the match and after the press conference, you went out and hit
some balls with a strong opponent, your father. You were working on a particular part of
your game, backhand. Was that the problem you were working on?

SERENA WILLIAMS: No. I was -- yeah, yeah. Yeah, I was, backhand. 

Q. Did your serve let you down, because she was really pouncing on your second
especially?

SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, she -- every ball that I put in place, I guess she pounced on
it. She had a plan. You know, usually she doesn't make that many shots. I'm sure her next
match, hopefully she'll do well. I've never seen her make that many shots that
consistently in my life. 

Q. Seven aces in your two first service games, then you struggled. Why was that?

SERENA WILLIAMS: I don't know. 

Q. How about the heat, did that bother you at all?

SERENA WILLIAMS: No. I'm used to the heat. You know, I live in Florida. It's no big
deal.

Q. You called it, you said you're going to be back on an early plane if you didn't
(inaudible). 

SERENA WILLIAMS: Did I? 

Q. Yes, last session. Have you played many matches when your opponent played that well?

SERENA WILLIAMS: I've never played a match where my opponent has played pretty much
nearly impeccable the way she did today. There's some days when your opponent's on, you're
not on. It's kind of hard to play when you're not playing your best, but your opponent is
playing, you know, out-of-this-world tennis. 

Q. This whole tournament, did you ever feel you were playing your best tennis?

SERENA WILLIAMS: At this tournament, not at all. 

Q. 50 percent, 80 percent?

SERENA WILLIAMS: I mean, 10. 

Q. How disappointing is it not to defend your title?

SERENA WILLIAMS: Well, obviously this is disappointing because I just go in every
tournament to try to win. You know, it's just a game, and next year. Last question. 

Q. Even though you did not play up to your game today, I think you played wonderful. 

SERENA WILLIAMS: Thanks. 

Q. How is your confidence now compared to the past? Do you feel as confident as in the
past or are you having problems in that area?

SERENA WILLIAMS: No. I mean, my confidence right now is really soaring. I feel like I
can fly.
