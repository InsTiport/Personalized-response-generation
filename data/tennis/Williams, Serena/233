  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How much are you prepared for Wimbledon this year physically and mentally?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I think both I'm really prepared for and really excited to be here.   
   
 Q.   How do you feel coming here after the French?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I feel good.   I feel like every year is another year.   
I feel happy to be here.  
   
 Q.   Can you tell us what you've been doing since the French Open?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I've been doing just a lot of training, just working out, trying to get ready for the next event, which so happened to be Wimbledon.   
   
 Q.   When did you arrive here?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I got here on Sunday.   So, yeah, almost a week.   
   
 Q.   Were you practicing back in Florida before that?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   With your father?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   Serena, when you lose early in a tournament, do you watch the tennis after that or do you divorce yourself from it?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I didn't watch this one in particular, but usually I do watch, enjoy tennis.  
   
 Q.   How about the World Cup?   To what degree have you been watching, and what are your thoughts on the U.S. team's progress?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I watch a match, at least one or two games every day.   Excited for the U.S.   Obviously I'm rooting for the U.S.   We were finally able to beat Ghana, so that was really good.  
   
 Q.   What did you learn about the team from that game against Ghana?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I thought they were really aggressive.   They played really well.   We had a guy out early, which was disappointing.   I thought the fight that the U.S. male team has was just really great.   
   
 Q.   Can I ask you what you make of Matosevic's comments where he says he doesn't rate the women's game?   And would you like to play him in a match?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Oh, I didn't read his comments.   I'm okay.   I don't want to play anybody.   Just females, please.   
   
 Q.   A bunch of pictures coming out of you and Caroline in Miami in various leopard prints.   Talk about your time there.   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I love Caro.   We have a great time together.   Obviously she was in Miami, so we kind of hooked up and we hung out.   
You know, she was ‑‑ just trying to be a positive influence in her life.   
   
 Q.   There's a lot of debate about Andy Murray's appointment of AmÃ©lie Mauresmo at his coach.   What is your take on it?   Are you glad to see it or are you surprised by it?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   It doesn't bother me one way or the other.   I think Andy Murray can make any decision he chooses.   I think AmÃ©lie Mauresmo was a former Wimbledon champion, a former No.1, and I know she's won more than one Grand Slam.   
So that's his choice.   
   
 Q.   Can you ever in your post playing days envision being the coach of a top female or male player?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I can't answer that question.   I have no idea.   I can't say no because I do think that one should never say never; however, I don't know the answer to that.   
   
 Q.   What feeling do you have when you come back here as someone who has won here as often as you have?   How do those experiences carry forward into this tournament for you?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   It carries a long way.   It feels good.   I feel good.   When I came here, I just felt a sense of being home.   I really like being here.   
   
 Q.   You've said that you'd never say never.   Why do you think there's not more female coaches in the game?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I have no idea.   
   
 Q.   Would you personally have a female coach?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I don't see why not.   My mom still helps me out a lot.   I don't see why not.   
   
 Q.   A lot of people thought you might be given the first spot on Tuesday.   With Bartoli not defending and you were the previous year's winner, it went to Lisicki instead.   Wondering your reaction to that.   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   She was in the final last year, so she was two sets closer than I was.   So why not?   
For me, you have to be ready to play on any day.  
   
 Q.   Your French Open defeat, how long did it take you to get over that?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Who says I was over it (smiling)?   
   
 Q.   Are you not over it then?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, I doubt it.   Knowing me, no.   
   
 Q.   There's a whole new generation of young women coming through.   Do you see them as a particularly talented group?   That whole generation, do you see them as an exciting prospect for women's tennis?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I think so.   I think the young ladies have really stepped up their game and really want to prove that they can be great.   Will be great.   They are great.   
They are the future of tennis.   I think, in particular, all the Americans, obviously I have an interest in.   So I would like to see them do really well.   
   
 Q.   I don't know if you're close to Taylor Thompson.   I heard she was criticized by the American Federation about her weight.   What I want to know what's your opinion about that?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   That actually happened a long time ago, and I actually already gave an opinion about it, so...  
   
 Q.   What recollections do you have of the type of player Maria was 10 years ago when she won here, and what observations do you have of Maria as a player sense?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   It's hard to believe it's been 10 years.   It's not many people that have a really long career like that.   Just speaking longevity‑wise, I think it's great.   
You have to evolve.   You can't just play tennis and just keep hitting and hitting.   You have to do things better, and I think she's been able to do that.
