THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   You aware that there was a bomb threat today and a lockdown?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, there was a bomb threat and a lockdown, but that's all I know about it.   Scary.  
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts?   Obviously you seem to be much happier with how you're playing now to two or three days ago.   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yes, I'm playing a little better.   I had to play better.   As the tournament progresses you can't get worse, you have to get better.  
I'm happy to be doing a little better.  
   
 Q.   You still seem not totally happy yet.   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   The good news is I can play better, so that keeps me really happy, actually.   So knowing that I can still play several levels higher is good for me.  
   
 Q.   Maria, who you play next, seems to have always brought out your best tennis.   Why do you think that is?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Well, when you're playing, you know, champions, you have to play your best.   So she always plays her best and her heart out against me.  
We just have to bring the best because we both are really good players.  
   
 Q.   How do you think it is that you play someone who obviously is a career slam winner herself, as well, and she hasn't been able to beat you in ten years now?   How does that happen?   How do you think?   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   You know, I don't know.   I just try to play good and, you know, she obviously tries really hard.  
We just both do the best we can when we try to play each other.   
   
 Q.   Do you think it's a tactical matchup thing or mental?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Well, I love playing her.   I really do.   Doesn't matter what surface or anything.   She's one of my favorite people to play.   And so I think that helps, too, when you're like playing people.   I think it just gets you really pumped.
