S. WILLIAMS/A. Radwanska
  6‑2, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, in English, please. 

Q.   You seemed to pull up with some sort of injury in the second set.   Could you give us some details about that. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   My back was a little tight.   I've been playing a lot, so it just got a little tight and I was just trying to release it.   It's been a little tight all week, but it spasmed up a little bit out there today. 

Q.   It seemed like you really dictated the pace the entire match, even if you were down a few points.   Can you speak to that at all?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Well, playing against Agnieszka, she plays like magic.   She can move the ball left and right.   She can do anything with her shots.
For me today it was just important to try to stay ahead or one step ahead of her.   Just tried to do that. 

Q.   We heard little bit of talk about the pollution in the air in Beijing and that the levels are very high.   Do you feel anything, or do you feel like it's just normal?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Well, I'm a California girl, so I can't help you there. 

Q.   My question is irrelevant to the match today.   I want to ask something about the Psycho Serena.   In the documentary of Venus and Serena, you said you had different personalities that live inside your body.   There's someone called Megan and there's Summer Diaz who got divorce and stayed in England.   There's Takwanda who surprised everybody back in 2009 US Open.   My question is, which one is more close to the real Serena, and who am I talking to right now here in Beijing?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No, I've been just Serena lately.   I've kind of pushed those characters aside and really just been focusing on me. 
So, yeah.
