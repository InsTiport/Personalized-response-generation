  6‑3, 6‑2 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   You played a great game tonight.   How did you leave the match?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I left pretty confident that I can play pretty well or played well.   I actually didn't think I played well, to be honest, but I left confident that I can do better.  
   
 Q.   It seemed like it was clearly the best match you played all week.   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Definitely the best I played.   I had to play better.   I'm playing a player that's very consistent, doesn't lose often, just usually in finals and semis.   So I had to be on my game today.  
   
 Q.   Now, you have a lopsided win/loss record against her but also Azarenka.   Going into a match, does that help you or do you think about that?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No, I feel like every time you have to go in with a new spirit and a new‑‑ you know, it's a new day.   The slate is wiped clean to me.   
   
 Q.   After all the tremendous achievements you have done for your tennis career, what keeps you motivated to this day to continue playing professional tennis?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I don't know.   I don't know how I'm still motivated, but I enjoy ‑‑I love playing.   I love winning.  
   
 Q.   Earlier, Vika said that she hopes she's not going to be playing when she's 31, which if I recall correctly, when you were a kid and most of the younger players, Oh, I won't be here then.   Does it go by quicker than you anticipate?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah.   I never thought I would be playing at 31, although I don't feel 31.   I don't know where the time went.   
I never, never, never thought I would still be out here, but I have nothing else to do.   I'm pretty good at tennis still, so why not?   I'd just rather I didn't sit at home all day.   It's kinda fun.   
   
 Q.   You have now 15 majors, I think.   And the record is around 22.   So is that a goal for you to break that record of majors?   I think Steffi Graf has it or Martina has it.   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No, I don't think I can reach that.   That's a lot.   Maybe earlier I could have, but I don't think it's ‑‑ I don't know.   That's a lot of tournaments I have to win.   
   
 Q.   Obviously now that you've got the No. 1 ranking coming back, in some ways did having achieved that last night, did that take a little bit of pressure off you coming in today, and you just didn't have to think about that and just go out there and play?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, you know, I definitely think it took pressure off, because every time it was like two matches and then one match, and then now I'm there.   So it definitely takes a little bit of the pressure off.  
But, you know, you still have to stay in it.
