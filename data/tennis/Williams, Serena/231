S. WILLIAMS/S. Peng
  6‑2, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please. 

Q.   Good result today.   How is your leg looking, feeling? 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   It's okay.   I was just taping it to make sure it stays kind of warm and ready.

Q.   Is that because the conditions are a bit cooler today, a bit craggy? 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No, not at all I just had some issues and went preventive to make sure I didn't make anything worse.

Q.   How are you feeling sort of about your chances going forward?   You're playing very well at the moment. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I'm literally taking it one day, one match at a time and not putting any pressure on myself. 
That's how I'm doing it here:   literally one match at a time. 

Q.   Do you think the match was as easy as the score shows?   How do you think your opponent played today? 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I think it was a little tougher than the score shoes showed.   6‑2, 6‑3 isn't a super‑‑ you know, she had chances obviously to even win more games. 
She's a great player.   Like I said on court, she has had a good last 12 months, I think, and so she's really coming to age and really showing her own.

Q.   Strange to have two days off in a nonslam event?   How does that help your preparation? 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   It actually helped my preparation.   Definitely helped that I had two days off.   It was perfect.   Really perfect. 

Q.   The fact that you didn't win the first Grand Slam of the year, is it going to affect the way you prepare for the second slam, which is French Open?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, I'm really prepared for the French Open, but I think the fact that I didn't win the first slam makes a lot less pressure for me.
Had I won the first I would have felt great still, but I'm now with less pressure.   Hopefully I can just keep doing well.
