THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. After having done so well here so often, how disappointing is this today?
SERENA WILLIAMS: It's obviously disappointing, but I've won here a lot, so it's okay.
Q. How much did the conditions play into what's going on out there?  Radwanska talked about it earlier.  It's pretty hot and humid.
SERENA WILLIAMS: I'm used to this weather so for me the conditions were fine.  This is what I practice in.
Q. (No microphone.)
SERENA WILLIAMS: Well, she won more games than me, I guess.
Q. You didn't seem to be moving as you normally do.  Was that just sluggishness or were you feeling physically okay?
SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, physically I'm fine.  I just didn't -- I don't know, I guess I didn't move today.  Maybe that was one of the things that didn't work out for me.
Q. Were you looking forward to this tournament in particular as a chance to regroup?  You've taken some tough losses.  In light of that, did you feel any pressure in that sense or anything?
SERENA WILLIAMS: No.  Actually don't really feel pressure when I play here normally.  I usually feel good.
Q. How much did the weather -- it was awfully, awfully hot out there.  How much of a factor was that as the match progressed?
SERENA WILLIAMS: I just said I'm used to this.  It's fine.
Q. So no factor?
SERENA WILLIAMS: No.
Q. For the benefit of your many fans here, can you sort of expand on why you weren't moving as well a we usually expect you to?
SERENA WILLIAMS: I don't think it's appropriate to criticize my movement right now.  I did the best that I could.  My fans, you know, I did the best I could do.  I can't win every match.  The players come out and play me like they've never played before in their lives.
You know, the best that I could do today.  I have to be 300% every day, so...
Q. Follow up to that:  The expectations that are on you, is there a little bit too much?  You said you're not going to win every match.  Are the expectations a little bit too high and you find that that kind of, not annoys you, but it's tough to live up to that expectation every single match?
SERENA WILLIAMS: I don't think there is expectations.  I mean, there obviously is expectations, but I think overall I put a lot of expectations on myself more than anything.
So that's pretty hard to live up to, is the expectations I put on myself.
Thank you.
