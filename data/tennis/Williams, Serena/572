THE MODERATOR:  First question for Serena, please.


Q.  Do you think you were fit enough to play this match, or no?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yes, si.


Q.  What happened?  It seemed like you were here on a holiday.  You weren't hitting the ball and you weren't playing like a real tournament.

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I wasn't here on a holiday.  Are you here on a holiday?


Q.  I'm not.

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I'm not either.  I'm actually working, as well as you.  Okay.


Q.  What was the reason why you couldn't hit the ball and move as well as you usually do?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I just wasn't moving well.  I just guess I had a really bad day today.  Just one of those days that just wasn't going to work.  I made too many errors maybe, and I just didn't feel anything today.  I mean, nothing came - from my legs, or from my arms.


Q.  Could you feel it in the warm-up or this morning that you were having a bad day?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Actually had a really good warm-up right before the match.  I thought everything was going to come together, but, unfortunately, it didn't.


Q.  Do you think it's because you didn't play a match in two or three weeks?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I don't know.  I just think I couldn't get my legs to move.  I was having just a lot of issues.  Just I just didn't feel anything today.  It's really weird.  I've never felt like this before.  It was just really, like, blah.


Q.  Have you been bothered by the fact that you were playing at night maybe?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  It was definitely a really late match.  I'm not used to playing that late. But I don't think that's an excuse.


Q.  How much preparation time have you had because of your injury, on clay?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Uhm... I haven't had as much as I would like - at all.  I'm definitely going to have to just get some more time, 'cause I was hindered a lot - actually, a tremendous amount.


Q.  You had to retire against Jankovic, Safina and Farina.  Did you ever think to retire tonight, too?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  No.  In the other matches I was injured.  This one, I just -- I didn't think to retire at all, no.  I didn't even walk on the court against Safina; it wasn't even a match.


Q.  Are you worried about getting your game in shape with the French Open coming so soon?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Am I worried?  I'm not worried, no.


Q.  What are your plans between now and the French Open?  Will you stay here?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I don't know.  I didn't expect this to happen, so I have to rethink my schedule.


Q.  Do you think this reality show is a factor of distraction in a way from your concentration in tennis?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  It had nothing to do with my loss at all, trust me.


Q.  Is it one of the worst losses of your career, do you think?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Maybe, yeah.  I think everyone in their career has their worst loss.  This is probably it for me, for sure - and last; this won't be happening again.
