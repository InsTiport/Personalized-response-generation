S. WILLIAMS/V. Williams
  6-2, 7-6

 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Serena, please. 

 Q. This year you have been able to stay consistent and fit. This is the key of your success at the end? 
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, I wanted to stay consistently fit. I had a little hiccup in March, but I put myself back together and I kept going. That's what I think I wanted to do. 

 Q. The last time you won this tournament I think you got a walkover in the final. This time you had to play for it. Does it make it sweeter this time, especially considering the fact you finished undefeated this year?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, the last time I had to -- I won undefeated, as well, because it was more elimination basis. Obviously it was nice to get the walkover because I can never say that's not nice. But, you know, today was good to actually win the title as opposed to getting it with a walkover, knowing you worked really hard for it. So it feels really good.

 Q. You seemed to have an easy time on your service games today. Was it because your serve was that good or was Venus struggling with her returns?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I think it was both. I've seen Venus return better, and I served well. I think I really did serve well. I served well in the Wimbledon final. I knew going in today that if I wanted to have a chance, I needed to serve well, especially in the second set, you know, starting off serving second is never easy. 

 Q. Now that you're finishing the world No. 1, do you still think the ranking system should be modified at all next year?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I never said I think the ranking system should be modified. I just focus on doing the best I can, when I can. Whether I'm No. 1 or No. 2 or No. 100, I think it's just important for me to do the best that I can do. 

 Q. You were a hundred percent. Do you think Venus was a hundred percent, too, during this match physically?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, we definitely weren't physically a hundred percent out there today. But it just shows you how much we try. Even in the second set, how hard we just both fought, especially Venus, she was getting every ball back. I was running down a lot of balls, too. 
 Again, we were just doing the best that we could do. It was I think high-quality tennis. 

 Q. Can you tell us why you won't go to the Fed Cup final in Italy?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Well, I definitely really want to go, but I'm physically -- I don't think I would do well physically. It's very difficult to play such a mental, mental week and then come back and play again. Right now I'm just struggling in every aspect of my body. 
 It's a very difficult decision that I actually couldn't make. I had to get input from my mom and my dad. People that are close to me had to just basically tell me what I needed to do as opposed to me making the decision.
