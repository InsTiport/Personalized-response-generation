 S. WILLIAMS/S. Soler‑Espinosa
      7‑5, 6‑2 
  
    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
   
 Q.   You're down Love‑15 in the sixth game, trailing 5‑0.   What made you decide to fight back and not take it into the second set?  
    SERENA WILLIAMS:   I don't know.   I just didn't want to lose‑‑ I didn't want to lose 6‑Love.   I just started fighting.   I was like, Just let me at least try to break here.   
   
 Q.   Were you dealing with some of the illness that took you off the court in Wuhan?   How quick was your recovery this week?   Were you able to practice?   What has it been like?  
    SERENA WILLIAMS:   No, I felt good today.   I definitely feel like I was over it.   
    This week I've been okay.   I wasn't sure if I was going to play or not.   You know, I just started hitting a couple days ago, taking it day by day.   Finally I decided I'm here, I may as well see what happens.   Here I am.   
   
 Q.   Energy‑wise, how are you feeling as this tournament starts compared to how you were feeling before Wuhan?  
    SERENA WILLIAMS:   I'm feeling much better.   I'm feeling a lot better.   I have more energy.   I look back.   Like my eyes aren't as dead as they were.   So definitely a lot better.   
   
 Q.   At this point with the Finals looming, what is your motivation as you enter into this tournament?   Is it to tune‑up, to get some watch wins, just to play a tournament?  
    SERENA WILLIAMS:   I definitely wanted to play some matches, so I was excited.   I think definitely just getting a match win or some match wins hopefully is a good goal to have for me here.   Just take it one day at a time.   I haven't been able to play much since the Open.   This was my goal.   
   
 Q.   I think last week you said you hadn't really decided whether or not, after the China Open, you would go back to the States, go to Europe, or stay in Asia to train for the Finals.   Has that become any clearer at all?  
    SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, I'm going to go to Europe and train and then come back.   Hopefully that won't be too challenging.   I don't think it will be.   I'll still be at least halfway on the time schedule.   
    And it's indoors, so I felt I could hit indoors in Europe.   That would help out, too.   I didn't want to go all the way back to the States.   
   
 Q.   You do a lot of traveling in the fall.   That's prime NFL season.   Do you get a chance to catch the Dolphins at all or go to a game?  
    SERENA WILLIAMS:   Our season ends pretty early, so it allows us some time to go see.   I usually try to catch their games at the end.   Yeah, I catch some games.   
    I'm going to go this year, for sure.
