S. WILLIAMS/S. Stephens
  6‑4, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   She pushed you a little bit, but you won the important points when you needed to, no?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, she definitely pushed me.   I've always said she's a really good player.   You have to expect that going up against what I would consider a top player.

Q.   I guess you guys hadn't played before but had practiced a handful of times.   Did she show you something you weren't expecting?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah.   I think she plays really well.   She's really calm, something I never have been in my whole career.   But I think it shows a lot of maturity.   I think she has really mature game.
Yeah, it's great. 

Q.   I think you said on the court that one day she could be the best player in the world. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah.

Q.   What do you think she needs to do to get to that point, whenever that will be?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I don't know.   She's playing great.   Just be more consistent, which she's already doing.   I think that's it.
Yeah, so I don't think it's that much. 

Q.   Was that the kind of hit‑out that you need before tomorrow's match with Victoria? 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   For sure.   I definitely want to thank her for giving me such a great match, because I'm going up against another good player, great player tomorrow, so I have to make sure I'm ready.
I've had some good matches this tournament, even though the scoreline in the second match seemed easy.   It was a really good, intense match.   So it's been intense. 

Q.   Looked like at one point you were rubbing your calf.   Was it a cramp?   Can you tell us about that?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, no, I don't know what it was.   To be honest, at my age you never know.   Could have been a broken bone.   (Smiling.)   Just making sure.   (Laughter.)   Arthritis.   (Laughter.)

Q.   But it feels all right now?   The calf is okay?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, feels fine.   Yeah. 

Q.   Is it exciting to meet the top players for you?   What sort of emotions do you go through when you know you're playing a top player in a big tournament?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I always feel like I have nothing to lose, especially going against Victoria, who I think has been the most consistent player the past year, last year.   She was most consistent, which is, I think, she's why she's No. 1.
So, yeah, feel like I really have nothing to lose, nothing to prove, and I'll just go out there and do the best I can.

Q.   I know you're being complimentary toward her, but I think you've won 35 of your last 36 matches, which is pretty consistent, too, no? 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, but I also lost in the first round of a Grand Slam and she didn't.   I think that's what really affected me. 

Q.   You also beat her five times last year. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah?   Five? 

Q.   Yeah. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Well, we played a lot last year.   I'm glad I was able to come out with the win. 
Come on, Matt.

Q.   Talk about the matchup a little bit.   She played you very tough at the US Open. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Well, she's been playing better and better.   I saw her play her match in the first round and I thought she played really well.   She's moving really well.   I think it'll be a really good matchup. 
Obviously with Melbourne just a little over a week away it's actually a good match to see, Okay what am I going to do in potentially semifinals or finals of Melbourne ‑ if I make it that far ‑   and what do I need to do to improve and make sure I am at the right level.
I think these matches always really help. 

Q.   So how much fun was it to be in Mauritius?   First time for you, huh?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   It was fun.   You know, I went with the attitude that I was going to wake up at 6:00 in the morning and practice and then have the rest of the afternoon. 
Obviously I didn't do that.   I woke up around 10:00 and I just had a late practice and then I had the rest of the afternoon.   I don't know.   I always have these big, grand goals and I never can stick to them. 
I ended up being really afraid of everything.   I was afraid of the ocean.   Everyone swam with the dolphins; I thought they would bite me, so I refused.   I ended up barely being able to snorkel because I was afraid of the fish that were this big, literally. 
So, yeah, I don't know if that's for me.   I don't know. 

Q.   You were doing karaoke with Pavlyuchenkova she said. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, I love singing with her.   It was fun.   We had some great songs.   I love karaoke so much. 

Q.   She said you guys were doing old songs she didn't know well. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No.   That girl knew some old songs.   She knew Fame word for word.   I was like, How in the world do you know Fame?   I didn't know Fame.   I had to go back and learn it.   That was just last year I learned the lyrics.   She knew them.   It was just really, really hilarious.

Q.   So Hingis can sing?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   She's a good singer.   She ended up being one of my favorite people to duet with.   We're the same age so we wanted to sing all the same songs.   I was like, Martina, do you want to sing this song?   She was a great plus one. 

Q.   Wow. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, shocking. 

Q.   Absolutely. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Great karaoke buddy.
