   THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
  Q. Yesterday we saw your dad on court No. 1 studying Francesca Schiavone. What did he say to you?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I did not know that, so I'm not aware of that.   
  
  Q. He told you nothing?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS: No.   
  
  Q. Does orange color mean something special for you now, because you're all in orange?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: It's the color of the season; it's the color that Nike kind of chose. I like orange, and I think it's perfect because the clay courts are kind of orange.   
  
  Q. Does Roma tournament mean something for you, or it's like any other tournament in the world?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Obviously it means something. I'm here. And I like Rome, so yeah.  
  
  Q. How do you assess your clay court preparation? How do you feel going into this tournament?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: This is my first clay court event, so I'm happy to be here. I think it will be a good event for me.   
  
  Q. How far do you hope you'll go?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, I hope to lose...   
 No, that's not possible for me to say that, so obviously I hoping to all the way.   
  
  Q. We see many Serenas in many stages and many moons. Which moment of your life and of your career do you think you are living now? In which moment you are?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Right now I'm really excited and really happy to be here. Just to be playing tennis in again I think is awesome. It's great for me, so I'm just enduring.   
  
  Q. Are you working for something special outside the court, not in the sport? I mean, in your life and your work outside of tennis?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I'm always working on something. You know, there's always something that I'm doing. So, yeah, yes. (Smiling.)  
  
  Q. Can you tell us what?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, no, I just launched my new collection called the Serena Williams Signature Statement, which included jewelry and clothes and handbags. So that is exciting.   
 We sold out of all the merchandise that we had so, I just finished a new collection for that. So that's what I've been kind of doing.   
  
  Q. Who would you consider your toughest opponent here in this tournament? Who's the player that you fear the most. Fear is maybe not the right word.   
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, probably myself. I always beat myself.   
  
  Q. What about the No. 1? Safina now is the No. 1.   
 SERENA WILLIAMS: (Laughing.)  
  
  Q. It's a new question, no?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Well, I'm excited for her.   
  
  Q. Who do you think is the real No. 1 today? Is Safina or it's Serena, it's...  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Well, we all know who the real No. 1 is.   
  
  Q. Both Nadal and Djokovic yesterday said that here in Rome the balls bounce very higher than other clay courts. Could it be something that can help you some way, or doesn't matter?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Well, that's a good tip. I didn't realize that, so thank you. I'm going to use that to my advantage.   
  
  Q. The next challenge for Serena in life and in tennis is?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS: You know, just to do well here and just do well in the clay court season.   
 In life, I would say, you know, my main challenge -- I've been writing, but I haven't been writing. In my mind I've been saying I want to write, but I haven't actually physically picked up a pencil and started writing.   
 So that is my next challenge, is to actually to sit down and do it.  
  
  Q. It's the story of your life?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: No. A screenplay, which is like a movie. So I love to write, yeah. Nothing is impossible.   
  
  Q. Where do you prefer to play Fed Cup final?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Well, it doesn't matter. Right here on the clay, on the grass, on the hard, indoor.  
  
  Q. Will you be there?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I can't say that I won't be there, so...  
 I think I should be, so who knows.   
  
  Q. It's better not for Italy.   
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Oh, well, it's better that I am there, so I'm really looking forward to it.   
  
  Q. What sort of relation do you have with your supporters? In the past, I remember on your website you have a blog. What do you think it means for them, Serena Williams?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I have a really intimate relationship with my supporters. I mean, with my website I'm really candid and I always speak out a lot and I'm always doing lots of updates and things like that.   
 So that has been really fun. I do videos and everything so that people that do want to keep in contact can have these types of updates.   
 I was just thinking today how I need to write another blog, maybe about Fed Cup. Just in general, I really love and appreciate the support, so I kind of want to give that attention back.   
  
  Q. But why after you and your sister there are no Afro-Americans in tennis, great Afro-Americans? I think it's a surprise. Why do you think?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Well, you know, that's a difficult answer. I think that, for me, I was really blessed to have the support from my parents and, you know, sometimes you can't get that.   
 I think I'm maybe really talented just naturally, so I don't know. Hopefully there are some players that are coming up that are African-American that really will take over.  
  
  Q. Sometimes parents are bad support.   
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah.  
  
  Q. You know, today is bad news about Jelena Dokic. She says that her father sexually abuse about to her. What do you think about that?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: The only thing I can say about that is I can say I would just pray for anyone involved in that situation.   
  
  Q. A lot people think that if Serena dedicate all of her time to tennis and nobody can beat her. How do you feel?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I dedicate a lot of time to tennis, and I dedicate a lot time to other things. So, you know, I have to do what's best for me. Right now, I'm doing that.   
 Quite frankly, I'm the best in the world.
