THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   She didn't do much wrong, did she, tonight?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Ah...   I'm a wee bit embarrassed.   (Laughter.)  
Um, she played really well.   I just, you know, I didn't play today.   I tried, though.   I just kept hitting errors.   I don't think I have made that many errors in a match in I think at least three years, maybe four years.  
   
 Q.   Why does that sort of happen?   Occasionally   these things happen when you don't have a great match.   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Why?   I mean, it happens.   You know, I have been playing really, really solid for a long time.   Today just wasn't my day.  
You know, she played a solid match.   She knew someone was going to hit balls in the stands and just didn't get the ball in play, kind of.   I think she did that really well.  
Yeah, I just‑‑ it wasn't my day today.   
   
 Q.   Was there any part of you ‑‑I know you're a professional, but maybe you were thinking ahead to Venus and the final?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No, I don't think ahead too much in general.   I usually just ‑‑I'm used to staying in the moment, and I'm used to doing that.   I don't think I had so much.  
   
 Q.   How about the back?   I saw a number of serves you seemed to not just get up.   Was that not happening or was something hurting a little bit?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Absolutely nothing was hurting me.   I mean, I just don't know why I didn't get up.   I tried.   I just don't think...   
   
 Q.   Just not your day?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah.   I think I just, out of a 10, I was at like a ‑283, so...     Wow.   
   
 Q.   Like you said, bad days just happen.   When you have a day like this, do you wake up in the morning feeling something is off, or did you step on the court feeling well and it just surprised you?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I haven't felt good this whole week, to be honest, just from my first match.   I felt I played good yesterday.   I had to play well.   If I'd have played like that today, I probably would have been ‑‑I don't know if I would have won, because I think Alize, she played really well, but I definitely think the scoreline would have been a little better.   
I started out extremely slow.   I have been actually looking at a turtle every day.   I think it's so cute.   Maybe I was too influenced about by it.   It's a really cute turtle in the hotel.  
I need to be able to play better than that if I want to be playing on this tour, on the professional tour.   Maybe I can go to amateurs.   
   
 Q.   So you go back and give Venus the book on Alize now?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah.   I mean, I'm sure she watched the match.   I'm sure she knows how to play her.   She's played her a few times.   I will obviously tell her what to do, but she'll be fine.   
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible.)  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Excuse me?   I don't understand your question.  
   
 Q.   This is Dubai finish.   What next for you?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Oh, I think I'm going to play Miami next.   It's a tournament.   
   
 Q.   Where do you stand on Fed Cup?   I know Venus said she thinks she might play a tournament.   But she'd like to play.   Do you have any idea where you're at?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I don't know.   It depends on the week.   It's such a difficult week.   I would love to play.  
   
 Q.   It's the 19th.   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, so, you know, at this rate I might have to play another tournament or something, so we'll see.   It just kind of all depends.  
   
 Q.   How about back in Delray?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, I'm always voting for Delray, but yeah.
