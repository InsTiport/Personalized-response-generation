  6-2, 6-2 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Did prefer the heat yesterday or the wind today?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Um, you have to be ready for both in Australia. You never know what's gonna happen. Normally I would prefer the heat, but as hot as it gets here, I think I liked the wind today.  
  
  Q. You didn't seem particularly happy with your form out there today. On court you seemed to be a bit down or yourself at times.   
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Did I? I think we were both struggling with the wind. It was really windy out there, but it's good to have a good result in the wind. I definitely don't think I played my best, but that's comforting to know that today want my best.   
  
  Q. How far off your best do you think you are?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I always try to get there usually around the semifinals and finals of the Grand Slams, so I don't know. I don't know. I haven't thought about it. I'm just doing the best that I can now to get there. Hopefully I have long way to go, which I think is always good.  
  
  Q. A lot of players talk about getting ready for the end the Grand Slams. How did you pace yourself to peak at the right time?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I don't know. I just go out there and give my best every time. Sometimes I'm a little off; Sometimes I'm not. But I always just do the best that I can. Whatever result, that yields...  
  
  Q. The brace you were wearing on your right ankle, was it sore or anything?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: No, I just didn't tape it. I always tape both my ankles. I decided to wear a brace on that side today, so...   
  
  Q. For so reason?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, there's probably a reason, but not one that I want to discuss.  
  
  Q. You won the Australian Open more times than any of the other Grand Slams. Why do you think that event has brought out the best in you?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I don't know. I really like it here. I feel like it's -- whenever I come to Australia people ask me to describe. I'm like, Well, it's like the United States but in Australia.   
 I feel really at home there and feel really comfortable. I don't know, I feel like when I walk out there, people really want to see me do well. I think that helps a lot. I just love the atmosphere. I have lots of friends there. My box is always full. I have a lot of Aussie mates, so that's good.   
  
  Q. Last year you described that the match against Kuznetsova as a out-of-body experience. Do you think the physical demands of the Australian Open suit are more then some of the other players?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Um, maybe. I definitely enjoy playing in the heat. I usually enjoy playing in the heat. I live in Florida, so it's all about hot weather there. So I think - I hope - maybe that's one of the reasons why I do so well. The past couple times I won it's been extremely hot, so I expect the same temperatures again.  
 But, you know, with what I went through last year, I feel good that I'm able to endure that again last year.  
  
  Q. Have you met Margaret Court?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I have.  
  
  Q. Looks like she's gonna present the trophy on Friday.   
 SERENA WILLIAMS: For the women's final?   
  
  Q. Yeah.   
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Hopefully I'll be there. (Laughter.) I have a long way to go. You never know. But I'm hoping for the best.   
  
  Q. That is a large bag you're carrying. Would you like to share with us what you have in it?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I have a lot things in my bag. One of my most prized possessions besides my Gatorade bottle is my other Gatorade bottle. (Laughter.) I have a pair of socks.   
 But I have my Hello Kitty receipt bag. It keeps my receipts and keeps me in order. And Venus gave it to me, so I like it.   
 Uh-huh, I have a bunch of stuff in there. Makeup. I don't know, keys.   
  
  Q. iPod?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: IPod. MP3 player actually. (Laughter.) Yes.   
  
  Q. Justine in on the comeback trail as well. Do you took forward to playing her again?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I definitely look forward to playing her. I think she's playing really well. I almost had a chance to play her here, which I was really excited about. We always have great matches.   
  
  Q. Are you surprised by the form she showed last week in Brisbane?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I don't think anyone is. She's been gone for just a little over a year, so you don't lose that much form. I know she quit while she was ahead, but she's decided to come back. I think that's a great thing for women's tennis.  
  
  Q. You fancy doing that, having a year off?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: No. You know, I definitely like to keep going when the going is tough. More than anything, I enjoy it. I enjoy being out there. I don't really enjoy practicing, but the moment I step on the court it's like, this is what I was born to do. It's what I do best, so until I find something else that I do better...   
  
  Q. Your semifinal opponent is Aravane Rezai. Have you played her lately?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I haven't played her, but I know her game. I played her in doubles and Venus has played her before. She's a good player and she's really young. She has a lot of drive. I think she can be really good. It'll definitely be my toughest match yet.  
  
  Q. Will you consult Venus before playing?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS: No, because I played her in doubles so I really know her game really well. You know, she has a style of play that's intense. I pretty much know her game.   
  
  Q. You struggled a bit at this tournament last year, and obviously it didn't impact you all at the Australian Open. You seemed to be getting through the matches a bit more comfortably this year. Do you feel like you're a little bit further ahead?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: No, I don't. I feel like I'm a little behind, and I definitely want to get back on that. Last year I played a few more matches before I got to this stage, so it was a little -- my first round was definitely -- I mean, Sam Stosur is a great player, so that wasn't a very easy match to get through.   
 You know, it was definitely two totally different times.   
  
  Q. Do you feel like you're behind because you haven't played as many matches, or is it something else?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: No, I just feel like -- I don't know why really. I was thinking about that today on the court.  
  
  Q. So you feel like you've got a bit more to do to be ready for the Australian Open?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, but I always feel like that. I always feel anxious. I think it's a good thing. I never want to become complacent and happy where I am. I always want to strive to do better and be better.
