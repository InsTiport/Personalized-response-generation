MODERATOR:  Questions.  
 
 
Q.  What pleased you most about your game today? 
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  Actually, I wasn't pleased at all with my game today.  
 
Q.  You're not used to losing games. 
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  There was nothing today that really pleased my game. 
 
Q.  Were you feeling out of sorts out there?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  No.  It was a little windy today.  I don't think I was focused enough.  Maybe my mind was too many places.  I just kept making a lot of errors, I didn't move up, I didn't come up to the net nearly enough.  You know, not normal. 
 
Q.  You said your mind was in too many places.  Did you feel you were a little distracted by things, or just a bad day out there?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  No, just a bad day out there.  I was just a little bit everywhere.  I was there, but I was really gone. 
 
Q.  Normally you say you're going to work on one or two things.  Do you have any game plan in mind for that?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah, I'm going to just, you know, work on my serve, because my toss is here and there, you know.  Some returns, I'm standing up a bit too high on the returns.  There's a lot of things I'd like to work on, take away from these matches.  It's good playing on these courts because you get a tape of how you played.  I'm going to watch it, try to do better.  
 
Q.  Is Lennox Lewis a family friend?  I noticed you were sitting, watching Venus' match with him?  Family friend?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah, we know  -- I met him a little while back at one of his fights.  He doesn't know my mom very well or my dad very well.  I mean, he met my mom yesterday, though.  I don't know about a family friend.  Maybe.  Fan.  Family fan, yes. 
 
Q.  I missed your gold shoes. 
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  Me, too.  But you have to wear the white here.  I miss them, too.  
 
Q.  Bit a trouble with a hair ornament.  Venus lost an earring yesterday. 
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  Did she?  
 
Q.  Yes.  Maybe time to cut down on the accessories?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  Accessorize, accessorize, accessorize.  You can never have too many accessories.  
 
Q.  Did you find it confining that you have to wear white?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  No.  I love coming here to wear white.  I think it's really nice to have the white against the green grass.  It's really pretty actually.  
 
Q.  I just asked because four girls are wearing the same dress. 
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  No, no.  I'm wearing something a little different.  Mine is kind of special because it has gold sparkles in it.  It's really nice.  I like it.
