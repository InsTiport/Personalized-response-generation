THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Were you happier with your return game today?   Just talk about that.   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Definitely happier with the return game today.   Still can use some improvement.   She served pretty well, but I was pretty happy with the results.  
   
 Q.   You have only dropped a few games through the first three rounds, so I guess overall you're pretty thrilled?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, I'm definitely feeling pretty good, playing much better than I have in the past month, I would say.  
So I'm glad I am getting back to the feeling and getting into some rhythm.  
   
 Q.   After you lost in Wimbledon, did you feel like you needed to kick your own butt to get into gear, or did you just feel like you needed a mental checkout?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No, I didn't feel like I needed that.   I just felt like I was just too tight, put a lot of pressure on myself, and just needed to relax more than anything.  
   
 Q.   So speaking of someone you played at Wimbledon, you'll be playing her in the semifinals.   You played her this year in Miami, and then Championships got her pretty good.   Just talk about the matchup there.   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   It's a good matchup.   She does everything so well.   She's playing better too, actually.   She's having a much better year.  
It's going to be an interesting match.   It's definitely not going to be easy.   I can only hope that I play well, and I can only hope that I come out on top.
