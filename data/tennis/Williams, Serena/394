 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Very dominant performance, especially in the first set. Heading into the US Open, is your game exactly where you want it to be, or do you feel over the next couple of weeks you have a few things to tinker with or are you Grand Slam ready as we speak?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I definitely want to get better on a few things, so I definitely want to try to continue to do more and play harder.  
 I would hate to be Grand Slam ready right now, seeing that the US Open is not right now. So I will try to peak at the right time.  
  
  Q. How was your bad boyfriend tonight?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: He was excellent tonight. I had a long, long talk with him, and we decided that if we can just hold through, you know, the rest of the year, have a nice break and start again next year, we can work things out. We can work it out.   
  
  Q. Your play looked effortless out there tonight. Is that a sign you're 100% healthy again?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I'm definitely a lot healthier obviously than I have been before. I'm not using as much energy as I used to play.   
 Maybe I've evolved. I don't know. I haven't really had a chance to think about it too much.  
  
  Q. You talked about it last week or couple weeks ago when you won, you said it tonight, that you're appreciating the game more, every match is so much fun. You're still not smiling an awful lot out there. How much fun is it? How much is it still very, very serious?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Well, it's obviously really serious. I don't know too many people that are smiling and winning.   
 You know, I smile a lot off the court. I figure if I take, you know, a day and if I could try to be serious for, you know, a maximum of three or four hours, then, you know, I should be good.   
 You know, sometimes when I smile too much, then, you know, you can lose focus.
