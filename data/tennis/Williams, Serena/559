THE MODERATOR:  First question for Serena, please. 


Q.  How much improvement was there on your first-round match in today's match? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  It was a little bit improvement.  I played -- my first-round match, my opponent was a different player, so it was a totally different match. 

Q.  You play Daniela Hantuchova next round.  So far it's 3-0 head-to-head.  She didn't win a set.  How do you look forward for this match? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Uhm, she's been playing really well lately.  She's no pushover.  So I definitely have to be ready for that.  Last match was pretty tough.  Yeah, I have to look forward to that.

Q.  What do you like about your game today? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Uhm, I like the fact that I was -- I mean, I think I was playing a little closer to the line. 

Q.  She has been No. 5 in the world but she dropped.  Do you think she's on the way back?  She can be again in the top 5?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I think she's definitely on the way back.  I think she's been on the way back for quite some time.  She's made a lot of improvements on her game and on everything.  So, like I said, she's definitely no pushover.

Q.  Could be a threat to you? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Everyone's a threat.  But I'm real serious and I'm here to be a threat as well. 

Q.  What do you feel you need to perhaps work on or improve as the two weeks goes on? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I just always like to improve my all-around game, so there's not one thing.  I mean, only thing I want to do better is just keep moving the ball around.  Other than that, I would just like to keep improving on everything. 

Q.  How are you feeling after the second match in 48 hours?  You said you felt great Monday night.  You feel great now today?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah, I'm feeling pretty good right now.  I'm feeling ready. 

Q.  Nice to get an easier match like that?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Pardon me? 

Q.  Nice to get an easier match like that?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah, those are always nice, so... yeah, for sure. 

Q.  Did you watch any of Martina's match last night?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I caught a few points here and there.

Q.  What did you think?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I thought she played really well. 

Q.  What do you think about her decision to return to the tour? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I think, you know, it's amazing.  Everyone can have their dreams, and she's dreaming big, and she should go for any dreams and pursue them to the fullest.

Q.  Would you look forward to playing her in the future? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  We've always had some great stellar matches, so definitely.
