2-6, 6-4, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How disappointed are you?  
SERENA WILLIAMS: I don't want to talk about how disappointing it is for me.  If you have any other questions, I'm open for that.   
 Q.  How well did she play today?  
SERENA WILLIAMS: I thought she played the best tennis in her career.  You know, she's 33 and, you know, she's going for it at a late age.  So that's good for her to keep going for it and playing so well.   
Actually, I guess it's inspiring.  But, yeah, I think she played literally out of her mind.   
 Q.  What wasn't working from your side?  
SERENA WILLIAMS: I don't think I played that bad.  I made more unforced errors than I normally would make, but I think she just played really well.  She did not want to lose today.  Neither did I, incidentally.  But she really didn't either.   
 Q.  You have been so adept at pulling yourself out of precarious positions throughout this run.  Was there any moment where you said, I know I can do this?  Was there a moment where you said, Maybe I can't?  
SERENA WILLIAMS: No.   
 Q.  A lot of pressure for you...  
SERENA WILLIAMS: No.  I told you guys I don't feel pressure.  I never felt pressure.  I don't know.  I never felt that pressure to win here.  I said that from the beginning.   
 Q.  You felt tight, though; is that fair?  
SERENA WILLIAMS: I mean, I made a couple of tight shots, to be honest, but maybe just about two.   
But that, I think, is just for me in any normal match you make two tight shots.  Other than that, I don't think I was that tight.   
 Q.  Do you think there is a (photographer interference) of her game that made her different than your other opponents thus far in the Open?  
SERENA WILLIAMS: No.  I have played everyone that came to the net this tournament.  She had a couple of slice; everyone I played had slice.   
So, no.   
 Q.  How did you feel going into the third set?  We have had so many three-set victories during this run.  Did you still feel you were going to win the match going into the third or did you feel very different?  
SERENA WILLIAMS: Of course.   
 Q.  Third set looked like you were trying to fire yourself up so much and calm yourself down.  Were you trying to find the equilibrium of where it worked for you as far as...  
SERENA WILLIAMS: No, I was just trying to win points at that match and win the match.  Last questions?   
 Q.  How do you get over all -- what's the key to just forget about it?  
SERENA WILLIAMS: Anyone else want to ask a different question than that?   
 Q.  You said prior to the tournament you took so much happiness from the fact you did your second Serena slam.  
SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah.   
 Q.  Let's focus on the positives.  Is that where your head is at right now?  
SERENA WILLIAMS: Well, thank you.  Like I said, I felt very happy to get that win at Wimbledon, you know.  I did win three Grand Slams this year.  Yeah, I won four in a row.  It's pretty good.   
Yeah, so it's definitely the positive.  Thank you.
