WTA:  Questions for Serena, please. 


Q.  What do you feel when you beat your sister in the first set 6-1?  Do you feel sorry for her or is it like a training situation then?  What do you feel?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  No.  I mean, you're out there, you're just playing.  It's like any other opponent.  I was cruising today.  I haven't played this well since I don't know when.  It was a good match for me.

Q.  You don't feel sorry then, you don't think, "This is my sister, I beat you"? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah, naturally.  I've never actually beat Venus.  I didn't know how it feels.  It's actually kind of tough to take this win.  I actually have had a win over everyone in the Top 10.  I never had a win over Venus, so. 

Q.  For the spectators, it seems that you play harder than anybody else in the tournament, you play harder than against Martina Hingis, Lindsay Davenport.  Is it true?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  That I played harder today? 

Q.  Yes. 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I think I played better today.  Like I say, I haven't played this well, especially in the first set.  Other than that, I started going back to my regular game, making a lot of errors, being silly.  In the first set, I was pretty focused, playing pretty well there.

Q.  What did you say after the match to your sister?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Just, "Good job.  It was a good match."  It was the first time I ever had a win over Venus.  I guess it was exciting.  It's just something that - we're going to play each other a lot, it's going to go back and forth a lot.  I don't think Venus played that great today.  This is the first time I actually played pretty well.

Q.  Picturing the family thing, your mother, sister and you back on the plane to the States, are you talking about that match then?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I'm not going to the States, I'm going to another tournament.  Venus, we're just talking.  It's like life.  Like I always say in all my interviews, there's tennis and then there's our family.  We always take family first because it's going to be most important.  All my life I'm going to have to live with Venus because she's always going to be my sister  - my mom.  Always have to get along. 

Q.  You won 16 matches now.  You haven't lost since the French Open.  Can anybody beat you now when you're playing your best game?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I don't think so.  I think I really  -- when I'm playing my best, I'm kind of hard to beat, just as Venus, when she's playing her best, she's like invincible.  We're both really tough to beat when we're playing our best.  Like I said, I don't think Venus played her best today.  I had 16 matches before.  I really wanted to win this match because I'm really trying to beat my record of 16.  So now I'm tired and I'm going to go into the next tournament with a plan on doing my best there also. 

Q.  Venus was the last person in the Top 10 you haven't beaten.  Were you intimidated by her a little bit?  Are you afraid to beat your older sister, she might beat you up or something?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  No, I don't think so.  Every time I played, I didn't play so well, or Venus played better.  At Lipton, it was pretty close.  She was more experienced.  She was just the better player that day.  As I mentioned earlier, we're going to play each other a lot, the matches are going to go back and forth.  It's going to be exciting for women's tennis.

Q.  Do you feel like there's a crowd there when you're playing or seems like you're practicing?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I don't feel the crowd.  I think they're a little nervous for who to clap for.  It's kind of weird.  They only clap on good points.  Other than that, it was mostly silent. 

Q.  Do you like playing in front of a German crowd, in Germany?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah, sure, I like playing in Germany.  Germany's great.  It's a great opportunity.

Q.  Are you learning more German an apfeltasche?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I like kirschtasche.

Q.  Which is your favorite?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Kirschtasche is the best.
