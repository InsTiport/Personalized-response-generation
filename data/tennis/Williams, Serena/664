THE MODERATOR:  First question for Serena, please. 


Q.  You must be fairly pleased with that? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah, a bit.  I'm definitely a little pleased.  Yeah, for sure. 

Q.  How did your shots compare to yesterday's? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  My serve was better today, and each day it's getting better.  So I'm happy about that. 

Q.  Is there much that you've done to adapt your game to clay?  Ahead of the clay court season, did you do much work on the court? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Well, obviously, I played a few tournaments this year on clay.  I've played two.  And I'm practicing on the clay.  And just that's about it, nothing more than normal.  Last year I didn't get to play any on clay. 

Q.  I wondered if you'd heard the talk of Martina Hingis and what your thoughts were about that. 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  No, I have not.  I'm sorry. 

Q.  She seems to have an injury and may miss the French Open.  I just wondered if you'd heard anything about it. 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  No, I really hadn't heard much about it, so...  I hope she's doing better, because she's never really missed a Slam. 

Q.  You've either got Jelena or Anastasia next.  What do you know about those two? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I've played both of them, so I know a bit.  Obviously, I've seen Jelena play more, but I know Anastasia's game also.  So either way it's going to be a bit more tougher than my first two matches.  Just have to be ready. 

Q.  Is the fact that your sister's playing too, is that something special for you?  Is it an example? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Well, she's not playing. 

Q.  No, but in the tennis world. 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Oh.  Yeah, for sure.  Because we're a bit close, and it makes it easier to travel and have a friend. 

Q.  How is Venus doing? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I really don't know.  She's seeing some different doctors, so we can all keep our fingers crossed and hope she's doing well.  But she's a fighter, so...

Q.  Have you had to find a new practice partner after her injury? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah.  Well, I've travelled with one guy, his name is Jovan Savic (phonetic spelling), and so we've been hitting with him.  But I kind of miss hitting with Venus, 'cause, like, I get to hit with the No. 1 player in the world. 

Q.  At this stage would you prefer to play a girl like Dokic, who can perhaps really get you into a fight and get your sort of match toughness up?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  For me, really it doesn't matter who I play.  I don't think right now I'm short on matches.  I'm never really short on matches.  I can take a three-month break and win a tournament, so it doesn't really matter. 

Q.  With these injuries to your sister and Hingis, the possibility they might miss the French, do you see your own chances increasing for this Grand Slam? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I don't think she's going to miss the French. 

Q.  But even the French Open field is still going to be fairly open this year.  Where do you see your chances?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Well, obviously I'm a top player also, so I never see myself as losing, you know, early - or even late.  So I think maybe if I pulled out that I think maybe the field would open, but it's just  -- you have to be ready for everyone. 

Q.  Is it in your fashion to answer so quickly, give such quick answers? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Well, you guys never ask different questions (smiling).  And you could just read the transcripts, it's always the same answers.  You have to be original.  Nobody's been original, so...

Q.  We may ask you something original.  Thinking about your sister, who has a nice Italian friend, do you have any nice Italian friends yourself?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Does she? 

Q.  Yes. 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Oh, I didn't know anything about it. 

Q.  So it's an original question, but you didn't know anything. 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Hey, you're asking the wrong person.
