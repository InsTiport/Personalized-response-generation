THE MODERATOR:  First question, please. 


Q.  The score line on that match looks like it was pretty one-sided.  Would it be fair to say the kid you played today was pesky and troublesome?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Oh, definitely.  I think the score line wasn't true to the match at all.  She played really well.  I definitely had to work hard to win that match.  I knew I was going to, because I had seen her play before.

Q.  Where did you see her play before?  What did you remember about her?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I saw her play for the first time last year during the French Open, I think she was playing Ai Sugiyama.  It was a really tough match.  In France, you see all the French girls, so you get familiar with all the French players when you go over there. 

Q.  You saw Venus lose last night.  Did that make you play extra hard today, be more determined the same thing wouldn't happen to you today?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah, of course.  I'm really upset and disappointed, but not at Venus.  Venus, I know, did a good job out there.  It's always next week, and at least it's not Wimbledon. 

Q.  How was she emotionally this morning?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  She left, she went home early this morning.  I was probably still asleep, so...  But, you know what, I'm sure she's okay.  Because, honestly, tennis isn't the end of the world.  You win some, you lose some.  You can't win them all.  We've been doing really well.  You just can't win them all.

Q.  Have you ever faced a player not in the Top 10 who can take the ball so early and return so cleanly against you? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I can't say I have, no.  I mean, until today.  But honestly, no, I can't say I have.

Q.  What was your adjustment to that?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  You know, I was trying to think what I should do.  I have to get a plan next time I play so I can hold on to my serve a little bit easier.

Q.  Did you think about hitting a lot of body serves at her?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah, yeah, but I couldn't get my first serve in.  I kept missing them.  It was really frustrating.  Even in practice, I was missing a lot of first serves.  I was thinking, "Ah, if I could just get it in, if I could just get it over the net."  I just couldn't get it over the net for some reason today. 

Q.  Particularly in the first set, your second serve was not up to the usual Serena standard?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  It wasn't? 

Q.  I think you scored three out of 13 points on your second serve. 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah, first of all, she was a really good returner.  Normally, I usually hit a better second serve and I usually place it and try to add  -- I just was having a tough time with my serve today in general.  I might go out later on today and hit some more serves because I wasn't really satisfied with my serves.

Q.  First game of the second set, though, good start. 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah, the only game.  I popped them in.  That's how I normally  -- that's how I should be serving normally, and that's how I've been serving.  The first game, I think, of the second set was the only good game that I served in this match.  I was reaching up, I got up, I was able to jump, I had my knee bent pretty good.  I think that was the key.

Q.  Any difficulty with a two-handed forehand?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  You know what, I think there might be a little difficulty.  I think it was well-disguised.  I know she liked to hit it inside-out a lot.  But she's got a pretty good all-around game.  She serves well, she's hits a good return.  She moves pretty good. 

Q.  Was the match harder than you thought?  Did you figure it would be that hard?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  No, I definitely figured it would be a tough match.  Like I said before, I've seen her play before, she's a tough cookie.  She never gives up and she has a lot of determination in her eyes.

Q.  Are you going to stick around later and watch the match between Kim and Jelena and see who your semifinal opponent is? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Definitely not.  I'm going to get out of here as soon as possible.

Q.  Are you feeling any ill effects at all from the stomach thing or is that completely history now?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I think it's completely history now.  I'm feeling good.  Yesterday was the first day I was able to eat a full meal.  I'm really disappointed now, I have to go back to eating, but...

Q.  Had you lost some weight through that?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I don't know.  I don't weigh myself.  I haven't stepped on a scale in years.

Q.  Do you feel that because your shoes are brightly colored you're more likely to get foot faults? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  That's probably why I get so many these days.  No, it's  probably -- no, I don't think so.  I think if I stay off the line, then I won't get foot faults.  I just have to stay off the line.
