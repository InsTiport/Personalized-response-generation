THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  What's your post match like, what do you do after a match is over? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Well, immediately I go to the gym and do a lot of stretching and icing and then come back, shower, dress.

Q.  Is that pre-injury or post-injury? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  That was pre, but I was really intense and I kind of slacked off a little bit.  Definitely post as well. 

Q.  Do you feel yourself playing better as this tournament is going on?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I feel definitely I'm playing better, more consistent today.  I really was working on being consistent and getting a lot of balls back, so yes. 

Q.  Did you think Jill played pretty well?  She said she played you in Wimbledon last year. 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yes.

Q.  Did you expect to dominate as much as you did today?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  No, I didn't.  I think she played very well, though.  We were just playing on hard court.  But I think she played really well. 

Q.  Do you think your game took a step up physically today?  You said you feel like you've been getting more confident.

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah, I think so.  I think I've been playing better tennis-wise today, for sure.  I actually kind of felt the ball.  When I was going for it, I just felt it.  That was really good. 

Q.  You talked a couple weeks ago about the hunger of wanting to get back out there.  Is it what you thought it would be, is it better?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  No, definitely I'm really excited to be back out here.  It's everything I thought it would be and more. 

Q.  I'm sure before this tournament you probably had a mental picture of how you wanted to play.  Are you coming close to matching that mental picture yet? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Definitely.  I just didn't really have too much of a mental picture, actually, to be honest with you.  I just thought if I could just get through a first round, second round, now I'm in - is it the semis?  I'm in the semis now?  Whatever round I'm in, I'm here, and I'm really excited to play my next match.

Q.  Do you feel you guys are on a collision course, you and Venus?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I think eventually we are, but I'm just ready to play my next match.  I'm really excited to be here. 

Q.  You guys practicing together this week? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  We're playing opposite days.  Actually, we weren't for a while, but not really.  We're playing at different times and she wants to warm up at a different hour than I do.  She hit with me today, though.  Look, I played much better. 

Q.  How do you think she was hitting? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  She's hitting great.  She's doing great, so...  You can tell by her matches as well. 

Q.  What other diversions have you been taking part in here in Miami?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Nothing at all.  I've just been playing every day so I haven't had too much time to do anything, so...  I've been getting home a little late, too.  So nothing at all  - except for the spa. 

Q.  In the hotel?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Uh-hmm.  I hope to go tomorrow for sure.

Q.  To get your nail fixed? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah, get all the specials  - the massage, the salt glows, the body baths.  I just want it all (smiling).  I love the spa. 

Q.  How tough is it playing every day after a long layoff? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I thought it would be really tough, and it is tough.  But I'm really excited and happy, and I feel blessed that I'm able to recover and still play.  I'm really, really excited about that. 

Q.  Four matches in.  Your knee is fine. 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Uh-hmm. 

Q.  No problems? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  So that's great.  That's really great for me, knowing that going into a Grand Slam, I'm already four matches in and five days, I can definitely do that over a period of a fortnight.
