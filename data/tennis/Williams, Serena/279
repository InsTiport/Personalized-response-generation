S. WILLIAMS/A. Radwanska
  7‑6, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Do you think this was one of the toughest matches you've played with her?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, it was definitely one of the tougher matches.   Also obviously Wimbledon was another tough one.
We actually have a lot of good matches.

Q.   Did you find maybe one of the most challenging parts was how she hits it so flat and so low?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah.   You know, I haven't played her in a little while, for me, and I kind of forgot how flat she hits and how low she hits.
Yeah, but it was okay.   Once I accepted that the balls are going to be flat, then it was a little better.

Q.   Is it different on these courts, too?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, it's a little different.   These courts are playing a little slow as well as ‑‑yeah.   So I just needed to just adjust to that.

Q.   Looked like you were not only fighting her playing at a good level but yourself at times.   You were getting frustrated.   Was that because you were sick or just a little upset with how you were playing?   You've got the cold I have. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No, I ‑‑yeah, I was just a little frustrated with myself, I think, as well as I don't think I was playing as aggressive as I needed to play.   I let her play her game, which is what she wanted to do, but I wasn't able to play my game as much.
Yeah, I just ‑‑as always, I got a little frustrated.

Q.   You didn't have any fun playing those long tricky creative rallies with her?   You won a lot of them. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No, I don't mind.   I definitely don't mind.   Yeah, I have no problem with playing long, long, long rallies.

Q.   When it comes to fitness, do you model your fitness according to your match and training challenges, or do you look at sort of what groups of muscles in your body need to be developed more in order to produce those killer shots?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   For fitness level, it's definitely, I think for any tennis player, is more cardio‑wise and endurance, for sure, endurance on how to stay out there a long time.

Q.   Is it a cold?   Did it affect you?   It looked like you were maybe... 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No, I just had some stomach problems.   I'm fine.   I actually don't have a cold.   I feel good.   I just had little stomach issues, and I just had to try to settle them down.   I will be fine probably.   I'm already feeling a lot better.

Q.   You played the tiebreak very well, and the end of the match very well.   Talk about that, last couple of games in the second and the tiebreak. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Well, it was good for me.   I really wanted to play a lot, tried to be more aggressive towards the end, and the tiebreak I just tried to just take advantage of my serve as well as her serve and just tried to win as many points as I could in the tiebreak.
That's how I just tried to stay really focused on those, because those were obviously really key times of the match.   You know, I don't think I played my best, and I always knew that, you know, I could, worst‑case scenario, I could do a little better.

Q.   When you were yelling towards the side, were you actually yelling at Patrick and Sasha, or were you yelling because you were upset?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, I don't know.   I don't usually yell at my coach.   So I don't ‑‑I think I was just ‑‑yeah. 

Q.   Looking for support or something?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah.   I don't ‑‑yeah, for sure. 

Q.   What are your thoughts on playing Sorana Cirstea tomorrow?   Were you surprised she made it to the final?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No, I think she's a great player.   She plays really tough.   Gosh, she hits really hard.   She has a really big serve.   She moves well, so she's not ‑‑she's definitely not an easy player to play, but she's ‑‑wow. 
Last few months she has been really consistent.   She is just a player who has finally found herself, and she's playing better and better and getting more confident.   It's going to be a really tough match.

Q.   I don't believe you have lost a set yet here.   You were talking earlier about playing well in Toronto, liking playing in Toronto.   I think you could go 3‑0 in the city tomorrow if you win.   Can you touch on how well you have played in this tournament and just in general in Toronto. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I love playing here.   Like I said, I have a lot of friends that always come out.   It's always like you really want them to keep coming, so it's a good time. 
I love being out here.   I love the battle, and I just love the city and I love ‑‑I just love it, so it's fun.
