S. WILLIAMS/A. Medina Garrigues
  6‑3, 0‑6, 7‑5

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   That was something of a battle today.   Difficult to know where to start.   How would you describe it?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I think it was definitely a battle.   That's the way to describe it.   I obviously didn't do much in the second set, and I think I gave her a lot confidence to play better.
I thought she played really well in the third. 

Q.   To lose a set 6‑Love is a very rare occurrence.   Can you perhaps explain why you felt that happened and what you did to turn it around? 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I felt just kind of‑‑ I don't know.   I wasn't really there.   I wasn't really in it.   My feet weren't moving.   I don't know what happened.
To turn it around I got up earlier on the changeover and started doing high knees and just stretching and doing anything to try to get my intensity back up where it needed to be. 

Q.   What do you think you need to work on more for the next match?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I definitely want to cut back on my unforced errors.   I had a lot unforced errors today. 
Also I went for a lot more today than I have been in my past few matches.
So I think I'm going to go back to the way I have been playing and being more calm and not making as many errors as I did today. 

Q.   After a match like this, do you use it as a reference of how not to play? 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No, this second set is a good reference.   I can show a lot of juniors what not to do.   Yeah, I think so.   Definitely be a reference. 
But also I was just fighting to do the best that I could today.   I think hopefully tomorrow will be a better day for me. 

Q.   The No. 1 ranking is on the line this week.   Is that something you think about at all? 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No.   I didn't realize it was, so I'm just‑‑ for me it's just a title.   Hopefully I can try to do it. 

Q.   Do you go home this evening angry?   Frustrated?   Determined?   What's the mindset when you come back tomorrow? 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Well, for me it'll be more or less how to do better.   In the past I definitely reflected on what I did wrong, wrong, wrong. 
The fact is I was able to get through it.   So tomorrow I start out at 0‑0, so it's important for me to let it go and just play a new match tomorrow.
Because it is a new match. 

Q.   There has been a lot of talk here in Madrid about drugs cheats with two hundred bags of blood about to be destroyed.   Do you like to see drugs cheats?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Drug cheats, what's that? 

Q.   The cyclists, where there are 200 bags of blood. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No, I don't know this case at all.

Q.   Do you like to see people who cheat by taking drugs exposed?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Well, I mean I think if you cheat then it's not right.   You know, it should be exposed.   I don't know anything about the blood stuff.   That's the first I've heard of it, so I can't give a proper answer. 

Q.   It's the 40th anniversary of this year for a lot of things. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   For how many years I've been on the tour.   (Laughter.)

Q.   Almost.   Not far off.   The formation of the WTA, Billie Jean King's Battle of the Sexes, equal prize money at the US Open and all that sort of thing.   When you reflect on the journey women's tennis has made, what do you think?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   It's amazing.   This you tour has been together for 40 years because of pioneers and those women that held up that dollar in that infamous picture.
They created a tour that I'm able to play on, every player right now is able to play on because of that opportunity.   We're able to be professional athletes because of that. 
It is just so impressive and something I don't think I could ever do in my lifetime.   I can only benefit from it.   What an honor to be able to benefit from that.   I'm a big Billie Jean King fan.   Her match against Bobby Riggs was really good for women's empowerment and movement. 
Definitely a lot anniversaries, and I think it should be celebrated all year the way the WTA is doing it.
