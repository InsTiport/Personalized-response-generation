S. WILLIAMS/S. Stosur
  6-4, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. You didn't give the local fans much to cheer about out there. 
 SERENA WILLIAMS: It's important when you're playing a local girl to not let the crowd get too involved or else they'll kill you. That was the plan to not let them get involved.

 Q. 5 service games to love and in one game you're down Love-40, reeled off three aces. I dare say the serve was the key to the game. 
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Absolutely. I think today it was all about the serve. Honestly I'm just hoping I can serve again like that, because that was pretty cool.

 Q. Sam said if you can keep up that form no one will get near you in the final. 
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I knew going into the match I had to serve well against Sam. She's a big server and even though she's not as tall, she serves incredibly well. I know that I had to serve well today.

 Q. You seemed to really be able to pounce on some of her mistakes too. You had a really aggressive game plan today.
 SERENA WILLIAMS: That's been my game plan in general for this year so far. Hopefully it's just all coming together. 

 Q. Was there a bit of revenge from the last match you played? Did you want to get one back?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: No, I think if anything it was motivating. I knew she was capable. She beat me last time and anything can happen. So she's a really, really good player and so dangerous. I was like, you have to be focused when you're playing Sam, for sure.

 Q. Do you feel like your getting better after last week?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I feel like today was my best match so far in this tournament. Um, you know, like I said I just hope I can keep it up.

 Q. Can you talk us through the strapping and how the leg is holding up?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: It's holding up well. I think it's all about adrenaline out there. When I step on the court I feel great. Sometimes before there I am struggling. I felt a little bit like Brett Favre today. He's such a champion, so I'm like, hmm, I got to be like this guy.

 Q. I heard in the post-match interview you only gave yourself a B plus? What could you improve on?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Well, I thought I could've returned better today. I think Sam really burned me on a couple returns. But she's serving incredible. 
 It's really good to match my game against her serve, because she's one of the best servers on the tour.

 Q. That serve is wonderful. It's like going to a dinner party and always being able to cook the perfect souffle. How reassuring is it to have that serve in your arsenal? 
 SERENA WILLIAMS: It's definitely reassuring. It's good to be able to serve well and be consistent with that. It makes you feel good.

 Q. Were you disappointed for Brett? Did you not want the Saints to win?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: No, obviously I wanted the Vikings to win. He went out a champ today. Hopefully he'll come back.

 Q. Who would you like to see win the Super Bowl?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I'm going for Peyton. I know him, so I'm definitely going for Peyton Manning. 

 Q. Your's and Sam's match here was supposed to be showing live. We only got to see a couple minutes of it, and they went to the news and some sort of soapies. How does that make you feel? 
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Well, we just got to get the guys to finish earlier, before five sets. I'll talk to Fernando about that. Like, Dude you got to finish earlier. You can't hold all the TV time. They got Nikolay, Mr. Personality now. He just wanted to be on TV, and they took all our time. Have to have a talk with those guys next time.

 Q. When Hollywood ends up making a movie about the Williams sisters, who would you like to see play, and you how would you like to see it end? 
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Oh, I don't want to see it end, that's for sure. But I've never thought about who would play me. I don't know. Maybe some up-and-comer-no-namer that's just able to do the job.

 Q. Will you play the first round of Fed Cup against France?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: As of now it doesn't look like it, unfortunately. I really want to, but I have -- since I do own a football team, we have some owner's stuff that we have to do for Super Bowl. Venus and I have to be there, so...
