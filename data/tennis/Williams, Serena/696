THE MODERATOR:  First question for Serena, please.  
 

Q.  You called it last night when you said you played so bad one day, then the next day you come back.  You were looking forward to today?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, I think when I have a tough three-set match it gets me on my feet and it gets me ready to be better prepared.  I was really ready today because I had a tougher match today.  It made me really ready today. 
 

Q.  She played you, I guess she played -- last time you played she had, you know, you had a tough match.  I guess you were expecting more from the match today?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS: I think maybe so.  Last time I played it was under different circumstances, obviously.  It was a little tougher instead.  But she's a great player either way. Whenever I have to play her, I have to make sure I'm playing pretty good.  I did.  
 

Q.  What was the difference this match against her, obviously you had a lot of  -- fans weren't pulling for you in California.  But here, were the fans behind you? How tough was it to play her today?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, the fans were behind me.  I always have a good crowd here, they're always so friendly.  That's usually with everywhere we go all the time. The difference today was I was really focused, I was really prepared.  Last night I knew I might have to play her.  I kind of knew what to expect this time because she played me kind of similar to the way she played me in Indian Wells.  I just wasn't on top of my game there.  
 

Q.  How much of last week is behind you?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS: All of it.  It's  -- that was last week, and honestly, no matter what I can do, I can't go back and I don't want to go back.  It's gone.  Those days are gone.  Moved on.  I think most people have moved on. 
 

Q.  How about there's comments from your father that he's still talking about last week, the incidents of last week.  How do you feel about that?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS: Well, you know, it's been difficult for our family in general because that was one of the biggest tournaments  -- that was my first big tournament.  It's a special place for me in my heart.  I'm just trying to look forward and just trying to forget about that now. I'm on a different tournament right now.  I'm focusing.  I have another match maybe tomorrow and really I'm just trying to stay focused on tennis. 
 

Q.  Is there something that could be constructive to come out of that, though, I mean with all the negativity and perhaps there being racism in the tour?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS: I think, because constructive is narrow, I believe I can play under any type of circumstance.  I just go anywhere and play under any type of circumstance.  I think that's what's best. 
 

Q.  General terms, though, to confront that issue, is there maybe some progress that can be made?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS: I don't understand your question.  
 

Q.  Regarding the comments that there is racism.  Is this something you think people need to address?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, I understand that he did make comments.  But you know what, like I said in my other interviews, I don't really read the papers and that's it.  I just  -- I woke up late today and I was running late on practice, I haven't  -- I just actually saw something in the USA Today, just briefly.  But then I had to run here.  So I haven't really been, you know, I keep to myself.  I'm at a new tournament.  I'm trying to stay focused.  I'm trying to improve my ranking because I'm really not happy where I am in the ranks.  I'm a much better player.  I have no points to lose, I didn't do well here last year.  My main focus is tennis and getting to where I want to be. 
 

Q.  Did he not talk to you about the racial comments he made?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS: My dad never told me that.  I'm glad he didn't because I  -- maybe I would have been a little more emotional about it.  So fathers and parents know what's best to do for their child.  They try to safe-guard them and keep them in a bubble, so to say, so if something hits it, it just bounces off and I won't be able to feel it. 
 

Q.  Have you heard any similar comments yourself while playing tennis on the court?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS: Let's see... Let me think about it. I don't know.  I don't know.  I can't remember.  I don't know.  
 

Q.  How big of a bubble is it? Do you feel like it's the Williams sisters against the world?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS: No.  I don't.  Just seems like the Williams sisters are always involved in some type of preposterous and just absolutely ridiculous - what's the word I'm looking for - controversy.  Just preposterous. You know, I think we do very well considering we've been under a lot of  -- we've been on a lot of covers of all the wrong magazines, so... (Laughing.) But we're just moving on.  We're doing pretty good.  I think we're doing well.  We're handling it as a family and spiritually.  So I think that's what matters most. 
 

Q.  When you were playing that final last week and you heard the crowd reactions and all, did you feel at the time that it was anything racial or did you feel it had something to do because the match, the semifinal, had not been played?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know why they did that.  At first, I didn't understand, you know, I was just walking out in the finals of a big Tier I event.  You know, I was pretty excited.  Had a couple big wins and I was, you know, I was like,  "Wow, this is weird." At first, I was like, "Why are they even booing."  I didn't understand.  Then, obviously, it kicked in.  I thought maybe it was because they were unhappy about what happened in the semifinals.  But you can't always believe what you read.  You can't always believe what you read. 
 

Q.  Looking ahead, the possibility of facing Capriati, how much of her have you seen recently? Can you talk about her comeback story?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS: I've seen a lot of her recently because she won the Australian Open, which is great for the Americans.  We've been winning all the Grand Slams on the ladies' side with the exception of the French Open.  We've been doing good. She's doing great.  She beat me here last year, so it should be a good match for the fans.  We're both from Florida so the crowd will probably be split.  It's going to be exciting.  We're both going in, it's just fighting till the end.  We'll see what happens.  
 

Q.  Your dad also said that a lot of the other girls on the tour are jealous of the family, him included.  Do you feel that's true?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS: You have to talk to my dad about that.  I think  -- I'm not really trying to get involved in any type of controversy; I'm just trying to stay out of everything because I think unfairly I've been brought into a lot of things.  Like last week, it had nothing to do with anything, but everything was taken out on me. I just don't want to get involved in anything right now.  
 

Q.  Martina Hingis was in here and was asked about these same questions unfortunately.  She thought that the story, what Richard said about the jealousy and the racism and all is, to quote her, "total nonsense." She likes the Williams girls and everything, she doesn't see any of that.  What do you feel about that, her saying that it's total nonsense?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS: Total nonsense. 
 

Q.  In regard to  --?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS: I think in general there's something in America, like I said, you know, before, there's Africans, African-Americans, we've been out of slavery for just 100 years.  Sometimes it's just two generations.  So in general, I think obviously there is  -- and we all know that there is racism in America and that's just a fact.  So in general, yeah, sure there is.  But like I said, I really don't want to be involved in this.  I'm just  -- I have a tough match in the next round.  I'm just taking it one match at a time really.  That's all.  
 

Q.  Serena, one more question.  You say that you're trying to stay focused.  When your father makes comments like that, doesn't that hurt more than help your situation in trying to win a tournament?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS: You know, everyone's on their own.  Everyone's doing their own thing.  I stick by my dad and I know that he's  -- he usually is a very true person, true-hearted person.  And he always  -- he's always known what's best for both Venus and I and we always do what's best. So difficult, does it make it more difficult? I don't think so because, like I said, I don't read papers.  When I watch the tele, I usually watch my programs and nonsense programs like Lifetime, "The Golden Girls."  I just stay out of everything because I'm out here to play.  I'm just out here to satisfy the fans and do the best I can do.  That's all.  Nothing more.
