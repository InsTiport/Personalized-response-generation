  6‑3, 6‑2 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Moved pretty well, hit fairly well.   Assess how you felt out there.   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I think I was a wee bit tight out there today.   I always get a little nervous in my first‑round matches.   
I definitely didn't play any way that I practiced.   So hopefully I can get better.  
   
 Q.   Talk about coming off the injury.   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Physically I felt fine.   I was definitely moving better than, you know, I suspected.   I still think I can move better, though, and just get that confidence.   It would be great.   
But I have to see how I feel tomorrow, if I'm sore, if I have any swelling.   We'll see.  
   
 Q.   You weren't favoring the ankle at all?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No, I wasn't.   That was really good.   Hopefully with time it will keep improving.  
   
 Q.   Was it a good match to have from that point of view?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, I definitely think it was good because I moved a lot and I challenged myself a lot.   She made a few dropshots.   She really pushed me physically.   
I think, you know, that's really something I needed to kind of feel and assess my ankle.   
   
 Q.   Does the leg start to bother you?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Nothing bothers me.   I don't let, like, anything bother me.   It's definitely different to have the ladies play so late, you know, so we'll see.  
   
 Q.   Were the bugs a bit of a distraction?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah.   Bugs fell on my back twice.   I hate bugs more than you can imagine.   I hate bugs.   Like, they kept jumping on me.   I just, Yuck!   So I'm going to request not to play at night anymore because I hate bugs, except for the final.   I heard it's at night, though.   I'll try to get used to them.  
   
 Q.   One game where you didn't have to move a lot was when you hit four aces in 60 seconds.   Have you done that before?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I don't know.   I feel like I have in some European country maybe.   I don't know.   But it's a great feeling.   It's cool.   Especially to do it at a Grand Slam, something you can't forget.   That was the only good moment I had in the match, I feel.  
   
 Q.   Was the way you had your leg taped differently to the way you've had it done in the past?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No.   I've had this tape for a long time.   Usually I practice with it.   One day I didn't practice with it.   But usually I have it taped like this.   
   
 Q.   If you ever lose a first‑round match at a slam, is that time to retire?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No, it's just time to go back to practice.   I'm never going to retire, ever.   So you guys got to get used to me.  
   
 Q.   The streak goes on and on.   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   They're meant to be broken.   I just hope this is one meant not to break.  
   
 Q.   Did you ever get an answer to your Twitter question?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I did.   I couldn't figure it out for the life of me.   It turns out it was Amanda Basica in LosAngeles in 1997.   So, yeah, I remember exactly.   I remember once they said it.   I'm like, Oh, I remember that match.   I don't remember who I played next.   I don't know.   I don't remember.   I went pretty far.   May have made main draw, but I don't know.   
But it took me a long time.   It was intense.   I was trying to think.   I remember who Venus played.   I didn't remember who I played.   I was like, Why can't I remember who I played?   So it was cool.  
   
 Q.   You and Andy haven't signed up for mixed yet officially.   Are you planning on doing that?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, hopefully we'll see.   We're just playing it by ear.  
   
 Q.   There's more doubt now?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I'm going to be out there, and hopefully he comes out with me (laughter).   He better.   
   
 Q.   That was a nasty sprain in Brisbane, pretty extreme.   Are you surprised you're able to move as well as you did tonight?   How hard was it to get yourself to this stage?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   It wasn't easy to get myself to this stage.   You know, I just had to think positive and be mentally there.   And I'm just taking it day to day.   You know, I'm doing everything possible that I can, things I've never done, just to get it better.   
You know, last night was the first night I didn't have any pain in it.   I was, Okay, that's pretty good.   But it is a very, very, very bad sprain.   So I'm just playing it by ear.  
   
 Q.   You don't talk about your injuries too much.   What did you do that was unusual?   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, something was pretty bad.   I tore a couple ligaments, so...   But it's all right.   I'm in here playing.   
   
 Q.   In terms of therapy?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Oh, therapy‑wise?   I'm not going to discuss that.   It's working, though, I think.   We'll see.   
   
 Q.   Must be a lot of ice?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   A ton of ice, so...   
   
 Q.   Basically sleeping in an ice bath?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Basically, yeah.   Basically, yeah, so...   But, uhm, it's working so far.   Like I said, you know, I've done it before.   It helped actually, which sounds ironic, it's helped that I've torn a ligament before, so it didn't swell as bad.   It was kind of like, Yeah, it was good I had to pull out of that other tournament, whenever it was.   So it worked out.
