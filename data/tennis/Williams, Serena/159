 S. WILLIAMS/R. Vinci
  6‑4, 6‑3 
   
 Q. Congratulations, Serena. Out of the four matches you've now played against Roberta do you feel this was the best she's brought against you and how her slice and her all‑court form can be kind of awkward to play against?  
SERENA WILLIAMS: I've felt that, you know, I don't remember the last times, because we don't play like every single week. But I think it was a couple of years ago, and then before that it was probably months. So it's always a long time in between. But I think this is the best she's been.   
Her slice, I think I handled it really well tonight. I think she just‑‑ more than anything her serve was, I think, what really kept her really strong in the match.  
   
 Q. And regards to how you felt despite a few strokes going not your way tonight, but how you still persevered, do you feel that you're still getting that form back to where you want to be at in getting to the semifinals here where you feel that you got through this one and this is just another step on the road to where you want to get to?  
SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, I definitely feel that's a good way to go, just another step, you know, in the right direction. I don't feel like I'm at my best or anywhere near it. But I feel like I'm going in the right direction and I want to keep that up.  
   
 Q. Serena, a couple of weeks ago you said on a conference call how much you liked Toronto, and obviously the fans really love you. You know, you like the city. Just wanted to find how cool is it to have one of the biggest rappers in your corner supporting you as well.   
SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, it's cool. We've been friends for so many years. So I don't think about it anymore. He's just like a normal person to me. Yeah, but you know, he's super nice and super sweet, super amazing person.   
   
 Q. Seemed tonight like you had to get angry with yourself in order to get the best out of yourself. Why is that?  
SERENA WILLIAMS: I don't think it's angry. I think it's more getting pumped up, and just wanted to be pumped up with myself.   
   
 Q. How did you find the court conditions?   
SERENA WILLIAMS: I find them really slow in the beginning, but now I feel like the ladies are hitting the balls right through the court and they're moving pretty fast.   
   
 Q. You slipped a few times.   
SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah. It's really slippery. I slipped in my first match, and now I slipped today. Yeah, so hopefully I'll be all right.   
   
 Q. Just to go back to the question about Drake a moment ago. I'm just curious have you ever been on the tennis court hitting any balls with him? Does he have any skills on the tennis court?  
SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah. We actually hit several times. He's really a good player. He said he played tennis when he was younger. I thought, really, of all sports. So he's always kind of been into tennis. So we hit a lot. Not a lot. But we used to hit a lot. Yeah, he's really good. He says he can take me lefty, which (rolls eyes) gets me charged up. (Laughs).   
   
 Q. So would he make a better tennis player or would you make a better rapper?  
SERENA WILLIAMS: Oh, man. I guess that's the start of another question. You know, that's a good question, because tennis takes a lot of years of skill and of, you know, practice. And I'm not saying rap doesn't, but I don't know. Rap, you gotta like think off the spot and do all this other stuff. So I don't know. Let's just say I'm doing the right thing and I think he's doing the right thing.   
   
 Q. More serious question, many people obviously consider you one of the greatest, if not the greatest female tennis player of all time. Who do you consider among those who came before you, either that you watched on TV growing up as a kid or you played earlier in your career, as the best female tennis player?  
SERENA WILLIAMS: Well, obviously I feel, you know, for me growing up watching, Steffi Graf and Monica Seles was just a great time. And then watching some of the‑‑ yeah, I think those two are people that really stuck out for me in my generation. So yeah, it was really cool to play them and just be a part of that.   
   
 Q. I'm not sure if you heard, but a couple of times this week Ana Ivanovic has sort of said that she would really like to see you win the US Open. I'm just wondering how it feels to know that some of your competitors are actually pulling for you and are really supportive of you and what you've done this year and what you've done throughout your career?  
SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, it makes me feel really good. You know, I've gotten a lot of support from the players in the locker rooms, and you know, obviously they want to win, but if they don't, I feel like I'm their second choice. So you know, that feels really good. It goes a long way.   
Yeah, Ana and I are really good friends, and she's just so amazing. We'll see what happens. But she's just a really nice, funny, sweet, beautiful girl. So yeah, I think the ladies in the locker room really get along and really just, yeah, for the most part, we all just enjoy each other's company.  
   
 Q. And just wondering also, you're well known for the mental strength you have on the court, and I'm just wondering if that's something that you developed over the years, if you kind of remember a time in your career when it sort of started to work out on the court there for you?  
SERENA WILLIAMS: I don't know. I think when I first won my Grand Slam back in the 90s, that my first Grand Slam I feel like that's when it started, like mentally in that final I was so mentally focused. I knew what I needed to do when times got tough. And I was shaking because I was so stressed about winning this first Grand Slam. I just locked in mentally and just did what I needed to do.  
   
 Q. So can you break down just for your next‑‑ since we don't know who you're playing, Bencic and Ivanovic. Can you just break down those two matchups for you? Are they different? Do you see them as similar, and how do you see that matchup going?  
SERENA WILLIAMS: I think both of them like to get balls back in play. I think that's one thing that's similar. Ivanovic is super aggressive on her return, and her serve has improved 100 percent over the past couple of years. So her serve has become a strength for her.   
Bencic, on the other hand, she gets a lot of balls back in play. She plays to win. She's really strong mentally, and I think she feels like she can‑‑ she is the next generation. She is the next person that's going to be the greatest, and she has an opportunity to prove herself, and that's always interesting to play a player like that.  
   
 Q. And now you're in the semifinal rounds. Usually when you get to this stage at any tournament, you're pretty tough to beat; seems like you're locked in. Do you feel that as the week progresses, that especially here, that your game is starting to lock in a little bit more? Do you feel more positive after today's performance, for example, than maybe the last ones?  
SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, I definitely feel more positive today. And I feel like each game and each week is getting better slowly and steady. And like I said to Patrick after the match, I don't want to peak too soon, you know. I just want to hopefully keep doing well and keep going.  
   
 Q. Serena, you mentioned Belinda being the next generation. I think when you were 18 you went to the finals of this tournament and lost to Martina. For her in her debut, what advice would you give her in this situation?  
SERENA WILLIAMS: Well, she's doing great. I think her father is giving her great advice as it is. Just keep it up. What else can you say. I wouldn't change anything.   
   
 Q. What do you think about Halep's comeback and whether or not you see her playing in the final here?  
SERENA WILLIAMS: I don't think she's having a comeback. I think she's been playing great pretty much. She's won a lot of tournaments this year. We've had a tough match this year. So I wouldn't label it a comeback. I would label it a great player that's continuing to prove how good she is.  
   
 Q. Very early on, top players seem to fall, you know, the first and second day. And it's a lot of No. 1 player. Does that change anything as you kind of approach later on in the week?  
SERENA WILLIAMS: You mean in this tournament?   
   
 Q. Yes.   
SERENA WILLIAMS: No. I just play the best I can and do what I can.   
   
 Q. And just wanted to ask how if Drake feels when you say that Green Day is your favorite music artist and if he feels a little jealous about that or any others since green day you have been a big fan?  
SERENA WILLIAMS: Well, I said Taylor Swift. I'm a huge Taylor fan. I think as long as I'm‑‑ that's a question you have to ask him.
