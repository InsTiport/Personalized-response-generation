  7‑5, 6‑4 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
   
 Q.   What did you like about your game today?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Well, I think I served great.   Yeah, I really needed to serve well today because she was just hitting unreturnable serves for me.   
So I was excited with my serve.   
   
 Q.   And your game overall?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Overall it was interesting.   We didn't really have too many long rallies.   We both were just hitting lots of service winners or aces.   So it was kind of hard to get in a good rhythm.   
But, you know, we'll see.   
   
 Q.   The two, the four and five seeds have all been eliminated, and all didn't play any tennis after Wimbledon.   You went to Washington and won there.   Do you think you benefited and they did not?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Uhm, I don't know.   I just definitely was able to do well in my last tournament.   I don't know.   I don't know the answer to that.   
I'm just trying to do the best I can.   
   
 Q.   When you talk about the serve being on, are there days when you know you're going to have it, or has it been a particular point of focus and emphasis in your work lately?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   When I feel like I'm going to have it, I tend not to serve well.   It's really weird.   It's almost like if I don't serve well in practice I do well on the court.   If I am serving aces in practice, I can't serve one on the court.   
I can't put a finger on it.   I'm just still trying to figure it out myself.   
   
 Q.   Your thoughts on facing Caroline Wozniacki?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   It will be a great match.   She's playing great tennis.   She's really focused.   She's just doing really, really well.   
It will be a really, really tough match.   It will be a good match for me to see where I am.  
   
 Q.   Can you get a sense right now where you think your game is right now, how close it is to being what you want it to be?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I don't know.   I'm just going day by day.   I'm not thinking about that.   I am not thinking that far in advance.   I'm just trying to do what I want to do on the court.   I don't want to overthink anything.   
   
 Q.   Could you imagine running the New York Marathon like Caroline?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No, no, no, no, no.   Let me tell you, I think I can do a half marathon or I can run with her for the first 5K, but I am done after that.   My body is clearly not made for marathon running.   I'm a sprinter (laughter).  
   
 Q.   It's the first time you've competed here in MontrÃ©al in some time.   Would the kind of result you want this week factor into your thinking about coming back again soon?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, it would be really great if I can just continue to get a couple more wins under my belt here in MontrÃ©al.   
But if not, you know, I'm just going to have to go next week and do the best thing I can there.   That's my thing, just do the best I can now.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French.   
   
 Q.   Your statistics are impressive with 61 titles and 17 Grand Slams.   How can you keep motivated?   How come you still have so much desire for winning?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I don't know.   I love playing tennis.   When I get up in the morning, I think, Why am I playing tennis today?   It's just that I love tennis.   I have time and I don't want to stay at home doing nothing.   It's better for me to play tennis.   
   
 Q.   So you're not thinking about retiring?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No.   
   
 Q.   You said you were happy with your serve today.   What can you improve in your game?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Only my serve?   I believe I played well today.   Yesterday I played well, but today I played very well.   
Maybe I was not in magnificent shape today, but I served well though and that's why I won.
