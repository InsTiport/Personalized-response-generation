S. WILLIAMS/N. Osaka
6-3, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. I wanted to ask you, at that 3-1 moment with that drop shot she hit and you ran into the net post and you seemed after that that you were all right, but just that whole moment and how it showed your strength and training you were able to weather through that moment.
SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, you know, tennis players don't really get too dirty and ugly on the court.  So that was one of a few moments where those kind of injuries can happen or whatever.
But it was fine.  It hurt, but it wasn't the end of the world.
Q. What do you feel like you did differently on the court today versus in the previous matches that you've played against her?
SERENA WILLIAMS: I knew her game a little bit more, so that's a little easier.  And, you know, I'm just overall a little bit better.  You know, last year was -- you know, it was a miraculous year for me, to be honest.
And, yeah, so I know her game.  I watch her a lot.  And I was just -- know how to -- I know what I need to do to hopefully try to get a win today, and it helped a little bit.
Q. Naomi had previously won the previous two meetings.  Is it refreshing to get a challenge like that, try to crack a new code, to figure out ways to beat her?
SERENA WILLIAMS: I wouldn't say it's refreshing.  But it's definitely good for me, you know, to keep the competition and, you know, to have players like her who can, you know, play really well.
Q. I was wondering if there was a moment or a place today when you made up your mind that you're going to win this match?
SERENA WILLIAMS: I mean, you know, I go into every match thinking I can do it, but, you know, sometimes that doesn't happen.
But overall I just went in with a similar mindset of just coming out and doing the best that I can.
Q. I saw the pictures on line of Wozniacki's wedding.  You were in the bridal party.  Could you just talk for a moment about the lifelong friendships that you have made in the sport and how they've enriched your life?
SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, you know, I travel so much in tennis.  And some of the players, at some point when I was traveling a lot, I would literally see more than my parents.  And so it's really an extended family, and it's your colleagues as well as your competition.
And you end up growing to have a lot of respect for all of these women out here that are traveling and working and playing.  And you literally see them every week, week in, week out.  And through that, I've met a lot of players that we get along.  We hang out.  We go to their weddings.
You know, it's really made me realize that these are lifelong friendships and experiences that so few people can have, because there's so few people that play tennis on this level.
And to build, you know, friendships with these people and these women have been really good for me.
Q. Can you talk about the longevity of your coaching association with Patrick?  Because with so many players it's a revolving door with coaches or at least every couple years you might see a fresh face.  How do you manage over the years to not tune out the message?  And on the other side of things, how does Patrick deal with your quirks, for lack of a better word, I guess.
SERENA WILLIAMS: Well, I don't like change, so that's one thing I've been working on personally.
But I would rather not change too much.  I don't really like too much change.  And I don't know why he deals with me, so...  (Smiling.)
Q. You played very well today on all areas, you know, serving, ground strokes, et cetera.  And I'm wondering if you played this well last year in New York, do you think the result would have been different?
SERENA WILLIAMS: I don't know.  I think she was supposed to win that and she deserved to win New York.
And, you know, I don't even remember what I played like last year.  I don't even remember what she played like.  I'm sure we both improved.
And, you know, it was her moment, and I don't -- I don't know.
Q. Today you got the rematch of the US Open final.  How it would be tomorrow to have the rematch of the Wimbledon final?
SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, it would be great.  Yeah, I couldn't play -- well, yeah.  It would be great.  I'll leave it at that.  Thank you.  I'm going to exit stage right.
