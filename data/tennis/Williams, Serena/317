THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Tonight was very windy, tough conditions.   Seems you adapted pretty well.   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, it was very windy, but I felt good out there.   It was very tough conditions.   I came through.  
   
 Q.   What do you think about her game?   It's not the first time you have been playing her.   Did you see some improvement from her?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I think every time I play her she improves.  
   
 Q.   You were cruising along in the second set and had a little bit of a hiccup.   She broke twice.   What was going on there?   Was it again the windy conditions?   Your serve was definitely better today.   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   It was better, but it still was nowhere near good.   
Yeah, I just started ‑‑I made a few errors that I shouldn't have made.   I didn't make a lot of errors in the first set, and I started making some errors that were just ridiculous.   She started playing a lot better.  
   
 Q.   Do these type of conditions probably make it pretty hard to assess where you're at at this point?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, definitely very difficult.   
   
 Q.   If you reach the semis, obviously you become No. 1, and you'd be the oldest player to reach that, the top ranking again.   What does that mean to you?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   It's awesome.   Since I didn't do the youngest, I figure I'll do the oldest.   (Laughter.)  
   
 Q. You said on Twitter that you were single.   How did you enjoy the Valentine's Day today?   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I don't celebrate Valentine's, so for me just another day.  
   
 Q.   Something commercial you don't really care about?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No, I really don't do the holidays in general, so, yeah, I don't do the Valentine's stuff.
