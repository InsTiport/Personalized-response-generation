 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Kateryna said it's very difficult to return your serves because she doesn't know where the ball is gonna go off her racquet. You had 14 aces. Can you talk about our serve?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I been working on my serve. I was really disappointed at Stanford in how I served. I felt like I hadn't been serving well in practice, so I definitely didn't expect to hit that many aces today. I took some pace off.  
  
  Q. How would you rate your game today?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I served well. I think that's about it.  
  
  Q. What have you been doing to work on your serve?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Just hitting serves after serves after serves. That's when everyone does: hit lots of serves. That's pretty much all I've been doing.   
  
  Q. How is your health? I heard you're a little under the weather, slight cold or whatnot.   
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, I am, but I'm getting better every day, so...  
  
  Q. How is the screenplay coming along?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: You know, I'm the ultimate procrastinator. I was near the finish line, so...   
 I don't know, sometimes I get nervous when I get near the finish line. I have lots of stories I can write about, and you know, hopefully I can get them in my script. I been writing them down, but hopefully it'll come together.  
  
  Q. Are you finished with your memoirs, or still working on those?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: No, it comes out September 1st, which I'm excited about. I think it's a good read, and I hope everyone gets it. It's not only a memoir but motivational piece as well, so it's fun.  
  
  Q. Have you given copies to your family yet?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS: No, I haven't, but hopefully that'll -- I want them to buy it.   
  
  Q. You were here in 2006. What are your impressions of the tournament now that it's a Tier 1 and obviously a different feel. How is it for you coming to the tournament and playing again?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: It's the same. When I was here in '06 it was a little smaller tournament. But it was such a great facility and the people that run it have been so awesome. So they really made it feel like a big tournament, so it's good that it's a big one now.  
  
  Q. Looking back last year, during the clay season the Family Circle Cup, that was the last regular tour season title that you won. What are you working on now so that you can add to that?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I'm sorry, but I feel like winning Grand Slams is just as important as winning -- and they're on the tour. I play on the WTA Tour while I win them, so for me it's a tour event. I've won one just recently a couple weeks ago.   
  
  Q. Have you been able to see much of Cincinnati since you've been here?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: No, I've been in bed all day, so maybe next time. I won't make to this time. Hopefully I'll finish out the tournament.  
  
  Q. Are you pretty much prepared to defend your US Open title?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I'm getting there. You know, I obviously have to play better. Hopefully I'll be ready. Is that it?   
 THE MODERATOR: Anything else?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Thanks, guys.
