 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Why do you think you've been so dominant so far this tournament?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I don't know. I just feel like I'm just trying to play my way into a rhythm. I'm just taking it one match at a time.  
  
  Q. It looked like you got into some rhythm today. You really -- once you started to roll, you started to roll. Can you talk about how you felt out there?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, I actually felt really good out there. I felt like I was really consistent. I felt like I was moving really well.  
 Yeah, I felt good.  
  
  Q. I saw your hitting partner was making notes. Is that something new, a new deal between you and him?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: He's been making -- it's definitely new that he was making notes today. Usually he tells me a little bit how he feels after the match, but I think today he started making a few notes, which is good, because sometimes you can't remember everything and it's often good to write it down.  
  
  Q. What do you think about your match tomorrow against Elena?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I think it will be a great match. I feel like, you know, she is obviously a great player. Our last match was, you know, really insane.   
 So it will be another good match. I love playing her. We've been playing each other a lot this year. It will be good.  
  
  Q. She was saying she might have some kind of advantage in longer rallies. This is a slower surface than in Wimbledon. Do you find that court a little slower and might that prolong rallies?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I don't know. I find that the court -- it is what it is. I feel like, you know, I can hit 100 balls or 200 if I wanted to or 5 or 2 if I need to, so...
