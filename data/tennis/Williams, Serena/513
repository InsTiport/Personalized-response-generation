 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. That was a pretty emphatic start to the tournament. Were you expecting it to be so easy?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I didn't expect it to be so easy, but I was really focused today. You know, just had a lot of momentum after my last match so I wanted to really do well.   
  
  Q. We just learned that Justine Henin is retiring from competitive tennis today. Just wanted to get your comments about that.  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: She was a great champion and she gave me a world of trouble, so I hope the best for her. She had a great year last year.   
 Gosh, what can you say about such a champion? I don't think we have enough time.   
  
  Q. Do you know anything about Errani, your next opponent?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Oh, yeah. You know what, Venus has played her before, so, you know, I didn't know she was Italian, but doesn't matter what country I'm in I always play a person from that country.   
 I'll be looking forward to the match, and I'll be talking to Venus.   
  
  Q. Sorry to bring you back to Justine again, but I just wondered if there was any particular match that sticks particularly in your memory against her.   
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Probably in Miami last year. It was such a hard-fought match and I was glad to win. I just thought that if any match it was probably that one.
