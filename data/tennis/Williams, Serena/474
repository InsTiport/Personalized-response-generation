S. WILLIAMS/S. Errani
  6-1, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.

 Q. Boring today?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, really boring today. No fun. Cinderella didn't last all week either, so that keeps me going and comforted.

 Q. Comfortable match today?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, a little better today. I still think I can improve on some things, and that's what I want to do. I don't want to peak too soon. Just want to stay level for the whole season.

 Q. Seemed like you were trying to get off the court as quick as possible. How did you find the heat?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Um, I didn't think it was that hot. I felt a nice breeze today. I wasn't necessarily trying to get off fast, but I wasn't going slow either. I was just trying to win the points.

 Q. What part of your game were you happiest with?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: My serve. I was a little disappointed with it in the first round, but it was much better today.

 Q. Between games you seem to be referring to a piece of paper. Can you tell us anything about that?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, no, they're just reminders. I mean, I always write them down before I go out on court. I just write things to myself that I want to work on and that what I want to do.

 Q. Can you tell us anything about them?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Just fun stuff. Like you know, just reminders. Little things. Look at the ball and things that. Keeps me motivated.

 Q. How regularly do those things change?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I write a new one every day for my match, so they definitely vary.

 Q. Obviously you're coming up against Wozniacki in the quarterfinals. What do you make of her?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Last I checked she was No. 12. She's probably even better now. She's definitely -- I'll be playing an top 10 level, so it'll be a good match for me going into the Australian Open, and also for her as well. So, yeah, think it'll be a good match.

 Q. Is your mom here now?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, she's here.

 Q. Nice to have the support of family?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, it's definitely nice to have her here. I'm already playing better, so it's good.

 Q. What's sort of things has she said to you since you arrived?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: You know, she just knows my game so well. I've been working with her since I can remember, so she just knows how to get me motivated.
 You know, I'm really always really motivated on my own, but she kind of knows what to say to get me to play and do better.

 Q. What was it in this case?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I can't tell you that. (Laughter) I'm trying to word around it, but...
 I can't exactly tell you that.
