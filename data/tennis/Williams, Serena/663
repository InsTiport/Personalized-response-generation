THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Serena, please. 


Q.  It's an all-American semifinal.  How does it feel? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  It's good.  At least one American will go into the finals.  Have the USA spirit nowadays, so I'm really excited about it. 

Q.  Today was a lot closer than your previous two matches.  How did you actually think you played today?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Well, actually I think I played a little better today.  I'm serving a little better.  I'm moving a little better.  And everything is coming together.  And I'm happy because I'm not training too soon.  There's still a Grand Slam coming up. 

Q.  Compared to the way you played today, how would you want to change your game tomorrow against Jennifer?  What would you want to avoid doing? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Well, you know, I haven't really had a chance to think about it yet.  So I will just have to go home and talk about it with my mom.  And, you know, we'll go from there. 

Q.  Were you surprised that your opponent would fight so tough and respond so well? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I wasn't surprised at all because I played her a long, long time ago.  But she was very good.  And I know Venus played her a little while back and she plays very well.  So she's a good player.  You have to be ready to play, because she can knock out the seeds quick and easy. 

Q.  You're 4-all in career meetings with Jennifer, I believe, but I think you've won the last three.  What have you done in those three that you didn't do perhaps in the previous four? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  In the previous four, I don't think I was  -- I think I had lost at one point four in a row maybe  - yeah.  So it was just  - I don't know  - I just  -- I don't think I wanted to win.  And sometimes  -- I think twice I was really injured and I couldn't really play.  But, you know, lately my game -- I'm getting older, and I realize that time goes and I have to want to win.  So that's basically it.  It's always a good match.  

Q.  Does that suggest then that tomorrow if you want to win, which you clearly do, that the match is, so to speak, on your racquet? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  You never know.  The match is never on one's racquet until you're at the net and you're shaking hands.  Jennifer's playing very well in the clay court events, and she's defending French Open champion.  So you really  - you never know.  I'm sure she wants to win, too. 

Q.  Tonight it was announced that Martina will miss the French Open because she has to undergo surgery.  I don't know if you heard about that.  Do you have any thoughts on that? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  No.  I heard that she was injured and stuff.  But, you know, it's really too bad.  She was playing pretty good tennis, and she almost won the Australian Open.  But it's tough.  It really is.  But I'm sure she'll be okay  - hopefully.  I'll say a prayer for her.  Hopefully, she'll do better. 

Q.  It seems that you have a very good relationship with the Roman crowd.  Do you think this might help tomorrow? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Well, I don't know.  We'll see.  I just  -- I normally don't hear the crowd when I'm out there.  I normally go out there and stay focused and just try to be very serious.
