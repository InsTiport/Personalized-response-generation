THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Congratulations.   Are you happy with your performance today?   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I felt a little sluggish out there, but I'm happy I was able to win the match.  
Honestly, I obviously have to and want to play better as each match goes on.   
   
 Q.   How long have you been here in Europe training for the clay court season?   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I've been here a little over a week; maybe a week and a half.   
Not super long, but long enough.  
   
 Q.   Have you just had the opportunity to train here in Madrid or have you been training somewhere else?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I was training if Paris for a few days and now I came to Madrid a couple days early.  
   
 Q.   Can you compare the conditions of the clay courts?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, well, I think these clay courts are really good.   I think they're a little bit faster than the ones I was practicing on in Paris.   For me, that's always a good sign.   
Conditions, it's a little warmer here‑ a lot warmer here.   Overall, I think it's really good.   
   
 Q.   Your opponent today, she's pretty intense out there.   You must know her well from the Mouratoglou Academy?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, we train sometimes at the same facility, at Mouratoglou in France.   I see her around a lot and I see her working really hard.  
   
 Q.   How has it been, your preparation?   Obviously your first clay court season with Patrick.   Has your preparation differed?   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   It's a little different.   Not much different.   
Just it's not something that I think would make such a big change.
