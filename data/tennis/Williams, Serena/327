 Q.   Obviously not what you were expecting tonight.   Disappointing that Vika had to withdraw.   What are your general feelings on her and having to pull out of the tournament?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I like Vika.   I think she's a great player.   I love playing her.   It sucks.   I had that toe problem just a couple weeks ago and it's painful.   God, it's so painful.   Doesn't sound painful, but it is.   You can't walk with that.   
I hope she gets better fast.  
   
 Q.   And obviously it's going to change your preparation slightly for the final.   What are you going to do tonight and tomorrow given that you haven't played a match tonight?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I'm definitely doing enough to prepare and be ready.   I feel like even though I didn't play a match tonight, I played some really good matches here.   
It's just like a regular tournament for me.   It's going to be fine.  
   
 Q.   So it's Anastasia or the lucky loser, Tsurenko, who is a bit of an unknown.   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Tsurenko is playing really well.   I think Anastasia is the favorite.   She was practicing so well.   I looked at Patrick a few times when I was practicing, and I was like, Gosh, she's playing so well.   I'm totally not surprised she is doing so well and getting so far.   Either way it'll be a good match.
