C. WOZNIACKI/S. Williams
  6‑4, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Seemed like you were struggling on the return a bit throughout the match.   Is that something you think was a big factor in what happened out there today?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Um, I think I just struggled a bit with a lot of errors more than anything, I guess both on the return and‑‑ you know, she did well, she moved well, and I just made too many errors.

Q.   How did you felt in the game?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I felt a bit off, but that's normal.   You know, sometimes you're not playing well.   You have to be able to still‑‑ be able to still play better.

Q.   At the end of the second set you started coming back.   How did you feel when you got back to, you know, when she was serving 5‑4?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I felt better than I had.   I started mixing it up.   In the last game I went back to what got me in that position and obviously didn't help.
But overall, I felt like I was striking the ball better ‑ but not as well as I could be.

Q.   On a day when you're not feeling 100%, making more mistakes, she has to be a nightmare opponent to play in that she got so many balls back. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I guess.   I mean, I don't think anyone is a nightmare to play.   I don't like playing Venus per se because she's the toughest player on the tour for me I've ever played. 
I think I was fine.   I just needed to make a few more shots.

Q.   I know you had a high percentage.   Did you feel like you served as well as you wanted to?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No, you know, I probably could have went for more.   I was going for more high percentage first serves, but that's not my game. 
So for me, I just want to play my game that I am used to and what I do best.

Q.   All losses are tough, but is it tougher when you lose close to home?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, definitely.   I‑‑ um.   You know, it's not‑‑ it's not fun.   You know, I wanted to be in the semifinals, but I'm not there. 
So just looking forward to the next tournament and not dwell on this too much.

Q.   Were you anxious at all or excited?   Because it seemed like you were asking yourself to calm down at times. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Um, no, just telling myself to relax and not crack, you know, a racquet.   (Smiling.)
So that was pretty much it.

Q.   Do you think it might have helped you if you actually had gone through that?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I thought about it, but, um, I'm trying to be better now.   (Smiling.)

Q.   It seems like she was serving a little harder today.   Like you had more unforced errors in your return of serve.   Was that you or her? 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Well, I think she definitely served the best she served in her career, and I actually expected her to do that. 
Last time we played I played a lot better, and, you know, she knows in order to be able to hang out she has to serve bigger. 
She did that today, but next time I'm gonna be ready for that.

Q.   Usually she's so solid, but knowing that the last times she surprise you, she's so solid today, she was so concentrate today.   Maybe she played the match of the year. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, definitely.   Everyone I play always plays the match of the year, though.   It's no surprise.
Um, you know, I think that she knew that she had to play really well to hang in there.   I didn't step up to the plate, but, you know, that's okay. 

Q.   Do you think shot selection was also an issue?   When you were volleying, it seemed like a lot of your balls were landing in the middle and she was able to pass you pretty easily. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, you know, I probably could've didthat better.   The good thing is I could've played a lot better.   I probably played about 20%. 
You know, it would really suck and if I had to sit here and say I couldn't do any better.   That's not the case.

Q.   Why do you say you played 20%? 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I just made a lot of errors.   I just made a tremendous amount of errors.   There's no reason for that.   I'm older and I shouldn't do that.   There's no excuse. 
I just gotta stop that.   It's silly.

Q.   It was a little breezier, also.   We could see your dress in the wind.   Did that influence your game or your... 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No.   I mean, she played under the same circumstances as I did.   I mean, her dress was flowing, too, I guess.
I can't‑‑ you know, I don't want to make excuses.   I didn't win because I didn't play well.   There's no reason.

Q.   Your sister has been doing something pretty incredible this week here, making it all the way to the quarterfinals her first tournament back.   Are you gonna stick around and watch her?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Well, I'm just a hop, skip, and a jump away.   I don't see why not.   I'm rooting for her all the way, and I think she will be fine.

Q.   Yesterday when Roger lost to Roddick he said he was playing a player that was a No. 1 player, not a 34 player.   How about you tonight?   You're both former No. 1 players.   Did you feel like a champion right there, playing as if she was the No. 1, also?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Um, I guess.   I mean, she's not No. 1 right now, so I don't know. 

Q.   Anything that really surprised you of this game in her?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Nothing surprises me anymore, at all.   Absolutely nothing.   So I'm used to it.   I have seen it a lot.   Nothing really surprises me.

Q.   What do you think to do so that you don't make so many unforced errors next time?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Um, you know, I think I just need to go back to the drawing board and do what I did in the summer and get serious about not making errors.   That's it.

Q.   How are you physically? 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I'm fine.
