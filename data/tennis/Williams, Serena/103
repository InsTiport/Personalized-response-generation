S. WILLIAMS/A. Beck
  6‑3, 6‑0

THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

Q. Did that first service break by her kind of get you going? Did you kind of use that as a little bit of a jolt?
SERENA WILLIAMS: I guess so, yeah. I think ‑‑yeah. 

Q. Did you need it? Did you feel like you came out a little slow, because after that, there was no stopping you, obviously?
SERENA WILLIAMS: I don't think I feel like I came out really slow, no. I feel like I believe I won the first game, right? I made a few errors, but at least I was going for my shots. Just because I didn't win, doesn't mean that I didn't come out slow.

Q. Did it feel any different playing on middle Sunday, the atmosphere? What was it like for you?
SERENA WILLIAMS: No, I didn't, actually. I thought it would feel really different, but it didn't feel really different.

Q. How good did it feel going up in the second set, because you didn't lose any points on serve, only lost four points on return. It was a lopsided set. 
SERENA WILLIAMS: It felt good. I wasn't sure what the stats were obviously, but on that last service game, I was thinking, Have I lost on my first serve yet? I wasn't sure, but I just tried to stay focused.

Q. Those sort of bright spots, how much can that give you confidence, you're moving in the right direction or where you want to be?
SERENA WILLIAMS: It gives me a lot of confidence. I know what it takes to win these tournaments. It's just about now just doing it.

Q. What were your thoughts about the Novak/Querrey match yesterday before and how things developed?
SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah. I thought Novak would come back. I was surprised he didn't, actually.
But, you know, it happens to all of us.

Q. What do you think it says, along with what you experienced last year, about the challenge to make history in this individual sport when you're going for such a difficult goal to attain?
SERENA WILLIAMS: I think he and I have both made extreme history. He's won four in a row. I won four in a row last year. I think that's historic in itself.

Q. All in all, when you look at it, was this one of your better matches, more efficient all year?
SERENA WILLIAMS: Definitely more efficient. I don't know. I played really well in the first six matches in Australia, but it was definitely getting back to that. 

Q. You looked really good today. Last year you played this really competitive match against Watson and won the tournament. This year you played a really competitive match against McHale and today you looked sharp. Do you think you need those matches to be as sharp as possible or enter a warrior mode as you said the other day?
SERENA WILLIAMS: I think the McHale match really helped me. To be honest, I felt like losing that first set so tight and her playing better than she's ever played in her life really helped me to realize that I can play better and I can lift my game to compete with people when they're frankly treeing.

Q. How much of a step up in class is your next opponent? I think it's Kuznetsova. You have played her a lot?
SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, we have played a lot. She's won a lot. I have won a lot.
You know, I'm looking forward to it. We both are ready for this match. You know, we're both going to give it our heart, as we always do when we play each other.
We'll go from there. 

Q. After that match you appeared not to remember playing in the middle Sunday here 12 years ago. 
SERENA WILLIAMS: At this? 

Q. You don't remember playing? 
SERENA WILLIAMS: No. Did I play? 

Q. Yes, you did. You played Serna?
SERENA WILLIAMS: (Laughter.) That's a blast from the past. Gosh. What year was that? 

Q. 12 years ago. 
SERENA WILLIAMS: That puts it 2004. Did I win that year? 

Q. No. 
SERENA WILLIAMS: No. Gosh. 

Q. Friday evening when you were in here talking about the then‑suspended Djokovic/Sam match, you said that you were torn because you said you always cheer for Sam, even though you felt an affinity with Novak as the champion. Sam leading the way, and the whole American showing here so far, what's that say about the state of tennis?
SERENA WILLIAMS: I think it's good. I think the Americans are doing well. I think we have been doing well. Now it's just being more consistent.

Q. Is Sveta somewhat of a familiar face? There has been a lot of players that have retired during your time, but she's been someone that's been around for a while. I think you have somewhat of a friendship with her, too. 
SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, we always tend to get along, especially off the court. But most importantly, we leave it all out there on the court when we play each other. So I think that's really important. 

Q. When you watch Djokovic, do you recognize what he's going through as a top player who is expected to win everything all the time always? When you see him having to fight, do you sense that you have been in those similar situations?
SERENA WILLIAMS: I am in those situations. I wouldn't say I have been. Every time I step out on the court, if I don't win, it's major national news. But if I do win, it's just like a small tag in the corner. 

Q. So what is that burden like?
SERENA WILLIAMS: It's not a burden anymore. 

Q. What is it?
SERENA WILLIAMS: It is what it is. I don't look at it as a burden. I look at it almost like something that's really awesome to be in that position. 

Q. What makes it that way for you?
SERENA WILLIAMS: Well, I think there is only two people that you can say that about out of all the athletes.

Q. What's the difference, if any, when you're playing someone that you're familiar with, like a Svetlana, versus someone you don't really know very much about?
SERENA WILLIAMS: Obviously I know Svetlana. I kind of feel like I know a little bit of her tactics, although she changes it up every time we play.
But, you know, playing someone you haven't played before is a little bit tricky, because they present different things and you're not quite sure how they play.
But going up against someone like Svetlana, she knows my game, I know her game. Then it's just really down, out to who's really gonna fight to win it.

Q. Do you take anything from that Miami loss or it was a bad day at the office for you?
SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, I took a lot from that loss. 

Q. Novak was telling us he likes to get on his bike and cycle around Wimbledon. Other players have different habits. What are kind of the more fun things you get to do when you're at Wimbledon?
SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, I don't do that. I don't do anything actually. I pretty much stay at my house. 

Q. I was wondering if you had a chance to see Coco? She was on court before you. She's done well on grass last couple of years. What do you think about her game on this surface?
SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, I saw she had a really good win today. That was really good for her. I think last year she got to the quarters. Honestly almost won in the semis to play. 
But, yeah, I think she's has a lot of confidence on this surface, as she should. She's doing well. 

Q. Just on the playing on middle Sunday, you said it might feel different. Is that you thought it might feel different for you or the crowd would be different?
SERENA WILLIAMS: I thought all around it would be a little different. But maybe it was because the match was so 'matter of fact' that it wasn't. But, yeah, I think it was nice, though. 

Q. You're not in the position because you're the hunted, not the Hunter. What insights do you have about what other players feel when the door opens and a Serena Williams or Novak Djokovic loses?
SERENA WILLIAMS: I don't know. I'm not in that position to answer that question.
