THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.


Q.  Give us an example of one of your screams.

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I was so frustrated.  I mean, just so frustrated.


Q.  From what, your game, conditions, everything?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  From my game.  The conditions weren't all that bad.  It's like people were just -- I was just so frustrated with the way I was playing.  She was just really treeing.  I'm just kind of tired people treeing on me, you know what I mean?  It's a fight every day.


Q.  You have had some struggles with her in the past.  Not a total surprise, right?  She won once.

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah, she's beaten me once.  That was 2000 Australian Open maybe.  So I always seem to have a tough match with her.


Q.  Were you thinking at all about the fact that your sister pulled out her match and you will play her tomorrow?  Was that on your mind at all?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  No, not at all.  I mean, she was still playing when I went out on the court.


Q.  You're going to have a quick turnaround.  Does that matter to you?  Usually there's a lot of hype around when you and your sister play.  Is it nice to have it happen quickly?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah, definitely.  So it's boom, boom, boom.  Definitely play a match every day.


Q.  Do you guys tease each other at all?  Is there light-heartedness about when you are coming up against each other, sisterly kind of kidding back and forth about it?  Is it all business?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  No, it's pretty much all business, you know.  We really -- we both want to win.  We'd obviously prefer to play in the final, but this is our job.  We take it serious.  There's no kidding around really.


Q.  At this point do you dread it, look forward to it when the times come up when you guys are out there together on the court?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I wish it was later in the tournament, so that's unfortunate. But one of us will definitely be in the semis.


Q.  News hit of your reality show tonight.  Fans were buzzing about it.  Can you tell us what they expect to see in this reality show?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  It's about the Williams sisters, who we lead very interesting lives off the tennis court as well, and then we're two fabulous world-champion tennis players.  So it's kind of interesting to see how that works out, I mean, our training regime, our different jobs.  I'm a fashion designer; Venus is an interior designer.  I act.  I do so much stuff off the court, and I do so much stuff preparing to get on the court.  So it's kind of what it's like.  It's going to be fun, interesting.


Q.  What are we going to learn about your relationship with your sister, family, friends that people wouldn't know?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I think everyone will learn that we're really crazy.  Like we're never serious, we're always laughing and joking.  We're just really kind of -- we're really kind of psycho, for lack of a better word right now.


Q.  The reality is that you've dominated this competition against your sister for the last several years, at least five in a row in Slams.  Do you feel like you have a mental edge over her at this point?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Geez, I don't know.  I know she's been playing good in this tournament, and she's usually playing well in practice against me, so... Whatever -- I've always said, whoever I play, even if I've beat them a million times, it's a new match, it's a new day.  They're going to want to win and move on to the next round.
