  7-6, 7-5 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Serena, please.   
  
  Q. How is your ankle and your legs?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, it's okay right now. Have to see. I just rolled it. So usually adrenaline sets in. I'm so into this tournament. I don't even feel it yet. So right now it's really good.   
  
  Q. What do you think about this situation that if you beat Venus tournament, you put her out of the tournament?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Well, it's a tough situation. But, you know, I'm not playing Venus tomorrow, I'm playing an opponent. That's kind of how I look at it. Just another opponent that wants to beat me.   
  
  Q. Can you take us through what you were thinking when you were facing two set points? In the second set, the serving seemed to decide the game at the end. Do you think you were mentally stronger towards the end?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, I started serving better. I didn't serve too many big serves until the end.   
 When I was down the two set points, I thought I ruined it because I had a chance to be up 4-1 in the tiebreak. I missed some easy shots. I just started thinking about how I was going to be in a third set. Next thing I know, I was still in the tiebreak. So I don't know, it was kind of weird thoughts.   
  
  Q. It's a massive tournament, a lot at stake. Very few people watching at the end. Does that make it difficult or do you block that out?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: No, I think Svetlana and I were really going at it. You can tell how much we care about our sport and how passionate we are.   
 We didn't care who was there, whether it was one person or two. We were really involved. We really both wanted to win. Neither one of us let up at all.
