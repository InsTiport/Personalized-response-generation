REVEN OLIVER:  First question, please, for Serena.  
 

Q.  Was it an easy game for you tonight?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  Well, I mean, tonight it was okay.  It was my first match in a couple days.  I didn't play so well, but I think she played a pretty good match.  She was able to pull through.  What am I talking about?  
 

Q.  Are you looking forward to the final, you and Venus?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  It's going to be exciting if I can make it there, Venus can make it there.  I definitely know that I'm playing great tennis right now.  There's a couple people in the way.  
 

Q.  Venus said she likes to watch you.  Do you like to watch her play?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  I love to watch Venus.  She's a great player.  I definitely think she's my toughest opponent out there.  So, yeah, I love to watch Venus. 
 

Q.  Do you have any ability that she doesn't have?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  Not really.  We have both similar games.  She's just like me.  I play a little like her.  But we both have differences, too. 
 

Q.  What differences?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  Well, actually I don't like answering that question.  You can come out and watch our matches and you can probably see. 
 

Q.  When you travel together, it's not so often that you travel together, are you able to spend a lot of time?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  I travel with her all the time, except for one tournament I didn't go with her.  I was in Paris.  Before that, it was like one more tournament.  Other than that, we always travel together.  We always spend a lot of time together.  We do everything together.  We're best friends.  
 

Q.  Who will be the first No.  1?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  Looks like a close competition now.  You never know.  We'll just have to wait and see.  
 

Q.  Are you tired of being asked always of the sister thing?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  No, not really.  Doesn't really bother me to be asked.  I don't think the other people should hear the answers if they don't want to participate. 
 

Q.  Do you talk about the outfits, hair, the dresses?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah.  I love her outfits.  I have some nice outfits, too.  We talk about a lot of things. 
 

Q.  Do you discuss tomorrow we have yellow, do you discuss what kind of color?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  I don't change the color every day.  I keep this color for about a month or so and then I'll change.
