   THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 

 Q.  What are your thoughts on that match?  Pretty routine? 
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  Uhm, routine?  I don't know.  I think it was definitely a match to be serious for.  She's a good player. 

 Q.  Served unbelievably well.  Can you serve much better than that? 
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah, I definitely served well today.  It was much better than what I did my other two rounds, so it's looking good.  I like it. 

 Q.  Can you bottle that, figure out why it happened? 
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  I got some treatment in the locker room earlier on my shoulder.  I kind of credit it to that (smiling). 

 Q.  She's an up-and-coming player.  Seemed to play pretty well off the ground. 
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah, I think she played really well off the ground, and she moved well, which is always good to be able to hit hard and move well.  I thought she had a lot of pace on her balls, too. 

 Q.  Are you happy with the way you're moving at this point in the tournament? 
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah, I'm moving well.  I'm not even moving my fastest.  You know, I can move faster when I want to. 

 Q.  Venus is playing doubles with you.  It's like playing with herself.  Is that the same for you? 
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah, I love playing doubles with V.  It's like playing with a guy because she has a great serve.  She hits these hard balls.  I just stand and look like an All-American.  It's pretty cool. 

 Q.  Who decides tactics? 
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  You know, we kind of just do our own thing.  And like sometimes I'll tell her like to look for this and stuff, look for that. 
 I don't know who really takes the lead.  I don't know. 

 Q.  What does it say to the teams that are out there that you knocked off the No. 2 seed? 
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  Well, I mean, we are a renowned doubles team ourselves (laughter), so I think the other teams out there know that.  So now we consider ourselves the No. 2 seeds.  We're taking it just as serious as we are the singles.  We really enjoy the competition.  We enjoy playing doubles. 

 Q.  So it's not a coincidence you're playing doubles again in an Olympic year? 
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  No, we started to play last year.  I wanted to play here last year as well.  I mean, obviously we want to play Olympics, doubles at the Olympics.  We would love to play doubles at the Olympics, and that's definitely something we want to keep in our hearts and in our minds.  But we also do enjoy playing doubles. 

 Q.  Was that one of the most exciting titles you won, that Olympic gold? 
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  By far, it is my most cherished trophy or anything, is definitely the gold medal. 

 Q.  Your earrings, are they officially large when you can fit a tennis ball through them? 
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah, if you can fit a tennis ball through them or your hand, like so (putting her hand through the earrings).  They serve as earrings and then I can wear them as bangles.  Two purposes. 

 Q.  Are you still working on the Althea Gibson documentary? 
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  It's not done.  They're still working on it.  It's cool.  It's really exciting. 

 Q.  How would you compare Vaidisova to Azarenka?  Many nuances between them? 
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah, you know what, I actually think they both play a like.  Obviously Vaidisova has had more -- has played more maybe in her career and done a little better, but I think they both have similar games.  Vaidisova has a really big serve.  She uses that to her advantage.
