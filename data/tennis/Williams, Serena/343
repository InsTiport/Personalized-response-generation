S. WILLIAMS/M. Sharapova
  6‑0, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   So many victories.   Where does this one fit in for you?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Oh, my gosh, this one is so high up there, being Olympic gold champion, being Golden Slam champion singles and doubles, that's pretty awesome. 

Q.   How about the way you won this one? 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I don't know.   I was so focused here.   I remember I was serving and I was thinking, Serena, this is your best chance to win a gold medal.   You played Wimbledon on grass.   You played great on grass.   Pull it together.   I was thinking, I got to do this.

Q.   You were thinking this when?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Today. 
I was like, I can do this.   This is so your surface, so just do it.

Q.   How important is it to win this gold medal when Venus won in Sydney?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, it's awesome.   She won against I think Dementieva, so she won against a Russian I think in Sydney, too. 
I would have been happy whether I would have got a silver or gold.   It's such a great achievement to get on that medal stand.   So that was awesome.   But obviously I wanted gold. 
Now Venus and I both have gold singles, so it's pretty cool. 

Q.   What about the historical aspect of this whole thing?   It was the most one‑sided final in Olympic tennis history.   You are the only person ever to win Golden Slams in both singles and doubles. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I know.   Hey, I did something nobody's done.   So I'm really excited about it. 
I haven't even had time to think about it.   I'm hungry.   I got a doubles match that I've got to get serious for.   We got to do this.   So, I don't know. 
It was so windy.   Of course it's not windy now, go figure.   It was so windy, you could see my hair.   I could barely see at times. 

Q.   What happened do you think between Paris first round and this?   What changed in your game?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   You know, I think it started before Paris.   I think it started in Charleston.   I started playing really well, really confident, talking to my dad about what I wanted to do. 
Sometimes you stumble.   In March I stumbled, but then I got back up and didn't quit.   I kept going.   I trained so hard, so hard in Paris.   You know, I came to Wimbledon, did well.   Went to Stanford and here. 
It was just all about doing well and not giving up today.

Q.   Talk about the dance. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I don't know.   I don't think I ever danced like that.   I don't even know where the dance came from.   It's just a dance we do in California, I'd say, West Coast.

Q.   Were you trying to win 6‑Love, 6‑Love?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   That would have been awesome only because against Maria, if you give her any hope, she's trying to come back.   Okay, Serena, try to stay focused because she's so good.   She won that one game, I could see her pumping her fists.   I was like, Oh, boy, here she comes.   It was important for me to go out there and do everything. 

Q.   What about the flag? 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   It was so windy.   At least the anthem was playing.   It was such a great moment.   You know, I'm happy. 

Q.   Didn't feel like an insult?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Oh, God, no.   It was amazing to just be up there for the USA and hold this.   I'm surprised, it was just so, so windy out there. 

Q.   Is this the best you played in a tournament from beginning to end?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Probably.   I was very consistent in this tournament from my first match to my last match.   Singles and doubles I've been pretty consistent, playing well. 
So, yeah, in a tournament, yeah. 

Q.   Do you have a name for the dance?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Actually, there is a name, but, I don't know, it's inappropriate. 

Q.   You have to tell us. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Oh, no (laughter). 

Q.   You used the word 'surprised.'   But how surprised were you with the way the match went?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I think I was just focused.   I don't think she did anything wrong.   I was blind today.   It was something about today and this tournament, I don't know.   I just played well. 
So I think she did well.   Uhm, you know, I played important points well.
