WTA:  Questions for Serena.  
 
 
Q.   Has your life changed after the US Open win?  Comment also on that. 
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  My life hasn't changed a lot at all.  I'm still practicing and working hard.  There's many more Slams for me to win, set records.  So if I want to do this, I have to continue to work hard and do my best.  As for the fine, I was so tired at the Fed Cup, I could barely walk.  I even have a cold now.  I still have a cold.  I don't think what the tournament director said  -- I think they were a little angry.  I feel really sorry that I couldn't play the tournament.  I mean, I was hoping to go there next year.  Who knows?  As for the fine, after winning the US Open, I can pay that (laughter).  
 
Q.  What has it been like to go through all the excitement of New  York, then the fun and success of team play in Palo Alto and here to Munich?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  It was pretty exciting for me.  It was horrible.  I had to go from the US Open to home.  There was a hurricane there.  It was just a horrible moment for all of us.  Then I went straight from there, the soonest flight out to California.  I had to practice, work with the team.  It was great.  It was a lot of fun.  I was excited when they announced it would be Venus and Lindsay playing the singles.  I was like, "Yes, I don't have to play."  I was pretty tired, pretty much out of it.  The team, I love playing Fed Cup.  It's a lot of fun.  I didn't realize it was going to be that much fun.  It's good. 
 
Q.  How many of the talk shows and things did you get asked to do, and how many were you able to do?  I understood you were being besieged by requests.
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  Really.  I was just asked to do basically all of them, like Today, Good Morning America.  I did some CNN thing, something else.  I really wish I could have done them all.  I love doing CNN.  I just did what I could do.  Like I said before, everyone wants a piece of me, and I don't blame them.  
 
Q.  Did you get to see Chelsea Clinton?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  No, I did not.  I was going to play Luxembourg.  I just didn't have time.  I was pretty disappointed because I was really looking forward to seeing her.  I was thinking that she might be more popular than me and I wouldn't have to sign so many autographs.  
 
Q.  About your match of today, what happens when you were 4-Love up in the first?  What do you think of the speed of the game here?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  Well, she was making a lot of errors.  It's not like I really won those first four games.  She was making a lot of errors.  Then she started playing a little better and I wasn't ready.  When I started playing better, I started thinking, concentrating more, I was able to do better.  I totally wasn't focused out there the first set.  Missing way too many shots.  My first serve, as usual, the percentage was down.  That's basically what went on. 
 
Q.  The speed of the game, the balls, the court?  Is it very fast?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  Oh, the court?  I wouldn't say it's so fast.  I think closer near the baseline, it's fast.  Middle area, service line, it's not that fast.  It's kind of weird actually.  I excel indoors, hard courts, yeah.  
 
Q.  Even if you say that your life didn't change that much, do you feel yourself now more as a star compared to before in a way?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah.  Actually I missed my flight coming over here.  I was thinking, "Hey, will they hold the plane for the US Open Champ?"  
 
Q.  What are your next plans after this? 
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  I play another tournament next week in Filderstadt.  I think I play the Chase after that. 
 
Q.  Who do you think is more popular, Chelsea or Serena Williams?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  I don't know.  I don't know.  That's a good question.  I don't know.  I couldn't tell you.  Probably her.  Probably her. 
 
Q.  Here in town is one of the world's great celebrations.  Your thoughts on Oktoberfest?  Are you going to go out and enjoy?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  If I do go out, I'll just enjoy the scenery, not so much the drinks and the beer, et cetera.  I've been to Germany three times.  Never been to the Oktoberfest.  I hear everyone say it's so exciting, fun, that I should go, rides, things like that.  I think maybe I'll go this year.  
 
Q.  Now you have a little time for your US Open victory sink in, what do you think about how quickly you've reached and won a Grand Slam in your career?  Two years ago, you were not really in the scene and now you're right at the top. 
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  It's definitely pretty quick.  You know, got to take your opportunity.  Life doesn't last long.  Before you know it, my career's going to be over.  I'll think, "Hey, if I could have done something a little quicker."  Now I don't have to think that way.  I actually went out there and did something about it.  You have to take your time as quick as you can, take it or leave it.  I took it.  
 
Q.  By the end of the week, you could have won $1.7 million over the past month or so.  At The Open, your sister said you might go out and celebrate with a credit card.  Have you begun doing that?  If not, what will be your first?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  What have I bought since The Open?  I'm doing really good.  I haven't bought anything.  I bought some furniture, so.  That's where my money is going, mainly to furniture.  I'm trying to keep it a little low other than that. 
 
Q.  Is that for your new house?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah.  
 
Q.  Sometimes people talk about your win at the US Open being a bit of a fluke.  Is this tournament a chance to dispel that, to prove that it wasn't a fluke? 
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  People are saying that?  
 
Q.  I've heard the word "fluke" used. 
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  When?  
 
Q.  I've been reading that. 
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  Really?  Everyone can see the players I beat, I actually have a record over them, beat them a lot.  No one ever said when other people won their first Grand Slam it was a fluke.  Apparently it's not a fluke, and it shouldn't be a fluke with me.  
 
Q.  Looking forward, do you think you're going to play your sister in the finals?  Did you talk about that yesterday at gambling night, that maybe you'll meet your sister in the finals?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  No.  Maybe it will be a fluke (laughter).
