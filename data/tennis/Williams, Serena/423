 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. How would you sum that up?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Um, I mean, I don't know, I think she played well. I made about a thousand and two unforced errors, so...  
 I mean, it's all right. It's better now than later, I guess.   
  
  Q. We have to ask you about the leg, the left knee.   
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I was struggling a little bit, but, you know, I hate to make any excuse. I think she definitely deserves all the credit for what she did.   
  
  Q. Is it just a ligament problem or strain? Is it an impact joint in general terms?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Definitely not ligament problems. Definitely not. Doesn't sound like very much fun.  
 I don't quite know. Just a little pain here, and the strapping usually helps the pain go away sometimes.   
  
  Q. How are you feeling going into next week now?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I feel great. I feel like I have more than enough matches under my belt. I feel like I'm really ready and fit.   
 I feel like I'm actually playing well. Even though I didn't play great today, I feel like I can play much better so face good.  
  
  Q. Has the injury of the leg caused any pain in the previous matches?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: No. You know, I had a long match the other day. It was good for me to have that long match and jump back and play today.   
 So I think I haven't played for two months on a competitive level, so I think it's good for my body to go through this now, especially since I'm in doubles as well as singles.  
 So, yeah, I think it's a great blessing in a way. It's like I played four matches and my body hasn't been used to it. Now we're ready and ready to go.   
  
  Q. That was my next question: Are you gonna play doubles in Melbourne, or would you still preserve the body for singles?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: No, I'm definitely playing doubles. I love -- I really love playing doubles, so...   
 I have way too much fun.
