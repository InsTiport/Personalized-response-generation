 S. WILLIAMS/C. Wozniacki
  6-4, 0-1 (ret.) 
  
  
  
  Q. Bit of a surprise sudden end to the match there.   
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah. She wasn't doing that great. I wasn't playing great. I think it's hard to play well against a player who's injured and is so nice. It was really a tough battle out there.   
  
  Q. You have your leg heavily strapped yourself. How is your body holding up?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I'm trying. I'm doing the best I can. That's all I can do. Win, lose or draw, I'm literally just giving everything I have.   
 I think I'm just gonna be wiped out by the end of this.   
  
  Q. She pushed you quite hard in the first set. You still happy with the way you were playing?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I think I could have played a lot better. I definitely played better all my other matches. So I think she did definitely do a good job. But I also made tons of errors.   
 You know, again, it's hard playing a player that you know is injured. It's like, Okay. Puts a little more pressure on you because you're supposed to win.   
  
  Q. So you feel you're going to have to play a bit better against your sister in the final tomorrow?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: If I want to win. If I don't, then I won't. And obviously I want to win. So I'm going to have to really, really improve my game.
