 S. WILLIAMS/C. Garcia
  6‑4, 4‑6, 6‑4 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Congrats.   Obviously she made you work for that one.   You have played her before.   Has she improved?   Why do you think she gave you trouble?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Well, she's obviously a really good player.   She plays well.   I really gave myself a tremendous amount of trouble out there.  
I think, granted she played great, but I made so many errors.   I hit so short.   It really isn't the same player.   I just have to do better.  
   
 Q.   I heard you say you thought your errors were unprofessional, which I think I have heard you use that term before.   How tough is it to learn how to win when obviously you're unsatisfied with your own play?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, it's important to stay positive.   Obviously I wasn't at my best.   I had 40‑ something errors.   It's not the way to play professional tennis.   Maybe amateur.   
On the professional tour you have to do a little better than that, so hopefully I can, in the next few matches, to do better.  
   
 Q.   What is it about her game?   She's given some other people trouble, too.   What is it that she does?   She doesn't look physically that imposing, but...   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   You know, she has a great serve.   She does everything well.  
Again, you know, I think she's a good player.   I also think I can test myself and say, Look, I can play a hundred times better than what I played before.   I'm capable of doing so much better.   I just have to get to that level.  
   
 Q.   Rafa and Novak said yesterday they would like to go to South America to play a big event there, a Masters event.   Do you agree with that?   Would you like to go down there to play a big event?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah.   There is not many opportunities in South America to play in South America, in general.   I think it would be great.   I have been there a couple of times and I have always had wonderful experiences.   I think it's missed, and I would love to do that.
