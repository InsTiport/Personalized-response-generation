  6‑2, 6‑1 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Serena.   
   
 Q.   How did you feel out there today?   Seemed the only thing that really bothered you was the sun on that one side.   Your serve was really amazing today?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, I felt okay out there.   The sun was intense, but it was okay.   Got through it.   
   
 Q.   You seemed to have your wardrobe mixed up.   Last night, sleeveless; today, one sleeve.   A little confused?   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No.   It was really hot and I didn't want‑‑ I always wear long sleeves, but that's why, because it's cool.   It has this cooling technology in the top, so it was pretty cool.   
   
 Q.   Just talk a little bit about the match and playing her.   Outside of that one game where she had the three break points on your serve, you didn't seem to give her an opportunity to get into the match.   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Both games like that are really important.   If she had won that game, would have been a tougher score or a different match.  
It was important for me to stay focused and win that game and fight for every point.  
Yeah, that one was tough, but I was just going for everything.   
   
 Q.   Were you surprised that your sister is playing now?   You seemed on court like it was a total shock to you.   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   You know, she's doing good.   She's playing.   The team discussed it a little bit, but that's Mary Joe's decision.   
Venus is a veteran and a great player.   I hope she does really well.   
   
 Q.   I know that in regular competition you don't use coaching.   This is a different kind of competition.   How do you feel when you have that kind of resource?   Is it good for you or you think that...  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   It feels good.   Mary Joe is there the whole time, so it's different than when you do call your coach on court.  
But like I say, I just take everything in.   I just try to be like a sponge and listen to what anyone has to say.   I'm trying.   
   
 Q.   I know you talked about this a little bit earlier in the week, but fresh off those two wins, talk about the extra satisfaction you get winning when that flag is on your chest there, playing and representing your country?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Well, it always feel good to play for your country and to win.   Today is another tough match for us, so we're all a little bit nervous.   
But it feels good to come out here, especially in the country.   
   
 Q.   If you look ahead a little bit, I know Paris is somewhat of a home for you ‑ or a second or third home ‑ and the French Open is a place where you have had success but not the same amount of success as you have at the other Grand Slams.   Talk about going towards that and your thoughts on this year's French.   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I'm not thinking about it yet.   I can't.   I thought about it so much last year, and I'm just like, Okay, I won Madrid last year, so hopefully I can do well and win Madrid again.   If not, at least win some matches.   
Then Rome.   That's all I can think about right now.  
   
 Q.   So Madrid will be your first?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, I'm playing Madrid first.  
   
 Q.   Just wonder if you had any trouble with your ankle?   You had a tape job early on.   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No, it was fine.   The court was really hot out there.   It's cooled down a lot, but it was really hot.   I wand to make sure thatI had ‑‑ my feet were really hot.   I just had to loosen up the tape.   That was it.  
   
 Q.   Chris Evert was here.   They were giving her an award because back then they didn't give the little Fed Cup, and she has quite a history.   Do you take notice when somebody of her stature is out there watching your match?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I didn't know she was here.   I'm glad I didn't.   I would have been like, Oh, am I playing good enough?   She's been so great for American tennis.   She's one of the best players to ever live.   I didn't know she was here.   
Thank you.
