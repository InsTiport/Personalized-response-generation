 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Welcome back to Toronto. I think this is your fourth match since your injuries. Is it getting a little easier each week?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Definitely way easier than my trip to London. So I feel such a big difference, and it's so much better.  
  
  Q. Is the new nutrition plan also helping? I understand you have a new nutrition plan.   
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Oh, I'm not on a nutrition plan. I should be, but I'm not.  
  
  Q. What's the biggest difference for you are you noticing?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I'm definitely calmer and making less mistakes. For me I'm just, I think, overall really -- not that I didn't enjoy it before, but, I mean, I really don't have anything to lose at all literally.  
 So it puts me in a wonderful position and such an easy position to be in.   
  
  Q. Can you just go through your match today and tell us, first of all, what you thought about your opponent?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Well, I thought she played really well and really smart. The conditions were extremely tough. I thought that she'd had to change up her game, and then I had to adjust to that.  
 It was just, you know, so much wind out there. So that was a little difficult, but, you know, we both were in the same circumstances, so that's why I tried to think of it. But she played really well.   
  
  Q. What was going your mind during the tiebreaker?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I thought, get up 6-0, and then if I screw it up, then I still have some chances to win.   
  
  Q. How big of an advantage is it where you hit the ball so hard to play in the wind like this?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: How about of an advantage is it...   
  
  Q. Where you hit the ball so hard you can cut through the wind where other players maybe can't?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: No, I think I had to hit softer today because it was so windy. I had to take pace off my ball, and, you know, because if you hit too hard, then -- you're not a tennis player? Yeah, I can tell.   
 The ball is going to totally fly the harder you hit. If you ever play in the wind, take some pace off it. You have to hit more spin.   
  
  Q. Do you have any thoughts on the format, the Toronto/Montreal format, men and women in the same week, any thoughts on it?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I have no thoughts on it, like I'm on the women's tour and I'm in Toronto, and I really like Toronto. I have fun in Montreal, too. I'm glad I'm here.   
  
  Q. Obviously there was some adversity in the second set today. What does that do for you going forward in this tournament?  
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I mean, it's good for me. I definitely want to get out there and close it out in two sets.  She played better in the second, and I think I made way more errors in the second set, but she also played a lot better.  
 So it was good for me to win that, and, you know, just get through it, because knowing that I didn't play my best and being able to win is better than playing good and losing, you know.
