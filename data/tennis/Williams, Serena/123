S. WILLIAMS/C. McHale
6-3, 5-7, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Good to be back?
SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, it's great to be back.
Q. What happened there up 5-3 and she won five games in a row.  Take us through that a little bit.
SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, she just started playing better and playing tennis that she's never played before.
I just made a few mistakes and then just had to pull myself back together.
Q. The transition from Indian Wells to Miami can to be difficult, especially when you make it through to the final.  Did that have any impact on today at all in terms of the feel of the ball and the conditions?  They're quite different.
SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, I can definitely feel there is a difference in the conditions than I feel like I was just playing.  But it's all right.  I'm back and going.
Q. Congratulations on your win.
SERENA WILLIAMS: Thanks.
Q. Your power game was a force to be reckoned with, but there were times you paralyzed her with your touch shots.  Was that taking advantage of the opportunity or you were working on that?
SERENA WILLIAMS: I don't remember those moments.  Thank you.  I guess I've been working on my touch.
Q. Is it sometimes tougher your first match of a tournament?  You have to get into it a little bit, get warmed up almost?
SERENA WILLIAMS: Not in this condition or this time because I been playing a lot.  I played all last week, so it wasn't tough at all.
Q. Anything more you could say about her game?  She said she was really nervous to play you and you were her idol growing up.
SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, she's an unbelievably sweet girl.  I've had the opportunity to play with her on Fed Cup, and we always have such a good time.
I think she did a really good job.  She can, should, and will be very proud of herself in this match.  I think it can also show her how good she is and what a good player she is.  She's a really good player.
Q. Did you underestimate McHale in the second set?  What was the biggest factor there?
SERENA WILLIAMS: No, because I know a lot about her game.  I don't underestimate anyone.
Q. How do you feel?  I see you a little bit low energy.  How you feel?
SERENA WILLIAMS: I'm great.  I really just don't want to be here.  So if we can wrap this up, that would be great.
Yeah, I'm great.  I feel like I've been doing press every day.  It's enough.  Okay, thank you.
