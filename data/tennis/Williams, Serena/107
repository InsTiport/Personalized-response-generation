G. MUGURUZA/S. Williams
7-5, 6-4
SERENA WILLIAMS: Questions?
Q. What did you think was the difference in the match?  It was really decided by just a few points, it seemed, from our point.
SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, I guess.  I haven't really had a lot of time to think about the difference.  I think she was -- I know in the -- she won the first set by one point.
I mean, that just goes to show you you really have to play the big points well, and I think she played the big points really well.
Q. Well, big disappointment, but do you think you played well?  I think you played today better than the past days.  I don't know if it's your feeling or not.  I understand when you lose it's difficult to appreciate.
SERENA WILLIAMS: Thank you.
I don't know.  I think -- I don't know.  It was just so many holes.  Like I could have served better.  I mean, I made a lot of errors on my return.  You know, I did definitely try out there today, but did I play better than the other matches?  It's a totally different game.
Like my other matches have been different types of players, you know, more or less.  You know, totally different style.  I think today was just, you know, another new style.  I don't know if it was better or what.  It's going in the right direction, I think.
Q. You applauded when you saw that the lob hit the line.  Was that one of the best match points that's been played against you?
SERENA WILLIAMS: I think so, yeah, for sure.  I thought that ball was going out.
Yeah, but it didn't.  It was a really intense match point.
Q. How much, if at all, was the adductor a problem for you out there on court?  Was there any physical issues out there for you today?
SERENA WILLIAMS: It was okay.  I'm not one to ever make excuses and say, like, Oh, my adductor was hurting or whatever.
I think at the end of the day I didn't play the game I needed to play to win and she did.
Adductor or not, she played to win.  You know, that's what she did.
Q. Schedule-wise do you feel the last few days were the most challenging for you ever in a Grand Slam?  Because you don't have time to fully recover physically.
SERENA WILLIAMS: Again, I'm not going to sit here and make excuses.  I have played -- I have played a lot of times four or five matches in a row, so, you know, it is what it is.  I don't think it's like something that I would say, Oh, that was the reason.
No, I just didn't do what I needed to do today.
Q. Muguruza, she's one player, younger player, who keeps challenging you.  Do you appreciate that kind of challenge, a new player coming up?
SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah.  I think, you know, I obviously always want to do the best and I want to play the best, and I kind of gear up for that.  I definitely feel that, you know, it was a great challenge.
Q. GarbiÃ±e is a person who hits a lot of aggressive balls.  Just in comparison to other players on tour, do you feel she's one of the players that's hitting one of the hardest balls?  Is that something that no one else is really doing against you on a consistent basis?
SERENA WILLIAMS: She's definitely hitting hard.  It just depends on who I play.  She just goes for broke on every shot and it works for her, so...
Yeah, I don't remember the rest.
Q. Looking at GarbiÃ±e from a different perspective, she's young, 22.  How would you assess her future?
SERENA WILLIAMS: Well, I think she has a bright future, obviously.  She knows how to play on the big stage and she knows how to -- clearly she knows how to win Grand Slams.
Q. Are you the type of person who can kind of let this match go quickly, or will you beat yourself up about it for a few days?
SERENA WILLIAMS: I don't really know right now.  I'm just -- obviously it's not something I'm like, Oh, it's over with.  It's definitely something I want to dissect and see what I can learn from that and what can I do to get better from it.
That's the only way to keep improving.
Q. You have had an incredible record in Grand Slam finals before this year and now you have lost these two.  Wondering if these moments feel different to you, the pressure, sort of stakes of 22 this year feels somehow different on court in these moments?
SERENA WILLIAMS: No.  You know, I ran up against two players that -- you know, I think in Australia, Ann Kerber made 16 errors in three sets, you know, so what do you do in that situation?  Today GarbiÃ±e played unbelievable.  The only thing I can do is just keep trying.
