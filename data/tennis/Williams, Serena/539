   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.   
  
  Q.  Very happy very saw on television.   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  Oh, really?   
  
  Q.  With your interview before.   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  I was playing around trying to stay warm.   
  
  Q.  You seem to be moving pretty well.   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah?  Good.  I don't think so.  I think I could move better.  But I'm moving better, and if I had to move more I would have moved more.   
  
  Q.  And you're sliding well.   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  It's easier to slide on European clay for me.  It's harder to slide on the Hard-Tru.  This is much easier.  I was struggling before but, the moment I got over here I just started sliding immediately.  Yeah.  It was good.   
  
  Q.  You got off it to a fairly slow start.  You seemed to be struggling to get the radar right in the early stages.   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah.  I kept missing and hitting balls out.  I wasn't doing what -- I was doing everything wrong basically.  I was just flat.   
  
  Q.  Would you have rather been playing in the day?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  I always prefer to play in the day because you have the rest of the day off, and the next day.   
 So now it's like I had to wait all day to play and then play at night, and then I only have tomorrow off, if I have tomorrow off.   
  
  Q.  Was there anything in particular that enabled you to turn it around so dramatically from that early loss?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah.  I felt like I wasn't playing my game at all.  I felt like I was just making a lot of errors and I was letting her dictate play, and that wasn't my game at all.   
 So I was out there not doing the way I practiced.  Second set I tried to do that a little bit more and it worked out better.   
  
  Q.  What about your opponent?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  I thought she played really well.  I think she has a great game, all-around game.  I thought she played really well and she's really young, so she has a great future.   
  
  Q.  Did you feel frustration after 4-2 and you cannot play your game?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah, I was a little bit frustrated, but I knew that I was going to stay calm no matter what.  And I knew if, I happened to lose the first set, there was no way I wouldn't be involved in a three-set match.   
 I knew I was going to stay out there all night if I had to, so I just had to relax.   
  
  Q.  It has been a good start for you.  Because sometimes you had a worse start other tournament, also here in Rome.   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah, I haven't played a while on clay.  It's a good start, and it wasn't a really easy match.  I got to run and she moved me a lot, so I came to the net.   
 It was a little bit of everything, so it was a good first-round match for me.   
  
  Q.  The tension that you had in first set, was that just routine or was there any problem to your thigh?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  Oh, with the trainer?   
  
  Q.  Yeah.   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  No.  I had to wrap my thigh and I wrapped it the other day and my other leg got sore from the rubbing, so I just had to get some Vaseline on it.  It wasn't injured or anything.   
  
  Q.  After a match like this, an hour, I mean do you go to eat?  You go to sleep.  I don't think you go to dance.  But do you eat later?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah.  I have to eat because I have to replace some carbs.  I'm not really hungry.  I'm just going to go to sleep after this.  That's it, like I said, my day has been boring.   
 I usually could have had the rest of the day, but -- watched some TV on my DVD.   
  
  Q.  And are you surprised about so many players retired here, this tournament, so many don't play?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  Oh, really?   
  
  Q.  Yeah.   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  I'm here.  I don't know who came out and who didn't.   
  
  Q.  You know you are here.   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  I know Martina a didn't play, but that's the only person I know that didn't play.  I think Maria was in it and she pulled out a long time ago though.  I keep up mainly with Serena Williams.  She's my No. 1 concern.  And Venus.  She is my No. 2, sometimes No. 1.
