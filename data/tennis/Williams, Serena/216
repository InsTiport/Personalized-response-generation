S. WILLIAMS/J. Jankovic
  6‑1, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Not a bad day at the office for you today.   Everything going the way it should be?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, definitely felt pretty good about today.   I felt better.   Was just getting consistent.   My unforced errors are lower than they've been this year, so it's definitely keep going towards the right way. 

Q.   Just a quick question about some the videos about your pre‑game and pre‑match warmups.   Explain what's going on there. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I don't know.   It's just really silly. 

Q.   Is it like cross fit or something?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   It's just Serena doing hand stands.   Yeah, that's it. 

Q.   Get you loose?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I guess I love hand stands.   I don't know. 

Q.   Jelena said she felt sluggish today and her game wasn't going right.   Did you notice a difference in her compared to other times you played her, that she wasn't quite on her game today?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, I don't think she played her best today and still she definitely fought well.   I was glad to have an opportunity to just get through that. 
I don't think she was at her best either. 

Q.   You used to tell the story about seeing Venus walk on her hands.   Wondering if you ever competed on your hands?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No, but we should.   We should definitely try that one.   I'll tell her. 

Q.   Tomorrow you could play either Caroline, rematch of a great match last week, or Aga.   Talk about those.   Are those different matchups to you?   We see them as defensive type players, but are they different?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, they are a little bit different.   Caroline I think might go for a little bit more at times, and Aga just never misses.
They're very similar but definitely different as well.   I think Aga hits a lot more flat and low.   She's fun to watch. 
So, yeah, either way I have to be ready to hit a lot of balls tomorrow and be ready for a tremendous amount of balls to come back.

Q.   Roger last night was saying he was pretty happy with the number of matches he's been playing, so he was going to go into tonight's match against Andy fairly relaxed and nothing to lose.   Do you feel that way?   You've played a lot of matches. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah.

Q.   Do you need more match play?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No, I feel really good.   I feel like I'm really relaxed now.   I felt like that even after Canada.   I felt like I was good, but obviously I wanted to come here.
Obviously I desperately want to win two more matches.   I don't want to stop here.   Definitely feel really good so far with my performance.

Q.   There was some focus at this tournament because it's the only Masters Djokovic hasn't won.   And you, too.   Is that a bucket list item for your career to win the Cincinnati title? 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I don't know.   I mean, it'll be nice.   It will be great.   Hopefully I'll do it.
We'll see.   No pressure.

Q.   Not something you're desperate for, I guess. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah.   I would love to win here.   Absolutely.   It would be great to win.   But at the same time, I don't want put that pressure on myself.
I'm just really trying to stay pressure‑free right now.

Q.   Have you been nominated for the ice bucket challenge?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I have, and I definitely want to do two.   I just have to get the right equipment.   (Laughter.)

Q.   Ice and a bucket? 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah.   I need that and some other props.   So I'm working on it.   Probably do it today. 

Q.   You've been so good on hard courts this year.   Talk about why you have been so dominate, especially today?   You said it was a grind.   Watching out there looked like you dominated start to finish. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I don't know.   I've been feeling really well on hard court this year.   I don't know, I'm just really happy about it.   At least I feel good on some surface this year.
I don't know really know.   I just feel comfortable. 

Q.   Do you feel better this week than last week at this stage?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, definitely.   I don't think I played great last week.   I was just fighting to be in the tournament.   I was mentally fighting really hard.
Definitely feel like I'm playing better this week. 

Q.   At the end of the match you gave a special shout out to some fans. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah.

Q.   Something that just kind of popped up today, or have they been following you?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No.   These guys were so amazing back there.   This one guy in particular just kept grinding and telling me what a great job I was doing.   He was so positive.   I was like, I love this.   So it felt really, really good, and he definitely deserved to know.

Q.   You going to bring him around for the rest of the tournament?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I told him he should come.   I should start traveling with this guy.   He was awesome.

Q.   NBA fans can wear like a LeBron jersey.   There is no real like Serena jersey for a fan to wear. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   True.   Nike and I have to get together and make a Serena jersey.   We should definitely do that.

Q.   Do you think in general tennis players should be branded more like team sport athletes are where you could wear your stuff, men or women could wear it, not just a guy in your dress or something?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, no, I guess so.   That would be fun.   It would be interesting and get a lot more people watching and involved, too.
Yeah, it's a good idea.
