S. WILLIAMS/E. Dementieva
  6-2, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Serena, please. 

 Q. You played three days in a row. Now you have a day off. Are you happy with this timing?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah. I feel like, you know, the first day was tough and the second day was tough and today was even tougher, but I was able to stay fit. You know, I've been working hard. I was playing probably the most fit girl on tour. 

 Q. You have good news every day. Yesterday you became the No. 1. Today you are the first one qualifying for the semis. Tomorrow you have more news?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Well, yeah, just having a day off will be good. Just try to relax and get through it, yeah. 

 Q. It looked like a pretty comfortable win, even though the second set was fairly close. Did it feel that way to you, as well?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Well, it was definitely a match where you have to be really focused for, because she's a really good player. You know, like I said, she's one of those late bloomers where every year goes on in her career, she tends to get better and better and better. 
 So every match I have to play better. 

 Q. You seemed to struggle the last two years. Have you brought a different mindset to the round robin stage this year? How do you explain how well you've played this year?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Well, yeah, I haven't done really well here traditionally at this tournament, especially the last couple years. I was kind of used to the elimination thing: if you lose, you're out. But I was just trying to do better than I did last year really basically and compete in all my matches, which sometimes it's very hard, as we can see, people have to pull out. At the end of the year, it's tough. You give so much every day. When it comes to the end of the year, it's a little hard.

 Q. You needed to win today to keep Venus alive in the tournament. Did you want to win for her sake as well?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I had no idea about that. But I really hope that she's able to win. I'll go out and cheer her on now. 

 Q. Do you think you will be ready for the doubles?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I definitely will be ready. That's my next goal, is to just play really tough in the doubles. I really want to do well in doubles. 

 Q. Do you think it's not too much for your sister and you to play so much?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Well, we're definitely playing a lot. We're really fit. We're ready. We knew what we were doing before the tournament started. So we knew what we had to do. Here we are. 

 Q. You're not at your best in Beijing. These three games you played so great. What have you done in these days?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Well, I went home. I think in Beijing I didn't play great, but I was doing the right things. Sometimes if you do the right things, it might not show up that day, but eventually it will show up. 
 That's how I feel. I feel like I didn't do my best, but I really tried. I tried to work on doing the right thing.
