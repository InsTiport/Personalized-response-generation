VERONIQUE MARCHAL:  Questions for Serena.


Q.  Serena, in your opinion was there a need for her to call the trainer at that point in the match?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  No. I think she was very nervous so she called the trainer to get some time, get some coaching, I'm not sure what she did.


Q.  What makes you say that?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  If you watch her matches, there's a pattern in that.


Q.  How did you feel that she got coaching?  She was only sitting with the trainer?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I didn't say she got coaching.  I said she could have.  Everybody probably gets coaching out there.  I don't really know.  Really doesn't matter to me.


Q.  What was going through your mind while you were waiting for her to get worked on?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I was just -- I don't know.  I was just concentrating, trying to concentrate on what I was  going to do.


Q.  And then what happened when you went back on the court?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Well, I don't know.  Maybe I think I tried too hard.  Missed a couple of shots yeah, that's it.


Q.  Did you lose that final lob in the sun or the wind, Serena?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I was going to let it drop.  I couldn't make up my mind, so I don't know.


Q.  Were you unsure of how much of a bounce you would get if you let it drop?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah.  I decided maybe I should take it out of the air.  By the time I made my decision, it was a little too late.


Q.  Were you encouraged by how much support you got from the crowd?  Is that important to you?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  You're the guy that asked me that one question, aren't you?


Q.  About the crowd?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  No, about something else.  I wasn't surprised at all because this is my home. Yeah, so I wasn't surprised, no.


Q.  How pleased were you with your effort today?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I think I feel I could have done  better.  I don't think I played so well.  I think I could have made a lot more of my shots, especially in the first set.  But I guess I should be satisfied, but I don't know.


Q.  Were you pleased that you were able to rally with her?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  A lot of people think that black people can't rally, just think they're athletes and they can't think.  As you can see, that's not true.  I can rally, Venus can rally.  A lot of people out there that can rally.  What was the question?


Q.  I really meant you're playing the world's No. 1 player.  I wasn't talking about the color.  I thought that you rallied very well with her.  You kept right up with her.

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah.  I think I could have rallied a little better.  I was missing a lot of shots that I should have missed, so, I'll go home and work on that.


Q.  Serena, can you talk about what happened on those match points?  What was going through your mind?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I don't want to talk about that. Maybe I'm just like Pete.  Maybe one day I'll be No. 1, too.  He lost two match points yesterday also. 


Q.  Were you nervous at that point?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I said I don't want to talk about that.


Q.  Pete did speak about it.

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Well, he's different.


Q.  Does the Williams family have any personal feelings about Martina Hingis?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yes.  I have personal feelings about Martina Hingis.  I think she's a very nice person. Every time she is in the locker room, she makes the effort to say hi.  I really appreciate that.  So that's my personal feelings towards Martina Hingis.  Other than, that I feel she's a great player.  She was able to pull out a tight match like today.  Other than that, I think she always tries to be nice.  She's a nice person.


Q.  But you didn't think it was nice for her to call for a trainer?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I don't know.  If I was tired, I probably would have called for a trainer, too.  She just wanted to stay in the match.  I really don't blame her, because I would have wanted to stay in, too.
