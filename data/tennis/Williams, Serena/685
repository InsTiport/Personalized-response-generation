MODERATOR:  First question, please. 


Q.  Match today seemed to go okay. 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  You say it seemed to go okay? 

Q.  Yes.  You don't seem to be having real problems here at all. 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I don't think I played very well at all today.  I couldn't get my feet moving.  I thought I made a lot of errors.  I haven't seen the stats on how many unforced errors I made.  I lost serve twice, which was really upsetting.  My goal is usually not to lose serve, so...

Q.  You've often spoken about being a student of history, not necessarily tennis history, but world history.  In terms of tennis history, Jennifer Capriati has made this incredible comeback.  She's more than halfway to the Grand Slam.  What for you has been most impressive about the way she's turned her life and her career around, as you've observed it?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Well, the most impressive I would say has been just to regain focus, you know, because  -- I guess, I don't know, I wasn't on the tour at the time, but I assume she was having some tough times.  It can be tough at times.  Maybe I think the fact that she was able to regain her focus and regain her tempo and everything was great. 

Q.  How do the players, such as yourself, not necessarily your opponents, feel about what she's done?  Has she sort of, in addition to being the fans' choice, kind of players' choice, because of all she's been through to come back this way?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Well, I don't know really.  I know  -- you know, I don't know.  I really wasn't paying attention to the question.  Sorry (laughter).  I don't focus well. 

Q.  Does she have players on the tour kind of rooting for her to do well because of all she's been through? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I would imagine so.  I would imagine so.  I definitely was rooting for her in the Australian and stuff.  I definitely would think so, yeah. 

Q.  When you met her last time, what was most difficult about her game?  What sort of level is she at right now?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Well, she's definitely playing a good level game.  She's definitely doing her best.  When I met her last time, she played a great match, yeah. 

Q.  If you weren't happy with how you played today, what will you try and change before the next match?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Well, I got a little nervous with running out there because it was slick and I fell.  I kept slipping a few times.  Maybe I should try to be on my toes a little bit more.  I will just try to  -- I didn't hit as many winners on my forehand and my backhand the way I usually have done in my other match.  That's what I'll just work on, hitting the shots the way I've been practising. 

Q.  Did you tweak your knee a little bit?  Were you afraid that maybe did you when you slipped out there once?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah, I did, because I kind of  -- my left leg went under my right.  It was just really weird.  I was like, "Whoa!"

Q.  You don't feel anything now?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  No, not now. 

Q.  It was written recently that you and Venus have a kind of authority like no one else.  If you were guys, we would all be cheering your competitiveness and your intensity.  But since you're women, you're called catty or some have said that you lack humility.  Do you think there's kind of a double standard or whatever?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  In all honesty, I think so.  I think Venus and I, I don't see where we don't lack humility.  I'm a very friendly person, I'm a very nice person on and off the court.  People when they beat me, I tell them, "Good match and good luck."  There's no need to be bitter.  Tennis, there's a next year, a next week.  Basketball, I can understand there's a difference.  You don't have a chance till the whole next year.  You know, tennis you get every week.  I don't know.  I know with the way we've been doing, our wins, who knows.  I know Tiger Woods wins a lot.  Maybe we don't win as much as Tiger Woods.  We need to start to.  I don't know if they call him cocky or not.  I'm not sure because I don't  -- I really don't follow sports, believe it or not, outside of tennis. 

Q.  How do you think you've changed and matured in the last two or three years since you came on tour?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I think mostly I've matured mentally.  I used to have a lot of problems.  I used to get down on myself a lot.  Now, after watching Venus a lot, I just try to keep the same look on my face, no matter what happens.  I think most of all, especially in the past year, I've done a lot better with that.

Q.  What about growing up from being 17, 18, how have you changed now as a person?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I guess as a person  --.

Q.  Feel like a grown-up?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Sometimes (laughter).

Q.  Venus said yesterday - I'm sorry to bring this up - she says you still have a bunch of growing up to do.  Did you hear that?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  No, I didn't.  I would imagine that I do.  I'm only 19.  I know that I can definitely  -- there's always room for improvement, always.  I'm ready to grow a little more, for sure, for sure. 

Q.  Venus also said she was very proud of you.  When you play, how much of you is thinking of your family name?  How much do you draw on that for inspiration during a match?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  None.  I don't think about that on the court.  I leave all that off.  When I go out there, I think about the opponent that I play, doing the best I can to win that match. 

Q.  I've been waiting all week to ask you a crazy question.  Your previous answer sort of tied in.  If you had to go to dinner with any one of the following five people, who would it be:  kobe, Shaquille O'Neal  --?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Sorry, no facial expressions (laughter). 

Q.  Kobe, Shaq, Tiger, Bush or Clinton? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Well, I would have  -- I would say Clinton.  I would say Clinton, for sure.

Q.  Why?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Truth being, I'm not a Laker fan.  Miami Heat, Toronto Raptors.  I'm not a fan of the Lakers.  I like Kobe, though.  He's a nice guy.  I'm just not a fan of the Lakers.  As for Tiger, I don't know.  I mean, he's a great guy, great personality.  If I have a chance, I would definitely pick Clinton if I was brought that opportunity, for sure.

Q.  And George W? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Well, he has brought the taxes down, so I do like that.  Hopefully he can keep doing it.  I don't know much about him yet.  He just got into office.  I myself was always a democrat.  But I don't get involved in politics.  Now that he's brought the taxes down a bit...  I'd just choose Clinton out of all of them.
