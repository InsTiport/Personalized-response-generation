   THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. You were pretty tired when you came in here yesterday. Today you seem a little more refreshed and happier. Talk about your feelings now going into tomorrow. 
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, I'm definitely more upbeat. Yesterday I wasn't really upbeat. But, um, it always feels good to be that I'm gonna go home with at least one title, so... 
 I really just get up for doubles. It makes me happy. 

 Q. So you had a bandage on your wrist today. You trying to do the whole body?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I fell the other day a couple times in my match, so, yeah, I'm just adding to the list.

 Q. You almost run out of tape at this point?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Oh, we have. (Laughing.) We've run out of tape and been borrowing tape from everyone. It's quite hilarious, though. I just keep laughing and like, Okay, I need to sit around a certain amount of time to get taped.

 Q. Justine says this is gonna a be really mental battle. You've both been there, done that. Do you agree with that?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Absolutely. I think that's a really good point. It definitely will be mental and who wants it more and wants the title more and who' willing to go the extra step. 
 I think we both want it, you know. But we'll just see who's playing better tomorrow.

 Q. How hungry are you?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: I'm literally hungry right now. I definitely feel like I am hungry. I have a chance to tie Billie, Billie Jean, which would be great. But at the end of the day I don't really think about that, because I'm okay with where I'm at, too.

 Q. Now that the doubles is done and dusted, how will you focus on tomorrow and the lead-up? How will you approach it?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Well, I'm a little bit bummed out that the doubles is over. At least I won't have a match on Sunday, because I've played every day. It's been pretty intense. 
 So I'm looking forward to having that day off and just relaxing. I'm getting geared up. I feel like I have one more match to go and that's it, I'm done, the tournament is over, and I'm off to something new.

 Q. Did you feel you're peaking at the right time, that the tournament has gone the way you wanted it to?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, I'm still here, and I feel like I really, really peaked against Sam Stosur, which was -- I played amazing. Hopefully I'll be able to pull that tennis out again.

 Q. Do you and Billie Jean kid each other at all about the record? 
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Oh, no, not at all. We don't even talk about that. We talk about Team Tennis, we talk about, you know, just so many different things. I've never brought up the record with her. 
 Because for me, it's not that huge of a deal. I mean, it'll be cool, but, you know, at the end of the day, I'm just happy and blessed to still be in the tournament and to still be, you know, physically able to play tennis altogether.
 So that's all I think about.

 Q. Would you consider this a defining match for you? 
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Um, I haven't thought about that at all. I think if you -- just thinking about it now, I think it'll be a defining match for both of us. 
 For me, I feel like I have no pressure. You know, I'm still here and I'm still alive, and that's anything less of a miracle. So I feel good. 

 Q. Is there something to be said for playing your great rivals in Grand Slam finals?
 SERENA WILLIAMS: Um, absolutely. I think it'll be fun. I think that just says it all.
