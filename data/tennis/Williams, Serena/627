THE MODERATOR:  First question for Serena, please.  
 
 
Q.  Well, Serena, what went wrong at the end? 
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  I don't know, everything.  I think I was making too many errors and, you know, I was really struggling with my serve throughout the match.  Yeah... I think that sums it up pretty much.  It's hard to win with a second serve.  
 
Q.  Were you a little bit tired at 3-all in the third? 
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  No, I wasn't tired at all.  I'm still not tired.  I never get tired.  
 
Q.  You never lost to her before.  Were you surprised she could stay with you at that distance, well over two hours?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  No.  We've played a lot of tough, long matches.  No, I wasn't surprised.  I just...  No, I wasn't surprised.  
 
Q.  What did she do to make your life difficult?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  I don't think it was one particular thing that she did.  I still believe when I lose, it's pretty much the way I played.  Like if I had continued playing the way I did in the first set, then maybe I would have won.  I think I made too many errors.  I think I didn't get any first serves in.  I think I didn't do a lot of stuff that I could have done a little bit better.  
 
Q.  It seemed so easy in the first set for you.  Did you lose your concentration afterwards? 
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  No, I didn't lose my concentration.  I can't say I did, no.  
 
Q.  What does it mean, this loss, looking to Paris? 
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  Well, I don't know.  It's better to lose here than at Roland Garros right now at this point, so nothing.  I just wanted to work on some things next week, and I'm glad I was able to play here.  Nothing.  I'm just looking forward to playing in Roland Garros.  
 
Q.  What specifically, your serve?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  Just everything.  Not just serves, returns, volleys, ground strokes.  
 
Q.  Everything?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  Overheads.  
 
Q.  Clay? 
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  (Smiling).  
 
Q.  Is it real disappointing, such a loss?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  It's always disappointing when I lose.  I love winning  - I hate to lose, I should say.  I don't love winning, I just hate to lose.  So, yeah, it's always disappointing, but it's not the end of the world.  
 
Q.  The last two games, up until 4-3 in the third set, it was very, very close, each game of the third set.  The last two games it seemed like it was too easy for Amelie to win these two games.  It seemed your first serve was very, very slow compared to all the rest of the game.  What happened in these two last games? 
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  Maybe she picked up the level of her game, I think.  I just tried to take some pace off my first serve to try to at least get one in before the match was over (smiling).  
 
Q.  Are you going to Paris right away?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  I'll be going to Paris soon enough, soon enough.  
 
Q.  You don't lose very often.  Does it make it harder when it does happen?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  No, it doesn't.  I don't know, maybe it does.  I don't know...  
 
Q.  Maybe more of a surprise, a shock? 
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  No, I always expect to go in and do well, but I never like say who I'm going to play in the final.  I always take it one match at a time.  
 
Q.  Is it easier to play a tournament with your sister playing? 
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  No.  I think we pretty much jumped that hurdle years ago. 
 
Q.  Is it psychological? 
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  I don't understand. 
 
Q.  Psychologically, it's easier to play without Venus?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS:  Venus, no.  We usually never play the same tournaments, so we're never at the same events.  So, no, it's not easier.
