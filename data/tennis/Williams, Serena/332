THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Could you sense how tired she was from pretty early on?   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Not early on, but definitely I probably had an idea that she was tired.   
   
 Q.   What did you say to her after the match?   You had a nice‑looking exchange.   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Just told her it was awesome that she played so well and played through another match after playing a good eight hours.   
It was really inspiring for me.   
   
 Q.   There is something special between you and the fans here.   What would you like to say about this?   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   It's a good feeling to have so many fans here in Turkey.   I love the support and I love how everyone is so awesome and nice and completely loud and into the game.   
   
 Q.   Do you have any sort of preference at all for who you play in the final?   Obviously you've done well against both so I'm assuming no.   But do you?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No, doesn't really matter.   I think I whoever I play is a going to be playing unbelievable and playing really well.  
   
 Q.   I've noticed that you've hardly grunted at all this whole tournament.   Sometimes you can a lot in matches, but I don't think you have once here, if at all.   Is there something different in how you're feeling on court that changes that, something you notice?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No, not at all.   I think I grunted in my first couple rounds, but not as much.   Kind of depends on how I feel.  
I don't think about grunting or not grunting.   Really when I grunt a lot it takes a lot of the energy and breath out of me, so one reason I don't like to do it as much.  
   
 Q.   So it's a sign that you're more comfortable that you're not doing it now, do you think?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No, because I still start grunting a little bit sometimes if it's more intense, or sometimes if I hit a ball really hard then I get a louder grunt.  
Yeah.
