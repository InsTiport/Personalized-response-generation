S. WILLIAMS/L. Safarova
  6‑3, 6‑7, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English. 

Q.   Tell us how difficult it has been, the struggles on court, coming back, having been ill couple days, crisis today second set.   How special does it make the trophy?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   It makes this trophy really special.   I really wanted it.   I wanted to win so bad. 
I just felt like, you know, I had every opportunity in this match.   You know, being down from second, third, fourth round, you know, it wasn't very easy, so this is definitely probably one of my ‑‑I probably topped for my most difficult time to win, but also makes me feel good that I was able to be fit and be able to win the event. 
I can't believe I won, but it's cool.

Q.   Talk about the second set; how were you feeling?   Was it nerves?   Something else?   How did you bounce back from that and be so strong in the third?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   It was interesting, because usually I get really nervous.   Last time I won here I was so nervous.
That time I wasn't that nervous.   I got a little tight, but I wasn't super nervous.   Then she started playing some good shots and I hit a lot of double faults.   Then my first serve abandoned me.
Once she saw that I got a little tight she started playing really a lot better, started playing like the player that got her to the final.   That's why it was a tough match for me today.
Yeah, I was really a little ‑‑because I felt bad at that point.   I felt, gosh, if I lose this match I'm going to try not to be too upset about it and look at the positives, that I'm even in the final.
Yeah, I was just kind of trying to think about it that way. 

Q.   What does it mean to you to win this Grand Slam No. 20? 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I haven't really had a lot of time to take it in.   I'm excited.   I'm still kind of celebrating No. 19.   (Smiling.)   So here I am at 20. 
It really‑‑ like I said, it seems a little bit like a dream.   Like, is this really my life?   Is this really happening right now?   So, yeah, it's really kind of weird.

Q.   You're halfway on the Grand Slam.   Everyone will start talking about it. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Three quarters of the way to a Serena slam.   (Laughter.)
Q.Do you really expect a little bit like that?   I know that you're going to say, Oh, step by step; I just won Paris; Wimbledon is a long way; US Open, who knows?   But can you try to be really honest with us in this moment‑‑
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah.

Q.   ‑‑ and tell us what you really think.   Because, you know, you won 20 slams.   Every time you say is special.   It is special.   Would be more special if you make a Grand Slam. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I don't know if it will be more special if I make a Grand Slam.   That's like saying, you know ‑‑I don't know.   I don't think that it makes it more special. 
I think it will be awesome, but at the end of the day it's going to be ‑‑it's pretty awesome to have 20.   Obviously I would love to win a Grand Slam.
I haven't done great at Wimbledon the past two years, so I'm going to take it a day at a time there.   My goal is just to do better the last couple of years, do one more and one more and one more.
That's the one I have been struggling at, so hopefully I will be able to play a little better there.   I mean, it's perfect for my game, so now that my arm is better I'm hoping to get better there.

Q.   Can you just give us an idea of what your last 48 hours kind of have looked like since we haven't talked to you?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Oh, it's been a nightmare 48 hours.   I think I played a match, right?   Okay. 
So, yeah, so after that I kind of just was in the locker room just laying down after the match, after my semifinal.   I don't even think I made it to press because I was just so out of it. 
I barely made it home.   Took a hot shower.   I went to bed, and then I didn't leave bed until like 4:00 or 5:00 yesterday.
I was just thinking, I have to go for a walk.   I've just got to go for a walk.   This house is making me sick.   I have to get out.   I have to get some air.   Went for a walk.   Came back.   Got worse.
Yeah, so I just took some more ‑‑talked to all the doctors here and the physios here.   I even told the physio, I'm not sure I'm going to be able to play, you know, because this is just not looking good.   I actually was really bad last night.
And then they helped me out.   I hit a little bit today in the morning and I hit them pretty well.   I was just like, Okay, I have been playing for over 30 years.   I know I can at least play tennis.   After that, I just went out to play a match.

Q.   Regarding this condition and this flu, is it the most difficult Grand Slam you have ever won?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, for sure, only because ‑‑you know, usually you get sick or have a common cold.   When you have the flu your whole body aches.   That's kind of what I have been dealing with.
Like even now I just really don't have any energy and I just want to go to bed.   (Smiling.)   But, yeah, it has nothing to do with why I lost those first sets in the beginning of the week.   I think that was just poor starting and not playing the way Serena Williams should play. 
But, yeah, I won US Open once ‑‑I think I went four three‑sets in a row.   Now I'm up to five.   I tried to beat my record, I guess.   (Laughter.)
Q.I was getting comments from people watching on TV about some language you were using in the third set.   Wondering how important that was to get your anger out.   Seemed to be happening quite a bit. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I got so frustrated.   I was just so angry at myself.   I pretty much gave the match away.   I think she played really well.   But at the same time, I gave it to her.   I started hitting double faults.   I was really frustrated with myself.
I just had to like try to pull it together.
