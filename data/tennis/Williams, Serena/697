THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.  
 

Q.  How did you feel about that match?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS: That one was okay.  Not too excited about it.  
 

Q.  You just weren't  --?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS: Not too pleased about that match. 
 

Q.  Weren't really in a groove in the first set?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, I wasn't  -- I don't think I was in the groove in the first set.  I didn't get the hang of her game.  I made uh, way too many errors.  It's kind of scary, the way I played. 
 

Q.  You talked about the last opponent's unorthodox style of play.  Is that the same kind of thing?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, I think these new people that are playing are hitting a lot more spin and trying to get the balls out of my strike zone, et cetera. I'm getting used to it, but it's getting a little better. 
 

Q.  Is it good to have matches like this so early?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, it is actually, it's good.  Usually when I play a tough match, I'm much more ready to go in the next round.  So I feel that I'm definitely a lot more ready because I had too easy of a match the other night.  
 

Q.  When is your water coming out?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS: Oh, it's coming out pretty soon.  You can talk to my dad more about that, yeah.  He's the main guy behind it.  
 

Q.  Water?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah.  Talk with my dad about that.  (Laughter.) 
 

Q.  Are you going to watch your sister play?
 
SERENA WILLIAMS: Oh, yeah.  Great.  Perfect.  Thanks.
