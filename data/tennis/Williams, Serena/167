THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
   
 Q.   Obviously we're writing and talking about the Grand Slam.   I know it's several matches down the road.   Do you just play the old line about one at a time?   Way back in your mind are you thinking about that at all?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Obviously it's on my mind, but I would have to win in a really tough draw here, and I would have to win the Open.   That's not really easy.   
You know, obviously it's something I want to do.   But at the end of the day, there's a reason it's rarely done.   
   
 Q.   What sort of connection do you have with Jordan now who is halfway through to the golf Grand Slam and what chance have you had to see him go about it?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I don't really follow golf, but I just started following the U.S. Open.   When I saw he won that one, I was like, Whew, good for you.   
Yeah, I'm always rooting for people to do well and create history and do something different.   So it will be cool to see if he can do that.   
   
 Q.   You now play Heather Watson, British No.1.   Do you know her at all?   What do you know about her game?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I don't know her at all.   I see her around the locker room a little bit.   She's always smiling, so she seems to be super sweet.   
I know Venus has played her before.   I've watched that match a few times.   I feel like she does really well on grass.   Like she played well in Eastbourne a couple times.   She's doing well on grass.   Had a really good win today.   
So, yeah, I know it's not going to be easy for me.   She has nothing to lose.   She's going forward.   
   
 Q.   What went into the decision to withdraw from the doubles and how tough a decision was that for you?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, it wasn't a really easy decision.   But I think ultimately it was probably the right one for this year.  
   
 Q.   What went into making that decision?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   There was a lot of factors.   Just making sure I'm 100% healthy for singles, focusing on that.   
   
 Q.   Bethanie Mattek‑Sands upset Ana Ivanovic today.   She's over the 30‑year mark.   What have you admired about her, someone who has come back and hung around is making another run at it?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, well, she has a great game for grass, just in general she has a great serve, wonderful doubles player.   You know, and she has a great, positive attitude and outlook on everything.   Whenever you see her, she's always happy to see you.   
I'm really happy for her.   I just feel like it's good to see her doing well.   I'm not surprised.   I wasn't surprised when I saw that score at all because I know her ability to play well.   
   
 Q.   What has been going through your mind as you've been watching Venus play so well at this time?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, she's been playing really well.   Obviously I'm really happy for her.   I always want to see her do great.   
But she poses a big threat for me, so just trying to stay focused.   
   
 Q.   Did you watch any of her match after you came off court today?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, I watched a little bit of her match.   
   
 Q.   What do you do or what are you thinking as you're watching her play?   Is it just rooting for her?   Are you shouting at the TV?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No, I've done that before (smiling).   
But, yeah, I always root for Venus.   She's been through a lot in her career.   She's really playing well this year.   She's had some wonderful wins and had some good results.   
Yeah, always rooting for her.   
   
 Q.   What was Venus' reaction when you decided to withdraw from the doubles?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   She's always supportive.   She's always super supportive.   Whatever I need, whatever, she's like, Whatever's best for you.  
   
 Q.   How much do you think home advantage will help Heather in the next round?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I think it will be a huge advantage for her.   It's going to be a great big match for us both.   I think the experience of playing for me, I've been used to playing against a lot of local people, doesn't matter what country it's in, hopefully that will help me a little bit.   
The home court will probably help her a little bit.   
   
 Q.   Have you been practicing any of your dance routines at home here in Wimbledon?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   No, no.   We've moved on to new choreography, but we haven't been practicing.  
   
 Q.   What kind?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I haven't done it yet.   I haven't even gotten the latest music, so a little behind.   
   
 Q.   You have won so many titles already.   When you're playing out there on the grass, is that special for you, being here at Wimbledon?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   It's always really super special to be at Wimbledon no matter what time or what day or what year it is.   To be here playing at this Grand Slam is one of a kind.   
We good here?
