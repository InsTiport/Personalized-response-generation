THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Serena, please. 


Q.  What did you think about your performance tonight? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Well, I don't think I played as well as I could have played today, so I'm not very satisfied right now at all. 

Q.  Any particular reason for that? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Hmm... No.  I mean, I had opportunities to close out the match earlier and I think the score line could have been a little different. 

Q.  Does this mean something for tomorrow's match, or you will forget it? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Oh, no, I've already moved on.  Looking forward to my next match. 

Q.  I don't know if you heard that Martina Navratilova got a wildcard for Roland Garros.  Would you like to be able to play her there? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I think that's great for her.  She's 46, -7, and that's amazing.  That's really amazing. 

Q.  Capriati said previously that she feels that the wildcard was taken away from a younger player.  Do you feel the same or...? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  No, I just said how I felt.  I think it's great for her.  If I could be even thinking about playing tennis at that age, it would just be unbelievable for me. 

Q.  You are said to be part of the concert which will take place in the future.  Is it true?  Do you know the other people who will take part in it?

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah, I'm good friends with Mr.  Jones from just being around LA.  It's for a great cause.  It's for "We are the People."  I'm excited to have the opportunity to be there. 

Q.  Do you like this type of tennis that you're playing now considering Roland Garros, how close it is? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  I'm close.  I could get better. 

Q.  Was there any level of improvement between Tuesday and today? 

SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yes, there was definitely a level of improvement.  I think each round I'm getting better, so I'm looking forward to my next round.
