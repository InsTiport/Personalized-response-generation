   THE MODERATOR:  Questions,  please.   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  Keep it short, please.   
  
  Q.  I just would like to know what Venus said to you through the first set?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  Oh, what she said to me, I'm unwilling to share.   
  
  Q.  Yes?  What do you think of the on-court coaching?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  I'm not a fan of it.  I hate it, but I may as well utilize it.  I think it takes away from the integrity of tennis.   
  
  Q.  What about playing so late?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  I played night matches before.  I think more or less the rain delay was -- it was just a long rain delay.  But it didn't really bother me too much.   
  
  Q.  What did you do during this time?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  I just sat down, and I got on the computer, and I sat down, and I ate something, and I sat down.  That was about it.   
  
  Q.  Roger Federer is playing now.  I know you are a big fan.  What is the most impressive part of his game and attitude to you?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  Well, he has a very good game, and he looks at the ball, and I think that's most impressive.   
  
  Q.  What about his attitude on the court, and outside?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  I think he has a very confident attitude.  Very confident.   
  
  Q.  Is it kind of more for you, I know you watched him during the final during the Australian Open.   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  I think I have a very confident attitude as well.  I think Roger's a great player.   
 Obviously he's a great player, and I like to think we have a lot in common.   
  
  Q.  But with you, was it good stuff for your tournament?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  It was decent.  I'm already looking forward to the next match.  Or have to go on to the next match.   
  
  Q.  What were the conditions out there like?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  It was weird.  It was windy, then it wasn't windy, and then it was like side wind.  It was weird.  Then at some points there wasn't any wind at all.  It was very strange conditions, as it always is here in Key Biscayne, and it was very humid.  So it was very strange.   
  
  Q.  How does it feel just to be back on the court after a few weeks?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  It feels good.  You know, I'm so ready.  I've been training every day.  And I'm tired of it.  It gets a little bit redundant and tiring.  And it's often very good to come back here and play tournaments.  It's the easiest part of tennis is playing the tournaments for me.   
  
  Q.  Kristin Davis was here today, do you know her?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  Yes, we're good friends.  She's a great lady.   
  
  Q.  And she loves tennis?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  She's loving it more and more.  We're trying to get her to come to more matches.   
  
  Q.  Did you play with her?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  I've never played with her, but she's been to a couple of tournaments.  She's been to the French Open before.  So I was excited to see that she was here.   
  
  Q.  Are you a fan of hers?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  Of course, of course, big fan.   
  
  Q.  Is there more buzz around the tournament this year?   
 SERENA WILLIAMS:  No.  Not at all.  But then again, I don't read anything, so I'm kind of blind to everything but the pictures.  Thank you.
