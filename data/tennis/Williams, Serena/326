S. WILLIAMS/V. Azarenka
  6‑4, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   She's a very good player, but you just seem to have her number and win the big points when you need to.   Talk a little bit about the match and coming back in the second. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, she's a really good player.   I just was able to play better than I did my first couple rounds.   So like I said, that was what I was going to have to do going up against the No. 1 player in the world.

Q.   Seemed like there were a lot of momentum swings in this match, even within games.   A lot of games started one way and went another.   How easy was it for you to sort of get a rhythm in this match? 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   You know, it wasn't that easy but it wasn't hard.   I wasn't thinking about it too much, about swings and stuff like that.   I was just trying to get some serves in and play better.
Like I said yesterday, what I felt was really positive about my match is I know I can do better.   So I knew that I would have to do better going up against this player and I knew that I could do better.

Q.   In some ways you were saying coming in here you were practicing, you were sick of practice, but you hadn't played in five weeks.   Maybe expecting to play really well off the bat was a little unreasonable and you're now in the groove three matches in?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Well, I've been practicing really hard, and I actually expected to play better.   If I could just play the way I have been in practice it would be more comprehensive matches. 
So hopefully as the tournament goes on I can get better.   If not, I hope to do better next year.

Q.   Long layoff, and now you've played three matches and you'll get a day off.   Looking forward to the day off or still ready to go? 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Looking forward to the day off, although I'm ready to go if I have to.   In tennis you always have to be ready.   You never know when you're going to play.
But I'm happy to have a day off. 

Q.   Just breaking down the matchup against her, you've lost to her once and you've beaten her five times this year.   The US Open match was super close, but what do you think the little or medium size or big difference is that gets you the wins every time?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Gosh, I have to think about it.   I don't know.   Maybe I'm doing the right things at the right time.
I don't know.   I have to go back and study some of those matches.   I played really well the first few times we played this year; namely in Madrid and wherever else we played, Wimbledon, Olympics. 
Yeah, so I played really well mostly at Madrid and Olympics.   You know, I think she went out and got better and started playing well, so I don't know what the edge is. 
I think every time you step out on that court it's a brand new time and there really is no edge.

Q.   Seems like given your record against her and Maria that you don't mind playing the hard, flat hitters, that you kind of invite the matchup. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, I don't mind.   I don't mind playing people that hit a lot spin, slice.   Gotten used to it over the years.   I think I've gotten particularly better with people that slice, so either way I don't mind. 

Q.   I saw when you were coming on the courts a nice picture of you with the gold medalist Serena Williams on your bag.   Is that luck for you?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I have a nice picture of...

Q.   Olympic gold medalist Serena Williams. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Where is this picture? 

Q.   On your sport bag. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Oh, I don't think so.   Is there?   I'm a little out of it right now.   I'm tired and hungry, so I don't remember having gold medals on my bag.   Maybe.

Q.   Last night I was watching you on TV and you were saying you love it here and you would like to move to Istanbul.   How serious were you?
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I didn't understand anything you just said. 

Q.   Last night in the TV interview you said you loved Istanbul and you would consider about moving here to Istanbul.   How serious were you? 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Oh, I said I should move here because there is so much love and everyone is so nice.   I just feel really bad because I can't sign all the autographs because the people go really, really crazy in the front.
But I don't know.   I mean, it would be really nice.   I like it a lot. 

Q.   The last Championships you played was in Doha, and then this is your first time in Istanbul.   Can you compare the two cities, the two hosts? 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, a little similar in culture.   Not extremely, but they have a lot of similarities in the culture.   I think both of them are great to host the Championships.
Doha did a fabulous job.   Of course it's always a fabulous job when you win.   So far love Istanbul.   We'll see. 
But I think it's been great here in Istanbul.   I think the people are really, really nice, really amazing, and incredibly supportive not just of me, but all the players.
The crowds are great.   Really a great city.   It's a host, and you get new kids in Turkey involved in tennis and get some stars that come out of Turkey. 

Q.   How much are you looking forward to Monday and vacation? 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I don't have vacation, but I am looking forward Monday.   Obviously I wish it were now, but it's not. 
You know, I have a maximum of two more matches this year hopefully; if not, one more.
That's how I look at it.   So, yeah.

Q.   In some ways too I would think given how well you've done the last six or seven months that you have the feeling I don't want season to end; I just keep winning and winning. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I can't wait to get to Australia.   I wish it started next month.

Q.   You likely play Radwanska in the semifinals the way things are shaking out now.   You guys haven't played since that Wimbledon final, which was pretty up and down.   Talk about the players that play with spin and stuff.   Talk about that matchup and the challenges she presents. 
SERENA WILLIAMS:   That'll be a good matchup for me.   She gets a lot of balls back, so I'll be definitely ready for that. 
I'm ready.   I mean, we are both fighting to be in the next round, so, yeah.
