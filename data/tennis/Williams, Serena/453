S. WILLIAMS/V. WILLIAMS
  6-4, 3-6, 6-3
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

   Q. Got to be a pretty good feeling. You probably feel like you got over the big mountain in the semis and sort of come what may in the final. 
   SERENA WILLIAMS: And come apart. Pardon?

   Q. Come what may in the final. 
   SERENA WILLIAMS: Oh, yeah, definitely feels good to get over that. Absolutely.

   Q. Talk about the match a little bit today. She gave you a lot of opportunities, breakpoints and stuff. 
   SERENA WILLIAMS: Yeah, I've got to work on my breakpoint opportunities a little more. I had so many. Yeah, I think it could have been a different score. 
   You know, she's always hitting big serves and, you know, playing really well. When she's down breakpoints, I think that's when she plays her best tennis.

   Q. How does it feel to even things up in the all -- time series? Is that something you knew about or care about?
   SERENA WILLIAMS: I definitely knew about it. It's definitely good to even it up. I would love to be in the lead again.

   Q. She helped you keep your No. 1 ranking. Can you talk about that. Are you going to buy her a present? 
   SERENA WILLIAMS: No. I'm excited because I was thinking that I would love to remain No. 1, so obviously I was really excited about that. 
   Then I thought, Ah. I mean, I think I was more happy about that than winning the match at the end.

   Q. Dinara doesn't have your credentials. How would it feel about to relinquishing the No. 1 ranking to somebody who -- what are your feelings on that?
   SERENA WILLIAMS: (Laughter.) Well, I mean, she's really a good girl and she is a nice person. You know, I just have the utmost respect for not only her, but everyone on this tour. I just think it's crazy that I can just be so consistent throughout the year and last year and barely be No. 1. 
   I mean, winning two of the last four Grand Slams and getting into the finals of three of the last four. I just -- I can't compute it. I mean, it's just psycho really. 

   Q. Seems like somebody who hasn't won a Grand Slam, how do they get there?
