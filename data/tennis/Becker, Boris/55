Q.  Do you have the feeling that you played your  best first round here because you were feeling very  good on the court today compared with other years?  
 
BORIS BECKER: Unfortunately, I have a past in  this tournament where I have been losing many times in  the first round, but I had also one of my two best  tournaments ever on clay. I don't know about the best  ever, but it was a very good first round.   
 

Q.  Any reason, Boris?  You have been preparing  particularly well or differently or you just went out  there feeling good today?  
 
BORIS BECKER: I had time to prepare.  Unfortunately, the weather wasn't that good the last  four days, but it was good two weeks ago and most  players haven't played and we were all ready here a  couple of weeks ago and we had time to practice hard.  I think that is why I was able to play with very good  timing and that is the reason.
