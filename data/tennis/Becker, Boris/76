Q.  Still as good as it was in Paris, Boris, for you? 
 
BORIS BECKER:  Still as good as in Paris?  
 

Q.  Yes. 
 
BORIS BECKER:  I think it was the same kind of tennis I produced tonight.  The same kind of tennis Paris and here; I mean, just that match.  It was better than the last two matches I played.  
 

Q.  How are your chances looking now, do you feel? 
 
BORIS BECKER:  Well, you know, if I keep on playing that kind of tennis, I have again a chance tomorrow.  I just -- I only can tell you that.  
 

Q.  Do you find the expectation of the whole country is a little bit more heavier-- 
 
BORIS BECKER:  They are high, those expectations, and from time to time I am not there, but, you know, when I have a match like tonight, it is great for me to play in Germany, you know.  I prefer to have that kind of match in Germany than in America, that is for sure.  
 

Q.  Did you feel sorry for Stefan having the whole crowd of 9,000 people against him? 
 
BORIS BECKER:  Well, he has been playing for many years now, and I don't think he minds much whether the crowd is so much on one side or the other.  Overall, I thought the crowd was rather fair.  Of course, they were a bit more behind the German player, but overall it was fair.
