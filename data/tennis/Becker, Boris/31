BORIS BECKER:  Today I had my day off.  I couldn't take it that much serious.  I regarded it as an exhibition to train, my timing and my shots; therefore, I was relaxed and take it with humor.  Tomorrow I am back to business because then it counts because there is something at stake.  Then I can give everything.  I am not disappointed that I have lost.  The cake was good.  The singer was even better.  It was very nice and very friendly, but I prefer it privately.  I didn't have anything against the celebration because I didn't have anything to lose.   I don't have a favorite opponent tomorrow.  I don't have a choice anyway.
