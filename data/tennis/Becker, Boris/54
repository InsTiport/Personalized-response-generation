Q.  I suppose it must be very satisfying by the  match you played today.  

BORIS BECKER: Yes, I am.  Corretja is a very  good baseliner.  He beat me the last time we played,  and he played probably already 10 clay court  tournaments this year.  This is my first and I was able  to play my game near to perfection.  


Q.  Do you remember having played as aggressively  as you did today on clay before because you played very  aggressive, serve and volley?  

BORIS BECKER: I get the impression sometimes,  you know, I had a similar question at the court.  I did  win a couple of matches on clay before in my career.  It is not like I am playing my first time, pretty good  clay court tennis.  As you remember, I did pretty good  at the French a few years in a row.  I did pretty good  at this tournament.  In Rome, I was in the final.  So I  am able to play good tennis, but -- and at the moment I  feel like I have very good timing on my serve and on my  shots altogether.  So I am able to play very aggressive  and that is what I am doing right now.  


Q.  Do you need to be physically fit to play that  kind of game or is it just a question of timing or --  

BORIS BECKER: No, you do have to work a bit  more than when you play indoors, even though it doesn't  go so much into your knees when you play on on clay  than when you play indoors because you are moving all  the time and -- with the clay court, you have to slide  a lot, so you need to have very strong legs to be able  to do that
