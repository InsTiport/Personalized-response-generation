 BORIS BECKER: You always get hope when you are on the court, otherwise you shouldn't be
on the court. In the first set I had the feeling that I should win this one. 
 We have had some interesting matches together. The last match was in Melbourne where I
lost in five sets against him. He has become one of the best players during the past
years. 
 The breaks I take must not get any longer, otherwise it will get difficult. I only
started to practice five days ago so for me it is very surprising that I won my first two
matches here. 
 The best 50 players of the world are here. The Top-10 players are here and that is
reason enough for me to play here. The fact that I cannot qualify for Hannover anymore is
annoying, but it is reality. 
 I didn't stop playing because I wasn't good enough anymore, but because I didn't want
to play any longer. I didn't want this rush of 15 tournaments per year. I am happy to play
the way I am playing now. The chances that I will play here again are not very high, but
you never know. 
 A win is always a win. It doesn't matter whether you are 17, 25 or 31 years old. That
plays a secondary role on your career level. The body hurts a bit more now after the
match. But my heart is still young. 
 I will play Bercy and Stockholm. Then I will try and play a couple of matches before
the Davis Cup, but my ideal scenario would be that I would not have to play Davis Cup, but
we will see that.
