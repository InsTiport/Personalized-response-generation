A. MESTACH/M. Puig
  6-4, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. You played Monica before and you've beaten her and she's beaten you. Did you change anything about your game coming into today's match?
 AN-SOPHIE MESTACH: No, I didn't change anything. I just think I played very well today and she played well also. I just think I played better today. So that's what happens. 

 Q. You were the favorite after Daria lost early. Did that give you any confidence early in the tournament? 
 AN-SOPHIE MESTACH: Not really. I don't really care what the other seeded people do. I just play my game and I see what happens. 

 Q. Any nerves out there on Rod Laver today?
 AN-SOPHIE MESTACH: I think at the end I was a little nervous. Also in the beginning, first game I was a little nervous, shaking a little. 
 But I had to speak after my match, and I think that was the most difficult part of today, so, yeah.
