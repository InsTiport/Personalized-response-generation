 THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
  Q. You didn't like him in the US Open already. It was the same today?  
 FLORENT SERRA: Nothing happens. When we play, he gives no rhythm. Also I'm hurting everywhere.   
 He chips and takes risks. That's all that happens.   
  
  Q. Was it difficult after the week in Casablanca?  
 FLORENT SERRA: Yes. My legs feel heavy.   
  
  Q. But overall it was a good beginning of the season? You are happy?  
 FLORENT SERRA: Yes, I believe the beginning of the season has been good. I was happy I went into the final last week. It hadn't happened to me for three years. It's a pity I lost the first round here in this big tournament.   
 I'm now going to play the quallies in Rome.   
  
  Q. Was it deliberately planned that you wouldn't go to Barcelona?  
 FLORENT SERRA: Yes, because I'm going to play every week until the French Open, so I needed at least one week's rest.   
  
  Q. Are you pleased with last week?   
 FLORENT SERRA: Yes. It was a good week. But I was a bit frustrated because once you are in the final, it's a pity not to win it.
