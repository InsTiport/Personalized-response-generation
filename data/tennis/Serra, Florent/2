 THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.   
  
  Q. Yesterday you were talking about having fun on the court, but apparently it was not the case today.   
 FLORENT SERRA: It was tough. I felt stuck from the beginning. He was playing very deep, very high. I had to step back.   
 Against him, it should be the contrary: I should be the one playing deep, and it didn't happen today. In fact, it started becoming a bit better when I started playing slower and higher and taking my time. Finally, I was then able to come back into the match.   
 In fact, I didn't serve well enough. And when I tried to go up to the net, I was always late. So it was difficult in all parts of the game.   
  
  Q. But still in some games there was very little difference between you.   
 FLORENT SERRA: Yes. On his serve I felt there were certain things I could do. If I had served better, also I could have done better. I should have served better. But today I felt a bit tired.   
  
  Q. We noticed when you were more aggressive on your return on second serves, he was sometimes making errors.   
 FLORENT SERRA: That was my tactic. When I was able to be more aggressive and to step into the court, it was a lot better for me. In the beginning, I was playing too fast and I was making too many mistakes on my serve.   
 Overall, I was much too inconsistent.   
  
  Q. What next?   
 FLORENT SERRA: I'll rest until the end of the week. I'm going to start again on Tuesday or Wednesday. I'm going to Switzerland for some treatment. I will have my new apartment there. It is not far from Geneva, a place called Gland. After that I'll go to Tunis. It's a good challenger. I will be with Gasquet and ClÃ©ment. We all want those 24, 25 points.   
 We will be seeded. It is interesting.
