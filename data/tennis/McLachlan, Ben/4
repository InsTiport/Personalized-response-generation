THE MODERATOR: Do we have any questions in English?
Q. I just wanted to ask a quick question about tomorrow's tie with Serbia. Obviously, Novak Djokovic is the most known member of that team, so I'm not so interested in that matchup. But I'm curious about your No. 2 player and also doubles, what anticipating for tomorrow?
SATOSHI IWABUCHI: Tomorrow, yeah, we are not sure who is going to play yet. But we, of course, prepared in case Djokovic going to play with our No. 1 player.
But still, we have, I think, confidence to beat them. We have good players and good doubles team as well. I'm looking forward to it.
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions in English? No?
Questions in Japanese.
