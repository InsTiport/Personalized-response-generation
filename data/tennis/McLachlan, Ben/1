 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Unfortunately it was a loss today.  Can you talk us through the match and how you're feeling after the game?
 ENA SHIBAHARA:   Yeah, it was definitely a close one.  Personally, I didn't really start off very well, but I think also they started really well, so.  But once we got into a groove it came down to like, you know, one point here and there and in the end they played better points, so, yeah.
 But I think overall it wasn't too bad.
 BEN MCLACHLAN:   Yeah, same for me.  I think we did a great job to find ourselves back in the match in the third set.  But, yeah, to get broken the first game was tough.  But we did well to break at the start of the second.  So I think we found our groove and played good tennis.  I thought it was a good match.
