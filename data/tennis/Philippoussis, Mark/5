 Q.  That was a long match. 
 MARK PHILIPPOUSSIS:  Yeah.  It was a long day.  Got here at nine in the morning and just, uh, definitely it's good to come out with a win after this long day.  Definitely make me sleep a lot easier tonight, that's for sure. 
 Q.  How do you stay focused when it's on and off? 
 MARK PHILIPPOUSSIS:  It's difficult, but I've been on tour for so long that it's happened before.  Especially at Wimbledon on the grass.  Especially the last few times weren't too bad because I knew it wasn't gonna be too long so I stayed in my shirt, I was just always on my toes.  I was pretty much still warm right into the next time.  It was okay. 
 Q.  Were you sharp in the second set coming after that? 
 MARK PHILIPPOUSSIS:  You know what, yeah, the second set was -- I made a lot of unforced errors, went for too much.  He's the kind of guy, he always plays the same.  If you miss, he's just going to take advantage of that.  You know, he doesn't -- you're going to have to beat him.  You don't want to lose, he'll do everything the same.  For me, the good thing is I stepped it up at the end, and chipped and charged, and played a good game that second last game to put some pressure on him. 
 Q.  You live in Coral Gables now? 
 MARK PHILIPPOUSSIS:  Actually, you know what, we moved to Fisher Island on the weekend. 
 Q.  "We"?  That must be my fiance... 
 MARK PHILIPPOUSSIS:  My fiance and I, yeah, thank you. 
 Q.  How long have you been living down here? 
 MARK PHILIPPOUSSIS:  In Miami, a long time.  I mean, even when I was based in San Diego I still had a place here.  I had a ranch in Delray Beach for two years.  Besides that, I was on Palm Island.  And then the house in Coral Gables, now I'm on Fisher Island. 
 Q.  Where were you playing when you were at Coral Gables? 
 MARK PHILIPPOUSSIS:  Fisher Island and also in Coco Plum, where there are some hard courts there. 
 Q.  I live right around the corner? 
 MARK PHILIPPOUSSIS:  But pretty much I was still going to Fisher Island.  It's a great setup. 
 Q.  What still spurs you on?  Do you feel the best is still ahead of you? 
 MARK PHILIPPOUSSIS:  Yes, without a doubt.  Without a doubt.  I wouldn't be playing, I wouldn't be putting myself through this otherwise.  I have no doubt in my mind that I still have my best tennis ahead of me. 
 Q.  What makes you think that?  You've seen other 30-plus guys win Slams? 
 MARK PHILIPPOUSSIS:  Yeah, that's inspiring.  I find inspiration from a lot of places.  Andre.  Pete went out when a lot of people were saying stop because you're not going to win another Grand Slam.  Went out like a champ, won the US Open and that's it, he was gone. 
 Inspirations like Kelly Slater.  He's in his 30s, winning his seventh world title.  Lance Armstrong.  I find inspiration through a lot of people, different sports. 
 Q.  Was there a point in your career where you looked in the mirror and said, "Man, I'm blowing this, I need to get my act together if I want to realize my potential"? 
 MARK PHILIPPOUSSIS:  No.  You know what, life's life.  You go through it, you learn, you make mistakes and that's how you learn.  Simple as that.  I'm just a guy here, I'm just growing up, learning from my mistakes and just living my life.  Simple as that, you know. 
 Q.  Did you feel by now you would have had a few big wins? 
 MARK PHILIPPOUSSIS:  I've had big wins.  I haven't had that Grand Slam but it's not like I haven't done anything, too. 
 But like I said, I wouldn't be putting myself through this every day and keep training hard if I didn't think that I had what it takes, you know, to still, you know, get up there.  It's gonna be a long, tough road, but I'm here because I feel like that -- I can do it. 
 Q.  In this particular tournament, because you're home basically, is this a good place for you to have success? 
 MARK PHILIPPOUSSIS:  It's a good place for me to play some matches, you know.  I'm not gonna go out there and expect to think about winning a tournament, you know.  I've got to stay healthy and just play tournaments, you know, five tournaments in a row.  If I keep playing matches, my game will come, you know.  That's why I'm still playing matches. 
 But simple as that.  There's nothing too complicated about it.  I just need to stay healthy. 
 Q.  Who's your coach these days? 
 MARK PHILIPPOUSSIS:  My father. 
 Q.  He's always been, right? 
 MARK PHILIPPOUSSIS:  Uh-hmm, yes. 
 Q.  Do you have a wedding date set? 
 MARK PHILIPPOUSSIS:  No. 
 Q.  Long-term engagement? 
 MARK PHILIPPOUSSIS:  No rush.  Took me 29 years to find the right person, so now that I have, there's no rush for me. 
 Q.  Would you feel like most of your obstacles were injuries?  Did you feel it was mental or growing up? 
 MARK PHILIPPOUSSIS:  I mean, it's injuries.  Simple as that, man.  Injuries, nothing else. 
 Q.  You were ready to win Wimbledon and, boom, right there. 
 MARK PHILIPPOUSSIS:  Yeah, yeah.  You can't -- nothing I can stop about that.  It happened and meant to be, simple. 
 Q.  How long have you been healthy now? 
 MARK PHILIPPOUSSIS:  How long have I been healthy?  Uhm, you know... 
 Q.  What you consider healthy, anyway. 
 MARK PHILIPPOUSSIS:  Now.  I'm fine, I'm walking away from the match and I'm ready for the next one.  I'm healthy.  I don't want to get too far ahead or jinx myself (knocking on wood). 
 Q.  What would be your favorite Slam to win?  Is it still Wimbledon? 
 MARK PHILIPPOUSSIS:  Wimbledon has always been a dream ever since I was a kid.
