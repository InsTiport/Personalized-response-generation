Q. Pretty good comeback there. 
 
MARK PHILIPPOUSSIS:  Yeah.  You know, I was a bit slow at the start.  Jonas played some great returns to break me, a bit of loose points from me.  But, you know, it was an up-and-down match.  Just I started playing some great tennis towards the end.  I'm satisfied with the way I played. 
 

Q. To look a little at the future, have you talked to John this week?  Any chance of you playing Davis Cup next year?
 
MARK PHILIPPOUSSIS:  At the moment, I'm just concentrating on these tournaments.  When that subject comes up, then I'll discuss it.
