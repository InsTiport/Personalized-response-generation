Q. You really came on strong in those tiebreakers; especially the last one; didn't you?
 
MARK PHILIPPOUSSIS:  Yeah, when I was down a set point at 6-5, I promised myself if I get out of that game, then whatever happens in the tiebreaker I am going to go for everything and I got out of it and that is what I did.  That is how I played, like I said before, in tight situations, I am a player who is going to go for my shots and when they go in I am going to, you know, win and when they miss, obviously, I lose, but towards the end that is what won me the tiebreaker. 
 

Q. Ivanisevic is out today.  It opens up your draw a lot?
 
MARK PHILIPPOUSSIS:  It does.  I think that first one was very tough but I had a look at the second one.  I thought I played Wayne.  He is definitely not a pushover.  Going to be tough.  This was definitely a tough one to get through. 
 

Q. Can you just talk about living in the Village?  You are staying there; right?
 
MARK PHILIPPOUSSIS:  Yeah. 
 

Q. How are you enjoying it?
 
MARK PHILIPPOUSSIS:  Really, I just think it is great for everyone to go amongst the best athletes in the world and just things they have got organized for us is unbelievable like  the concert they had with Hootie and concerts every night and obviously the big game room, that is my hang out joint, so it is good. 
 

Q. Sharing rooms?
 
MARK PHILIPPOUSSIS:  Yeah, with Mark Woodforde.
