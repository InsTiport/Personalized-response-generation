MAJA MATEVZIC: Yeah, I think so. No, I was playing I think very good match, but just got a little bit nervous at the end, so... 

MAJA MATEVZIC: 4-All. 

MAJA MATEVZIC: Yeah. 

MAJA MATEVZIC: Yeah, I got a little nervous. I was nervous at that point. I did I think one double-fault. Just I was too -- I wasn't attacking. I should have do something more. I was too passive in that point. 

MAJA MATEVZIC: It was pretty good. I think I played two or three good lobs. It was good. 

MAJA MATEVZIC: Yeah, when I got to the net, she passed me with it. I should have done that at 4-All, just go for one ball maybe, just take a risk. But it's gone. 

MAJA MATEVZIC: I was playing like all shots. I think she had problems with maybe my back. I think she didn't know really how I'm playing. She never played me before. So I think she was a little bit confused. But I just played everything like I play always, so... 

MAJA MATEVZIC: I mean, it's another match. I mean, yeah, I'm disappointed because I lost, but there will be still matches. I didn't play a lot of matches like this. I just played against Schett in Wimbledon. I lost 8-6 in the third set. That was also one of the matches like this. But there will be lots of matches, so... 

MAJA MATEVZIC: Well, when I was younger, I watched a lot Navratilova, Martina. I like that style of game. I like playing everything - slice, go to the net, just everything, not just hitting the ball. 

MAJA MATEVZIC: No, not really. But, I don't know, as juniors I was playing there, I was playing good. I don't know, I think it's good for my game because I can do everything on grass. I can go to the net, I can do a lot of shots I like to play. I like the grass because of that. 

MAJA MATEVZIC: Yeah, that's right. A lot of people always say Slovakia or -- I don't know. I hope I will help people to know where Slovenia is. 

MAJA MATEVZIC: Well, I mean, I like how she's playing. I don't like when somebody's hitting hard against me. So I think was good because I could play everything. She wasn't that powerful. So I got used to it after a couple of games. 

MAJA MATEVZIC: To not get nervous at important points, not to take a risk when you're up, not to get tight. I mean, you have nothing to lose. You just have to go for the point. 

MAJA MATEVZIC: Yeah, because I usually play like this because I'm left-hander. I always play like forehand cross. But then when the forehand, I think she's -- I mean, her backhand is very good, but I think her forehand, she goes a lot for the winners with her forehand, so I try to play on her backhand a little bit more.
