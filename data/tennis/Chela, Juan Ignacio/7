Q.  Is that a very sweet victory for you? 
 
JUAN IGNACIA CHELA:  (Translated from Spanish.)  It's the biggest of my career.  He's a good fighter, and in Australia in front of all the public, it was very special.  He's a great player.  
 
Q.  Given the events of last year's match here, did it make it even sweeter for you out there today? 
 
JUAN IGNACIA CHELA:  (Translated from Spanish.)  They talked a lot about what happened last year, but when I got on to the court I was just thinking about the tennis match and not about what happened last year.  
 
Q.  How do you and Hewitt feel about each other now?  Do you talk, or is there still sort of coolness between you? 
 
JUAN IGNACIA CHELA:  (Translated from Spanish.)  We don't talk.  We didn't before and we don't really now.  
 
Q.  Do you think that he didn't play as well as last year, or did you just play better? 
 
JUAN IGNACIA CHELA:  (Translated from Spanish.)  It's difficult to compare the two years.  Last year Hewitt played extremely well, yeah.  This year he's not at the same level he was last year.  
 
Q.  Do you think Lleyton has lost his aura that he's had previously? 
 
JUAN IGNACIA CHELA:  (Translated from Spanish.)  I don't think he's lost anything.  Maybe he's lost a bit of his confidence, but I'm sure he'll return to the same level as he was.  
 
Q.  Did you have a different strategy this year? 
 
JUAN IGNACIA CHELA:  (Translated from Spanish.)  No, I tried to play the same.  He's a very solid player, very quick. But I tried to play the same.  I didn't have a different strategy.
