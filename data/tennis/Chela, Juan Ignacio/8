Q.  Did you expect more from Andy Murray today? 

JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  (Translated from Spanish)  I thought it was going to be a tougher match, but I think I played very well from the first point until the end.  I think I played better tennis today.  That's why I won. 

Q.  Last year Andy Murray played David Nalbandian.  Did you speak to Nalbandian's coach for help at all? 

JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  (Translated from Spanish)  No, I didn't know that Andy had played against Nalbandian. 

Q.  A number of players in the tournament have struggled for a couple of sets before they got it together.  Do you feel like you're ready from the first ball?

JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  (Translated from Spanish)  Last weeks I had that problem, but here I'm feeling very well.  I'm feeling that I have no problem.  The moment I went into the court, I felt my game, and everything was smooth.  I think I played very well. 

Q.  If Lleyton Hewitt survives, what is your view on the incident that everybody made a big thing of last year?

JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  (Translated from Spanish)  I'm aware of what happened last year.  From that point of view, could be a special match.  But every match is different.  If I have to play against him, I will try to come into the court very well.  I will play my match.  That will be everything.  Nothing else.
