Q.  Do you consider that one of your better victories? 
 
JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  Yes, I believe it's one of the greatest victories he's ever had.  I'm happy.  
 
Q.  Hewitt came in here and was complaining about the balls.  He said he found that they were extraordinarily heavy.  What do you think about the balls? 
 
JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  I thought they were real heavy, but for me it was in my favor, and I'm happy about it.  
 
Q.  Why do you think it worked in your favor, the heavy balls? 
 
JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  Slower balls are better for me than fast, hard balls.  
 
Q.  Did Juan have a game plan going into this match?  Do you think your style, because of your style, you were able to beat Hewitt today? 
 
JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  I wanted to go high to his forehand or to the right so that Hewitt would have to run very fast to get the ball.  
 
Q.  Did you purposely try and stay on the baseline and play from the baseline, because Hewitt is known as a good player who tries to get somebody to the net?  Did you try to avoid coming to the net and stay back more? 
 
JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  Two reasons.  I play better from the baseline, and I know that Hewitt is very good at the net.  He can pass me.  
 
Q.  Over the last couple of years, I noticed you changed your serving motion.  Why did you do that?  Because of physical reasons or strategy? 
 
JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  I changed from a higher toss to a lower one, and I have more success because it's more normal for me not to throw it up so high.  
 
Q.  Did today's conditions bother you at all, the heat? 
 
JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  No, because I just played in Acapulco and Brazil, and it was much hotter.  
 
Q.  How do you analyze your chances of going further in the tournament? 
 
JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  All the games are very difficult.  I have a lot of confidence and I'm very motivated.  I know I have to play Tommy Haas.  I feel pretty good about it.  
 
Q.  What do you know about Tommy Haas' game?  How does it play to your game plan? 
 
JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  Tommy Haas is very young.  He has a good game.  He has good form.  He's very strong.  It's going to be a very difficult match.  
 
Q.  Have you played him before? 
 
JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  In Rome.  I lost in Rome.
