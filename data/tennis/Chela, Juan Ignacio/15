Q.  Did you hope to turn the match around? 
 
JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  I wasn't really thinking about that.  I was thinking about each point.  I was feeling good.  I was losing.  He had match point.  He had the choice of defeating me.  Afterwards, I fought on for all the points I had and I had the chance to turn it around finally.  
 
Q.  What does it mean to make it to the quarterfinals in a very different surface to the one you're used to?
 
JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  It's very important.  I'm really happy.  It's the third time in a Masters Series I'm in the quarterfinals.  I've done it on a hard surface.  That's where I'm most comfortable.  But even though this surface is not the one I'm used to, I'm playing well.  I'm happy.  
 
Q.  Do you remember match point?  How was it exactly?
 
JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  I don't know.  I know the first serve was in, then he had a forehand.  I can't really remember right now.  
 
Q.  About the end of the second set, we saw you warming up as though you were tired.  Were you tired?
 
JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  I'm not tired.  I'm physically very fit.  
 
Q.  How do you see tomorrow's match against Massu?
 
JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  It's going to be an exciting match.  He just beat Roddick.  Besides, we're friends.  We have the same coach, so it's going to be a very nice match.  We know each other very well.  
 
Q.  Gabriel, what does he do?  Is he talking to you both?  Did it also happen before?
 
JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  Well, he watches the match, but he doesn't say anything to either of us.  
 
Q.  What about before? 
 
JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  No.  He says nothing (smiling).  
 
Q.  Taking into account the match, it was very tight.  What could have changed in one week to make the match change? 
 
JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  Every match is different.  I don't know if he's reached the quarterfinals before, but he's very confident.  He beat Roddick and is playing very well.  But whatever.  We know each other very well.  Both of us know what the other is going to do.  It's going to be a very nice match.  
 
Q.  Are you going to enjoy playing on center court instead of like today on a secondary crowd, smaller crowd?
 
JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  Sure.  The court is nicer.  Crowd will be better.
