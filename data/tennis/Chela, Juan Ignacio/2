   THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 

 Q.  How were you able to turn it around being down a break in the fifth? 
 JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  I didn't think too much.  I was 2-Love down.  I just think to play point by point.  I start to play better.  I come back.  Then I broke his serve in the seventh game, I think.  Was very tough after then. 

 Q.  It will be Rafa or David in your next match.  Can you talk about that? 
 JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  Well, for me is the same.  Both are very tough.  They play in the baseline.  It gonna be for sure a long match. 
 Rafa has more experience.  He won three Grand Slams.  He's No. 2 in the world.  But David is a great player.  Going to be tough with him also. 

 Q.  Such a long match today.  How does that affect you going into your next match physically? 
 JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  Yeah, was very tough.  Now I'm tired.  But I have day off tomorrow.  I'm gonna be very good for Thursday, yeah. 

 Q.  Have you been doing anything interesting or fun here in New York? 
 JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  New York is very interesting.  Nothing different.  Just go to have dinner.  Nothing special.  Some shopping. 

 Q.  What do you mean "it's interesting"? 
 JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  You have everything here.  You can do whatever you want. 

 Q.  Do you find other cities where you go during the year are like that, too, or no? 
 JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  No, all the cities are different.  Maybe I like Paris and maybe Rome.  But other cities are different. 

 Q.  This is your first US Open quarterfinal.  What does this mean to you? 
 JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  Yeah, it's my first time here, the second in my career.  The first was in the French Open. 
 It's great for me.  This is a very good year for me.  I start the year playing very well.  I'm really happy to reach the quarters.  It's very important.
