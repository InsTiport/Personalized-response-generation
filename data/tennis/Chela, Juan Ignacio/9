Q.  There are many Argentinians in Madrid, and also the important tournaments on the circuit.  How can you explain you Argentines are always there fighting for titles? 

JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  It's not easy to explain.  I don't know why this happens.  We have not got the support of the Federation, except some players.  For the rest of the players, it's a personal effort to improve physically and all.  It's not previous work of the Federation that can explain the situation of our country. 

Q.  So it's a matter of talent then? 

JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  Yeah, maybe.  It's overall our personal effort.  Maybe talent, but also the need to work.  It's not easy for us. 

Q.  Do you think you took advantage of having played qualifying?

JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  Yes, no doubt.  Massu played his first match today.  I had already won, so it gave me confidence. 

Q.  But the match was easier than you thought it was going to be? 

JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  Yeah.  First points were hard and, tough, very intense, but then his level dropped and mine rose. 

Q.  Your serve was very firm.  You didn't give him many chances to break. 

JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  Yeah, I knew the serve was a key point.  That was dangerous, if he broke my serve.  I kept it solid and firm. 

Q.  What do you expect in your next match against Johansson?

JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  It's a different match because he adjusts well to this surface.  It will probably be very tough.  I will enjoy the match.  Besides, I have already won three times here in a row.  It gives me confidence. 

Q.  The three tournaments you have till the end of the year, what do you expect?

JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  Well, I have no goal.  Maybe improve my ranking, try to end the year as well as possible.  I'm now ranked 39th.  I'll try to reach 30.
