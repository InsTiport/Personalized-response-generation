Q.  What do you feel is going so well for you at the moment? 
 
JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  I think that my game with Hewitt gave me a lot of confidence.  I'm ready for the most important points, to get them and to carry it out.  
 
Q.  You said that your victory against Hewitt was one of the best of your career.  How do you rank this one, avenging that last loss to Tommy Haas? 
 
JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  It was very important for my career because Tommy Haas was No. 2, and he's a very good player.  I've got more confidence.  It's very important to me that I won.  
 
Q.  What are your thoughts on possibly playing Federer in the next round? 
 
JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  Since he's No. 1 and he has a complete game, I think it's going to be very, very hard.  
 
Q.  Are the conditions here especially suited to you?  Do they give you a lot of time to retrieve balls and play a good defensive game? 
 
JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  First of all, I like the heavier balls.  It's to my favor.  It doesn't affect me where it does some of the other players.  I think it's a very good atmosphere here at the Pacific Life Open.  Everything is going fine.  
 
Q.  It looked real easy for you.  Was it as easy as it looked?  Your game was flowing. 
 
JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  When I played him in the past, it was very, very hard.  I was beaten in Rome by him.  But today it wasn't as hard, even though he's a very, very good player.  But it still wasn't an easy game either, but it wasn't real, real hard.  I like the conditions and the way the ball goes. 
 
Q.  Have you been working on anything specific in your game lately that you think you have improved? 
 
JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  Especially my serve has changed.  I've been working with Gabriel Markus.  We've been changing my serve.  I like it better this way, just to hit the ball better with the coach.
