Q.  Can you please tell us something about the match against Escude. 

JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  It was a very tough match.  I played very good.  I was very concentrated, especially on the return.  But he was coming to the net a lot, so I had to be very concentrated there.  And I have a lot of confidence.  It was a good match again. 

Q.  The next match you will be playing against Grosjean or Gaudio.  How do you see that match?  Who do you prefer to play against? 

JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  They both have a similar game.  They are both playing very good also.  As I said, they have the same style of game, but I would prefer to play Gaudio not because of the tennis, but because Gaston Gaudio is Argentinian.  That will assure one Argentinian in the next round.
