Q.  How do you feel after this three-hour match?

JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  I'm a little bit disappointed.  I knew I had a lot of chances of winning this match because every time I played against him, I won.  But this time I couldn't. 

Q.  After winning the first set, did you think you had the match in your hands?

JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  No.  I knew it was going to be a very even match.  We had a tiebreak, 7-5.  I knew he was going to fight until the end.  I knew it was going to be a long and tough match. 

Q.  Are you comfortable and happy from a tennis point of view?

JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  Yes, quite comfortable.  I played well. 

Q.  Maybe you were a little bit inconsistent, because the games were 40-Love, then Love-40. 

JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  Maybe.  Fast courts like this one make the ball fly a lot, and you can lose points very easily. 

Q.  Massu has been named the star of the tournament.  Do you agree? 

JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  Yeah.  He won some very difficult and tough matches where he was not favoured, especially when he defeated Roddick. 

Q.  Do you think he has the weapons to make it to the final?

JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  Yes.  At this point, anyone can win the tournament. 

Q.  What are your plans until the end of the year?

JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  Tomorrow I'm going to go to Stockholm, then I'll play Paris. 

Q.  There's only two tournaments left.  What is your evaluation of your season?

JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  It was not too bad, not too good.  I had to defend many points.  I think I didn't play well in the small tournaments.  I played better in the bigger tournaments.  There was a difference. 

Q.  Are you planning to change anything for next year or to continue on in this way?

JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  I start with Marcos not long ago and I'm going to stay with him. 

Q.  Marcos is also Nicolas' coach.  What did he tell you after the match?

JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  Nothing.  He was angry.
