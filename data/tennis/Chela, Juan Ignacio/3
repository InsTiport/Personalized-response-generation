   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 

 Q.  I just wanted to ask you about Guillermo Ca√±as.  Did you, having been in a similar situation to him, did you give him any advice when he came back?  Anything that you could say? 
 JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  I always supported him.  I was always on his side.  He has a lot of, you know, inner strength, and he has a lot of will.  And things are going really well for him right now. 

 Q.  Is there any way he seems to be a different player now than he was before? 
 JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  I mean, he was No. 8 in the world before, so he was always a great player.  And he has the same inner strength, he has the same will to be at the top.  And more than anything, maybe now he wants to prove that he was right, and that it was a big adjustment.  He has improved a few things. 

 Q.  Do you notice the Argentinian flags and the people when they're chanting, and the more support you get here in Miami, is it different? 
 JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  Yeah, there's a lot of Argentinians living here and also people that come here on holidays.  Definitely more Argentinians than at other tournaments. 

 Q. Does that pump you up a little, get you going differently? 
 JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  It's great to have this kind of support, and it's really nice that they're chanting your name and they're supporting you. 

 Q.  People have made a lot of the Argentinians being in the stadium all week and cheering.  Does it really make a difference in how well you play out there? 
 JUAN IGNACIO CHELA:  Inside the court it's only two players, so it's between the two of you.  It's maybe the other player could be upset by the kind of support that we get.
