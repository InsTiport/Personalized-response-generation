D. GOFFIN/M. McDonald
  6‑1, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.

Q.   So what was the difference between tonight's match and this past weekend with your wins and then going out there? 
MACKENZIE MCDONALD:   I think that, I mean, he played really well today.   Didn't give me much free points.   I mean, he served unbelievable, returned unbelievable, so it was tough. 
I mean, from the back, groundstroke‑wise, he made a lot of balls and he made it really tough for me.

Q.   Were you nervous at all? 
MACKENZIE MCDONALD:   I obviously had a little bit of nerves.   Each match I did.   I think I handled it well today.   So, yeah.

Q.   So you played some three setters in qualifying.   In the last press conference you mentioned that you didn't feel tired, you could keep going.   Did that factor in at all today?   Did you feel any of that? 
MACKENZIE MCDONALD:   Today I felt it a little bit physically.   Not from my legs, but from my abs and from there possibly from the serving.   Just, yeah. 
But otherwise, physically I felt pretty fine.   I felt, when the points were long, I mean, I was a little winded.   So I think he had that advantage over me.

Q.   What do you feel is the difference between your level now and where you feel like you need to go to to play with these guys week in and week out? 
MACKENZIE MCDONALD:   I think a lot of it has to do with physical.   I think I can get a lot stronger, gain a lot more weight, and just last longer with these guys.   And at an intense level, at a higher level for a longer period.

Q.   And you also talked about observing the other pros and talking to the fellow Americans just about stuff.   Is there anything, like the best nugget of advice that you got or that you're going to take going forward? 
MACKENZIE MCDONALD:   I mean, a few things would be just, I mean, staying professional always.   Before the matches, after the matches, win or lose, just doing the right things at all times.

Q.   [] Twitter tips?   Anything about social media and how to interact with people? 
MACKENZIE MCDONALD:   From that perspective, I mean, I don't know.   I kind of handle that myself.

Q.   When you say right things, what do you mean by right things, doing the right things?
MACKENZIE MCDONALD:   I mean stretching, doing your exercises, getting your massage after, doing the ice bath.   Just that type of stuff.   Eating right, all that stuff.

Q.   Speaking of social media, have you maybe thought about tweeting out a picture of you doing an ice bath the way Fognini and some of those guys have? 
MACKENZIE MCDONALD:   I don't do too much tweeting.   But, yeah, I mean, I posted a few pics of just me around the site, but nothing like that.

Q.   It's an idea. 
MACKENZIE MCDONALD:   Yeah, thanks.

Q.   And what's the plan now?   What are the next steps for you? 
MACKENZIE MCDONALD:   I'm going to go play the quallies for US Open next week.   It starts on Tuesday.   I'm going to be hanging out here.   I'm going to try to hit with as many pros as possible, keep just soaking stuff in, and then go on and compete there. 
And juniors too, and then to quallies.
