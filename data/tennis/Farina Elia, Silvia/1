THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please, for Silvia Farina Elia. 


Q.  The first set went extremely well, then everything started to fall apart.  Can you pinpoint why, what the reason was?  Did your level drop or did she just start playing better?

SILVIA FARINA ELIA:  Well, I think I play very good set, you know.  Even when I was down 4-all and  -- no, 4-all, 0-40, I always believed that I couldn't win this match.  So I think I played my best game today in the first set.  And suddenly, at the beginning of the second set, I lost my nerves a little bit and I think she raised the level again, and I couldn't handle it.

Q.  Were you afraid of winning?  Is that why? 

SILVIA FARINA ELIA:  Afraid of what? 

Q.  Winning.  Is that why you lost your nerves?

SILVIA FARINA ELIA:  No, no, no, no.  Because the first set was really intense and, you know, I was just relax a little bit more.  I lost the chances in the first game that I was serving for going 1-all.  And of course I missed the chance, but I don't think I had the chance anymore.  I mean, I have nothing to say that I missed the chances, because I didn't have any then. 

Q.  She told us at the end of the first set she was stinged by a wasp.  Did you notice anything?

SILVIA FARINA ELIA:  No, no. 

Q.  So many players, after they pass a certain age, their level goes down.  Yours has continued to go up.  How come? 

SILVIA FARINA ELIA:  What do you mean? 

Q.  What do you attribute getting so much better, even as you get older? 

SILVIA FARINA ELIA:  Well, a lot of works,  experience, of course.  Many things together.  All the time, believe in yourself, and that you always can improve.

Q.  Is there anything in particular that has helped you get better in the last year or two? 

SILVIA FARINA ELIA:  I was working especially in the mental side, and the physical side as well. 

Q.  What did you improve on the mental side? 

SILVIA FARINA ELIA:  Well, that you have to believe in yourself.  There is always a chance, and you have to think in a positive way all the time. 

Q.  Are you coming to the Fed Cup in Washington in a couple weeks? 

SILVIA FARINA ELIA:  Maybe, yes. 

Q.  Maybe.  Are you interested in coming? 

SILVIA FARINA ELIA:  Yes.

Q.  Have you been to Washington a lot? 

SILVIA FARINA ELIA:  No, never. 

Q.  Never?

SILVIA FARINA ELIA:  Never.

Q.  What do you know about it?

SILVIA FARINA ELIA:  Not much (smiling).  Sorry. 

Q.  Why do you want to play the Fed Cup? 

SILVIA FARINA ELIA:  Because I think, you know, play against a good player is always exciting and, you know, also play for your country is very  -- is feel you  -- is make you feel you very good.  So why not?
