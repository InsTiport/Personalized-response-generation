THE MODERATOR:  First question, please.  
 
 
Q.  So it wasn't so bad to play in the evening? 
 
SILVIA FARINA ELIA:  No.  I went against the odds.  Well, I didn't like the lights, but I felt good on this court.  It was not so fast, and the balls were bouncing quite high, and that was good for me.  But I cannot play every evening.  
 
Q.  What about Testud?  You beat her four times.  It's 4-1. 
 
SILVIA FARINA ELIA:  It's going to be a tough match, especially because we are in the third round and not in the first.  There is a lot of tension  - maybe for her even more because she has always been the favorite.  She always should have beat me.  But so far she's had very good results:  The finals in Dubai, semifinals in Charleston, quarterfinals in Amelia Island, quarterfinals in Berlin.  
 
Q.  How do you feel on this surface? 
 
SILVIA FARINA ELIA:  Well, I feel good, but I know I'll have to be careful.  Just because I already beat her four times does not mean that I can relax.  
 
Q.  Did you change something in your physical preparation? 
 
SILVIA FARINA ELIA:  Yes, it's something I do quite carefully.  After Charleston, I decided to take two weeks off to prepare for the clay court season, like I did last year.  And I'm glad I did it.  Well, I didn't want to and I had a clash with my coach.  But finally I'm glad I followed his advice.  
 
Q.  What happened at the end of the match? 
 
SILVIA FARINA ELIA:  Well, I was serving, it was 5-2, and I was a little bit nervous.  I thought about our matches and her comebacks, so I was a little bit too nervous.  But in the end it was all right, and she also made some unforced errors.  
 
Q.  Your coach is your husband.  Where do these clashes happen? 
 
SILVIA FARINA ELIA:  Well, at home... No, I just mean that he's no ruler; that we talk things over.  And I didn't have the same opinion.  
 
Q.  If you win the singles, will you play doubles tomorrow night? 
 
SILVIA FARINA ELIA:  Yes.  Why?  Well, unless it is a very tough match with cramps.  But, otherwise, I don't see why.  
 
Q.  What happened in the last few points?  There was a call or something.  We haven't seen the whole match. 
 
SILVIA FARINA ELIA:  Yes, we were 30-all and there was a forehand and it was called out, but it was on the line.  I didn't ask the referee to come down and take a look at it.  
 
Q.  And then there was another shot, which was called out as well. 
 
SILVIA FARINA ELIA:  I don't know.  I can't remember.
