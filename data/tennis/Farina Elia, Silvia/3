Q.  You started out and broke her on the first game.  Where did you feel this game got away from you 
 
SILVIA FARINA ELIA:  I think it was the match.  I had my chances with the first set.  I think today the luck has turned against me many times, especially, you know, when you play against a strong player, it makes a difference.  That's it. 
 
Q.  What was the difference between the first set and the second set?
 
SILVIA FARINA ELIA:  I think the score of 6-1 is not the real one.  I think the level of the second set was much better.  In the first set we had many forced fouls.  The second, we had many rallies and long games.  I had my chance for the game, but I think she highered the level as well. 
 
Q.  Was Jennifer the type of player you expected?  Was that how you expected her to play?
 
SILVIA FARINA ELIA:  What do you mean?   
 
Q.  What did you expect from her when you got her in the draw, when you knew you were playing her?
 
SILVIA FARINA ELIA:  Well, I knew she was playing really a good match in the last couple of weeks, so I wanted to have a good start, and it helped me a lot for my confidence in the beginning.  Of course, I have a lot of pressure, because she is the one, she has to win.  I tried to play my game as best that I could.  I'm satisfied.
