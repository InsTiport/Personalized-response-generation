Q.  Did you ever think you would be in this position at the start of the tournament to find yourself in the semifinals?
 
SILVIA FARINA: Not really.  But I thought I had a good draw so I had a chance to be in the semifinals. 
 

Q.  I know you're unseeded, but how difficult is it to get up to play a qualifier in this tournament; is it tough?
 
SILVIA FARINA: What do you mean? 
 

Q.  Is it difficult for you to get up emotionally to play a qualifier?
 
SILVIA FARINA: A qualifier?  Not really.  I mean, for me it was tough because it's the first time that I play in a quarterfinal of a big tournament and, I mean, it's not really against I play but the position where I am in the tournament. 
 

Q.  I mean, the fact that she had gotten this far obviously told you she knew what she was doing and she was a tough opponent.
 
SILVIA FARINA: Yes. 
 

Q.  Silvia, could you take us back a little bit, how you began playing and what you're
 family -- 
 
SILVIA FARINA: I just start playing ten years ago -- no, 12 years ago.  I signed with the Federation and then I've been playing for junior until 18 and then I start to play pro at the age of 18. 
 

Q.  But you didn't start with the Federation. Who thought taught you to play?
 
SILVIA FARINA: My mom and my father. 
 

Q.  Are they --
 
SILVIA FARINA: They play, like, amateur. 
 

Q.  But like the high level or just club?
 
SILVIA FARINA: Club. 
 

Q.  And any brothers or sisters play?
 
SILVIA FARINA: Just my brother. 
 

Q.  What level?
 
SILVIA FARINA: He play just a little competition in the city. 
 

Q.  Any thoughts, you've got some countrymen back home battling it out in Davis Cup?
 
SILVIA FARINA: No, what do you mean. 
 

Q.  Italy is in the Davis Cup and the United States.
 
SILVIA FARINA: I don't know the results. 
 

Q.  Do you want to know?
 
SILVIA FARINA: Yeah. 
 

Q.  First match it got rained out.  Agassi won the first in straight sets and Sampras was rained out. Do you know those guys well?
 
SILVIA FARINA: Who, from Italy? 
 

Q.  Yes.
 
SILVIA FARINA: Yes, I know. 
 

Q.  We haven't had a lot of great women from Italy.
 
SILVIA FARINA: Why not? 
 

Q.  Exactly, why not?
 
SILVIA FARINA: Cecchini is No. 1 in Italy and I'm second.  
 

Q.  I'm talking about in history.
 
SILVIA FARINA: Oh, in history.  Well, I don't know, Reggi was a good player, top 20.  Let's see, maybe in the future. 
 

Q.  Maybe you.
 
SILVIA FARINA: Maybe. 
 

Q.  Is this the best you've played this year, this tournament?
 
SILVIA FARINA: Tier 1, yes, but I make the good results.  I made a semifinal in Auckland and quarterfinal in Puerto Rico. 
 

Q.  What are you doing differently?   I mean, this is the highest you've been ranked, what are you doing differently now?
 
SILVIA FARINA: Different?  Nothing, I'm just still practicing and workout every day and, you know, day by day and I'm in shape and I feel better and that's it. 
 

Q.  How would you characterize your strengths and what do you still need to work on?
 
SILVIA FARINA: What do you mean? 
 

Q.  The best parts of your game, what would you say are the best parts of your game?
 
SILVIA FARINA: I mean, I feel I have a good backhand and I don't know, I'm -- that's it.  My best shot I think is the backhand. 
 

Q.  And what do you think you need to work on more than anything else?
 
SILVIA FARINA: I need to workout on the defense, defense shot and the serve. 
 

Q.  And who are you working with now?
 
SILVIA FARINA: With Leonardo Lerda. 
 

Q.  Have you been working with him for --
 
SILVIA FARINA: For one year. 
 

Q.  And what about your thoughts on Maggie?
 
SILVIA FARINA: Maggie? 
 

Q.  Maggie.
 
SILVIA FARINA: I never play against her. 
 

Q.  Have you ever seen her play?
 
SILVIA FARINA: Yes. 
 

Q.  You've seen her play?
 
SILVIA FARINA: Yeah. 
 

Q.  What do you think you have to do?
 
SILVIA FARINA: I have to think about the match.  Not now because I just finish, but I'm going to practice a little bit now.  So my coach -- 
 

Q.  You're going to go back out and practice now?
 
SILVIA FARINA: Yes. 
 

Q.  Is that customary for you to practice?
 
SILVIA FARINA: No, I'm fine, but just 30 minutes just to relax.  That's it, not to workout. 
 

Q.  Silvia, you said it was strange, kind of tough for you being in the quarterfinal matches.  Is it even stranger now in the semifinals?
 
SILVIA FARINA: Yeah, but I'm feel better now, I don't know.  Every day is different day.  Maybe tomorrow I will tell you tomorrow what are my feeling. 
 

Q.  Were you nervous at all before the match today?
 
SILVIA FARINA: No, I was -- I was calm, yeah.  A little bit at the end of the second set, but I'm fine. 
 

Q.  What have you been down doing while you've been down at Hilton Head?
 
SILVIA FARINA: Extra? 
 

Q.  Yes. 
 
SILVIA FARINA: I'm just good cook. 
 

Q.  Are you in one of the condos here?
 
SILVIA FARINA: Yeah, I stay in the Family -- 
 

Q.  Have you been cooking dinner?
 
SILVIA FARINA: Yeah, every night. 
 

Q.  What are you making?
 
SILVIA FARINA: Pasta. 
 

Q.  Are you a better cook than Maleeva?  She said she was just doing rice.  What's your specialty?
 
SILVIA FARINA: Pasta. 
 

Q.  Yeah?
 
SILVIA FARINA: Different sauce. I mean, vegetarian or tomatoes with mozzarella or Carbonara.  I don't know, many. 
 

Q.  I'll be over in about an hour.
 
AMY CONLEY: Anybody else have any questions?  Okay.  Thanks
