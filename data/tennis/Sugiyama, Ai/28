THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Ai, please. 


Q.  You've played Kim before.  Is it a different feeling playing against your doubles partner in the singles?

AI SUGIYAMA:  Well, when I play against her before, we are also playing doubles even in the same day.  So, actually, we get used to it I think. But, well, when I have to play singles against her, it's not easy.  But I have nothing to lose against her, and I just try to focus on my side so it's not against her, whatever.  For me, it's not that bad to play against her so, yep...

Q.  Did you mention, during your doubles match today, did you mention your singles match when you were speaking?

AI SUGIYAMA:  No, when we play doubles, we just, yeah, focus on doubles.  Then we enjoy it.  We played good doubles today.  Yeah, we won 2-2, which was very good.  Actually, we didn't think  -- we didn't talk about singles.
