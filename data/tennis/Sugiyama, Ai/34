MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  How tough was that match for you today?

AI SUGIYAMA:  I think at the beginning we both were very nervous, very tight.  She pulled it out second set.  Well, luckily I won the first set.  Second set, she start to play better.  I was still tight.  It took so long to feel the way I play.  Well, when first set and second set finished, then I feel like I got to do something different, otherwise I just freeze, playing with the tightness.  It's not my tennis at all.  I just tried to do a little bit more aggressive coming to the net, I just tried to do, and it worked out.  It was very tough to play first round.  But a lot of Japanese people were cheering me up.  It helped me a lot.  It was just so great to get through the first round.

Q.  Do you know why you were feeling so nervous at the start?  You've been here before. 

AI SUGIYAMA:  Yeah, I should get used to it by now.  Still last two weeks I didn't play good.  Well, I start to play good, but in practise and a match are real different.  It was tough to have confidence.  You have to come with a result.  Also even when I was practicing good, I just couldn't believe myself.  I should believe myself that I can play better, then it's coming out.  I can play good tennis on grass court.  I like it.  I'm going to play better next round.

Q.  Any particular aspects of your game you think need work before your second round?

AI SUGIYAMA:  My serve a little bit.  My first percentage was pretty low today.  I need to work on that.  Also I can come into the net more.  Every time I feel that I hesitate to come in, so it's not working good.  You don't know where should I be.  Play aggressive more.
