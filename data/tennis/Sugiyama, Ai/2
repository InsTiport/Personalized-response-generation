 A. SUGIYAMA/A. Parra Santonja
  7-6, 6-3 
   
  Q. You were pushed quite hard in the first set.   
 AI SUGIYAMA: Yeah, she was playing really good, especially her service game. I think I won four points of that. But I think it was -- the key was my service game, and it was always deuce, deuce, deuce and long game, but I just started to hold my service and somehow tried to get my rhythm.   
 In the tiebreaker I was really one point here and there, and luckily -- I was down 5-3, so I just tried to hang in there, and she played really good on the first set.   
 That's all I could do, but somehow I got through, so it was good.  
  
  Q. The second set was a different story; there were many breaks of serve?  
 AI SUGIYAMA: Yeah, that's true. I got used to her serves, as well, but also lost my rhythm a little bit, and I made some double faults here and there. It was not easy to hold my serve, but it's also quite windy, and it was not only one side, and it was kind of a gusty wind, so it was not easy to serve, as well.  
  
  Q. You know that Daniela won, also, so you'll be playing each other the next round. How does that feel for you?   
 AI SUGIYAMA: It's good to be third round playing against each other, not the first round. Yeah, we are very close friends, but on the court we can be very professional, so it's no problem for both of us.  
  
  Q. I guess you know each other's game very, very well?  
 AI SUGIYAMA: Yes.  
  
  Q. What will you be trying to do to beat her?  
 AI SUGIYAMA: It's a secret (smiling), but I know how she plays and she knows how I play. Yeah, it's a lot of mental game, I guess.   
  
  Q. Are you expecting it to be a tough battle?  
 AI SUGIYAMA: Yes, definitely.
