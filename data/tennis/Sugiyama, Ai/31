THE MODERATOR:  First question, please.  
 
 
Q.  Any reasons for the loss today?  How do you feel about your play at the net? 
 
AI SUGIYAMA:  I'm not happy the way I played today.  I made so many mistake, easy mistakes.  So I think if I make mistake like that, I don't have chance. And, well obviously, I don't know, I didn't serve good.  It's so tough to get my rhythm if I don't serve well.  Then she served quite good today, and she held her serve easily.  I just couldn't put the pressure enough to make the  -- put the pressure on her.  
 
Q.  Did you think it was do-or-die at the net, that you had to get to the net, the points there, to win the match?
 
AI SUGIYAMA:  Yeah, I wanted to come to the net.  I did, but I was not good enough, and my approach shot was not good enough and not smart sometimes.  Like especially a crucial point, I hit to her backhand and give her a chance to  -- she has a better backhand, and I was not thinking well enough.  So like this probably second set, when I was serving, what was it, I was up 40-love and she came back and take the game.  That was very big game for me.  If I hold that serve and keep it up, then I might have chance. But if you were leading 40-love and then got broken, it's not the thing you want.
