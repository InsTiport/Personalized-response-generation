THE MODERATOR:  First question for Ai, please. 


Q.  Little bit upset about that after winning the Gold Coast last week? 

AI SUGIYAMA:  Yeah, yeah, definitely, because I was playing really good last week, and then I thought I was ready.  But she was just too good today for me.  I think my footwork wasn't great today, and also it was windy so I have to be more  -- I have to quicker on the court.  But my footwork wasn't there, so I guess I didn't play good today. 

Q.  Were you more prepared last night?  Were you sort of set back by the rain?

AI SUGIYAMA:  Yeah, it was really tough because we had to wait till 10 o'clock.  I mean, the match before us was playing three sets, and then we were waiting.  But when it was 4-1 in the third, it start to rain, and it was already late kind of; it was 10 o'clock.  So we had to go back and get some rest for today.  But we had to get ready for first match, which starts at 11 o'clock, so not enough time for really get rest and get ready.  But it's the same situation for my opponent, too.  But I can't say.  But it was tough situation. 

Q.  Is that a setback for your Australian Open preparation? 

AI SUGIYAMA:  No, I think even though I lost today, I still can practice here.  And I'm still in doubles, so I just focus on doubles now.  And then still four more days to go, so get ready for the big ones.  I can practice here, so it shouldn't be a problem. 

Q.  Will you focus a little bit more on doubles this year?  I see your partner is sort of cutting down on her doubles. 

AI SUGIYAMA:  Yeah, but I also focus on my singles.  I had a good start of the year.  But at the same time, I also enjoy playing doubles.  So I'm looking forward to playing with Liezel this year and see how it goes.
