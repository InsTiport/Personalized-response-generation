THE MODERATOR:  First question for Ai, please.  
 
 
Q.  Amelie, five matches against her without a win.  Anything in her game that you have particular trouble with?
 
AI SUGIYAMA:  It's always tough to play against her.  She has a lot of power.  She can play really good when she needs it.  So like also in second set, I had chance.  I was up 3-0.  Only one break, but I got to keep going.  Somehow when she needs it, she served good, she placed the serve really good, at the corner, and then she recovery really good.  So I always have trouble when I play against her, yeah.  
 
Q.  Did she switch anything up?
 
AI SUGIYAMA:  I think, you know, she raise her level a little bit up I think.  She was making a easy mistake up to 3-0, but she tried to concentrate maybe, then she didn't make mistake easily.  That makes me feel like, "I got to do something."  Then I make mistake a little bit more.  
 
Q.  Anything in your game you'll focus on between now and The Open?
 
AI SUGIYAMA:  Yeah, I think my offensive shot and defensive shot, that the balance wasn't great.  I mean, I try to hit every shot he was so I was not a great position.  She's hitting a good shot.  I have to try to defend better.  But I just tried to go for it.  Make a lot of errors.  That's not my tennis.  I try to make a good balance between offense and defense.  I think that's what I have to do for The Open.
