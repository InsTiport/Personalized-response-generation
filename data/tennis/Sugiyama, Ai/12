   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 

 Q.  Must be a little bit disappointed you didn't put away one of those volleys in the match point? 
 AI SUGIYAMA:  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah, I had chances, but I don't know.  I just couldn't finish it out.  And then from there I just lose my concentration and couldn't get my rhythm at all. 

 Q.  What would you say is your best quality? 
 AI SUGIYAMA:  Today it was like there's nothing going right.  I mean I think there's up and down match.  And when I'm playing good, maybe third set when I was down 3-0 and came back 5-3.  And that's five games everything worked out good.  I had a good rhythm.  My foot work was good. 
 But I think all over, I just couldn't get my rhythm.  Of course, she runs good, but I think I didn't do what I have to do today. 

 Q.  Were you confident coming in with your form? 
 AI SUGIYAMA:  Yeah, well, after this match, it's not easy to say.  But, well, I guess the big one is coming up in two weeks, and I'd like to get my good preparation for it.  It's not easy after just loss, you know.  But there is another nearly two weeks, and I'd like to refresh a little bit and try to focus again. 

 Q.  A lot of unforced errors from both players today.  Was it just kind of a matter of who was going to make the least amount of mistakes was going to come around with the win? 
 AI SUGIYAMA:  Yeah, definitely.  I mean, for my side, it's really so many unforced errors.  Especially from backhand side, I don't know what makes those easy balls unforced errors. 
 I think today was the day that I couldn't figure out.  But there is coming a better day, hopefully.  So today I just want to forget.
