Q.  Can you talk about your week here and your preparation for the Open?   Obviously winning here gives you a nice boost going into the next couple of weeks.

J. HALARD-DECUGIS:  We did win since the beginning of the year and we have some confidence going in the final of Wimbledon and was good to win here, just the week before the US Open to have a lot of confidence for our doubles and for the singles is good. So we played a lot of matches and important points and hopefully it will help for the singles next week.

AI SUGIYAMA:  For me, too, this is the first time to come here to play in this tournament and actually I like this tournament very much.  Then also I enjoyed playing singles, of course, doubles good preparation for US Open.  And I hope we do the same for next week.


Q.  Do you feel ready to win a Grand Slam in doubles?

AI SUGIYAMA:  Well, if you are playing good doubles.  We have been playing good since, I mean, last week also we make the Finals, then this week we won the title, so I think --

AI SUGIYAMA:  We are ready to play good.

J. HALARD-DECUGIS:  We are progressing.


Q.  What was the key today?

AI SUGIYAMA:  It was very tough to get the rhythm first set because it is tough to return -- make a return and get the rhythm, but -- and also it was very close game, first and second, but we decide to play -- give our level going up and good energy and we fight every single point.

J. HALARD-DECUGIS:  The third set everybody start to be a little bit tired.  We tried to put a lot of pressure and to think to the other that we were a little bit fresher than them and keep going and put some energy in it.  It was good.  We have very good start in the third set and we keep on going this way; keep moving a lot.  Sugi was a lot at the net and keep going for the pressure all the time.


Q.  What do you think makes you a good doubles team?   Why have you both clicked and had a very successful run?

J. HALARD-DECUGIS:  First of all, we are very good friends.

AI SUGIYAMA:  That is a big key for the doubles for us.

AI SUGIYAMA:  We are practicing for doubles too.  It is fun to play doubles.  Singles and doubles are different games, so it is -- how do you say?

J. HALARD-DECUGIS:  In Japanese or what?

AI SUGIYAMA:  Even if one is going down, but we keep fighting and we can cheer up both of us; then, yeah, it is a lot of fun to play, so that is the key, have fun on the court.
