 Q.  Morigami has just told us that as a player that she respects, she's very much looking forward to playing with you.  How are you feeling about that particular match? 
 AI SUGIYAMA:  Yeah, she's been playing good, especially on grass court lately.  Yeah, I know her since we are, you know, not junior but maybe so many years ago.  Yeah, we both know pretty well how we play again. 
 So it's gonna be tough match for me as well, but I'm really look forward to play against her as well.
