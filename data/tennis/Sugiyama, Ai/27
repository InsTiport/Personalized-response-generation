THE MODERATOR:  Questions in English, please.


Q.  Was Kim that strong today?

AI SUGIYAMA:  Yeah, she was, and I didn't start well today.  I gave her so many chances.  And it's so hard  to -- it took long to get into the match today, so...

Q.  She's in good shape, in good form?

AI SUGIYAMA:  Yeah, I think so.  She played really good  - and especially crucial point that I really wanted, she also wanted.  Then she took just chance.  Then just so hard to, yeah, keep it up.  And especially my serve wasn't going that much, so it was kind of hard for me to attack. 

Q.  Your chances in the double game?  What are your chances, do you think?

AI SUGIYAMA:  Doubles? 

Q.  Yeah. 

AI SUGIYAMA:  Oh, I'm ready for doubles now (laughter).
