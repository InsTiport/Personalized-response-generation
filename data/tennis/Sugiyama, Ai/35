THE MODERATOR:  First question, please. 


Q.  Was it disappointing, being the No. 2 seeds, not making the final of the Australian Open?

AI SUGIYAMA: Yeah, well today we had chances, a lot.  I mean, they played well of course.  I already knew that before we play against them.  But we had so many chances that we could broke  -- we could break, and also holding my serve little bit struggling.  So it was tough for us to keep it up. But I think it was a good match.  Our doubles improving compared to the last week, so it's getting better. 

Q.  So will you two stick together now, you and Nicole, as a doubles pair?

AI SUGIYAMA: Well, we still don't know yet.  We haven't talked about that after the match, so we definitely play next week in Tokyo.  But after that, we're not sure yet. 

Q.  And can I just get your view on the seedings at this tournament, the likes of the Williams sisters and Seles and Hingis not being seeded, what do you think about that?

AI SUGIYAMA: Well, I think it's a really tough question.  They play only two tournaments, and if they play three tournaments, they should rank very high, then they might be seeded. So I think it's tough to say they has to be seeded.  But if we have to play in a first round Williams sisters and Monica and Martina, whatever, then that's too much.  I mean, that's tough.  It happened here first round, Rennae, Lisa play against them, then can be final.  So it's really tough. But if they do well here, then they might be seeded next Grand Slam.  So that works.
