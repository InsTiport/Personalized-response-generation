  Q.  It was a very exciting match.  How do you feel your performance was?   
 AI SUGIYAMA:  Yeah, I think first set I got a little tight at the end, but also, Cornet, my opponent, the young French player, compete really good in the first set.  But in the second set I tried to be a little bit more aggressive going to the court.  I was maybe a little bit behind the baseline in the first set, but tried to be a little bit close to the baseline or inside the baseline to be aggressive.   
 And that works really good in the second set, and it went my way and I won the game 6-0 and got the good rhythm from it, and also it was huge that I broke her serve first game of the third set.   
  
  Q.  Ms. Cornet seemed to let her temperament get the better of her, particularly in the second set.  How did you respond to that?   
 AI SUGIYAMA:  You know, she was really up and down at the second set.  She was upset easily it seems like.  So it helps me a lot.  Being positive on the court all the time is not easy, but that's what we have to do and that's what I like to do.  That attitude gives a good opportunity for the opponent.  Maybe second set she was giving away a little bit, so it was good for me.   
  
  Q.  And where do you go from here?   
 AI SUGIYAMA:  Well, next one is going to be tough one for me, of course, and maybe Sharapova winning right now, so I might play against her.   
 Last time I played her here was 2004 maybe, which is three years ago.  It was quarters on the Centre Court.  It was a really good experience.  I had a couple of chances but I couldn't get it.  So this time I'll try my best and see how it goes.
