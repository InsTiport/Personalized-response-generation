Q.  What went well today?  What worked well today?  What really clicked with you guys today?  
 
JULIE HALARD-DECUGIS:  I think we are a good team since the beginning of the year.  We made a lot of finals together, coming from Montreal, making a good final tour.  And I think it helped the work we have done all together with our coach, and I think we are even improving, we are still improving, just to play together in the beginning of this year.  So I think were working good as a team.  
 
Q.  What was it like going out there?  The fans are obviously for Martina.  What was it going out there and kind of playing that role as spoiler? 
 
AI SUGLYAMA:  Well, that's what we expected already even before we good on the Court.  
 
JULIE HALARD-DECUGIS:  She has some Japanese fans.  
 
AI SUGLYAMA:    Yeah, but not this time.  Well, we didn't really mind.  Fans, of course they go for Martina, but we're a team, and we supporting each other on the court, and we really didn't mind that even the crowds go for Martina.  
 
Q.  Have you guys ever played as a team against Martina before? 
 
AI SUGLYAMA:  No, this is the first time.  
 
JULIE HALARD-DECUGIS:  I did.  I'm a little older than you.   
 
AI SUGLYAMA:  No, I played against her also, but not as a team.  
 
JULIE HALARD-DECUGIS:  Play many, many times.  I just beat once before she retired and then come back.  I have a good win in the French Open.  But That was it.  She's still very good very good at the net.  
 
Q.  Is it a thrill to come in and beat her now, even though she retired and just come back, is it still like a little extra something to beat her now?  
 
JULIE HALARD-DECUGIS:  For sure.  But it was even better before, because she was still playing very good in singles and, and maybe she has a good team at that time, and now she's not playing maybe as well, but she's still playing very good at the net with the hand.  
 
Q.  Do you remember what year that was? 
 
JULIE HALARD-DECUGIS:  When I play her?  '94.  
 
Q.  Was she playing with Pam at the time?  
 
JULIE HALARD-DECUGIS:  Bollegraf, Manon Bollegraf.
