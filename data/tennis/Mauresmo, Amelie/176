Q. How did you find conditions out there on the court? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESEMO: Very tough. I mean it was very windy, it was going around a little bit so it's very tough to find a rhythm and to play a consistent game.  
 
Q. Do you think that the win would be easier if there wouldn't be no wind today? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESEMO: I don't know. I mean it's very special when you play when it's windy. I mean, I can't say it would have been easier or harder or whatever. It's just I had to win today with these conditions and that's what I did.  
 
Q. How did you find Iva playing today? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESEMO: Again, it's tough. I think we didn't have a very good match. We did what, you know, what we could do. I think she's probably coming back into the game very well, and I will have to see in the normal conditions I would say.  
 
Q. How is your back? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESEMO: It's good. Yeah, yeah.  
 
Q. No problem at all? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESEMO: No, no.  
 
Q. You had a problem last week, I think? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESEMO: Yes.  
 
Q. What was that? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESEMO: Oh, it was just something that happened to me last year that kept me out of the circuit for a few months.  
 
Q. Did you have surgery last year? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESEMO: No, no. It was just a little problem I have sometimes on the serve, but now I mean this week it's okay and I hope it's gonna last.  
 
Q. It looks like you probably will play Venus Williams? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESEMO: Yeah, I think she's playing now, yeah.  
 
Q. When was the last time you played her? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESEMO: It was here three years ago I think. I haven't played her since then, but it will be an interesting match.  
 
Q. She's developed a lot since then. 
 
 AMELIE MAURESEMO: Yeah, me too. (Laughter.)  
 
Q. Last week at the adidas when you had to withdraw you came on the day regardless and had a quick chat to the audience. Was that your idea? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESEMO: It was the tournament director's idea. He asked me if I could, because I wasn't playing, so if I could just say a few words. So that's what I did.  
 
Q. Do you think as a public relations gesture that was a success, showing up? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESEMO: I hope. Yeah, I hope people liked it. I don't know.
