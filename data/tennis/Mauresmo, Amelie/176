AMELIE MAURESEMO: Very tough. I mean it was very windy, it was going around a little bit so it's very tough to find a rhythm and to play a consistent game. 

AMELIE MAURESEMO: I don't know. I mean it's very special when you play when it's windy. I mean, I can't say it would have been easier or harder or whatever. It's just I had to win today with these conditions and that's what I did. 

AMELIE MAURESEMO: Again, it's tough. I think we didn't have a very good match. We did what, you know, what we could do. I think she's probably coming back into the game very well, and I will have to see in the normal conditions I would say. 

AMELIE MAURESEMO: It's good. Yeah, yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESEMO: No, no. 

AMELIE MAURESEMO: Yes. 

AMELIE MAURESEMO: Oh, it was just something that happened to me last year that kept me out of the circuit for a few months. 

AMELIE MAURESEMO: No, no. It was just a little problem I have sometimes on the serve, but now I mean this week it's okay and I hope it's gonna last. 

AMELIE MAURESEMO: Yeah, I think she's playing now, yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESEMO: It was here three years ago I think. I haven't played her since then, but it will be an interesting match. 

AMELIE MAURESEMO: Yeah, me too. (Laughter.) 

AMELIE MAURESEMO: It was the tournament director's idea. He asked me if I could, because I wasn't playing, so if I could just say a few words. So that's what I did. 

AMELIE MAURESEMO: I hope. Yeah, I hope people liked it. I don't know.
