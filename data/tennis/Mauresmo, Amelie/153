AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, it's very disappointing but, you know, I didn't feel I got into the match today and she played very good tennis, you know. She didn't let me get my rhythm and, you know, that's about it. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I tried different -- something else. Try to make her think a little bit and change a little bit the pace of the game. But, you know, I didn't do it good enough to come back in that second set and eventually win it. So, she did better than me today. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, I think she just played a tough game, very solid on both sides. I was giving her lots of free points. So that's nothing special about it. Just one of those days. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, I go back home and then the next thing is Fed Cup. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, we have different personalties, but, you know, the games on the women's tour is still, you know, a lot of pace and not a lot of variation except for, you know, for some players like Justine who can slice the backhand, and myself. But, no, I feel women's tennis is going well. It's really at its best. Variety, I don't know about it. I'm not sure. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, it's good because I know I have different weapons and that I can try to change, like I did little bit today, change game. I can do different things, which didn't work too well today but, you know, in general, I think it's a big advantage, yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I don't know. I don't have an explanation for that. I started well yesterday. It's true I didn't start very well in the first round, but, no, I don't have any specific explanation. I don't know. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, not at all. Not at all. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, I didn't have time to feel anything today. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I don't get that. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I don't care about this. If people mixed the war in Iraq and the tennis here in Miami, it's, you know, it's unbelievable. I don't see any comparison between the two.
