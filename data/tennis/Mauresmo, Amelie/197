AMELIE MAURESMO: I didn't know who I was going to play -- oh, sorry. (Laughing) French; I'm used to English. Anyway... (Speaking French) It's never easy to know that you're going to play qualifiers. She's in the tournament because she has already played three matches. She's really into it and you never know what's going to happen, so I'm very happy I won today. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: (Speaking French) I served very well. She was serving pretty well, too, but I broke her in the first game of the first set and then -- or second service game of the second set. So I kept this during all the sets and it was okay. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: (Speaking French) Yeah, I think -- I hope I'm going to play well this week. And I don't know who I'm going to play tomorrow yet, so we'll see how it goes. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Thank you. 
(Interview continued in French.)
