Q. I guess it was a pretty easy first round match for you today. Was that what you expected? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: I didn't know who I was going to play -- oh, sorry. (Laughing) French; I'm used to English. Anyway... (Speaking French) It's never easy to know that you're going to play qualifiers. She's in the tournament because she has already played three matches. She's really into it and you never know what's going to happen, so I'm very happy I won today.  
 
Q. Explain the match. What did you think worked for you? Obviously, a lot. But if you could just sort of explain what happened, why it was such an easy match. 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: (Speaking French) I served very well. She was serving pretty well, too, but I broke her in the first game of the first set and then -- or second service game of the second set. So I kept this during all the sets and it was okay.  
 
Q. Obviously you were playing pretty well. Looking ahead, obviously the next match is the most important, but do you think you're playing well enough to make a run here this week? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: (Speaking French) Yeah, I think -- I hope I'm going to play well this week. And I don't know who I'm going to play tomorrow yet, so we'll see how it goes.  
 
Q. Great. Good luck. Thank you very much. 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Thank you.
