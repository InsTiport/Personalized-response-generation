AMELIE MAURESMO: She what, sorry? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Me losing confidence? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, I mean I think she just played a good match and, you know, she didn't make too many errors. I had a few occasions in the first and in the second set, you know, to break her and try to lead the set and, you know, didn't take it. So after, it's tough. But I think she didn't make too many mistakes. And, you know, she just played a good match and she played better than me today. That's it. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Not 100 percent. But I just tried a few things for different things during the game. I tried to vary and I tried to play in a rhythm with her, you know, just tried different things. And, you know, it was tough tonight. And, I mean, you know, nothing special to say. Just she played a good match. That's it. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Different surface. That's, I think, is a big thing - the surface. You know, probably being in a Grand Slam and being home for her is more important than the last time that we played against each other. So, you know, a few differences that probably help her. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: That's going to be a tough match, that's for sure, and a good match I think. Both of these girls are playing well. You know, they've proved they can win some big ones. So we'll see.
