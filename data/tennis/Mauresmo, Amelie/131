AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, yeah, it's never easy to handle these kind of days. It was a good beginning for me, and actually maybe the rain came at the right time for me because I wasn't feeling so well, even though I didn't start again that third set in a very good way. I still managed to, yeah, to get out of this one in a good way, and I was close to go out of this tournament. But I am still alive, so that's a good one, that's a good test actually. Hopefully, it will help me for the rest of the week and for the French also. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I felt physically I went down a little bit. I came out very strong in the first set and then, you know, I felt I went down a little bit in that second set and lost a little bit of realism - can you say that? - And made too many errors in that second set. That was the case in a big part of the third set. So, yeah, I don't know, maybe a little physically and mentally not enough focus so, whatever... 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, no, I think I'm capable of keeping that level up for two sets or even more. But just wasn't the case today (smiling). 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, actually, was pretty good with the back. I didn't feel anything wrong. So, hopefully, I'm gonna be in good shape tomorrow. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, also last week in Berlin was very cold and a lot of rain also, so... It was okay last week, so I wasn't too worried about this tonight. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I played her - the last time I think was in Fed Cup six months ago in totally different surface, different conditions. It was indoor on hard courts - on carpets. So I thought she played a good match today. I watched a little bit on TV of her match against Schiavone. She really played some good tennis, and I'm expecting, you know, a tough match. I'm sure she's gonna take her chances. She finished her day a little earlier also, so we'll see...
