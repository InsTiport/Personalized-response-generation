AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I think I was a little bit tired from yesterday's match. I really wanted to make the points as short as I could. But also I think I played a good match, a little down at the beginning of the second set, but very aggressive, you know, going forward, having a lot of shots to go to the net, a lot of opportunities to go to the net. No, I think it was a good game. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: She started to dictate the game a little bit more in that second set. Probably also because I was a little bit going back on my shots. So after that, I really tried to turn it around and go forward, go to the net, make sure I hit every shot, you know, to be aggressive. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, we both played against each other a few times already in the past few years. It's going to be tough match, you know. She had also a tough match today against Pistolesi. She might be a little bit tired for tomorrow. It's very tough conditions. No, I'm expecting, you know, a big match. She's a big hitter from the baseline. We'll see. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I didn't really think about it, to be honest. Yeah, probably. She's one of the player that is supposed to win tournaments probably. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No. Really, the thing I had last week on my back that was giving me some trouble for the serve is okay now.
