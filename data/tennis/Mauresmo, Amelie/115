THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 


Q.  Was that a comfortable first round for you?

AMELIE MAURESMO:  Yeah.  I felt pretty good on the court out there today.  I really felt my game right from the beginning was consistent, and I didn't let her really get into her rhythm and finish the points pretty quickly, as she loves to do.  Yeah, very satisfied about this one.

Q.  What about the injury?  Did you feel it at all? 

AMELIE MAURESMO:  It's tight.  But, you know, I just want to make sure that, again, as I said on the court, that nothing bad happens, and just want to put it as a prevention.  It's going to get better and better, I'm sure.  We're going to work on it tonight and then tomorrow, and hopefully Wednesday it's going to be all gone. 

Q.  Sam said she was restricted a little bit because of her muscle strain.  She wasn't able to serve at full strength.  Not making major excuses.  Did you see anything in her game that can give Australian fans something?

AMELIE MAURESMO:  She's proved a lot of things in these last couple weeks, that she can play some great tennis.  I've seen a little bit of her match against Alicia a couple days ago.  But, you know, she probably needs to be a little bit more consistent.  But she knows how to do, you know, all different things.  She can volley, she can come in, she can serve well - although she was maybe a little bit like not hundred percent today on her serve.  But, you know, big kick serve, and also she can hit it flat.  I think if she can get maybe a little bit more consistent on all the areas of the game, she can improve quickly.
