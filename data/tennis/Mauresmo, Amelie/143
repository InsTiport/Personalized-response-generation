AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, I'm not gonna tell you that (laughing). No, I just think, as you say, we've played each other a few times - a lot of times already. We know each other's game pretty well. So I guess she has some weapons to disturb me, and I have a few to disturb her also. But I'm not gonna get into details or whatever. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: "Diffuse" is like control? Well, you just have to move well, be ready, be aggressive yourself, trying to not let her do what she likes to do, which is dictating the game - which is very tough. That's why she got to that No. 1 spot. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Uh-hmm. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Has she found it difficult? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Maybe, I don't know. You have to ask her (smiling). What do you want me to say? That's all I can tell you. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, yeah, I think it was a good match. Took me a few games to, I think, get into my rhythm. And after that, yeah, it was good match. I was able to really control the game. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I feel much better than, you know, before my first match. First, physically, I think I'm 100 percent now. I'm really capable of staying on the court for a long time, I think. That gives me confidence for the rest, I mean, for my game, for going forward. Yeah, I feel much more confident now than a week ago, but I still -- you know, I still have tomorrow. I mean, in two days it's gonna be a big match. It's gonna be, hopefully, yeah, a good match where I can also find a good rhythm. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, not yet. I think these three matches are the most difficult. Obviously, the best players are staying in the tournament. Even though the Williams sisters are not here, again, it's pretty big draw and pretty good players, so...Let's keep it one match at a time.
