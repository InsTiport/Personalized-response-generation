AMELIE MAURESMO: It was like a year and a half ago. Since then I think things have calm down a little bit. I mean, for me it's in the past. 

MODERATOR: She's here to answer questions about the match she just played. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, you know, today was an important match for me. I needed to have a win today, whatever the score, whatever the way I had to make it. After, you know, one month without competition obviously, and the last experience I had wasn't too good, so the main thing for me was to win. I mean, my killer instinct, maybe as you say, is going to come with some wins that I hope I will have under my belt. You know, it's all going to come back together. It's never easy for the French. For me, it wasn't easy to come out of the French as early, to go back into the routine. It was pretty tough. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Not rebuilt. Not everything. I just need maybe these couple matches, you know, to have all my confidence back. But today is already good. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I was okay. I mean, I've been practising for one week now on the grass courts. Everything was going all right. So, you know, I was just hoping it would keep going. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: On my? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, she did a few things to try to disturb me a little bit. I mean, I had some occasions obviously in the first set to make it maybe a little bit faster, also some occasions to break her in the second set, which I didn't. I guess it's my first match, as I said, on grass, and first match since one month. I just need to adjust a little bit, I think. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: It was tough. I was really waiting for the first win, so I'm happy about this one. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I stop for ten days, I mean, no tennis, nothing. Just went in the south of France, tried to think about something else. You know, after that, I had of course to prepare again and get ready for here. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Too much about? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: It's about both, I think, now today. I think it's good for women's tennis, if it's not going too far. I mean, has to be both, I guess, the skill and the way you look or whatever. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I don't know. No, I think, you know, I had a pretty good run at the beginning of the year. Everything was going all right, everything was coming together. I just need to find that rhythm back, and it should be all right. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, yeah. Nothing special into my game or whatever. Just, yeah, consistency. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, it was important for me anyway. I couldn't have kept going in doubles or mixed or whatever. I just had to, you know, try to think to something else, which was not easy. I don't know if there was maybe something sweet about it, but just take care of myself and do the things I wanted to do. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No expectations really. As I said, come back into the game and win a few matches. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, yeah. I mean, I think so. I've beat a lot of players since the beginning of the year. You know, I don't see why should not continue. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I'm fine. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, yeah (laughter). I mean, yeah, I thought about it. I just kept playing the game. That's all you can do. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, no. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, I don't think so. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Of course, it makes it I think a little bit easier. You know, get the attention on some other players is good for me. But I think at the French Open I have to get used to that anyway. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I think for this period, I think it's much better for me, yeah.
