AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, it's good. I didn't feel any pain in my back, so I'm happy about this. I had to test it yesterday with a serve and it was okay, so I decided I could play. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I think maybe she doesn't like when you mix it up, you make her play different shots. So that's what I tried do today. I also play the sort of game, I was happy the way I played. And I know her pretty well also, so... 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I think it was, yeah, 50-50. I mean I was hesitating a lot, and yesterday when I felt that the serve was okay and the back was okay, I just thought, you know, even though I didn't serve like 100 percent today I think I can play like this. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, the thing is it's only about the serve. I mean, in the game I can play normal, it's no problem. So I was really hesitating with the serve. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, at the beginning I didn't know really how to make the second serve. So after it was okay.
