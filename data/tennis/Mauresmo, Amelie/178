Q. We heard about your back problem. You seemed to be quite all right today. How was your back? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, it's good. I didn't feel any pain in my back, so I'm happy about this. I had to test it yesterday with a serve and it was okay, so I decided I could play.  
 
Q. How would you evaluate Ai's play? You were very good today. She was having a very tough time against you. 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I think maybe she doesn't like when you mix it up, you make her play different shots. So that's what I tried do today. I also play the sort of game, I was happy the way I played. And I know her pretty well also, so...  
 
Q. Amelie, how close, I mean was it 50-50, for you to play here, or were you likely to, if you didn't practice well yesterday or if your back hurt yesterday, to have not played at all today? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: I think it was, yeah, 50-50. I mean I was hesitating a lot, and yesterday when I felt that the serve was okay and the back was okay, I just thought, you know, even though I didn't serve like 100 percent today I think I can play like this.  
 
Q. Did you, before yesterday, before you served, were you thinking that you would be able to play or that you would not be able to play? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, the thing is it's only about the serve. I mean, in the game I can play normal, it's no problem. So I was really hesitating with the serve.  
 
Q. Was that the reason you had some double-faults today? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, at the beginning I didn't know really how to make the second serve. So after it was okay.
