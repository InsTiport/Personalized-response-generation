AMELIE MAURESMO: Perfect first set. Then I got into a little bit of trouble in that second set where my serve went down a little bit and I wasn't so effective as I was in the first set. But, you know, happy to play today and go through this one. That's the most important thing. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Crowd? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, it's strange. But I guess, you know, people maybe were not ready to come today and were not expecting that day to be a tennis day here at Wimbledon. So pretty strange. But, you know, we waited all day yesterday. So, again, I'm just happy to play 'cause, you know, go through that third round. And tomorrow will be a little bit more crowd. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Oh, it's fine. I mean, you just have to deal with it. That's it. No, I'm okay with that. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, it doesn't worry me. I just have to pay attention for the next time it happens to don't get into frustration, you know, just stay focused on what I have to do, and maybe pay a little bit more attention on my serve. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, little bit, you know. I didn't serve quite as well as I would love to and not as well as I did for the last match. So, yeah, I got a little bit frustrated with that, which I shouldn't. But I don't get worried, no (smiling). 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, I feel pretty good doing that, actually. I enjoy it and I like doing it and it's effective most of the time, which is the main thing. So, yeah, I keep doing it. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. But, I mean, if you don't feel comfortable doing, I mean, serve-and-volleying, then you shouldn't do it, you know. Of course. I mean, I like it. I think it's good for my game not only here on grass at Wimbledon, but also for the rest of the year. So I think it's a pretty good thing for me. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, a little bit more. Yeah, of course. It's more effective on this surface. It stays low and goes a little bit faster sometimes. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, because I really pay attention to don't use it too much and mix it up still. Maybe not as much as I would -- I don't put as much spin as I would put on clay or whatever, but I still go for the lift a little bit sometimes, yeah.
