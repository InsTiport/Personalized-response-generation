 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. You've had some injuries and you're battling back. Where do you think you are in your career right now?  
 AMÃLIE MAURESMO: Well, I'm at the point that I just want to select the tournaments I'm going to enter and not play too much during one year and really try to do well in those tournaments, trying to be ready for those ones and, yeah, try to enjoy.  
 As you said, for one year or two years I didn't really have some fun on the court, and I enjoy being on the court.   
 I'm finding this much more in 2009. So that was also the goal, to keep going for at least one more year to really find the happiness of being on the court. So that's where I am.
