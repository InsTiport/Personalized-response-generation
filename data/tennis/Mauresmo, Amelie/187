  WTA: Questions.
Q. I saw you on the tennis court the other day. I saw that you were having problems with your back. You lie down on the court. 
AMELIE MAURESMO: No, I was stretching. 
Q. I'm sorry. How did you injure yourself? What happened?
AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, about ten days, two weeks ago, I had a problem with my back on the serve. I had to stop for a couple days. I came here, I tried to serve again like three days ago. It was good. I was feeling okay. I think today maybe with a little bit of tension of the match or something, I served, and on the first game, like stabbing or something in my back, in the lower back. I called the trainer. I tried to serve after. I couldn't, so I had to stop. 
Q. Is it the middle of your lower back or kind of on the sides, the pain?
AMELIE MAURESMO: It's on the right side, right lower back.
Q. Down to your leg as well?
AMELIE MAURESMO: No. Just the back. 
Q. How are you going to deal with it now? 
AMELIE MAURESMO: Treatment. Doctor gave me some antiinflammatories. I had something that I have moved, so he replaced it. I hope it's going to be better.
Q. Never before happened similar injury to you?
AMELIE MAURESMO: Sorry? 
Q. Did ever happen something like that before?
AMELIE MAURESMO: No, no. 
Q. Does he know how long you'll be out or is it something you'll have to take day-by-day?
AMELIE MAURESMO: I think I have to see him again on Monday. He will see how the evolution is.
