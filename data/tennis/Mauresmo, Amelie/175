AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, of course I thought it's the time for me to come back in that third set. But then, you know, she did three very good first serves - couldn't really do much on these ones. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yes, of course at the beginning I was a bit surprised with the pace, you know, she put on the ball. But then I got used to it. I found my rhythm with her game. Of course, I mean, I made too many mistakes. That's obvious. Next time I need to really, you know, make not so many mistakes. That's for sure. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, they probably wanted to see more of this match, more of this game. I like playing here. I like the crowd here. I think they like me. You know, I was enjoying really this end of the third set. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: That's the encouraging part of the match today. I mean, I wasn't at my best. I didn't start well. I mean, the first set was not good at all. I still, you know, took that second set and fought my way back into the match. I mean, maybe one year ago or two years ago, I would have, you know, let it go. That's the main thing today, the positive thing about the match today. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: It was okay. I mean, you know, except these last three big serves that she hit, I think it was okay for me to read it. You know, at the beginning, it took me a little time, then I got used to it, I think. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, you know, maybe she was a little bit pissed with the backhand I made (laughter). She was a little bit angry, and she hit those three big serves. I didn't look at the speed or nothing, but they were very well-placed and very hard, yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, the noise. It surprised me because it cooled down very quickly when she was ready to serve. It was good.
