   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.   
  
  Q.  You appeared to have turned that around early in the third set.  What happened?   
 AMÉLIE MAURESMO:  Well, I guess I didn't keep the intensity the way I should have.  And, yeah, I started to play less deeper, less deep, than I used to come back in the second set and then lead in the third.   
 And, yeah, I didn't take the chances.  Obviously, I had at that point three chances, and then of course again in the tiebreaker or even earlier in the third set on my serve.   
 So, you know, nothing much to say but just disappointed, and obviously I guess the lack of matches showed a little bit at that moment.   
  
  Q.  How does this second early defeat affect your confidence for Roland Garros?   
 AMÉLIE MAURESMO:  Again, it's not for Roland Garros, it's just I want to -- when you're out for a while, you just want to get back to your level the quickest you can.  Obviously it's not there yet, and yeah I'm disappointed about that.   
 I'm not even looking ahead.  I'm just really thinking, you know, I have to keep working.   
  
  Q.  You said your serve was a problem last week.   
 AMÉLIE MAURESMO:  It was a little bit.  Well, sometimes much better, sometimes still something to work on, which is normal.  But it's -- no, it was better than last week, actually which was not enough, but still...   
  
  Q.  You said you needed match practice, you take any consolation from the fact that you were out there for nearly three hours?   
 AMÉLIE MAURESMO:  No.  No consolation today.   
  
  Q.  You wanted more obviously, more matches this week?   
 AMÉLIE MAURESMO:  Definitely.  That's for sure.
