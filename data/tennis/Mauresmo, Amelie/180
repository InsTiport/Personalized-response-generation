AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, I'm going to get treatment after the press conference. The thing is that I don't feel it in the game. I just feel it on the serve. So that's a good point. Hopefully it's just a muscle, you know, really tight and it's gonna get better I hope. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Last year it happened twice, once in March and then again in summer, August. And so, you know, I hope it -- I really hope it's not the same thing exactly and that, you know, I hope it's gonna get better. I just don't know right now exactly what it is. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, I'm very satisfied with my game. Of course I think I played a good match. I lost twice against her before, so I really wanted to make it this time. No, I think it wasn't an easy match, but I handled it very well and, yeah, I'm happy about this one. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, I felt the pain when I was serving at 3-1 in the second set. There are a lot of things going on in your mind when you feel -- when you don't feel good, when you have pain, when you don't know if you can keep serving or whatever. But, you know, the main thing is that I stayed on court, I played my match and I won it. So it's also good mentally that, you know, I went through this one. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I don't know really. I just don't know how bad it is. I really hope it's just, you know, a little stretch or contract. Very, very stiff. But I can't -- I mean, I can't help you. I'm not sure. I don't know myself. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: When? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Last year? Well, I think the main thing was I was injured too much. Four months all together I was out of the Tour. So it's pretty tough when you are out, you know, to come back and perform well every time. That's why this year I was really hoping to have a good season, a complete season. You know, I hope it's gonna be better than last year, at least for my health. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, I'm just myself. You know, people take it as they want to take it. If they like my game, they come see and watch me for my game. If they like the way I am or the way I behave, they come see me for this. I mean, I'm just trying to be myself and then people take what they want to take from it. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Any? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No. No, not at all. I don't think so. I'm okay with that. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, you know about my private life and everything, I don't want to talk about it any more. So, you know I move my house. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: You know I moved my house. And, yeah, it's good. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I'm sorry. What did I just say? I can't remember. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I moved because of my private life and you knew it. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. All right.
