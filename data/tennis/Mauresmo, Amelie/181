AMELIE MAURESMO: I hope that's the main -- my main concern. I mean, I hope I'm going to be very healthy for all the year. You know, I've tried to prevent injuries this winter in practice, and we did well. So hopefully it's going to last twelve months now. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, I think I had very good preparation this winter. I really want to play. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Because I think - well, first, I have a big problem -- well, I had a big problem with my back with two bones touching each other, so it hurts. Now it's much better. And I think my fibers are very fragile. And, I mean, that's how I explain the injuries I have. You know, I have to be very careful. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. I mean, it's good to have one match under your belt and give you confidence I guess. I just play match by match. It's a very strong draw this year. I'll do my best and try to put my game in place. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, of course it was disappointing. But, you know, it was the first time I had to handle a win in a tournament and then go into a Grand Slam. So it was an experience I hopefully - when it happens to me again, and I hope it will - I will know better how to handle the situation. It was new for me, so I guess I had to learn. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, you just want to be happy about the victory, and you're not as focused maybe on the next event as you should be. But I think against -- you're happy because you have to get there. It was the first time for me. So next time will be better I hope.
