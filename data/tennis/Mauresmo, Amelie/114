THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Amelie. 


Q.  Caused you a few problems early? 

AMELIE MAURESMO:  Yeah, especially in that first set.  I had a pretty slow start, I would say.  My legs were not really moving very well.  And then, yeah, she played a good first set.  She made me work a little bit more.  But still, you know, after in that second and third set, I felt really that I was taking control of the game, that she was going down a little bit physically also.  So, yeah, it was a tough one, in hot conditions also. 

Q.  Are you pleased with your game overall, happy?

AMELIE MAURESMO:  I was more pleased after the first round, I think.  Today the thing I'm pleased with is my head, you know, that I stayed focused, that I hang in there, even though I wasn't really playing some good tennis.  But, you know, after that, it came a little bit, after the first set.  But it's good sometimes to win when you don't play your best tennis. 

Q.  Injury and fitness-wise, how are you feeling at the moment?

AMELIE MAURESMO:  I'm okay.  I'm okay.  My legs didn't bother me at all.  So that's good, that's a good point.  I felt, again, she went down physically as I was really getting better and better.  So the work I did is paying off.  It shows today.

Q.  Interrupted preparation to the tournament to a certain degree.  Getting into the second week, how close to the top do you think you're going to be getting?

AMELIE MAURESMO:  Well, I hope I'm going to be, you know, better and better.  I already feel not too bad physically even though at the beginning I think my energy wasn't really there.  But, yeah, hopefully getting into that second week will be better.
