  A. MAURESMO/V. Pascual
4-6, 6-1, 6-1

 Q. Funny game today, having lost the first and raced through the second and third. How would you rate the performance? 
 AMÃLIE MAURESMO: Definitely good in the second and third and really a little bit tight in terms of movement at the beginning -- I mean, the whole first set. I wasn't really knowing how the leg would react and everything, so I was probably a little bit scared and some tension on that -- most part of the first set. 
 But after it was much better, and I thought also conditions were not so easy because it was pretty windy for some time, quite some time, in the beginning. Yeah, and much better on the serve and the movement, also, overall from the back and at the net, so it was good.

 Q. Injury-wise how are you feeling?
 AMÃLIE MAURESMO: Yeah, a little bit the same after my last match, so it's not perfect, but obviously I still kept the ball moving around. So it's good. 

 Q. Next is Serena. You've been a couple times here. Your thoughts on that? Obviously a tough third-round match?
 AMÃLIE MAURESMO: Tough, definitely. I haven't seen her play yet here, but I basically know her game pretty well and what she's going to do and what to expect. Yeah, I hope I'll be ready in a couple days for this match. 

 Q. And if you do get the better of her, do you think you're a contender as a former champion? 
 AMÃLIE MAURESMO: We'll see. We'll see how physically it goes, also, and if I can get through the next one. We'll talk about it after maybe.

 Q. What is the key to beating Serena do you think? 
 AMÃLIE MAURESMO: Probably serve is very important because she serves very well. Yeah, I think probably that's the first big key for this kind of match.
