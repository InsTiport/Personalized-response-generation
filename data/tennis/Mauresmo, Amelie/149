AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, not so good (laughing). She was playing good tennis, she wasn't missing. She was playing very long, very deep. Couldn't really do something with the ball, so I just, you know, had to stay in there and wait till, you know, she maybe come down a little bit and then I can eventually, you know, play my game. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, you know, again, I try to really play my game, do my best, you know, stay in there. Mentally and physically, it was very tough match also. I was a little bit tired in the third set. Then I, you know, went through that pain. And I don't know, I think it's a little bit of everything - physically, mentally, the game, I don't know. I just take it. Little bit of luck sometimes also. It's everything. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, she doesn't lose so many matches (smiling). 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I don't think it's just something specific, you know, going to Paris. To me, it's just very important for the rest of the season and the career also, you know, just knowing that you can do it - not only going to the French but, you know, in general. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: A little? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, in that third set I really realized that, and I realized that but just probably the last two games only (smiling). 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, but at that point I really felt I could do it today so I just went for it and, you know, I took it. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Sorry? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, I was getting very tired at that point, especially in that game. I made a lot of effort to come back from 2-love, you know, break her back at 2-1 to go up to 2-2. And then, you know, a lot of effort. Then I lost that game. But I just, you know -- again, mentally I just stayed in there. And I broke her a few times in that match before, so I knew I could do that again. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. But, you know, I felt that before beating her today. I said that was my goal one year and a half ago at the beginning of 2002 season. I said that was my goal, and it's still the same today. You know, bit by bit I improve in so many areas and, you know, maybe it comes one day.
