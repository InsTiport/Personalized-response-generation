AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I guess not so much was missing today, but, you know, she took the advantage in the first set and broke me just beginning of the second set. So then it is tough to come back. I couldn't break her back in the second, but I think it's just that much (indicating an inch). 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I am getting a little bit tired. I think we are Thursday and the Open starts in four days, so that's good. I am going to have time to rest and then get ready for next week. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I will see. My legs are getting very tight and I haven't made my decision yet. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: That's where it's getting tight on the left leg, it's inside, I think, abductor, especially the other side it's the quad, it's very tight, so I just prefer to make sure it's holding. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I think she has a very good level considering she has been out for a few months, so I think she is coming back very well. She's moving well. Maybe she's moving even better than before, I think. That's what I think. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Of course, yes, she was playing very deep and it was very hard for me to come back into the court, and she did that very well. Whatever the position she was in she was always keeping the ball very deep. It was tough to come back and to come in. That's -- I could do it sometimes at some point, and could -- it was working well, actually, when I was able to do it. But obviously not as often as I would have liked to. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, I am not playing doubles there. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: It's hard to say. There's a lot of very good players and you have to take advantage of the opportunities you get, and it is very long. As I said a Grand Slam is very long and, you know, you have to keep it up for day in and day out. We'll see. I just take it as it comes, match after match. That's what is the most important, I think. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I got here on Monday. I had to play doubles Monday night, and then I played singles everyday, so I didn't really have time to do something else except massage and sleeping. I just went to some restaurants Downtown, but very quickly and just eat and go back, so couldn't really enjoy the city this week. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I like to go to Melbourne. I like New York. I like big cities usually. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, as I said, she looks pretty good and I think she's moving very well. She's coming back strong, you know, after her injury. And she looks in tough moments to handle it very well. I think that's what the most difficult when you come back when you haven't played matches for a few months to handle these situations, so, you know, she plays good tennis, I think. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I think so. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No. To me, I think it is just -- it doesn't matter the loss today. It is just -- I just have to have good recuperation now, just rest a little bit for two days and, you know, easy practice and then get back into the rhythm at the end of the week for the Open.
