AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I think, you know, I played a very solid game today, very strong physically and mentally. I really wanted to take every opportunity that I had today. I knew the beginning of the match was going to be very important against this player. You know, it was. I saved two breakpoints on the third game, on my service game. You know, that gave me a little bit of confidence. Everything went right. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: You know, I hope so. It's coming. Winning these kind of matches gives you confidence, that's for sure. You know, I really hope I'm going to again keep playing like this, be as consistent as I was today, and we'll see. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I didn't really see her play much this year, but I saw a little bit of her match because she was just playing before me. You know, today was very tough conditions obviously with a lot of wind. But, you know, it's a difficult match for both of us. Two Top 10 players. We'll see. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: She's very strong, you know, and she covers the court pretty well. But I think in the Top 10, when you look at every player, we all have probably different qualities physically, but we're all very strong I think. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: You know, it's hard to say. I haven't played against her. I think it's going to be our first meeting since three or four years. It's going to be tough. We'll both see when we get on court. As I said, she has a lot of power, she can hit the ball very hard. We'll see.
