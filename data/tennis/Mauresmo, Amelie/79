THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 


Q.  Your next game you will play against Michaella Krajicek from the Netherlands.  What do you expect?  She's a tough girl. 

AMELIE MAURESMO:  I am sure.  I'm sure about that.  I don't know much about her because I've never played against her.  Obviously she's a newcomer on the tour.  It's tough to really see how she plays because you never even really, you know, seen her play in a match.  If she's at this stage of the tournament, she beat some good players, some tough players.  I'm just expecting a tough one.  Just, you know, don't know much about her game, so we'll have to focus on mine.

Q.  You like her tennis, power-play, her aggressive style of playing?  Do you like that?

AMELIE MAURESMO:  Yeah, I'll tell you after the match on Saturday.  But, yeah, I heard she's hitting the ball pretty hard on both sides, really young and aggressive, really no fear and whatever.  It's going to be an interesting one. 

Q.  She serves like her brother. 

AMELIE MAURESMO:  Really?  That's bad news.  That's pretty bad news (smiling). 

Q.  Not much you can tell?

AMELIE MAURESMO:  Well, yeah.  I mean, I'll tell you more after the match, I guess.  But, yeah, not too much. 

Q.  But you're not scared, you're not afraid?

AMELIE MAURESMO:  Well, you know, no, I'm not.  Not yet or whatever, no.  It happens very often to play young newcomers and players I don't know or I've never seen play or whatever.  Just have to deal with it.
