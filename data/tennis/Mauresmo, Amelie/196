  Q. Did you and Martina ever play in the juniors?
 AMELIE MAURESMO: No, never. 
 Q. Had you ever been on a court with her until a month ago? 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: No. I don't think so. 
 Q. So you really didn't know each other at all? 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, we knew each other, but didn't really play against each other at practice or anything like that. 
 Q. You were -- when you played her a few weeks ago you were up a set and 4-1. Today you won the first set. What happens both to you and to her in that situation? 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Last time she played I was up 4-1 in the second set, but I think she came back well. She didn't give up, so it was tough for me, but I think she employed a good match. And today, physically, I had a little breakdown in the second set, beginning of second set, I went through a tough situation physically so she took the -- how do you say, she took the lead. 
 Q. What do you mean "tough physically," cramping? 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: No, no, no. 
 Q. You were tired? 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, a little bit. I went through a little bit of pain. 
 Q. Was it your legs or your -- 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: It was everything, mental, legs, everything. Just, I don't know, it is like -- how do you say that? Just after the first set had a few bad moments.
