THE MODERATOR:  First question, please.  
 
 
Q.  You were obviously struggling out there.  Is it just the heat? 
 
AMELIE MAURESMO:  Yeah, the adductors.  I mean, tennis is already tough when you're 100%.  When you're 50% or so, when you're moving not so well on both sides, it's getting tougher and tougher to win.  So, you know, what can I do?  
 
Q.  Was the injury worse today than it had been earlier in the tournament? 
 
AMELIE MAURESMO:  Yeah, it got worse the last match.  So, you know, I thought I would recover pretty well with the day off, but that wasn't really the case.  So, yeah, I mean, there's nothing much to say about that.  
 
Q.  How frustrating is it to be playing well and then have an injury like this? 
 
AMELIE MAURESMO:  Well, it's frustrating.  You're scared that it gets worse.  I mean, you know, I don't really have much -- many things to say about that.  I just thought maybe I can -- I was going to be better as the match was going, which wasn't the case.  Then it's tough.  
 
Q.  Did you consider not playing? 
 
AMELIE MAURESMO:  No.  I thought, you know -- honestly, I thought it would be good and that, again, it would warm up as the match would go on, which wasn't the case.  And the other side got tight as well. 
 
Q.  Did you discuss with any doctors whether you should play or not?
 
AMELIE MAURESMO:  No, no.  I just -- honestly, I mean, I thought I could really play -- be 100% or 90% today.  Wasn't the case.  
 
Q.  How well did you think Serena played today?  She seemed to be more controlled. 
 
AMELIE MAURESMO:  Well, she had nothing to do but just put the ball back in.  You know, it's -- you can't really judge her game today, I think.  
 
Q.  How do you see the matchup with Sharapova?
 
AMELIE MAURESMO:  I don't care really.  I just want to get better.
