AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, can I answer this question after three matches (laughing)? Yeah, I mean, these days, that's how it works. I feel pretty good. I had some worries at the beginning of last week which were cleared after the week in Berlin. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: The back. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, always (smiling). And so I felt better and better as the tournament was going, and hopefully it's going to be even better this week, so.. We'll see. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: But maybe also the other solution is what I do as well, is have a physio traveling with you all year long to make sure that you do all the exercises, all the prevention that you need to do to be healthy. You know, we're trying to do our best to have a good schedule, to make sure that we have some working time, some tournament time, and also some time off, but it's not always easy. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: It doesn't really matter, I think. It's, you know, I always like -- I always enjoy coming to Rome. I've had some good moments here over the last few years. To me, it doesn't matter who is No. 1 or 2; it doesn't make much of a difference, I think, in the draw. I just want to make sure that I play my game and that I'm, you know, consistent on the court. And if you want to have a discussion about the seedings, then maybe ask the question differently (smiling). 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, no, it doesn't bother me. I think all these three times have been different experiences. And I think for the last few, the last two or three -- because Rome is always coming at the end of a series of three tournaments for me, and usually I'm getting a little tired at the end of this tournament. And so I guess for the last two, at least, probably was the explanation. It doesn't worry me or whatever. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: (Shaking her head no.) Surprisingly (laughing). No, that's... Yeah, surprisingly, no, we don't necessarily practice on clay. That's one of the trick. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yes. Well, I guess one of the goals of the president of the federation is for French to win Roland Garros, but we don't practice on clay. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: (Smiling). 

AMELIE MAURESMO: For the young, I mean. I'm talking about the young, when you are younger. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, you play on hard court, indoors, and sometimes outdoor. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I feel comfortable on both. Few years ago, I would have said clay court and slower courts. Now, I think I feel -- I've been doing well at Wimbledon, and I feel that my game can really suit all the surfaces. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: "Daring"? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, yeah, probably. That's what I'm trying to do with my game, to really go forward and try to win the points at the net. And maybe faster, yeah, that help me a lot. Yeah, again, I'm working on it for few years now, and it's starting to pay off. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, it was good. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, I love being here, again; that's what I said. But I love the club. Foro Italico, I think, is a great place to play a tournament. I like the city, I like the food, I like going in the streets. The history of the city is unbelievable also. Even if I don't have too much time to visit, I still saw a few things. I really enjoy being here, yes. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: You know, I haven't seen her play since she came... 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, since she came back. So I really can't tell. You know, she won Miami, so, I mean, she must have been playing some great tennis. But, honestly, I haven't seen her play, so it's quite difficult. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No. Just, you know, I just want to keep playing the way I did last week in Berlin. I had some great feelings on the court, some good moments. I handled everything pretty well physically and mentally. So I want to make sure I play again some more matches before the French Open, and hopefully I can do that this week.
