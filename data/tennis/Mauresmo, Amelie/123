AMELIE MAURESMO: Of course, it was a very tough match. You know, I was expecting a tough one. It happened today. So physically and mentally, it was a good one, difficult one, but I went through it. You know, I'm very happy to go in the semis, having a chance to go a little bit further. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, I don't know what it was, why it was happening yesterday. But it was much better today. I didn't feel anything. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I'm not surprised by that. I lost against her like two or three weeks ago in San Diego. I thought she was playing really consistent tennis. I'm not surprised at all to see her at this level of the tournament. But I have a good revenge to take. It's going to be a good one.
