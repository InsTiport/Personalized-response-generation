AMELIE MAURESMO: I was a bit tight in the beginning. I haven't played matches since two weeks. Just to get in the rhythm again. It was okay after. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I think after three or four games, I was really into it. Yeah, it took me like four games, I would say. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. I think it would have been good, of course, to play the match till the end. She was a little bit injured, I think. It's okay. It was 3-0 second set. I think it's already good. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, there is more journalists in the conference (laughter). 

AMELIE MAURESMO: That's it. I'm still the same person. I think people around me are still the same also. You know, I keep playing my game as always. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, of course. After Australia, I played a tournament in Paris. It was really huge, a lot of people, a lot of fans. It was great. Yeah, that's one thing that have changed. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, yeah, of course, it gives me a little bit more pressure. But I think I've handled it well in Paris. It was a big pressure in France, in my country. So now I think I have confidence in my game, in myself. I think for the moment, it's good for me. It's not too much. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: -- the game? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, for the moment I actually enjoy it. I play good game, good tennis. That's the most important for me today. The rest is following. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: For the moment, I think I'm doing okay. I'm not I think the kind of person that - I don't know - leave the feet off the ground. People around me, it's true, are helping me to do this. I'm fine for the moment. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I think it was a good thing for myself and for my tennis to do this. I was relieved after this. I don't regret anything. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Of course. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: You don't have any more questions to ask me (laughter). 
Yeah, I think in a way I'm free now. I can play my game the way I want to play it. It's good. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Exactly.
