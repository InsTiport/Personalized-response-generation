AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, was such a different rhythm and everything from last week, so I had to adjust to that and, you know, just try to get into her rhythm. And, yeah, it's tough because she doesn't give pace, you know, you have to make all the game. And, you know, for a first round, it's not easy to come into a tournament. But, yeah, I'm happy to go through this one. It's these kind of match you can go for three hours out there and it's very strange. So I'm happy to get through this one. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, I think I tried to do a little bit more, and that's where I made too many mistakes I think. So after, at 3-all, I really focus back and to really put that ball in and be aggressive and finish it off. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I hope so. After this one I have a week off, so, you know, to relax and get -- try to be as fresh as possible coming up to the French Open. So, you know, I hope to be, to keep the same rhythm and the same confidence. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, it's true, especially today against a player, you know, that doesn't make the game really, you have to be aggressive, you have to get into the court. That's what I tried to do today, and that's what I did last week also. It's coming into my game, and that's what I'm looking for.
