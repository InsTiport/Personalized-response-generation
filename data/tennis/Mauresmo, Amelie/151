Q. (Inaudible) to play against you? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: No, not today. No, two weeks ago when I played against her in Warsaw, because it was the third time in three weeks I play against her. So it was very long match, more than two hours and a half. So then it was very tough.  
 
Q. She doesn't make many mistakes, does she? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: No, she didn't that day.  
 
Q. Are these courts in bad shape? I've seen a lot of funny bounces. 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, the lines are...  
 
Q. Not the court itself? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: The court is okay, but the lines, you know, when it touches the line, it's getting hard.  
 
Q. Try to hit the lines. 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, but it's risky sometimes (laughing).
