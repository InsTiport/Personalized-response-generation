AMELIE MAURESMO: No, not today. No, two weeks ago when I played against her in Warsaw, because it was the third time in three weeks I play against her. So it was very long match, more than two hours and a half. So then it was very tough. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, she didn't that day. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, the lines are... 

AMELIE MAURESMO: The court is okay, but the lines, you know, when it touches the line, it's getting hard. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, but it's risky sometimes (laughing).
