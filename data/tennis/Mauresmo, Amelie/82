AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, of course. Especially she's had a few matches already this year, and this was my first one. So I think probably made the difference in some key points today. And so, you know, really nothing -- not much to say about this match. Just she played better than me today and, again, I probably would have needed at least one match before playing against her, you know. She's playing well. She's been playing well for the last few months. That's just the way it is. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, that's the way it is, you know. You just take it as it comes. I'll have the, you know, opportunity to play a double I guess tomorrow. We played one yesterday. So just, you know, to keep hanging in there, hanging in to the tournament, into a competition mind. And then keep, you know, keep working on the singles part of the game. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, that's why I came to Sydney this year, just to, you know, to feel the atmosphere of competing and playing in an official match because it's quite a -- really quite a difference between practice and matches. So, you know, I would have loved, obviously, to have had a couple more but, again, I just take it as it comes. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Only in terms of power? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, I think it's at the level of the biggest hitters in the women's game. And, yeah, she's -- you know, she's hitting it pretty hard and also is capable of really hiding it pretty well I think. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Of course. I mean, that's her biggest weapon, obviously. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, I had couple weeks of rest and then got back on the practice courts to - as usual - to get ready for the next season (smiling). 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, I travelled somewhere actually because it's pretty cold at home. I like the sun (smiling). 

AMELIE MAURESMO: What? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: To Tahiti.
