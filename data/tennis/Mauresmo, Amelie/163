Q. When you were leading 2-1 in the final set -- 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: 2-love.  
 
Q. -- And the ball was called good to make it 3-1, was that a pivotal moment in the match? When the umpire overruled, it could have made it 3-1 for you. You had to replay the point. Was that a pivotal moment of the match in your eyes? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, there was a lot of point that she overruled anyway.  
 
Q. Was that the biggest of them? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, of course. I mean, I had the opportunity to be 3-1 up, which I didn't do. I had, you know, it's my fault. I guess it's my fault. If the ball was in, the ball was in and what can you do?  
 
Q. Do you think you would have won the match had that point went in your favor? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: I mean, it's -- you cannot know. I think, yeah, I was feeling well. I was playing better and better. And I think she was maybe going down a little bit. And then at 2-all, it's a different story. But you never know. I mean, you never know what can happen anyway.
