AMELIE MAURESEMO: Not really, no. (Laughing.) No, you know, I had some trouble get into the match, get into the rhythm. Physically I wasn't feeling a lot of energy so I had to, you know, push myself to get back into the first set. And same in the second set, and that's what I did. I think it was very special match with up and downs for me, but I make the effort at 4-love and 5-2 to come back and to win it. So it's great mentally. 

AMELIE MAURESEMO: That might be the reason why, you know, I had these slow starts on the two sets. Just also the condition, it's very humid and very heavy, very hot, so I need to adapt to that a little bit I think. 

AMELIE MAURESEMO: It's a relief. I think, you know, when you get out of this kind of match with these bad starts, it's just a little bit funny to come back and win the same way two sets. So it's a relief and it's -- we always say it's good to win even though you don't play well. So that's the case today. 

AMELIE MAURESEMO: Yes, I think so. I mean these last --. 

AMELIE MAURESEMO: Yeah, these last couple months, yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESEMO: So many reasons. (Laughing.) 

AMELIE MAURESEMO: I think it's the work, a whole different part of my life and my game, and physically, tennistically, whatever, you can see I feel more comfortable on the court and it's all coming together to give the best I think. 

AMELIE MAURESEMO: Well, I had to make of course this rehabilitation that took me a little while, like a month and a half, you know, to make sure my back was okay. And then, you know, I took confidence in my back because when I started to play again I wasn't really sure if it was okay or not or if I was going to get injured again. So I just had to take confidence in my back to make sure I will be 100 percent physically. So that's the main reason, you know, I could work again more than I used to. 

AMELIE MAURESEMO: It came at the end of the last season, you know. I had a problem in Australia, but it wasn't really important. I think at that time, December, January.
