THE MODERATOR:  Questions in English for Amelie, please.


Q.  You trying something new with not having your coach here this week, or you're just preparing for the French?

AMELIE MAURESMO:  Yeah, we made that -- it happened already this year, earlier in the year in February. We'll see (smiling).  We'll see.


Q.  Just a spur-of-the-moment decision, try something new?

AMELIE MAURESMO:  Yeah, yeah.  You know, we change a little bit.  Not always in the same habits.


Q.  Going well so far then?

AMELIE MAURESMO:  Well, so far it's okay.  I played a good match.  So, you know, I'm enjoying being on the court.  I think I really played a real clay court game today with, you know, a lot of spin, and try also to come in when I was able to, when she put the ball a little shorter. So I'm pretty satisfied about, yeah, the way I played today.  I think it was good.
