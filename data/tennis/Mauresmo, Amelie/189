WTA:  Questions for Amelie. 


Q.  Was this match a positive experience?

AMELIE MAURESMO:  Medium size.  There were a lot of ups-and-downs, good things, but a lot of things to throw away, trash.  I think for the coming weeks, I will have to be more consistent. 

Q.  Do you think you could have beaten her?

AMELIE MAURESMO:  Oh, certainly.  She and myself, we didn't play at our normal level.  Yes, I could have beaten her.  I didn't take the opportunity.  This is my mistake. 

Q.  Satisfied with your serve? 

AMELIE MAURESMO:  Oh, many double-faults today.  How could I be satisfied?  When the first comes, it's rather efficacious, but in this respect, as in many others, I have to be a lot more consistent.  My second serve today, no, I was rather surprised to play such a service, which I haven't done for some time now. 

Q.  How did you approach or do you approach this tournament, this event?  Is it for you a sort of preparation for the indoor season, more or less? 

AMELIE MAURESMO:  I would like to get back to a certain level.  But, yes, I have to say that I came here rather relaxed.  But still with the determination to show some good tennis and maybe reach the second round.  That's it.  Yes, it's good preparation for the indoor season that is just coming up.

Q.  You didn't play for almost three months.  What does it mean or trigger?  What does it affect most?  Your physical shape?  Concentration? 

AMELIE MAURESMO:  No, both, both mentally and physically.  I felt I was less focused than if I had played more recently.  I'm not back yet physically either, although there's a certain foundation that I think I was able to lay.  In my game, I tried to do a lot of things I didn't do before.  Yeah, I'm a bit in between.

Q.  What about your schedule right now?

AMELIE MAURESMO:  Stuttgart, Filderstadt is coming next week, then there's a week of practicing, then Moscow, Linz, Philadelphia, maybe The Masters.

Q.  You are qualified.

AMELIE MAURESMO:  Really?  I didn't know that. 

Q.  You are 12th. 

AMELIE MAURESMO:  I didn't compute it. 

Q.  I hope for you, otherwise you can blame me. 

AMELIE MAURESMO:  Okay.
