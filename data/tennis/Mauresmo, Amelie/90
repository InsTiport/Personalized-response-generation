Q.  In the first game her big serve seemed to get you off stride.  You adjusted and won the next three games.  Were you surprised by that and what adjustments did you make? 
 
AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, I haven't played her for I think more than two years, so and she improved a lot since then, so I think I needed a little time to see a little bit better her serve and really read better and I think that's what I did throughout the whole match.  Also in that first game she puts a lot of first serves in, so, nothing to say about that. Then, yeah, like a little bit like yesterday it was close at the beginning and then really took control of the match, took control of the game and was -- really kept the ball, dictate on my serve and really push her on her serve.  
 
Q.  Happy overall with the way your game is going?
 
AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, very happy.  I don't know how it looks from outside, but I feel comfortable on the court.  I feel, again, a little bit like I said last night fit, ready, and really feeling I am hitting the ball very well.  
 
Q.  Crowd was kind of sparse out there.  Do you prefer bigger crowds?
 
AMELIE MAURESMO: It's always better to play with a bigger crowd, but it was quite a big one last night, but yeah, it's a pity that people don't come more to the tennis. 
 
Q.  What are the things you are most trying to accomplish?
 
AMELIE MAURESMO: I have been coming here for a few years now and never got to the last day and get the trophy so that's what I am trying to do and first and then also getting ready for the Open also, try to really put my game together which is quite there and really, yeah, try to go to the end. 
 
Q.  How many times have you played her in the past?
 
AMELIE MAURESMO: I think just once.
