 Q.  What are your feelings on the instant replay? 
 AMELIE MAURESMO:  I have mixed feelings about this machine.  I think it's a bit too long. 
 Q.  Takes too long? 
 AMELIE MAURESMO:  Yeah.  I think the procedure is a little bit too long, the umpire saying "Miss whatever is challenging this line", whatever. 
 So I have the feeling it's a little bit too long.  I don't know, it's strange.  I am just wondering if it happens, you know, every -- at last point of a set or of a match, like it happened last night.  You know, it cuts a little bit of the emotion sometimes, I think. 
 I'm still more want to see how it goes. 
 Q.  Have you used it yet yourself? 
 AMELIE MAURESMO:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I used it A couple times today. 
 Q.  You were right or wrong? 
 AMELIE MAURESMO:  I was both, one time right and one time wrong. 
 Mixed.  I don't know.  I don't know yet (smiling). 
 Q.  Ana is a player that has given you trouble in the past.  What was the difference tonight? 
 AMELIE MAURESMO:  I felt I was in much more control of the game.  I really felt I should have also won that first set much easier than I did.  I'm not so happy about that, concerning the match today. 
 Then was really much more focused and aggressive and taking control in that second set.  I'm glad I finished the match this way. 
 Q.  Because of the past you've had with her, coming into this match, were you more up for this?  Did you feel more excited or more prepared? 
 AMELIE MAURESMO:  Not specifically, no.  I think I, you know, every time I step on the court I really want to do my best.  I was just probably -- I learned a little bit the last couple times we played each other.  I also remember the quarterfinal we played here last year, so that was a good reference for me. 
 So I really tried to, yeah, again, take control from the first point coming into that match.
