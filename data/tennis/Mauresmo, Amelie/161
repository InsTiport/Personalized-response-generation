AMELIE MAURESMO: What's the difference? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: It's not the same person on the other side of the net. That's it. You know, there's just nothing to do about it. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, she was just playing very well, too good, and I -- you know, I couldn't do nothing. I tried a few things, but I just couldn't do nothing. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: What's the difference, you mean? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, at the moment, you know, they're No. 1 and No. 2, and that means everything. They're the two top players. They were in the final of the French Open. They are in the final here again. So it means they're better than everybody else. That's it. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, you look at the scores, you can tell by yourself. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, to me I think it's a little bit sad for women's tennis. But maybe it's not the point of view for everybody. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Because, first, I think people are going to get bored about it. It was already final at the French Open. You know, I'm not counting how many people since yesterday told me, "We don't want Williams final," whatever. You know, some people think like this. Some people think it's good. You know, everyone has a different opinion. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I just said it. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, I don't think so, no. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, you have to ask them for that. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Nothing really. I didn't feel very comfortable, especially on my serve today. You know, I didn't serve well enough, you know, to try to hold my serve and then see what's going on on the return. So it was difficult. You know, I tried a few things, to come in a few times. It didn't work. Yeah, but no regret. I mean, that's just the way it is. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I think then she just cruised on. You know, again, my serve was a big point in this match, I think. I was serving well at the beginning, then was going down a little bit. So against these player, if something goes wrong, then it's difficult to come back. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: 3-1. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, it was, you know, advantage for her, advantage for me. You know, a little bit up and down on each side. Maybe in the second set it was an important game. But she already had the game, so that was second break, and then it's tough to come back. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: You mean this match? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I think the beginning, it's 2-All, 3-2, even when she breaks me, you know, the first time in that first set, I still think, you know, I can hang in there and do my best. You know, it's getting tougher and tougher as the score is going on. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Not yet. I don't know. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, no, maybe not. Maybe she's playing her best tennis, yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, no, just people.
