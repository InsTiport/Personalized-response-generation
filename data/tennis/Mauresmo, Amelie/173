AMELIE MAURESMO: Well... 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No. I think she has a very special game, you know, sometimes she just hits the ball very well and with a lot of pace, and then sometimes she just, you know, give three points like this. So it's very -- not really consistent, you know, so you have to adjust to that. And I think in the second set I just wasn't focused enough on the game to be sure I was gonna win in two sets, so... And that's what I did in the third set really, putting my game together to win it. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I hope she's right. (Laughing.) You know. Yeah, I mean, what can I say? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, it's just the spirit, I mean, the way of thinking that I have now in my mind. Whatever the changes that have been in my life, professionally or private or whatever, today I'm really focused on the tennis and do the best in practice so it gives very good results. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yes. She serves very well sometimes, but not consistent enough. But she has a very good serve actually. I was surprised in the first game, she put just four first serves in. Very good forehand. I think she has, you know, to move a little bit better maybe. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: It's a little bit of everything. I think it's coming together any way. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I don't know who I'm playing. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Paola Suarez, I played her last year in Berlin, I lost in three sets. You know, I know a little bit how she plays, and she's playing very consistently also these last couple weeks especially on clay. So, you know, not an easy one. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yes. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. (Laughing.) Well a name I still have to choose, but I got it last night so it's my dog, yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: It's a present. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No. (Laughter.) But it's a good try.
