AMELIE MAURESMO: No, no. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I don't know. Back home probably. (Smiling.) No, you know, I think today she just played a good match, that's for sure. And, you know, I wasn't really 100 percent. I was a little bit tired, but, you know, I tried. And losing that first set was very tough because physically I'm feeling tired now and, you know, she just took the opportunity. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, you know, it's tough to mentally make the effort and everything, and I had to make a big effort yesterday and also last week and all this week. You know, I just wasn't feeling like coming back. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, I don't think so. I don't think it, you know, all I've done is here and, you know, it's not that this loss today is gonna change it I think. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Is a...? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, I mean, you never know. She's playing very well. I haven't seen her play for a couple of months, so obviously she's improved. Apparently clay court is okay for her game and, you know, you never know I think. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I hope so. No, I was very satisfied with the match I played yesterday. That's for sure. You know, I feel like, as you said, I've done enough practice but, you know, of course I would have liked to win today. That's obvious. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I think it's a little bit of both, you know, it's going together. So I need a little bit of rest and, you know, to start again and have some more energy. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, no. I didn't really pay attention to that. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Back home and --. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I mean resting and then practicing and then go to Paris. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: You know, probably like two, three days, you know, just letting, you know, it go and resting and start practicing very easy again.
