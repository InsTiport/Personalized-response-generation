AMELIE MAURESMO: I've been asked this question last week already in Sydney. You know, compared to probably the Belgians or Venus, the first three seeds, they've won a Grand Slam or been No. 1 in the world. I guess that's what makes the difference at this stage. I haven't done that. I guess that's the reason why. It doesn't obsess (sic) me or whatever. I just feel comfortable the way it is. That's it. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I don't think we've ever played against each other, no. I don't remember that. But, you know, obviously she's playing well. She's had some great matches so far. You know, it's going to be an interesting match. I'm looking forward for this. We'll see how it goes. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: We've practiced with each other a couple times already. You know, we know a little bit of each other's game. But I guess we're going to discover a little bit more on the court in a couple days. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: It was good. I felt I really took control of the game. I was really feeling comfortable on the court. Yeah, again, controlling what was going on. You know, it's another good match for a third round. Yeah, I'm pretty happy about the way I played, about the different parts of my game. So it's good. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I feel I always have a chance. I think also my game is coming together a little bit. I feel maybe a little bit more confident in what I'm doing. So, you know, we'll see. It's a long way till the final and to hold the trophy. I'm just going to take it match after match. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I don't know really what's going to go through her head and how she's going to deal with this fourth round. But to me, I mean, I feel like I want to concentrate on what I have to do and on my game, and that's it. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Probably. Probably, yeah. Again, I feel good in my game. I think a few things are coming together, you know, be aggressive and everything. Yeah, that's my best ranking, obviously. I hope it's going to keep going higher. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, I think she's played a pretty long match today, and she still got through it. So I guess, you know, she feels comfortable on the court with her ankle. So I'm not going to count on anything like that in two days.
