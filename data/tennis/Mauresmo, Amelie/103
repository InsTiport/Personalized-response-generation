THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 
 

Q.  Yesterday you said that you were improving your game day by day.
 
AMELIE MAURESMO:  (Smiling) Yeah. 
 

Q.  How is your feeling now?
 
AMELIE MAURESMO:  Of course much better than yesterday.  I also think my opponent today was some up and downs.  I think, let's say, the first three or four games of the match were very important, you know.  She had some opportunities early in the first set, which, you know, she didn't make, and then I was able to really break her first and then play some great tennis.  Didn't miss, and didn't let her play, you know, her lift, a lot of topspin on both sides. So I think I was putting a lot of pressure on her, coming in also.  I knew that was the way I had to play to really not stay too long on the court with her because you can easily go in her game, and then it's another story.
