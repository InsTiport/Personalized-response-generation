THE MODERATOR: Questions for Amelie, please. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, of course I felt it yesterday during the match in the second set, in that second set. I had this problem last year, but I thought it was over. I was not bothered with this anymore, and it just came back yesterday. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, it's low down on the right side. I guess it's always the same thing, just, you know, two bones touching each other. That's the only thing I can tell you. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, I'm just -- I don't know really. I really hope that with two or three days' rest, treatment, massage, everything, it's going to be okay. That's my hope, but I'm not sure about it. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. Dr. Ackerman. That's what he proposed me. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: It's very hard to say. You just don't know. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: It's very frustrating actually, because what is tough is that it's only on the serve, you know. So I can play my game, I can -- I feel good. So, yeah, it's frustrating. But in the same -- I mean, I cannot go on the court not knowing how I'm going to serve, if I'm going to be able to serve 100 percent or not. So I just choose not to go on court. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: That's it. Yeah, that's the concern. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I think it's not as bad as it was the last two times. I'm optimistic for the Australian Open. I really hope just these two or three days are going to be enough for me to relax and let the pain go. But it's not easy. I just don't really know, so that's tough. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Oh, it's the serve for sure. I mean, it doesn't hurt me on the backhand or the forehand. It just -- I feel the pain only on the serve. So that's the motion. I mean, that's where the bones on this motion are touching each other. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Which part? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: It's when I'm ready to hit, and I start to accelerate. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: To release, yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, no. No, it's just the back and it's inflammation between the two bones. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, now that the inflammation is here, I don't -- you know, I've tried a little bit to make it a little bit better, you know, try to avoid the situation when it hurts me. But first, it's very tough to change. And, second, the inflammation is here now, so I just have to put some muscle on that site to keep the bones away from each other. That's the only thing. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Apparently, yeah. Because I thought it was over, you know. But it comes back sometimes. I think it's also with the tension maybe of the match and everything. So... 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yes. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: It's not hard. It's just really - how can you say - translate. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Rough, yeah. I mean, most of the time you get - in Australia, you have some players that get ankles twisted and, you know, when you stop, it's very hard, yeah. So I guess that's what people mean by hard. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. You just -- very tough to stop, you know. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. It's hard for the body I think. Yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, new shoes probably, yeah.
