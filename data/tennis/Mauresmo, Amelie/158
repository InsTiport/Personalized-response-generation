AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I needed to recover, you know, because she's playing -- she makes you run a lot. You need to recover. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Maybe, but that's the game. If I need some times, I can have. I don't know exactly how long I can have, but if I need it, I'm gonna take it. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, at some point, yeah, I thought, "Okay, it's not my day, I'm gonna go back home tonight." But it happens. I mean, that's not because I think that I'm not gonna fight or that I am gonna go out of the match. But, yeah, when you're down a set and 6-5 and she's serving, it's -- you know, you have to hang in, there even though you're thinking maybe it's the last game. But you still have to hang in there and try to do your best. That's what I did and it worked out pretty well. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, not too much. Because I was paying attention, you know, to what I was supposed to do and to me -- because physically, you know, I wasn't feeling so well. I just wanted to make sure everything was going fine for me and try to put that ball back in. Yeah, didn't really realize that while the match was going on, you know. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, but I always thought that -- as the match goes on, you know, you get tired, you sometimes lose a little bit of concentration. You have to take these opportunities to come back into the match and try to, you know, come back to the same level. Then see how it's going. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I think the legs were out of it more than the backhand or the forehand or whatever. I think, you know, I didn't really have the footwork right from the beginning to adjust to play that backhand or to adjust and go to the net, you know, what I really wanted to do today. So I just find another way to beat her, so... 

AMELIE MAURESMO: It's great. I mean, it feels great inside. It gives -- you know, I think to myself, I have different way now to win a match: either go to the net and be aggressive and dictate the game, or if doesn't work and maybe physically I don't feel good enough, you know, I can still, you know, hang in there and really make the opponent play one more shot each time. That's what I did today. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, she likes to play with a lot of pace and same height. You know, when you slice a little bit and you put some topspin, as you say, maybe she's not used to that, because on the tour, not so many players play like this. So, you know, I know that's what she doesn't like too much. I try to do that. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: You know, at Wimbledon I thought I played my match in the semifinal and Serena was just too good that day. She played great, served great. There was really nothing much I could do. So I just want to, you know, go out there, play my game again, do my best, and we'll see what happens. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Are they good or not? That's what you mean? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, I think to me people are maybe gonna get bored of seeing always the same final. But I can't, you know, put myself into the crowd's position or the public, you know, in the public eye. To me, it gets a little bit irritating, you know, because you want to go out there and try to beat these guys. But we'll see, you know. Time will tell for sure. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I think so. We are now I think 4-3 for me, or something like that. I know she -- you know, she doesn't like to play against me. Maybe she gets a little bit tight when she has to play against me. You know, she's a very good player, so I'm not going on the court thinking, "Okay, I'm gonna beat her." That's for sure. It's always good matches, good fight. It can go either way I think. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I've beaten her a few times. As I just said, you know, my game is a little bit different from the other players on the tour. So I don't know, maybe she's not used to that so much. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, you know, I have a feeling, you know, I have good chances and I'm gonna go out there thinking that into my mind. But obviously Venus or Monica both are good players. It's gonna be a very tough match, especially since physically it was very tough today for me. So I'm gonna have to recover very well from that. We'll see how it goes. But I will take my chance, that's for sure. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I'll try. I'll give it a try. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I hope so. You can never say, "It's never gonna happen again," or whatever. But I really hope that I'm getting little bit more mature and maybe gets a little bit more experience to handle a little bit better, these matches. But anything can happen and you always have to fight against this tension a little bit. 

AMELIE MAURESMO:
