AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, it was much better today. From the beginning, I really played well and put some pressure on her, especially on her serve. And I'm satisfied with the match I played - consistent to the end. That's good, that's what I was looking for. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, it was okay. I was expecting to play a little bit earlier, but when I saw it rain, you know, I just, you know, was patient. It was okay. I waited more yesterday, so... 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, I really wanted to be aggressive. I knew I had to serve well also, which was much better than yesterday, too, the serve. Was, yeah, nothing special to say. Very consistent, good match. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, she's playing good. She came back very well from her knee injury. It's going to be a tough match. I saw a few points because I was playing after her, saw a few points of her match. She's consistent and she plays good tennis, so we'll see. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I'm fine. I'm feeling good. Much better than last week.
