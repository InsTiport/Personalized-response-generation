AMELIE MAURESMO: Thank you. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I mean, it was very close. Could have gone either way, like I said on TV on the court. It was so close, you know. When you get to 6-all in the third-set tiebreaker, I think you don't really know what's gonna happen, you just hang in there, go for it if you have the opportunity. And I felt that's what I did. She had matchpoint, so, you know, it could have been her way, again. But I'm very satisfied about the level of this match and hanging in there til the end. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Oh, yeah, it happened to me, well, I think against Justine in Amelia Island a couple months ago already. It happened a few times. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Also, yeah, few years ago. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Of course, yeah. We were both a little bit tired, I guess. I felt that I still had some more energy left than she did, but it was very intense match - I mean, very long and very intense from the beginning. The level was unbelievable from the first game. So, yeah, these kind of matches, yeah, you get a little bit tired, of course. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I don't know (smiling). 

AMELIE MAURESMO: (Laughing). 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Two points, yeah. One, actually. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, very impressive. What can you do? I went for it, she made the shot, the perfect shot. Congratulations to her. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I was expecting her to be more consistent and, yeah, play some better tennis this week - I mean, today. And, obviously, she beat Serena yesterday, she had some good matches throughout the week, so I could see and I could feel that she was playing better than last week. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: It's strange, because I wasn't too satisfied about the way I played the whole match. Then I really focused myself on these two points where I put some very good serves in. But just shows that I need really to be maybe more focused and pay more attention on the serve. Yeah, it came at the right time, I guess (smiling). 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Oh, really? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Probably, that's what I did. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, again, I really had to focus on these serves. I felt it was important at that time, obviously, to have some good serves. And, yeah, I really focused on that. I don't know what to say. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Of course it's great. I didn't want to lose this match, so I was very concentrated. I could have lost it, but... 

AMELIE MAURESMO: To my father, who is somewhere watching over me. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I have to take the plane, so I would like to go home now. No time for joking this time (smiling) 

AMELIE MAURESMO: We'll see (smiling).
