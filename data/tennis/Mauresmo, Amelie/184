  Q. It was an easy match for you, was it?
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Yes. (Laughter.) 
 Q. Do you think this is going to be an advantage for you in the final because you didn't have to tire yourself out too much? 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, I hope it's going to be, of course. It was better for me to have an easy match today. I was a little bit tired from yesterday still. I have doubles to play again today, so it's good. 
 Q. What has this week of good results done for your confidence for Roland Garros? 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, I think it's always good to have some matches under your belt and to win some easy matches like today and to play well from the beginning till the end. So of course it's going to -- I hope it's going to give me confidence for Roland Garros. 
 Q. How do you see the final? 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, I'm going to watch a little bit of the match they're going to play, so, you know, I've never played against Monica. I've played twice against Corina, so I know her more than Monica. But, you know, I'm going to watch the match like I did yesterday, last night. 
 Q. What were the results with Corina? 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: I won twice. 
 Q. Twice? 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Yes. 
 Q. On clay? 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Like two weeks ago, and Australian on clay. 
 Q. Amelie, the tournament newspaper here carried an article about you which had some insulting comments in it. What have you done about it? 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: You know, I think I prefer to talk about tennis than about this bullshit. 
 Q. Have they apologized to you? 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: What did I say before? 
 Q. You're playing well here. Do you think you have to still improve to be able to have good results in Roland Garros, or do you think you're okay like this? 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, for the moment I'm just thinking about my final of tomorrow and the doubles I have to play today. So I'm playing well. I hope it's going to last; that's it. 
 Q. The final in Rome could be your best result ever. Do you expect this success here? This year. 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I really want -- for this year, I won a tournament in Sydney at the beginning of the year where I beat some very good players. Of course I would be very happy to win here, and it would be anyway a very good result I'm sure. 
 Q. You beat Pierce and Tauziat has already lost. Do you think you are now the best French player? 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: It's a very tough question. For the moment, I'm still behind Pierce, Tauziat, Halard, all of them. So, no. I mean probably this week I was the best French player and that's it. 
 Q. In this last match you were not serving as well as you can, I mean so fast. Maybe because you have not recovered completely from a back injury? 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: No, I think of course I had to stop serving for six weeks so it was a little bit long for my serve to come back in my game. But I think I served okay today, and I served good all week. No, I'm not worried about this.
