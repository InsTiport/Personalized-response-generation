Q. Convincing display from you today. 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I think especially the first set. It was very good. You know, I started the match very well, then beginning of second set I, you know, I let her play a little bit too much, wasn't aggressive enough. I didn't keep my focus up maybe enough in the beginning of the second set so she took the break. But I'm happy the way I came back into that match and to win it, yeah.  
 
Q. You have a good history at Australia. Are you feeling confident in this tournament? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I think my game is here. So the confidence is coming with Sydney last week, now these two matches behind me. Yeah, I feel the confidence is coming.  
 
Q. And your next opponent is Iva Majoli? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Yep.  
 
Q. What do you expect? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: I only played her once three or four years ago. I don't really know how she plays now. I haven't seen her play for a couple years. So, you know, I'm going to play my game anyway and be focused, yeah.  
 
Q. You withdrew from the adidas International because of your back. How do you feel? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: For the moment it's well. My back is okay. I don't feel the pain the way I'm serving right now. It's a little bit looser, I don't serve 100 percent but it's still very good. Hopefully it's gonna stay like this, yes.  
 
Q. Last year you played in Lebanon. How did you find that competition? Did you enjoy it? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, it was very hot and very humid. The conditions were very difficult, but the place was nice. Yeah, I enjoyed it.
