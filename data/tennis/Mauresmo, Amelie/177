AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I think especially the first set. It was very good. You know, I started the match very well, then beginning of second set I, you know, I let her play a little bit too much, wasn't aggressive enough. I didn't keep my focus up maybe enough in the beginning of the second set so she took the break. But I'm happy the way I came back into that match and to win it, yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I think my game is here. So the confidence is coming with Sydney last week, now these two matches behind me. Yeah, I feel the confidence is coming. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yep. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I only played her once three or four years ago. I don't really know how she plays now. I haven't seen her play for a couple years. So, you know, I'm going to play my game anyway and be focused, yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: For the moment it's well. My back is okay. I don't feel the pain the way I'm serving right now. It's a little bit looser, I don't serve 100 percent but it's still very good. Hopefully it's gonna stay like this, yes. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, it was very hot and very humid. The conditions were very difficult, but the place was nice. Yeah, I enjoyed it.
