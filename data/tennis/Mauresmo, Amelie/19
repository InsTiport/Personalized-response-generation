 Q. Do you feel like you were back to your best today? 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, pretty consistent, definitely. Very good match. And again, from the first point to the last one, very consistent. 
 I am not going to say every time I played a good match I'm back or I'm not back or it's the same or not the same. It's just the way it is for now, and I'm just very happy about the way I played. 
 I'm not really asking myself questions of "where am I?" I'm just enjoying and making sure that I know what's going on on the court, and why I'm playing good. I'll try to do this day-in and day-out.
