  Q. Are you satisfied with the result compared to last year's?
AMELIE MAURESMO: Yes, of course.
Q. What's the difference between the two matches?
AMELIE MAURESMO: I think it's mostly mental, mental difference. Also, I beat her at the beginning of the year, so it was good for the confidence because I had three losses against her, so it was good. Yeah, I'm very satisfied about the way I played today and how I handled the match from the first game to the last one.
