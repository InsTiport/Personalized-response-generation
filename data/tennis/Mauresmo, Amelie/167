AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, I'm not going to tell you what I did there (smiling). You know, it was very intense match for both of us, I think. You know, she improved probably since then. I hope I improve, too. You know, we'll see how it goes. I think I give it a shot. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yes, I'm satisfied. Nathalie is a tough player to play. You know, she doesn't have the usual game on the circuit. I think I handled it pretty well, especially in the third set where, you know, I had to keep my serve, and I did that very well, wait for the occasion to break her. Yeah, satisfied. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. You know, as I say, maybe I'm too much taking it match by match, so I don't really realize that this year in the Grand Slam I haven't been so far. I was in the fourth round at the Australian Open, but... You know, it's good. I'm happy about it. I don't want it to end, that's it (smiling). 

AMELIE MAURESMO: It's coming back. Obviously, it's very good for my confidence. Winning four matches in a row, today against a player that did a good match. You know, hopefully I'm ready to play against a player in the Top 5. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, I guess it's going to be in my mind, but I think it's going to be a different match. You know, different surface. It's her home country. It's going to be different match, that's for sure. We'll see. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Of course, it always helps when you know you can beat someone and you've beaten her. You know, I will just try to have in mind what I did last time and try to do the same. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I didn't know that (laughter).
