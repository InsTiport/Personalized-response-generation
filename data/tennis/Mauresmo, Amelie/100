AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, on my -- physically I feel great so far. I've been free of injuries for even last week and now I'm feeling pretty good physically. You know, need to get hopefully a few more matches to really I think feel a hundred percent on the court on my game. And talking about the fact that all the top players are here, I think really it's one of the most open tournament that we have. I think it's great that everybody's here - not only for us but of course for the media and for the spectators. You know, I feel that even though for the last couple years maybe not all of the top players were here, I still think it was -- it's already a big event and everybody's doing their best to be here and perform at their best level. It's even better that Justine is back from injury and Kim as well. Yeah, it's good. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: We'll see. We'll see. It's always tough to see until the end. I guess all these big tournaments are match after match, and that's what I'm trying to do. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I was still pretty confident about my game, about the way I play. I had to really forget about last week's disappointment pretty quickly and go back to practice to make sure all these little things that were wrong in Eastbourne went the right way today. And that's what I did. Yeah, very satisfied but not a big relief like if I was doubting a lot. You know, I knew my game was still there.
