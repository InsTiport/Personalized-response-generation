AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, very soon in that first set I was able to break her and that made it a little easier for me. Yeah, I was feeling very comfortable on the court again. Just the way I played in my first two matches, you know, taking control and I really was focusing on the big points. It went well. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. I don't know really how to say in English, but I had some eruptions of rash or hives. I don't know how you say. Yeah, skin problem. I had that a couple days ago in warm-up before my doubles match. Today in that second set, I couldn't really focus on what I had to do. But, you know, I think everything is going to be fine tonight and better tomorrow. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I really was in a big crisis after the singles, not being able to go back out there on the court and play the doubles. But, you know, again, I have tonight and the rest of the day for tomorrow to recover before the evening session. So hopefully it will be fine.
