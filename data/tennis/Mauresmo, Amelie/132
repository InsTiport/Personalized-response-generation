AMELIE MAURESMO: I think the game, the game is getting, again, tougher and tougher. The level has improved a lot for the last few years. We ask our bodies a lot - to practice, to play in competition, and we are trying to adjust the schedule to have some time off and make sure that we recover well, but sometimes it's not so easy. I think the game, it's the game that make us ask more and more. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: The only thing that I think that Larry and the WTA are working on is shorten the season, you know. Obviously, it finishes a little bit late. That's what he's been talking about a lot lately, and he's there, actually, trying to see how they can arrange that. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, not really. You just keep going, you forget about it. It's frustrating when it happens. It's a lot of disappointment. But, you know, once you go back on the court, you just want to play and forget about it and you go forward, because that's how it is and that's how it works in our world. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I have a physio traveling with me. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I used to sometimes have somebody, but I think I pay more attention now than before. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, no. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, just before the end of the first set, 5-all, I think was the time really I adjusted myself to the conditions and to this match. I think after that, I was really more effective on what I was doing and really going forward a little bit more, because I was staying back a little bit too much at the beginning. And she was playing well, and she took control of the game in the first couple games, so... Yeah, 5-all, I wanted to make the difference there. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I mean, we've grown up together. We know each other since we were probably 9 or 10. So, yeah, we practice a lot together. We are in the Fed Cup team, we are playing always together. So, you know, we know each other pretty well. It's never easy to play another French, you know, (inaudible). But that's how it is.
