AMELIE MAURESMO: Yes. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, you know, I've been feeling pretty good a couple years ago when I came to the semis, and couldn't come last year. But again this year, you know, I have some pretty good feeling and a good sensation on this surface. So, you know, it took me a few years to understand how to play on this surface, and now I'm starting to feel comfortable. So it's very good feeling actually. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. I still have -- there are still a few things I'm not pretty happy about, or at least that I can improve. But, you know, overall, it's pretty difficult to adjust on this surface. So I'm pretty happy about my all game. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Two years ago? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: It's comparable. I think I'm serving pretty well, pretty consistent going forward, go to the net. So I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that I'm feeling comfortable to go to the net, to volley. I'm enjoying myself doing that. So pretty much the same. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I heard that. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, it's a huge compliment. No question about that. Again, like I said a few days ago, to me she invented the game on this surface. So, you know, it's a compliment. There's no question about it, yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: So much attention, yeah. Well, actually I'm dealing a little bit better with that here because, of course, the attention is not on me. A lot of it is on Tim. Most of it is on the Williams sister, on the women's side. So it's pretty difficult, and actually I will maybe have to talk with him to see how he handles the pressure here maybe to help me at the French. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, actually I haven't seen her play so far in the tournament. But I guess my coach has. Yeah, with the score, except maybe today, I don't know if she played a good game, but she seemed to have a little bit more trouble going through her matches. But again, as you say, you know, it's match after match. I have a pretty tough opponent next time, so... 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Oh, yeah. I think it's another story now. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I think it's from me. Yeah, I think it's from me, my expectations. Of course, when there is a lot of talk about me outside, it's also a little bit more pressure. But most of it, obviously, I think comes from me, yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, I think we all feel some stress when you look at it, all the women players. Sometimes we have some trouble sometimes coming into a match and give hundred percent because of that. So I'm not -- I'm not the one that doesn't maybe handle it very well. I think we all have some trouble with that sometimes. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: A lot? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, I was expecting a tough match. I played her couple times on clay, which is obviously different. But she gave me some trouble already on clay. You know, I think seeing her play a little bit of that third set against Ruano Pascual, I had in my mind I had to go forward, take the advantage, take the opportunity of my game, of my aggressive game actually. And I served pretty well today also, which helped me a lot. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I had some occasions -- 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I had a lot of occasions on her serve, especially in that first and second service game for her. But I didn't get into frustration. I just was patient, and I thought, you know, it's going to come, my time is going to come on her serve. So that's what I felt. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: You know, it just doesn't, you know, inspire specifically my tennis. I think it's a way of life. You see things differently. Of course, you put things into perspective. Yeah, again, you see things differently, and you don't put maybe -- you put some priorities, I think. Probably enjoying what I do is now the priority when it was maybe sometimes the result and stuff. And also enjoy life, obviously. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Not anymore -- well, sometimes. But not on the court. I'm trying to focus on the game. But could happen. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Whoa. I'm not done yet (laughter). I'm not done with my career yet, so we'll maybe talk about that in a few years. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yes. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I had some trouble in Eastbourne during that semifinal against Daniela Hantuchova. You know, was a little up and down throughout this first week, especially with some cold and rain. You know, you have to go and warm up and then stop again. So it's a little bit better now actually. It's more prevention, I would say. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, obviously she's playing well. She's in big confidence. She played the semifinal at the French Open, and coming here already into the quarters. So, you know, she's more a clay-court type player. But obviously with the grass being a little slow here this year, she handles it very well. And I think I'm sure the doubles that she's No. 1 or No. 2, it helps her a lot, especially with the return. So it's going to be a tough one.
