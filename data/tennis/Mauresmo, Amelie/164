Q. Are you satisfied with your match, and are you pleased with your backhand? It worked out quite well. 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, of course I'm satisfied with my match. I think I played very good from the first point till the end. And, you know, all my game - especially my backhand - but all was working well today.  
 
Q. Did you overcome all your physical problems? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. It seems that it's going on well. And my neck is not so sore anymore. So, you know, I hope it's gonna stay like this.  
 
Q. Whom do you prefer for the next round? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: I don't care, really. I think they both play, you know, a similar game. And one is coming back; the other one is the top seed now. And, you know, I don't care. It's just I will take what comes.  
 
Q. Have you heard about Hingis? She might pull out of Roland Garros. 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: No, I didn't hear about this.  
 
Q. What's your relationship with the Roman public? Especially there was a bunch of Italian fans you had. Did you notice they had a flag? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, it's good. I mean, it feels great when you come in to a city and you have, you know, people that are cheering for you and behind you. It's always good.  
 
Q. Last year you lost to Dokic. Where do you think you can go this year? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: (Smiling). It's good. You know, I'm in the quarterfinals tomorrow. I just think I can go, you know, very far. Of course the last day again this year. But it's obviously a tough draw now. You know, it's difficult to say. I mean, we'll see. It's a couple of different things are going to come together and the best will win. Hopefully, it will be me.  
 
Q. Do you have something to say about the fact that Venus pulled out? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: No.
