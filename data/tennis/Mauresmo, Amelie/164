AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, of course I'm satisfied with my match. I think I played very good from the first point till the end. And, you know, all my game - especially my backhand - but all was working well today. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. It seems that it's going on well. And my neck is not so sore anymore. So, you know, I hope it's gonna stay like this. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I don't care, really. I think they both play, you know, a similar game. And one is coming back; the other one is the top seed now. And, you know, I don't care. It's just I will take what comes. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, I didn't hear about this. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, it's good. I mean, it feels great when you come in to a city and you have, you know, people that are cheering for you and behind you. It's always good. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: (Smiling). It's good. You know, I'm in the quarterfinals tomorrow. I just think I can go, you know, very far. Of course the last day again this year. But it's obviously a tough draw now. You know, it's difficult to say. I mean, we'll see. It's a couple of different things are going to come together and the best will win. Hopefully, it will be me. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No.
