Q. Are you happy with the way you are playing right now?

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, of course. Yeah, I am playing well. I am getting used to the
hard court, so it is good. I think the weather is very difficult, a lot of humidity. So
physically, I think I am in good shape also. So, yeah, I am happy.

Q. What part of the game that you really feel is good right now, serving or --

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I serve pretty well. I think my game comes from my forehand. I
dictate the game with my forehand and I feel it worked pretty well, quite complete.

Q. You have played quite a few matches over the last few days. Is that good, bad for
you?

AMELIE MAURESMO: It is good. I needed this. I lost first round in Montreal, so I needed
to play some matches. Tomorrow is going to be my third one, so, yeah, I like it before the
US Open. It is good.

Q. What were you hoping to accomplish this week, just to get practice time in or a lot
of --

AMELIE MAURESMO: Both. I was hoping to play a few matches, of course -- put a few
things in place in my game, and I think it worked pretty well.

Q. What do you think about tomorrow's match?

AMELIE MAURESMO: Who do you play?

Q. We don't know. Could be Jana Novotna.

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, it is going to be -- I think it is Jana or Chanda, right?

Q. Yeah.

AMELIE MAURESMO: So it is going to be interesting anyway. I have played Jana twice:
1-All, so...

Q. 0 and 2?

AMELIE MAURESMO: 1-All.

Q. When was the last time you played her?

AMELIE MAURESMO: In Berlin on clay in May, so, and interesting, yeah, I am looking
forward --

Q. You played well that last match against her? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I won that last match, but it was on clay so it is very
different.

Q. What do you have to do to beat her on hard surface?

AMELIE MAURESMO: I think first you get -- make her stay at the baseline as long as you
can, and then when she is at the net make her play, try to come to the net before her
sometimes. Don't let her know what you are going to do.

Q. What has been the big turnaround this year, from like 109 last year jumping all the
way through 32?

AMELIE MAURESMO: A year ago I changed my coach. I changed the way I was practicing and
now it starts to work.

Q. How do you practice different now?

AMELIE MAURESMO: Physically, I practice different. I don't lift weights. I just run.
Before I was very often injured, so, for one year now I haven't been injured. I hope it is
going to stay like this.

Q. What type of injuries were you having?

AMELIE MAURESMO: I had shoulder problems like for eight months. I had knee problems. I
had few things. So, couldn't really practice and play matches, play tournaments. So I have
been changing this. I have been changing my game also being more aggressive, going
forward. I think the result is coming.

Q. When you played Martina so close about a month ago, was that a big boost in your
confidence playing her that tight?

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I think it was -- yeah, it gave me a lot of confidence. I proved
to myself that I was able to play at the best level. The environment was very special. It
was Fed Cup and you have somebody on the chair next to you so it is different. But it give
me a lot of confidence, yeah.

Q. How have you done in the US Open in the past?

AMELIE MAURESMO: It is going to be my first time.

Q. That is got to be special?

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, because I was injured last year so I didn't play.

Q. You said that you stopped lifting weights in the last year?

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah.

Q. That has led you to having few injuries?

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah.

Q. How do you explain that, a lot of people saying weight training --

AMELIE MAURESMO: I think the way the program was made wasn't right. It was too much.
Just too much. 

Q. Who is your coach now?

AMELIE MAURESMO: Warwick Bashford (phonetic).

Q. As far as the weather is concerned, you said the humidity was a problem today?

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, because it makes your leg feel heavy. You have trouble moving.
You sweat a lot, so it is uncomfortable.

Q. You want to get in the match quickly and get it over quickly?

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, exactly. You don't want to stay too long on the court.

Q. Two straight sets got to be nice?

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah.
