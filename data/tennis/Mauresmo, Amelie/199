AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, of course. Yeah, I am playing well. I am getting used to the hard court, so it is good. I think the weather is very difficult, a lot of humidity. So physically, I think I am in good shape also. So, yeah, I am happy. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I serve pretty well. I think my game comes from my forehand. I dictate the game with my forehand and I feel it worked pretty well, quite complete. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: It is good. I needed this. I lost first round in Montreal, so I needed to play some matches. Tomorrow is going to be my third one, so, yeah, I like it before the US Open. It is good. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Both. I was hoping to play a few matches, of course -- put a few things in place in my game, and I think it worked pretty well. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Who do you play? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, it is going to be -- I think it is Jana or Chanda, right? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: So it is going to be interesting anyway. I have played Jana twice: 1-All, so... 

AMELIE MAURESMO: 1-All. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: In Berlin on clay in May, so, and interesting, yeah, I am looking forward -- 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I won that last match, but it was on clay so it is very different. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I think first you get -- make her stay at the baseline as long as you can, and then when she is at the net make her play, try to come to the net before her sometimes. Don't let her know what you are going to do. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: A year ago I changed my coach. I changed the way I was practicing and now it starts to work. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Physically, I practice different. I don't lift weights. I just run. Before I was very often injured, so, for one year now I haven't been injured. I hope it is going to stay like this. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I had shoulder problems like for eight months. I had knee problems. I had few things. So, couldn't really practice and play matches, play tournaments. So I have been changing this. I have been changing my game also being more aggressive, going forward. I think the result is coming. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I think it was -- yeah, it gave me a lot of confidence. I proved to myself that I was able to play at the best level. The environment was very special. It was Fed Cup and you have somebody on the chair next to you so it is different. But it give me a lot of confidence, yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: It is going to be my first time. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, because I was injured last year so I didn't play. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I think the way the program was made wasn't right. It was too much. Just too much. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Warwick Bashford (phonetic). 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, because it makes your leg feel heavy. You have trouble moving. You sweat a lot, so it is uncomfortable. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, exactly. You don't want to stay too long on the court. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah.
