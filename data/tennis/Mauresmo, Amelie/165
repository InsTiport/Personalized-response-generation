AMELIE MAURESMO: It's the same game I played from the beginning. I couldn't make it, even though I had some occasions in that second set. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, let's talk about the important things. My preparation wasn't sufficient. Physically it was hard for me to play in the second set because this is hard to play on this surface. You have to be physically fit in order to make your game. If your game is like mine, there's a lot of topspin. I had a match point, but I couldn't make it. I can't blame her. She saved it. I'm disappointed because I had my opportunities in the second set, then I lost my serve at very crucial moments in the match. That's it. After all, I think in the third set, I couldn't play my game anymore. I couldn't force my game upon her. I had played in Luxembourg last week, had I had a better preparation, I suppose it might have turned out differently. But that's it. Now I have to get in shape for the Fed Cup. That's the way the cookie crumbles. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yes, I had a thigh injury, a slight elongation. I had a pulled muscle. Well, I hoped I would be able to play Munich, preparation for Munich, then Fed Cup. I didn't have any limitations today physically. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yes, in the beginning. After, I was exhausted. I was down and out, I have to say. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No. Mentally, frankly, I thought I had to take some time off. I did too many things this season. I think I've understood a lot of things about myself, about the level I'm playing at, the work I did. It paid. Many things that went through my head, I had to digest all this, to cope with this. The end of this year has been a bit difficult for me, that's for sure. But I would rather be positive about the whole of the season. After all, it wasn't all that bad. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yes, I think, because my preparation is going to be extremely solid and serious, maybe more intense than last year. We'll see how next year takes off. My coach Jean-Claude, we're talking about this. If I do my work solidly, I don't see why I couldn't get to where I was at the beginning of this year, the first months of this year, and then why not go even further. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, no. I think they are all going to be tired in this competition - medically and mentally. But I think being on a team, playing for your country, there will be no reason for any lack of motivation.
