AMELIE MAURESMO: Just a Nike shirt (laughter). 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, not yet. I'm looking for one, so if you maybe know someone that could do that for me. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No. I just try to eat things that are good for the stomach, you know, not too aggressive, not too acid. Actually, it's much better than a few days ago. I'm still not a hundred percent. I mean, I need some energy back a little bit more. But it's very satisfying, yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Oh, it's good. I really wanted to make sure my game is here, you know, get some confidence, don't spend too much time on the court, you know, to don't try to burn the energy. Everything was good today. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I'm very happy to be here, first. I'm very happy to play another Grand Slam this year. I always enter these kind of tournaments with something in my head trying to win it. Of course, it makes a difference because two of the best players in the world are not here, so it might make it easier, even though a lot of good players are there. To be honest, I don't think too much about it. I just concentrate on what I have to do on each match. We'll see. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I think I need a few good more matches like this one I had today to, you know, build the confidence a little bit more. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: It's far from France (laughter). I mean, I'm doing better and better in Paris every year. But, yeah, it's a little bit more difficult for us French to play at the French. I don't know if there is an explanation. It's just in the body, in the emotion. I cannot really find some words to put onto that. It's difficult. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Here, yeah. Yeah, actually it's good for me. Surface is good. I'm getting used to all these distraction that are happening. So far it's okay.
