AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I think it took me a little time to, you know, find my rhythm. Playing at night, it's not the same, quite the same. Just took me a few games to get in that match. But then I think I played good tennis. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I think so. Some very long points. Try to stay in the rhythm in the match, try to put the ball back in longer than her. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: You know, it's not the same for me. You know, the pressure is not the same also. I think I was maybe less -- I felt less tension today than I did at the French Open. But both matches I think I played pretty good tennis, today also. You know, good. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, it's what I expected. I know her. I know how she plays. I know how she hits the ball. She can hit it very hard. But we know each other for a few years now, so I knew how she plays, what I have to do to beat her. I think it happened the way I wanted. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, you know, it was a little bit of a surprise to do what I did at the Australian Open. After that, I think I confirmed it very well in the Paris Open, and then in Rome when I reached the Top 10. You know, I think I can play this level very, very often now. That's what I'm trying to do, even though I'm coming back from a long rest. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I'm sure it wasn't the same like a few years ago, like Martina Navratilova said. I think people are growing in their mind. I'm coming today, so I don't know what it would have been a few years earlier. I think, of course, I benefit from what they did. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, I like it. It's true, it's very fast, very fast hard court. I think it's okay for my game. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Sorry? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Injury. I twist my ankle, so I had to rest for a long time. It was a bit of both. It was good.
