AMELIE MAURESMO: I got a little bit impatient. I wanted to -- I thought I could finish the point earlier. Yeah, that is it. I thought I could do better than I should. Then I got into it, finally found my rhythm and did better the second set. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Should be no difference. I mean, I tried to play same game as I played last time I played against her. As I told you in the beginning, it didn't work because I wasn't doing the right thing. But then when I got into this game, it worked. She was staying right at the baseline. She was not coming in. Me, I was coming in even more than her sometimes. So no big difference. Maybe on grass it would be different. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I don't know if I would have won the match. But I could have won it. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I think she was also getting tired a little bit. So, yeah, I mean, third set was anybody's match. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, it was a little bit frustrating, that is true. But I think I handled it well afterwards. I was winning my service game pretty easily, I would say. No, it didn't affect me so much. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I think she played two, three good points. She made two passing shots on important points. I made a doublefault. That makes the difference. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, I think she was already playing well when -- I played her just before the French Open, she was already playing well. Of course, winning Wimbledon and getting this confidence makes probably the difference on the important points. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, it is coming. It is getting better and mentally I am getting stronger. I know that my game is here so I just have to keep playing like this. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I think it is going to take a few more matches at this level. Getting into the match quicker, sooner and, yeah, I mean, matches at this level, this rhythm, then I should be all right. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, it would be third round so, -- 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, it would be a good thing, but, you know, I take match by match and first I play qualifier, then we will see. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, you never know....
