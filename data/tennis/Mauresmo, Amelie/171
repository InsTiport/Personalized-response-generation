AMELIE MAURESMO: To improve my game? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I played perfectly. I feel I played a good match, and I was there mentally and physically in the important moments. So that probably made the difference today. I still probably have to improve -- I had some up and downs sometimes, you know, some games I just lost (inaudible) games so on these things I'm sure I can improve. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, for me it was different. I start the match much better than I did last time, you know, being very relaxed and just playing my game. I know how she plays, she knows how I play, so, you know, trying to make the right shot at the right time to not let her come in, you know, she likes to dictate the game. So I was trying to just not let her do that. And, you know, I think I played better tennis this time. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I saw just a little bit of the first semifinal because I was just focusing on the time, not really on the game. (Inaudible.) I think Dokic is playing very well these days. Beating Conchita two easy sets on clay court is not easy. So, you know, looking forward for this one. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: (Smiling.) I know, I know, but it's always the same question. It's work. I mean, it's no secret. Being more relaxed, I mean you can see on the court I'm much more relaxed than I used to be. I play -- I'm more confident in my game, I know how to play and I know what my game is now. So, you know, physically I feel good, everything's going well.
