AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, it was kind of a little bit up-and-down. I had some very good moments. I had some maybe less better ones. You know, I think she played a good match today also. Very tough, the conditions and everything. But it was for both, of course. Yeah, a bit disappointing. But I'm going to -- surely I'm going to learn lessons from this match. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, it's kind of tough, of course. You don't know if you're going to get on or not, if it's going to rain again or not. But it's for both players, so I guess it's the same. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: You think we have the same kind of game? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No. She's not the only girl to play with a lot of topspin. You have to get used to every kind of game that you have to face. You have to adapt. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, never. It was the first time. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: You know, you don't have anything to lose anyway, so you come back on court, you're okay. That's the way it is. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, I think I made a very good first game. I don't know, I had the feeling the umpire and everything, I was thinking a little bit too much of what happened in the first game in my head. I guess it took me a few games to come back in the match, I think. During this match, I didn't have really, you know, confidence in the people. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: In the first game? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I don't even remember. I don't know. I asked her, "So the machine doesn't work, so we switch it off." She said, "No, we're going to try again," something like that. I don't remember. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, you know, as I said last time, I don't really know why it happens that there is so many French players, women, in the Top 20 or Top 40. What I know is it's not a bad thing. It's good because we all trying to be better and better every tournament, do better than the others. I can't really explain it, but I think it's good. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I don't know what they do in other countries, but I don't think so. I don't feel like I did.
