AMELIE MAURESMO: Not really. But, yeah, my goal is still the same: to go a little bit further in these events. You know, I don't feel more pressure here than Wimbledon or the Australian Open. French Open is a little different for me. But, yeah, I want to go one step or two further. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Tradition. It's more a show here, I think. It's more of a big, big show. Here in the States, you know, people only look at the US Open, and that's the main event for them. I mean, for us it's one of the big ones. Of course, you want to do well. But, yeah, to me the special thing here is the show. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: A little bit, yeah. You have so many other sports, like basketball, hockey, the baseball also is very big here. In Europe or even in Australia, there's really a big thing with tennis, which doesn't really happen here except for two weeks. Yeah, I agree with that. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Of course. You want to make sure that tennis is known here the way it should be and the way it is in Europe or even other countries. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yes. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Not really. Not really. Again, I don't feel the pressure of being No. 2 or No. 3 seed or whatever. Again, my goal is still the same coming here as it was going to Wimbledon or the other Grand Slams. I want to go to the end and try to get that trophy. The same for me. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, my serve was pretty good today. I felt very comfortable on that side of the game. The rest, I think I made too many errors and let her come back into that first set where I shouldn't have. You know, it's the first rounds, never easy. I guess I have a few things to adjust in my game. But overall, you know, good start of the tournament. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. It's about the same as last year. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: You know, probably mentally, try to be more confident with myself and change probably a few things when I get to the last round. We'll see when I get there. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: The way of playing, being more aggressive probably, taking advantage, try to take more control of the game where I used to probably be little wait -- wait a little bit and these kind of things.
