AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, it is a big disappointment. You know, especially 7-6 in that third set. The way I thought, you know, I had some occasions I didn't take. So I am pretty disappointed with that and a little bit angry with myself as well, not being able to take these opportunities. Because I felt that at some points during the match I had some good occasions, but didn't make it. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, but it's not so easy to return her serve. And I'm not happy with my net game. She passed me really well. But I thought I should have done better with that. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Oh, I don't ask myself that question right now. Right now, I just feel very, you know, very disappointed. But it's just the game, you know. You ask all the players, we all had at some points matches we should have won and we didn't and that's the game, and that's just the way sport is. Otherwise, you know, if everything was written before, we don't need to play. So that's just the way it is. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No. With a victory you mean today? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, I didn't know. I knew if I was winning the tournament I would be No. 1. But, no, I don't - how you say? - I don't calculator, you know, I'm not in my room doing the... 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, you know, you just have to adjust to that. In the same time, sometimes she serve 100, sometimes it's slow, sometimes it's spin, sometimes it's flat. You have to adjust. Everybody's talking about her serve, but she still make the semifinal, maybe more, was the final of the French. So after that, you know, she reacts very quickly after. I think her serve is maybe little weak, but then she's very quick and very aware that she's gonna have to play a nice shot after. And that she did pretty well today, I think. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No. No, no. I just wanted to be aggressive on the serve. I wanted to make sure I, you know, I was going in. But, again, my net game and going forward wasn't good enough today. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: It is something I want to reach; it is something I want to achieve. What can I say? It's just I hope it's gonna happen very soon. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I don't think so. Probably at the French is one of the -- probably the reason I am not able of giving 100 percent there. But I don't think so for the rest. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Maybe, yeah. I mean, it would be great anyway. Just coming out of here or anywhere else, I think when you reach that No. 1 spot, it's great. But I would have loved to do it with, you know, in a good way. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I don't -- I don't know, really, because it's probably too early to say. But I just didn't handle that tiebreaker very well and made too many errors, especially on the return of serve. You know, she played well sometimes as well. But I don't know. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, I need to -- because the disappointment is so big, you know, so I need to calm down a little bit and have a talk with my coach and make sure we see things clearly and, you know, make sure we don't analyze too fast or whatever. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: How concerning? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, it's difficult, you know, to hang in there. It's a crucial moment. It's very tough to stay focused. But that I was able to do, to keep my serve at 5-4 and keep going with the match. So it's not the reason I lost. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, I think, you know, I think I played -- again, I think -- I don't know how to say. But now, I feel I lost the match, you know. That's the -- my thinking now. I don't know. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, some occasions I had to really put this match away, and I didn't do it. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, no, I didn't expect to win because of that, no. I wanted to -- didn't go through my mind.
