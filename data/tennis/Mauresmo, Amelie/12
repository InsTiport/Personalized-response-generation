 THE MODERATOR: AmÃ©lie Mauresmo. Questions, please.   
  
  Q. The roof, how did that feel?   
 AMÃLIE MAURESMO: It makes the conditions a little bit different. It does. I would say the ball is flying a little bit more. That's how I felt. And we both kind of took a little time to adjust. Then was okay.   
 But, yeah, I would say it's flying more. And then visually when the ball is in the air and when you have the overhead or stuff, it's very bright. It's really bright.   
 But, no, it's good. It's a plus, definitely, for the tournament to be able to play. Of course, we haven't seen really bad days so far in the tournament. But I remember a few editions of Wimbledon when we would really have needed a roof. So it's a good thing.   
  
  Q. In terms of having to go off court in the past because it's a rain interruption, and then coming back into the normal court, going off and coming back into a different arena, do you find that...   
 AMÃLIE MAURESMO: You have to adjust quickly, that's for sure. I mean, I was expecting a little different conditions, so I was trying to really, from the first moments, first balls I was going to hit at the warmup, to see what is different and what I have to adapt.   
 It's not a big deal. But, yeah, it's just a little feel, a different feel. But the time in between, I think it's decent. It's not that quick, but it's not that bad. I mean, I don't know how long we were off the court actually.   
  
  Q. Half an hour.   
 AMÃLIE MAURESMO: That was fine.
