AMELIE MAURESMO: I think today was okay, I can feel a little something in my leg, but not enough to make me play worse or whatever. It stays the same for the moment. Not perfect, but good enough. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, I don't know if it has been up-and-down. I had a very good beginning of the season. I've been injured at the French Open. That's quite a big thing. Coming back here, you know, in good health enough to play good matches is very important for me. My goal for this year is still the same, meaning The Masters at the end of the year. You know, it's good to come back. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. I think people appreciate that I've been honest with them. You know, they're behind me. I guess some are not behind me also. At least I only see the good ones. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Same. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: It's good. It's good now. No more problems. I think I'm moving well. I've been moving well today. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: You know, to get my confidence back, I will have to maybe play a few more matches, win a couple of those, and it will come back anytime. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: As a professional, yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Uh-huh. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: It's not so much playing a second US Open. My confidence is not here because of the ankle and because of the injury. It's true I feel good here, a surface I feel good on. I think I need more matches. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. I think I can play well on this surface, sure. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: It was good. I was pretty tense before this match because I didn't know how physically I would stay in the match and mentally. I'm very happy to win this one. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Winds, yeah, is difficult to handle. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I was just playing, you know, to try to put the ball in. With the wind and everything, it wasn't very easy. I think she made some mistakes. I made some big ones, too. Not an easy condition to play in. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Probably
