AMELIE MAURESMO: I felt okay. I had a pretty good start. I felt I was in control in the first four or five games. You know, was pretty difficult again today with the wind. I guess on the Court No. 1, it's even more windy 'cause, you know, you don't have as many seats. So, no, I'm just happy to go through. I'm happy to have the opportunity to play better tennis tomorrow. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: For me? Does it take time for me? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Usually, it's okay. I adjust to this surface pretty quickly normally. I guess that's what I did in Perth last week, and also here this week. So, hopefully, I'm gonna -- Melbourne is not gonna be a lot different, I guess. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, it takes a little time. But in Perth, even if I played my matches indoor, I practiced outside, yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: With Schiavone? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: She has the type of game that she stays in the back, she's trying to put a lot of spin also on her shots. She's playing a little different from what we're used to see in the women's tour. You know, I don't think I've played her already, I think. I think it's our first meeting. So, you know, I'm gonna talk about it with my coach tonight or tomorrow morning. And, you know, I just have to focus on what I have to do, I guess, and don't think too much about who is in front of me. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I think in my head I didn't really have a break after Fed Cup. So I kind of kept my focus up and kept practicing well. So I think I'm still on that roll a little bit.
