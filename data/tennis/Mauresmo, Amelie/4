  THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English. 

Q.   Welcome to British tennis. 
    AMÃLIE MAURESMO:   Thanks.

Q.   What was the moment when you thought that you would take over as coach of Andy Murray?   What is it about the job that is fascinating to you?
    AMÃLIE MAURESMO:   Andy contacted me a few weeks ago and we started to talk about this possibility to work, to be working together.   It's not really something that I was thinking doing when I stopped being a tennis player.
    Then we talked again a little bit more about how to do the things maybe about his game, about different things.
    We came up with the will from both sides to, yeah, to give it a shot.

Q.   Could you talk a bit about the fact ‑‑ obviously you're a woman, he's a man.   Do you consider that of any relevance, or do you see it possibly as a positive advantage for you?
    AMÃLIE MAURESMO:   I would say that, yeah, I mean, it's probably something that have to you ask him at some point why he made this choice.   We all know his mother was a big part of his tennis career.
    I think he's maybe looking for something different, about emotions and sensitive things.   It's not really interesting for me, this part of the story, to be honest.   All I'm interested in is to be able to help him in his goals.   That's about it.   The rest is the story for you to write, I guess. 
    But, yeah, for me it's a challenge.   I want to take it.

Q.   Can you tell us what areas of Andy's game you believe you can be the most help to him in?
    AMÃLIE MAURESMO:   I don't think I'm going to go into these details right now.   I think we really get to know each other, really get to start, and actually start working together. 
    We'll maybe talk about it at some point.

Q.   He had obviously choices and people to consider.   When he contacted you the first time, did he say, AmÃ©lie, the reason I decided that you would be the right person is because you could bring me this or this that?   Did he give you a reason why he thought of you?
    AMÃLIE MAURESMO:   Yeah, he did.

Q.   Can you tell us what it is?
    AMÃLIE MAURESMO:   Not really (Laughter). Not really.
    I mean, maybe he will tell you at some point.

Q.   Have you watched his game much over the years?   Did you have any sort of relationship with him?   Were you surprised when he rang?
    AMÃLIE MAURESMO:   We didn't really talk to each other more than just greeting each other and stuff.   I have watched him play, yes, many times.
    Again, we have talked a little bit already about his game.   We definitely going to get more into this very soon, I guess.

Q.   Were you surprised when he rang?
    AMÃLIE MAURESMO:   It was a little bit of a surprise, yes.   To be honest, yes. 

Q.   This will obviously get a lot of attention because you are a woman going to be coaching a top man.   Do you think it is an important step for men's sport for somebody to make this decision?
    AMÃLIE MAURESMO:   Again, I mean, I guess it is a big story to write on and a step forward.
    But honestly, it's not my big concern right now.   I'm happy about this new challenge.   I want to help Andy.   It's the only thing that I have in mind right now.

Q.   I think the reason why Andy stopped working with Ivan Lendl is Ivan said he didn't have enough time to spend with him.   You will be available to travel with Andy throughout the year, will you?
    AMÃLIE MAURESMO:   We have already, yes, talked about this.   Yeah, not the whole year, not as full‑time, but, yes, significant amount of weeks that we have agreed on and should be good for everyone.

Q.   From your point of view, what do you expect to achieve with Andy and what would make the job a success for you?
    AMÃLIE MAURESMO:   Well, it's quite easy for me to answer this, and he's very open on this.   He wants to win more Grand Slam or Grand Slams, so I guess that's what it is.

Q.   You were in a comfortable position as a TV consultant. 
    AMÃLIE MAURESMO:   Yeah, I was sitting.   Now I will be... 

Q.   You will have almost the same pressure as Andy.   The expectations will be high.   So what was the reason for you to accept such a tough challenge?
    AMÃLIE MAURESMO:   First of all, I think he has the most pressure.   That's for sure when you're a player, and I know what it is.   You have huge pressure on your shoulders.   This will remain this way. 
    Yes, it will change a little bit my life and my retirement, let's say.   But I'm passionate.   I'm passionate about this sport.   I love challenges. 
    I don't know, I guess I like to put myself on the line at some point and see what I can do.

Q.   We all know that since Billie Jean, a big part of the WTA, has been about the empowerment of women and opportunities.   We all know also it's extremely difficult for WTA players.   What were your thoughts that Ernests Gulbis made the other day that he would not want his sisters to go into tennis and that it's very tough and they should be focusing on families?
    AMÃLIE MAURESMO:   I know him a little bit.   I think you guys also know him quite a lot.   He's provocative at some point.   I'm not sure he was really thinking this way.
    He explained a little bit later why he said this.   I'm not really ‑‑I'm not shocked by this because I know him.   I know how he is. 

Q.   How long is your commitment with Andy?
    AMÃLIE MAURESMO:   We are going to do the grass court season and we will talk after that.
    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French. 

Q.   You're going to be the coach for a British player.   We might wonder if a French player has ask for the same type of thing.   Why a foreigner?   Is it because the French players wouldn't come to you?
    AMÃLIE MAURESMO:   No, that's true.   I have never received such a request from a French player.

Q.   What about female players?
    AMÃLIE MAURESMO:   No.   Marion wanted to, but we were not compatible.   Let's put it this way.

Q.   What's the reason?   Why did you say yes to Andy?
    AMÃLIE MAURESMO:   Well, as I have said, it's a huge challenge.   Well, there was no option, you know.   It was an option for me.   When I stopped my career I didn't really intend to travel and to be on the tour again.
    And then we met.   We discussed.   Then we discussed again deeper with more details.   I listened to him and his expectations in a way, and, you know, we're going to start this way. 
    I'll see.   I'll see if this is something which ‑‑oh, shit.   Oh, shit.   (Announcement interruption).
    Well, that's it.   No, well, as I said, I'll see if I enjoy it, if he likes it, and then we'll see if it will be as simple as that.

Q.   What do you think you can give him?
    AMÃLIE MAURESMO:   Well, it's difficult to say, you know, and to give all the details.   But I have experience.   I'm a player who has good experience.   He's interested in that.   I have a view on tennis. 
    And also, you know, on many details, daily things, which maybe will help.

Q.   Now, what about the Fed Cup?   You're captain.   What about this?
    AMÃLIE MAURESMO:   Well, nothing's going to change for the Fed Cup.   First we have to discuss this with the girls at Wimbledon before the tournament starts.
    You know, normally, logically I wanted to do this here with the girls, but we couldn't meet.   It's a good thing.   You know, it's been two years.   It's a good thing to take a rest, to see where we're going to go, if we all want to continue together, etcetera.
    But, you know, I was thinking, Well, I'm not going to say it's either Fed Cup or Andy Murray.   I never thought that things would be this way.
    If everything goes on smoothly, if everybody wants to continue, we can continue this way. 

Q.   You're one of the first women or the first woman to be a coach for a top‑10 player.   What would you say about this?
    AMÃLIE MAURESMO:   Nothing.   Well, you know, I know it's a major event in a way in the world of tennis ‑ in the world of sports, as well. 
    But, you know what?   As I have said before, it's a challenge.   It's a professional goal for me.   This is what I'm interested in.   It's not an easy thing.   It's not simple.
    I have to live up to this challenge.   I'll dedicate all of my energy and focus on this, and then if we can manage to change the situation, that's a good thing.

Q.   Now, the Toulouse is your commitment, as well.   That should move to the town of Toulouse.   Would you say this will change your involvement with the Toulouse tournament? 
    AMÃLIE MAURESMO:   Well, that's a question mark on this event, so I'll say we'll talk about this in due time, when the time comes.   Maybe we'll have to make a decision one day, but we have not yet reached this stage.

Q.   Have you spoken with Ivan Lendl?   If yes, what has he said?   If no, are you going to talk to him?
    AMÃLIE MAURESMO:   No, I have not discussed with Ivan Lendl, but maybe I'll do it. 

Q.   Andy won Wimbledon; he's won everything; there is a lot of pressure.   What about you?   What about you?
    AMÃLIE MAURESMO:   Well, you know, the whole point is for him to win more Grand Slams.   Of course he's going to defend his title at Wimbledon.   That's his No. 1 priority.   It's not going to be something easy. 
    I'll help him as best as I can.   Then when he contacted me, the point is not to say, Okay, it has to work immediately from the word "go."     No, the thing is that we want to do something in the midterm, you see, because, you know, miracles, no, they don't happen, not overnight.
    Even though you can give him, I don't know, new dynamics, it will not happen overnight.
    I want the best for him.   So that's good.

Q.   (Off microphone.)
    AMÃLIE MAURESMO:   I don't know.   We can discuss this afterwards.

Q.   Was he the one who decided to get in touch with you?   Did you hesitate before you said yes to Andy?
    AMÃLIE MAURESMO:   Well, no, I'm not going to sing.   He contacted me directly and then we had these discussions.   We decided to choose this period on grass.

Q.   What do you feel right now? 
    AMÃLIE MAURESMO:   Well, it's warm, rather warm.   No, you know, I'm eager.   I'd like to start immediately.   This is what I feel.   You know, we're discussing this.   It's very abstract. 
    Well, it's going to become more concrete.   But you know what I like?   Is to get my hands on things and to act.   So we have to move forward.

Q.   Now, if this works out well, would you say you're ready to take your bag, your rucksack, and follow him like a coach 100% of the time on the circuit?
    AMÃLIE MAURESMO:   No, I don't want to work full time.   If it's halftime, half a year, that's not bad.
