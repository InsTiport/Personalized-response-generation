AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I lost when I lost that second set probably. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: 7-6. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: 7-6 was the most important. Still, when I had to play the tiebreak, I thought, "I could win this one." Beginning of the third set, it was getting very difficult for me physically. With yesterday's match, I guess I would have needed some extra energy I think. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, was a little bit tight this morning when I woke up, but it has nothing to do with the loss. It's just being tired in like all the body. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I'm very disappointed, of course. You know, I could feel I could win this match and... So, yeah, what can I say? Just I'm disappointed. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: But I was really pushing, pushing, pushing, so it doesn't surprise me that suddenly I didn't have enough energy. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: This morning (laughing). No, but, you know, I knew it was gonna be tough, but probably the second set was getting very tough. But, you know, that's just the way it is. She had an easier match than me yesterday and it's good for her, you know. You've got to give her credit to stay in that match and finally win it. So that's the way it is. You know, hopefully next time it's gonna go my way. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, I just really wanted to start like this and take control of the game. That's what I did very well, actually, from the beginning. You know, I just was very relaxed and not too much tension and so I could play my game and do it the way I wanted to do it. You know, just she stayed in there and this is the way it is. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, I don't think so. I took every -- I think in the game I took every opportunity that I had, and I don't have to regret anything. Just, yeah, I think, you know, again, it's probably a little bit down physically. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, it's a rule that is in effect sometimes in the year when it's very hot. It wasn't the first time. So I took it, you know, to try to get the energy back, but didn't work (smiling). 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I think so. I think I've played a lot of matches. I think I have my rhythm in the game. Now I think I need to recover for a few days and, you know, start practice again at Roland Garros. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Just try to get the experience from the past years and try to also realize that you have to take it as a normal, like, all year tournament. You know, try to do your best for this. Of course there's gonna be some pressure, but you also have to handle that, and I'll try to do that. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Who? (Laughter). 

AMELIE MAURESMO: "Ex President," is that what you said? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: The former one, no. I wasn't aware. I didn't see him. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Of playing at the French? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: That's what I'm gonna try to do, of course. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I think it's possible, but you just have to take it as it comes and really don't try to think too much and handle, again, the pressure, you know. We'll see...
