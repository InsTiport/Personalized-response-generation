AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, it was still a tough one, and I was expecting a tough one actually. You know, with her serve, it's so difficult to break her and to really be able to get into the game and into the rhythm because she's been playing well for the last couple months and she keeps playing some good tennis and some high-level tennis out there. So she made it very difficult, but I'm very proud of the way I hang in there. And even though I was a break down early in that first set, I really am proud of this. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Big relief, you know, having, for sure, a medal. I don't know (smiling). It's a great moment in an athlete's career. I think it's really great to have these kind of emotions. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, but I think we both want to still have that gold medal. It's going to be a big fight tomorrow. She has the experience of these kind of finals. Maybe I have a little less experience, but I'm, you know -- we will want -- both, we will want that gold medal for sure. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Oh, yeah, probably. But really the main goal coming here - and it was the goal before I even reach the semifinal - was to get that gold. So it's still there.
