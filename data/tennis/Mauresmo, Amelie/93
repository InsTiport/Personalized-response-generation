AMÃLIE MAURESMO: It's good. Obviously, just not spending too much time on the court is an advantage when you play these kind of tournaments, when you have to go out every day. But, you know, also because I haven't played for a month in competition, I like to be maybe tested a little bit more so that, you know, I can really know where I am in terms of, you know, physical training and everything. 

AMÃLIE MAURESMO: I think I played better than my first match. You know, I had a few things I have to adjust after the first round. I felt everything was working pretty well today. I know her very well also. I know the way she plays, which is very, you know, different from the other players. So, you know, I was not surprised at all by what she did, and I knew exactly what I had to do to really put her into trouble. So it was good. 

AMÃLIE MAURESMO: As you can see, you know, she's variating (sic) a lot. Varying (smiling)? Varying a lot, especially on the backhand side with the topspin and the slice, she's capable of doing both. We've seen a few dropshots as well. On the forehand side putting in a lot of topspin. On the tour, the girls, most of them play pretty flat on both sides. I think, you know, it's an advantage at some point when you're capable of doing both. So that's the difference with her and the other player. I know -- you know, I knew if I was overpowering her, making her run, don't let her dictate the game with her forehand, I would, you know, be probably a good match for me. 

AMÃLIE MAURESMO: When have you seen me last time (smiling)? 

AMÃLIE MAURESMO: I'm sure you just ask these questions because of what have been wrote in the papers, not because you've seen me. 

AMÃLIE MAURESMO: You've seen pictures, but you haven't seen me, for sure, real before. 

AMÃLIE MAURESMO: Because, you know, I'm doing more weight lifting now than I used to, but I lost little bit of weight. Maybe that's what made the difference. A lot of things has been written about me, about my physical looking or whatever. So sometimes it goes to your mind, and you just suppose things, but you're not really sure about it. 

AMÃLIE MAURESMO: Maybe I'm not the right person to talk about. Ask to people who have seen me maybe change. I don't know. I don't think I've changed a lot, except maybe losing some weight.
