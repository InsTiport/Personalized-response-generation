AMELIE MAURESMO: It's an infection, food infection. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yes. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, a little bit. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yesterday. It happened yesterday in the morning, then got worse today. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. It's tough to play in a match against, you know, a tough player like Jennifer when you're not a hundred percent. There is no point. I tried, but doesn't make sense, I think. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I was trying few different things, see what could maybe work the best. I wasn't good enough in any kind of game. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, food infection, yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Doesn't really matter, I think (laughter). 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, it's not tougher each time. It's just very tough, very frustrating every time you have to go out of court without giving your best, you know. So it's never an easy decision to take. I mean, to me, there's no point being on the court and not being able to give, you know, the first for me. I just don't want to take any risk or whatever. There was no point I think staying on the court for me today, tonight. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No. I was hoping maybe to move a little bit better, to try a few things. But it wasn't the case. Just wasn't the case. I tried. What else can you do? You just have to go out there, try, see how it goes. It wasn't good enough. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: A few games. You see very quickly when you're going to be able to keep the level, to have a real fight with the opponent or when you feel like it's not going to be enough. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: No, I asked if she had other medicine that could maybe do something, miracle, make a miracle, you know, which she didn't have apparently (smiling). 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I think it's Monday. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I hope. Yeah, I hope this kind of thing doesn't last too long. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I mean, she played a good match, you know, very solid. She took the opportunities that she had. She was probably playing better than in -- I mean, than the last round. I didn't see her first round, but I saw a little bit of her last round. I think she was, yeah, playing some good tennis. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I heard that. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Nothing much. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I don't know. We all have our injuries. I don't see any particular reason why they have these kind of injuries. You know, that's just the way it is. That's sport. We have sometimes to deal with these things.
