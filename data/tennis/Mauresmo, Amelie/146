Q. So what's the problem? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: It's an infection, food infection.  
 
Q. Bad stomach? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Yes.  
 
Q. Makes it hard to run? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, a little bit.  
 
Q. When did that happen? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Yesterday. It happened yesterday in the morning, then got worse today.  
 
Q. Very disappointing? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah. It's tough to play in a match against, you know, a tough player like Jennifer when you're not a hundred percent. There is no point. I tried, but doesn't make sense, I think.  
 
Q. You seemed to be most effective when you tried a bit of serve and volley today. Is that kind of a desperation? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I was trying few different things, see what could maybe work the best. I wasn't good enough in any kind of game.  
 
Q. Do you know if you have food poisoning or just a stomach virus? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, food infection, yeah.  
 
Q. What did you eat yesterday? What should we avoid? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Doesn't really matter, I think (laughter).  
 
Q. This is the fourth time this year you've had to not finish a match. Is it tougher each time you can't complete a match? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: No, it's not tougher each time. It's just very tough, very frustrating every time you have to go out of court without giving your best, you know. So it's never an easy decision to take. I mean, to me, there's no point being on the court and not being able to give, you know, the first for me. I just don't want to take any risk or whatever. There was no point I think staying on the court for me today, tonight.  
 
Q. Did you go out there and just hope that Jennifer had a bad day? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: No. I was hoping maybe to move a little bit better, to try a few things. But it wasn't the case. Just wasn't the case. I tried. What else can you do? You just have to go out there, try, see how it goes. It wasn't good enough.  
 
Q. How long did it take you to realize it wasn't going to happen for you? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: A few games. You see very quickly when you're going to be able to keep the level, to have a real fight with the opponent or when you feel like it's not going to be enough.  
 
Q. What took place during that injury time-out, when the trainer came out? What did you say? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: No, I asked if she had other medicine that could maybe do something, miracle, make a miracle, you know, which she didn't have apparently (smiling).  
 
Q. When is your first-round match in The Open? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: I think it's Monday.  
 
Q. Do you think you'll be all right by then? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: I hope. Yeah, I hope this kind of thing doesn't last too long.  
 
Q. Can you talk about Jennifer tonight? Seems like she's getting stronger. 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I mean, she played a good match, you know, very solid. She took the opportunities that she had. She was probably playing better than in -- I mean, than the last round. I didn't see her first round, but I saw a little bit of her last round. I think she was, yeah, playing some good tennis.  
 
Q. You know Venus Williams has dropped out of the US Open. 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I heard that.  
 
Q. What do you think about that? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Nothing much.  
 
Q. Doesn't matter to you either way? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah.  
 
Q. Do you think the kind of game that she and Serena play, hard, physical game, just takes too much of a toll on their bodies after a while? 
 
 AMELIE MAURESMO: I don't know. We all have our injuries. I don't see any particular reason why they have these kind of injuries. You know, that's just the way it is. That's sport. We have sometimes to deal with these things.
