  Q. Why do you need so much time to finish your match?
AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, because I couldn't make it much in the second set and, you know, she fought very hard and very well as she always does. Then I got a little bit tense, but, you know, I'm very happy. I went through mentally in the third set to make it 6-4.
Q. You came to the same point of last year, you are now at the same point. What do you think you have to do more this year than last year to do better?
AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, you know, maybe mentally I'm a little bit stronger. In one year I learned a lot with all the tournaments that I've played, so I hope it's going to make a difference tomorrow.
Q. Does beating someone who's won Roland Garros three times give you extra confidence yourself going in there now?
AMELIE MAURESMO: Well, I didn't think about it when I went on the court today, but of course it's always good. She's a great player, claycourt player, and it's always tough to beat her, as it was today again. So I'm very happy about this, and of course I think it's going to give me confidence.
Q. Are you satisfied by your game, technically speaking?
AMELIE MAURESMO: Sorry?
Q. Are you satisfied with your game technically speaking at the moment?
AMELIE MAURESMO: Yes, I'm satisfied, but I think I still have some work to do on different points, and, you know, it's always good to win even though you're not completely satisfied. But I mean the most satisfying thing today was mental and physical, yes.
