AMELIE MAURESMO: I'm happy. No, I'm pretty happy about the way I played, the way I handled this match. You know, I didn't know her. I didn't know how she was playing. Obviously, she's hitting the ball very well. So happy about this one. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, it's coming. It's coming. You know, first match on grass wasn't easy. Got better today. I was really, you know, focused on what I had to do, especially my service games. Everything went well. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: You know, still the same, taking match by match. I don't even know who I play next match. Just taking it as it comes. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, I think I'm in a different position now. I maybe control my game a little bit better. But I think my form is coming anyway. Hopefully with the matches, you know, it's going to get better and better. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: You know, I got known a little bit more. I had to work still a lot on my game and on every part of my game, and even mentally, you know, I wasn't maybe strong enough, at least wasn't feeling as good as I feel now. I still had a lot of work to do. Everything change, I think. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: It was okay. I mean, I had a little pressure after the Australian Open, then I didn't do so well, so I don't have the pressure anymore. This year, it's all coming together. Hopefully it's going to last. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I think mentally I wasn't consistent enough in my game to just hope to perform always at the best level. As I say, it's coming together this year, so it's good. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: With? 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yes. It was some good times and some bad times I had to go through. Anyway, it gave me a lot of strength, I think, to go forward, to pass this. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: It was okay. I mean, you just don't -- I think I didn't really realise that I was in the spotlight or whatever. I just took it as it came. Maybe six months later I realised, and I got through a little -- I mean, I was struggling a little bit. But you get used to it, I think. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: It's okay. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, of course. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: Yeah, it's more or less, yeah. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I don't think I've played her. I don't think so. I know she's playing very well on grass courts. You know, she's done very well these last couple seasons. I will see.
