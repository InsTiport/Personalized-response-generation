  6-2, 7-5

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Do you feel like you were able to control the pace of play today for the most part?
 BETHANIE MATTEK-SANDS: Yeah, for the most part I was. I'm disappointed with the amount of unforced errors I had today.

 Q. Do you feel like you had a toe hold there at 5-All in the second and things were turning your way?
 BETHANIE MATTEK-SANDS: Yeah, a little bit. I think I was there the whole match. I made a lot of unforced errors that I don't normally make. That was kind of the decisive factor.

 Q. Is it a fine line between being aggressive and not being aggressive enough and finding that balance?
 BETHANIE MATTEK-SANDS: Yeah. It definitely is. I mean, I take risks when I play. You know, that's something I have to work on is, you know, when to go for it and when to bring it in a little bit.

 Q. What made Caroline so tough today?
 BETHANIE MATTEK-SANDS: She's No. 1 for a reason. She gets a lot of balls back. She doesn't give you a lot of free points.

 Q. Do you have a lot of support here in the crowd today?
 BETHANIE MATTEK-SANDS: Yeah, I think so. Definitely. Just being from around here, I think it helped a little bit. But it was nice to have the support.

 Q. How many people did you have in the stands?
 BETHANIE MATTEK-SANDS: I don't even know. How many tickets did you give out? 20? I leave that to him. I've gotta play. 
 Q. So as the top-ranked American in the women's draw, what is your take on the state of American women's tennis?
 BETHANIE MATTEK-SANDS: You know, I think we have a lot of good juniors coming up. You know, couple of them had some good results at Indian Wells last week. You know, it's a constant battle just to win a few matches, so, you know, I don't think it's as drastic as everyone makes it seem. 
 But, you know, we definitely want to get some Americans up in the top 20.

 Q. Does it seem different, feel different, when the Williams sisters are not around, especially in a big tournament like this?
 BETHANIE MATTEK-SANDS: For me or for fans? 

 Q. Either one. Obviously for fans. 
 BETHANIE MATTEK-SANDS: For fans, I'm sure. For the players, you know, it's who you play. You know, you don't worry -- if they're not in your half of the draw, you don't worry about it. I think most players just worry about who they're playing that day. 
 I guess maybe for the two that would play both of them it would make a difference.

 Q. Did you feel like you had kind of bad luck when you drew the No. 1 seed for the opening round?
 BETHANIE MATTEK-SANDS: No. I like playing the top players. I think that's -- that's why I play. I don't want to have an easy way. I want to beat the best players.
