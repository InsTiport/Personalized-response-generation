THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
 Q.  Of course not the way you maybe wanted it to go, but how much fun was the whole experience for you?  
LIAM CARUANA: It was great.  It was just a blast being able to share this moment with the seven best Next Gen players, and playing in front of the home crowd was great.   
And I learned so much about my game and what I need to improve to possibly get here one day.   
 Q.  And with all the different innovations, were there any in particular that you enjoyed?  
LIAM CARUANA: I like the sets to four.  They made everything so quick and so exciting.  And, yeah, sets to four.
