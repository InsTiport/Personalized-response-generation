T. FRITZ/L. Caruana
1-4, 4-1, 4-3, 4-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. You seemed to really enjoy that today.  You seemed to be really into the game and you seem like a real entertainer.  How did it feel with that atmosphere out there today?
LIAM CARUANA: It was really fun for me.  I think living the experience yesterday of getting the first match out of the way with the nerves was critical for me.  Overall, I just had fun and it was pretty exciting.
Q. So does this give you real confidence going forward that you can really feel as though you belong out there?
LIAM CARUANA: For sure.  This gives me a lot of confidence for tomorrow against Andrey.
But, again, I just have to focus on playing my game and keep progressing each match.  If I do better tomorrow, I'll be happy.
