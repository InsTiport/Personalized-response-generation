   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 

 Q.  Alejandro, welcome to the third round at Key Biscayne.  When you lost in the qualifier -- 
 ALEJANDRO FALLA:  I just lost last second round.  The last round, yeah. 

 Q.  Yes, to Guccione.  Did you have any hope at that time that you could get in as the lucky loser? 
 ALEJANDRO FALLA:  No, no, no.  Never.  I was the third out, so I wasn't expecting to get into the major.  I was very lucky, because yesterday two guys pulled out, so then I could make it to the main draw, and now I'm in the third round. 
 Since I qualified, I knew I was playing very well.  It was a shame that I played Guccione, because he's a guy who serves very well, and he can get you out of rhythm. 

 Q.  Did you have a plane ticket to go back to Colombia? 
 ALEJANDRO FALLA:  Yes, I was going to Mexico to play the challenger.  I was going to go.  I was going to wait until today, and then my flight was at 7:00 p.m. 

 Q.  Where were you when the phone call came to tell you you're in the main draw? 
 ALEJANDRO FALLA:  I was warming up.  I was warming up with Guillermo Garcia Lopez.  In the middle of practice, my coach got a call.  And from Mark Miles, from ATP just to tell him that I was in. 
 So I got nervous.  I had no time, like half an hour, just to get ready for the match.  It wasn't enough.  And yesterday, I almost knew yesterday.  I was very close.  Set down, and break down, and then I came back.  And so I'm so happy that I won that match yesterday and also today. 

 Q.  Was it Tom Estrada from the ATP, not Mark Miles? 
 ALEJANDRO FALLA:  Who was it? 

 Q.  Miles? 
 ALEJANDRO FALLA:  Must be another Miles. 
 THE MODERATOR:  Alan Mills? 
 ALEJANDRO FALLA:  Okay, I was wrong. 

 Q.  You played last week at Sunrise? 
 ALEJANDRO FALLA:  No, no.  I played Indian Wells. 

 Q.  Okay.  And then to come out here now and to get through two rounds, when did you have a sense that you might be able to defeat Tommy Haas today? 
 ALEJANDRO FALLA:  It was from the last week.  I was really close to beat Ljubicic.  And I was set up, 4-1 up in the second round, so I was really close to getting it to the third round for the first time. 
 So I knew from the beginning that I could beat this guy today. 

 Q.  Why has your game caught fire, if you might say, at this point? 
 ALEJANDRO FALLA:  Excuse me? 

 Q.  Why has your game suddenly gotten so much better? 
 ALEJANDRO FALLA:  Why, you mean?  I think from last year, I won a couple of good matches.  I beat Davydenko, so I realized I could be there, so that's what I'm working for. 

 Q.  You've done some practicing with Roger? 
 ALEJANDRO FALLA:  No, never.  I played him twice.  He beat me twice. 

 Q.  Okay.  Has that helped your game at all? 
 ALEJANDRO FALLA:  Yeah, I think that's a point of reference.  When you play Federer, he's the best.  He's the best right now, so then you know you're going to work hard, and you've got to get weapons to be in the top.
