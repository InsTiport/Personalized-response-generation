  6‑3, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Tough day.   She's obviously very good player. 
MADISON BRENGLE:   Yeah.

Q.   You played recently well the last, what, three days more or less? 
MADISON BRENGLE:   Yeah, I mean, got quite a few matches in.   That's kind of like the idea playing these is getting as many matches as I can before. 
So I'm going to Hobart tomorrow.   I'm in quallies there.   Hopefully get a few more in and then have a good week in Melbourne. 

Q.   The way she played today she's a good player, huh? 
MADISON BRENGLE:   Yeah, very.

Q.   Second set was very close. 
MADISON BRENGLE:   Mm‑hmm, in the second I started maybe to return her serve a little bit better.   Because she has really, really good first serve.   She places it quite well.   So the first set I didn't really get that much of a play on most of her first serves.   So that was quite tough. 
The second set was closer because I got more of them back and I could start the point a little better and I finally broke in that set.

Q.   You played a ton last year, huh?   Almost every week?
MADISON BRENGLE:   That was a lot of matches, yeah.

Q.   Good thing in a way. 
MADISON BRENGLE:   Yeah.   No, I had my best‑‑ like from Wimby on I kind of had my best section tournament‑wise.   I mean, it was good.   I enjoyed it.   I was healthy for a longer section than normal, so that was good.

Q.   So you're playing much better how?   Physically?   Mentally? 
MADISON BRENGLE:   I mean, I had had some injuries and health injuries so I wasn't able to play that well like continuously.   It does make a huge difference, yeah. 

Q.   But you been playing since you were a kid?
MADISON BRENGLE:   Yeah, but, I mean, just some things just start to click.   You get older, you get smarter on court.   I mean, I'm enjoying being out there, so...

Q.   As far as being smarter, what are you doing? 
MADISON BRENGLE:   Just like certain things in the match, working on certain things.   Just getting a little bit more solid off the back, not having kind of one side people can pick on as much.
Just working on little things in my game that I felt like I needed to do improve on, they got better in the second half of the year.

Q.   So you know more, basically. 
MADISON BRENGLE:   Yeah, exactly.   Yeah. 

Q.   So overall you're very happy you're top 100 now for the first time?   That must be big, huh?
MADISON BRENGLE:   Mm‑hmm.   Yeah, no it was good.   I was very, very happy to end the year there.   Around US Open time I saw like, Okay, what do I need point‑wise to get main draw of Australia.   So that was kind of my goal working from US Open on, and I made it.   So, yeah, I was quite happy. 
I got to stop a little bit early last year, earlier than I thought I was going to.   I had to have a small surgery at the end of the year.   So I could get that in earlier and have a longer off‑season.

Q.   What happened there?
MADISON BRENGLE:   I had a touch of skin cancer.   They had to take that out of my leg.   Sunblock is important. 

Q.   Yeah, I would imagine.   How long were you out?   Weeks?
MADISON BRENGLE:   Yeah, it was on the inside of my knee and you're not allowed to run with that.   That was about five weeks I couldn't do much.

Q.   Boy, that's rough.   Couldn't run around or walk around?
MADISON BRENGLE:   I could walk but they were just like, Be very careful with it.   So I felt... 

Q.   And you couldn't swim?
MADISON BRENGLE:   I hit like stationary, but I don't think my doctor would've been too happy with me if I broke those stitches.   Yeah, she did quite a good job.   It doesn't look bad. 

Q.   So when you got to run again, did it feel okay? 
MADISON BRENGLE:   Yeah.

Q.   It wasn't, I'm tired, I'm tired?
MADISON BRENGLE:   No.   It actually was fine.   I had a really good off‑season.   I was Bradenton and I was quite happy.

Q.   Do you work with your mom?
MADISON BRENGLE:   No, not really. 

Q.   Not at all?
MADISON BRENGLE:   No.

Q.   But she used to... 
MADISON BRENGLE:   Yeah, she coached me, but she's up in Delaware and she's a coach up there and couldn't really miss that much work to be able to travel with me and stuff.   And I train down at Bollettieri's.

Q.   What about your traveling?   USTA people or all by yourself?
MADISON BRENGLE:   (Shaking head no.)   Next week I have a friend coming from Hobart and Melbourne.   He'll be my coach for the two weeks, so it'll be good.

Q.   That's not going to be easy, though, right?   Almost everyone has a coach. 
MADISON BRENGLE:   Yeah, but I'll have somebody next week and for Melbourne.   He was with me up at US Open, and very, very happy he's coming.   It will be good to have somebody there with me.

Q.   What is your goal this year overall? 
MADISON BRENGLE:   Right now kind of thinking to be in a better ranking spot for Indian Wells and Miami.   Last year I needed a wildcard to get into quallies of Indian Wells, so I would like to be able to play both of those.

Q.   Top 80?   70s?   Maybe 50? 
MADISON BRENGLE:   I haven't actually looked at like what do you need to be for those.   I would like to be able to play both of those and not need a wildcard.

Q.   But you feel like when you're playing the best players you're close to everyone; you're not getting crushed by them. 
MADISON BRENGLE:   Yeah, I mean, I definitely didn't get doubles bageled. 

Q.   You're in there. 
MADISON BRENGLE:   Yeah, I'm in there, and every match I play I feel like I'm learning, Okay, what I do need to do to be able to play against this level player or that level player and just keep working on it. 
That's kind of the fun of it. 

Q.   Okay.   Good luck next week.
MADISON BRENGLE:   Cool.   Thank you.
