M. CILIC/A. De Minaur   
4-6, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What are you thinking at 2-5, Love-40, saving all those match points?  
ALEX DE MINAUR: Every time I step out on court, I tell myself that I'm going to play until the last point.  He was going to have to beat me.  Eventually that's what he did.   
But I did everything in my power to try and get back, everything ounce of energy to try and push.  I managed to come back, but then he was too good at the end.   
 Q.  Did you talk to your camp at all afterwards?  
ALEX DE MINAUR: Considering I finished about 10 minutes ago, I just had a quick shower.  A couple of words of encouragement from them, and here I am.   
Look, right now I'm completely devastated, but it's a great learning experience for me.  I played at a very high level, pushed a quality opponent.  It just shows that experience at the end of the day.   
Looking forward to playing more of these five set matches and being able to hopefully have the opportunity to finish it off.
