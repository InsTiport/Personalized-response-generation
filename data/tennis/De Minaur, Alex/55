1-6, 6-4, 7-5   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What do you need treatment for?  
ALEX DE MINAUR: Well, it's been a long couple of weeks.   
 Q.  Nothing specific?  
ALEX DE MINAUR: No, no.  It's just releasing, you know, trying to look forward to the next match, which is Berdych.   
So just trying to do all the right things to get ready for that.   
 Q.  Your energy level was much higher at the start of the match today than yesterday, it seemed.  Was that something you were focused on?  
ALEX DE MINAUR: Yeah.  It was a big occasion, first final.  You know, pretty jumpy.  Just tried to bring a lot of intensity at the start, and, you know, that really helped me in that first set.   
Then he started playing some great tennis.  You know, I probably lowered my intensity a bit and then it was an uphill battle.  It was just a tough match all around.   
 Q.  When you were 4-0 down in the third, it seemed like you were having a bit of internal monologue with yourself during the break.  What were you saying to yourself to get yourself back on track?  
ALEX DE MINAUR: I said, Just keep digging, leave it all out there, find a way to just make it competitive.  You know, I didn't want to just not leave it all out there, especially for everyone who stayed out there.  I wanted to just compete until the last point, and I thought that's what I did.  I left it all out there on court.   
 Q.  Tell us about the last two weeks.  
ALEX DE MINAUR: Crazy.  You know, it's been a roller coaster, and I honestly wouldn't have it any other way.  You know, I have enjoyed every second of it.  It's been a thrill, and I just want it to keep on going.   
 Q.  How proud are you for what you have been able to do?  
ALEX DE MINAUR: Yeah, I'm tremendously proud.  You know, I put in all the hard yards, and it's great to see the results coming through.   
It's great to see that I've got the level to beat these guys, and, you know, make back-to-back great results.  That's something I was really trying to work on from last year, and to be more constant, and I felt like I proved myself there in that aspect these two weeks.   
 Q.  We've all been coming to this tournament for several years, and it's been a while since there has been an atmosphere like that tonight, full house and noise.  What was it like for you?  
ALEX DE MINAUR: It's great.  It's honestly unbelievable to play in front of your home crowd, and, you know, to just have that many people stay up and watch you and just support you every point.  They give you energy when you think there is no energy left.  You know, just push yourself until the end.   
It's honestly amazing, and, you know, I reckon the Australian crowd is the best crowd of them all.  Honestly, they're incredible, and I can't wait to play in front of them every day.   
 Q.  How empty was the tank as you went through that match?  
ALEX DE MINAUR: It was -- you know, it was close to being empty (smiling).  I mean, it's been a couple long weeks.  A little bit of fatigue there, but that's when you have to dig in deep mentally.   
I just tried to find any sort of energy I had left and left it all out there on court.  There were some brutal rallies at the end, and he was just too good.  There's nothing more I can say about it.   
 Q.  It seems like you're never going to give anyone an easy match.  Is that the mentality you're taking in to Berdych next week?  
ALEX DE MINAUR: For sure.  I mean, I want all the players out in the locker room to know that, that I'm going to give it 100%, and, you know, fight until the last point.  They're all going to have to beat me.  So that's what I try to pride myself on and that's what I want the other players to know.
