A. De MINAUR/A. Davidovich Fokina   
4-2, 3-4, 4-1, 4-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Just having that experience from last year and having matches under your belt with this format, how much do you think that had an advantage coming into today?  
ALEX de MINAUR: Obviously it's my second time around with these different rules. Look, going in, I knew it was going to be a tough match. Especially with these conditions, anything can happen. The match can turn at any moment.   
So after that second set, I had to make sure I regrouped, because I didn't play a bad set. He just came up with some big shots in big moments. So I sort of had to go and say "too good" and move on and try and regroup.   
I was able to do that pretty well, so happy I was able to overcome that.   
 Q.  (Question in Italian.)  
ALEX de MINAUR: (Answer in Italian.)   
 Q.  The rules are very different. Are there rules you'd like to get on tour? And also, are you pro-coaching?  
ALEX de MINAUR: So it's a tough question, that one, because I know that there is a fine line between tennis as being sort of an athlete's sport or a spectator's sport.   
I know that coaching is great for the spectators, as it gives insights on what the player is thinking and how to solve solutions.   
But me, as an athlete and a player, I don't actually like it. You know, that's just me, my opinion. I'm sure there is a lot of people who like it and a lot of people who don't, but this is my opinion of coaching.   
I think obviously they are doing some great things with trying new rules and innovations here in Milan, and it will be a matter of time to see if any of these stick or we come up with new ideas.
