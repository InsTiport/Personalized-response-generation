A. de MINAUR/C. Ruud   
4-1, 4-0, 4-2   
 Q.  Having not lost in round-robin play, is there something about that format in particular that really you kind of get up for?  
ALEX de MINAUR: I get up for any sort of match any time I step out on court. These conditions make it a bit tougher in the sense that things can change direction really quickly, so I feel like you've got to be constantly focused. That's something that helps me, in a way, to stay in the moment.   
Also, a lot of work has been done for me to achieve that, but it's a work in progress and I'm happy to be through to the semifinals.   
 Q.  Even though the format here is completely different to any other event, are there things about it that you can take into other ATP Tour events next year, whether it's quick start, anything like that?  
ALEX de MINAUR: There is a lot of different things that obviously I really like. The Hawk-Eye live, you know, I think you don't take away any sort of problem on the court. You believe Hawk-Eye. So if it's called out, it's out. If it's a close call, they show you the replay. No more troubles. You don't have bad calls.   
If you don't challenge and you should have challenged, then you realize you end up losing the point. But obviously sort of the instant replay, that helps a lot, as well.   
There is a couple of things that I do like here.   
 Q.  With your own game, is there anything in particular that you can take from this, like, having all of these matches where you have to get off to a quick start or anything like that that carries over to...  
ALEX de MINAUR: Of course it helps to constantly stay focused. I mean, every point counts here, so, you know, you've got to be on top of things.   
I can definitely take that on to the tour. It's just, yeah, if I manage to do what I've been doing here on the tour, it will definitely help me win a lot of matches.   
 Q.  Just the experience of being in Milan. You were saying last year you were having a blast off the court, as well. What's it like just having the chance, before the tournament started, just getting to know these guys a little bit better, people that you maybe don't have an opportunity with at other events throughout the year?  
ALEX de MINAUR: For sure. I think it's great. I don't think I have ever had much to do with Jannik Sinner. After this week, I have been able to get to know him and I've been able to hit with him, and things like this that otherwise probably don't -- other tournaments, there is a lot more going on, a lot more players. But here it's just eight of us. So we're bound to get to know each other a bit better, so I enjoy that aspect, for sure.
