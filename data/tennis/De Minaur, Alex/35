A. DE MINAUR/G. Simon
6-3, 6-2
Q. How do you feel about having to play twice in one day?
ALEX DE MINAUR: Well, it's things that happen.  I think what's more annoying is me having to play on Monday at the Australian Open and not getting helped out as a fellow Aussie at your pretty much home slam.
I think they're punishing Aussies for playing deep in their home tournaments, and I think that should not be what they should be doing.
Q. Did you put in a request to have it delayed?
ALEX DE MINAUR: Yeah.  I mean, they came out with the schedule before they even saw who was in the final in weeks past.  So I think that's pretty poor.
But, you know, I'm still here.  I've got a final now.  I've got to reset and do everything I can here and we will see what happens.
Q. How do you get yourself ready for these next hours?  What will you do?
ALEX DE MINAUR: Probably jump in the ice bath.  It was quite hot out there.  I will try and get some food into me and maybe have a nap and just try to refresh.
Q. It was pretty warm.  Gilles looked like he was pretty sore and tired.  How are you after the heat?
ALEX DE MINAUR: Yeah, I mean, it was pretty brutal conditions.  It's probably the hottest day we have had.  Very humid, as well.
Long rallies and pretty taxing.  But this is what I do the hard work for, to go out there and back it up, and I'm going to do everything in my power to come back in the final and I will leave it all out there.
