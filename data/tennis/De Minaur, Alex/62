A. KUZNETSOV/A. De Minaur
6-2, [Ret.]
Q. Tell us what happened out there today.
ALEX DE MINAUR: I had an abdominal strain.  So I was feeling this halfway through my first-round match.  But with adrenaline and that, I sort of pushed through.
As soon as I finished that match, I went to the physio and tried to do everything I could to get my ab ready for my next-round match.
Then I got out there on court, and I wasn't really able to serve at more than 70%, and I could feel it was gradually getting worse.  I felt like it was better not to risk actually getting a tear.
Q. Were you advised not to play at all today?
ALEX DE MINAUR: Yeah.  Physios were trying to get me, sort of told me it was a good idea not to play, but I still wanted to make an effort and see how it was on court.
Obviously really didn't want to go out of this tournament like this, but I had to be smart at the end.
Q. What's the process for you for recovery?
ALEX DE MINAUR: Well, I will head over to Melbourne tomorrow, and then we will start treatment, trying to get ready for AO.  Pretty sure it should be all right for AO, but I've got to really focus on it and make sure I do a lot of rehab on it.
Q. Did you feel like you made it worse today by going out there or not?
ALEX DE MINAUR: It didn't feel 100% when I got out there.  I thought I was going to make an effort.  Then realized that it was gradually getting a little bit worse, so I decided to stop.
Q. Did you decide that before the physio came out, or was there a discussion?
ALEX DE MINAUR: I sort of was 50/50 thinking about it, and then I wanted to hear what the physio thought.  Obviously he thought it was a better if I stopped playing.
Q. Was this something you had before, an ab strain?
ALEX DE MINAUR: I have, but many years ago.
Q. Despite the injury and everything, how excited are you about everything that's happened?
ALEX DE MINAUR: Oh, yeah, it's been an unbelievable week.  I'm really happy with my result.
Disappointed with how I had to finish off the tournament, but hopefully I can keep my level up for AO, which is the big picture.
Q. Have you ever had to retire halfway through a match before?
ALEX DE MINAUR: I believe this might be my second time.  I really don't enjoy it.  (Smiling.)  It's not a great feeling.
I'm looking forward to going to Melbourne and getting a lot of work done on my ab to get ready for next week.
Q. Are you totally out of juniors now?  I think you initially were in the AO before.  What's the deal?
ALEX DE MINAUR: I'm not going to play Aussie Open juniors.  I'm going to try and focus more on the pro tour, and we'll see how that goes.
Q. But you're not totally out of, like, the French or Wimbledon?
ALEX DE MINAUR: Well, at this stage I won't be playing them.
Q. Okay.
ALEX DE MINAUR: Who knows?  Maybe we change our mind, and maybe it's a good decision for me, but at the moment, gonna try not to play them.
