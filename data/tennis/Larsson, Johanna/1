6-4, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Your overall impressions of this week?  You pretty pleased with what you got out of it?  
JOHANNA LARSSON: Yeah, definitely.  Actually, before the first round of quallie, I had a chat with Flipkens during lunch.  She told me it's unbelievable, you play three matches even to get into the main draw here.  It's so tough.   
I said, Yeah, maybe this week is all about the matches, to get as many matches as you can before the Open.   
Looking back on that lunch, I think I succeeded pretty well.  Of course, I'm very disappointed about today, but overall it's a good week.   
 Q.  What enabled you to go on the run after qualifying?  
JOHANNA LARSSON: You know, as I got in as a lucky loser, it was like a second chance.  I played a really well match against Timea to start with.  After that, it just kept going.   
Today I was maybe a little bit more tired than my opponent.  I think maybe I had one or two chances, especially in the first set with a breakpoint back to 5-All, but didn't make that.  If you don't, it kind of slips away.   
Yeah, it was a good match today and a good week.   
 Q.  The way Svitolina is playing, how do you assess her chances at taking the championship?  
JOHANNA LARSSON: Good, of course.  I think she's a great player.  It's the first time I played her ever.  I thought she's playing quite flat and very low over the net.  It was tough for me, I want to use the spin, to get a grip on the ball seeing as she's playing so flat and low all the time.   
I think she definitely has a good chance for the final tomorrow.  So let's see.
