THE MODERATOR:  First question, please. 


Q.  Can you just talk about what this has been like for you, this round here at the Open.

MARIANO ZABALETA:  I'm so happy.  You know, is my first time in one Grand Slam quarterfinal.  I so happy because I win four matches, very important matches.  I beat big guys.  I'm so happy, too, because I'm playing very good tennis.  I play, I think, my best tennis in the year. 

Q.  You beat Malisse in three sets.  Was it an easier victory than you expected?

MARIANO ZABALETA:  No, was not easy.  Was difficult match.  Malisse was little bit tired I think because he played five sets last  -- with Henman. But I think I serve very good today, like the other matches.  I play better.  I think I play better. 

Q.  What do you think about his game? 

MARIANO ZABALETA:  He's very good player.  I think he was little bit tired.  He do a lot of mistakes today, yeah. 

Q.  You had such a good record as a junior.  Can you just talk about why you think it's taken you a little while to get to this point, to where you are now. 

MARIANO ZABALETA:  Yeah, just, I don't know, after Juniors  -- I play in '99, I play really very good tennis.  I finish No. 20 in the world.  Last year I finish 55.  This year, I didn't play very good tennis.  I change my coach.  I think that was a little probably my tennis, but now is okay. 

Q.  Each set seems to be very, very close.  What would you say was the deciding factor that turned into your favor? 

MARIANO ZABALETA:  I think was very important the tiebreak in the second set, no?  I play so concentrate that points.  And I think that was the moment in the match, no?  Because if he had lost in the second set, was terrible, and I win the second serve was very good for me. 

Q.  Any preference in the quarterfinals?

MARIANO ZABALETA:  No, it's the same.  It's the same.  Johansson is very good.  Safin, better. 

Q.  What kind of statistics do you have against them? 

MARIANO ZABALETA:  Against who, Safin? 

Q.  Johansson.

MARIANO ZABALETA:  Johansson?  I lost with him one time two years ago in Long Island in hardcourt. 

Q.  How were you feeling about your game coming into the Open?  Did you feel really strong about it? 

MARIANO ZABALETA:  Yeah, I feel good.  The last tournament in Indianapolis I play good tennis.  I be  -- I won two matches, and I lost with Tim Henman in third round. But the last two months I play very good tennis in the tournaments.  And here, I won the matches (inaudible).

Q.  Have you changed anything?

MARIANO ZABALETA:  No, just I start to play very good.
