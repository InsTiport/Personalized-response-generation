THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.  
 
 
Q.  You got to the net quite a bit.  Was that your tactic, to try and rush him a little bit?  You went to the net quite a bit to volley.
 
MARIANO ZABALETA:  Yeah, I try to play aggressive in these matches like semifinal.  You have to win the match, no wait for the other one.  In front I have Carlos Moya, he's a great player.  I think to beat him I have to play aggressive and go to the net and win on points.  I try to do that.   But I didn't feel very good today.  I really played -- I think I played bad. 
 
Q.  In Copa Davis, did you get hit by a chair in Chile?
 
MARIANO ZABALETA:  Yeah, was a long time ago.  Yeah, was a bad moment, too.  It's over, is like five years ago.
