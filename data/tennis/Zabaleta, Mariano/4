THE MODERATOR:  First question, please.  
 
 
Q.  Obviously, you're disappointed with the result today. 
 
MARIANO ZABALETA:  Yeah. 
 
Q.  Considering how far you came in the tournament, I mean, do you feel any consolation whatsoever with the way the tournament went for you?
 
MARIANO ZABALETA:  Yeah, I think was a big tournament for me, no?  Good tournament, too.  Because I play quarterfinal first time in my life.  I not very happy because today he doesn't leave me to play, no.  He played really very good tennis and I do a lot of mistakes and I didn't play like the last match. But today I play against one big guy, you know, like Marat Safin, he won last year and he's very good player. 
 
Q.  Assess the way he played.  Is he playing at championship caliber right now?
 
MARIANO ZABALETA:  Yeah, I think he play unbelievable today, no?  He play, he serve good, he return very good.  I think for that he won last year.  And maybe he won this year, too.
