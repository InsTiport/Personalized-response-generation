THE MODERATOR:  Questions.  
 
 
Q.  It's like you're playing the tournament of your life, isn't it?
 
MARIANO ZABALETA:  No, it's just three matches.  It's not the tournament of my life.  I play good matches.  I beat Sebastien Grosjean, Taylor Dent, now Rusedski.  Was tough matches.  But is not my tournament life or something like this.  Just good matches.  
 
Q.  What do you think about the next game against Malisse? 
 
MARIANO ZABALETA:  He's tough match.  I know him.  He's a very good player.  But I try to play like today, no?  I try to play  -- I think I have to play my best tennis to beat him.  I think I can do it.  
 
Q.  Everybody thought it would be Henman-Rusedski. It's Zabaleta-Malisse.  So it's two outsiders. 
 
MARIANO ZABALETA:  Yeah.  It's okay.  Tennis, always nobody know the results.  I think is always the same.
