THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 
 
 
Q.  Can you talk about today's match a little bit?  Todd Martin had not been ranked lower than 100 for more than ten years.  Can you talk about it? 
 
MARIANO ZABALETA:  I know Todd is a big player.  And I think he played, today  he played really good.  He didn't make mistakes, and he served very good.  I think he played better than me.  
 
Q.  Did his height help him?  That he's very tall, did that help him on the court, control the court at all?
 
MARIANO ZABALETA:  Yeah, maybe for the serve, I don't know, yeah, have some help.
