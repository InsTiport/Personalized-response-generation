THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Well, you must be really, really happy about what happened today outside and your first move into the top 10?  
DOMINIKA CIBULKOVA:   Yeah, yeah, I have to say I'm really glad, especially about my win today, you know.   
It wasn't easy at all to play today against Aga with the wind and conditions, and I had to stay aggressive all the time even if I missed many shots, you know.   I just had to keep going.  
So today the match was really tough, and I'm happy about everything, you know.   Before the match, even before the tournament, like they keep asking me, Top 10 and everything, and I just, you know, I just said, like, Okay, if I should be there, I will be there.   If I should not be there, I will not be there.  
So now I'm there.   So finally it's over (smiling).   
   
 Q.   Does it feel like this is a big relief for you?   
DOMINIKA CIBULKOVA:   Before it will be like big relief, yeah.   Before it will be, Oh, finally.   
But now I'm like, Okay, it happened, and I continue.   I know I'm playing well.   
It's like, Okay, it happened.   Of course I'm happy.   I cannot just say, It happened.   I'm happy it did, but it's not like now my world or my life will change, you know.  
   
 Q.   You don't know if it won't change, though?   It really could change.   
DOMINIKA CIBULKOVA:   Yeah, maybe will change in some way, but I will still be the same Dommie, you know.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel like you belong there?  
DOMINIKA CIBULKOVA:   Yeah.   I did ‑‑ like even before my game was a lot of times up and down, and I could be beat great players but not really playing like, all the time, I didn't know how to keep the consistency.  
But now like feeling my game is there, even maybe I'm mentally a more mature person and also on the court.   And also the confidence, for sure.   It's something that you need to have to be there.  
   
 Q.   There were 19 I think breaks of serve, and then in the third set it started to kind of even out.   
DOMINIKA CIBULKOVA:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Was that due to the weather?  
DOMINIKA CIBULKOVA:   Yeah.   For me it was, I have to say, 80% because of the weather, because of the wind, and I start off my toss was not good.   Usually in the good weather sometimes I can get difficulties with my serve and not even in this wind, so it was tough for me to play.   
Yeah, I have to admit we are not the best servers with Aga, you know.   So who will win the serve then will get a set.  
   
 Q.   You were married recently, right?  
DOMINIKA CIBULKOVA:   No.   We are just engaged.  
   
 Q.   Okay.   That's good.   Bad question.   Thank you.   
DOMINIKA CIBULKOVA:   Okay (smiling).
