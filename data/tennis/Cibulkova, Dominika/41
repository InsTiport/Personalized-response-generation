 D. CIBULKOVA/V. Razzano 
      7‑5, 6‑0 
  
    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please.   
   
 Q.   The first set was difficult because Virginie played well, and she served at 4‑5.   What was your feeling at this time, especially?  
    DOMINIKA CIBULKOVA:   Yeah, you know, it wasn't easy today.   I was prepared for a really tough match, because Virginie, she's a great player.   With her, you never know.   
    I was ready, you know.   I knew she's playing a lot of down lines, she's serving a lot, she's serving well.   
    So, yeah, today, you know, at 5‑4 on her serve, I was just ‑‑I changed a little bit something on my return.   I went a little bit forward.   I didn't give her any time.  
    So there was a change that really pumped me up, you know, and then I won a few games and I started to get more confidence, you know, and that's what happened when I play well and when I get more confidence.
