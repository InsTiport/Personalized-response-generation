  6-2, 7-5

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. How tough it was to play under that kind of windy conditions?
 DOMINIKA CIBULKOVA: I would say it was the most difficult conditions I have ever played in. Especially center court, you know, the wind was turning around and it was very tough to play. 
 But I would say it was about fighting, and today I was more affected, my tennis was more affected by the wind than Caroline's tennis.
 That's why she won today.

 Q. Was the wind consistently in one direction or was it just unpredictable?
 DOMINIKA CIBULKOVA: Yeah, it was kind of like this (motioning with her arms). But it was changing a little bit. It was really hard to serve. 
 Just from the first point I just a little bit changed my tennis. I was not serving properly and my forehand was not proper.
 You know, my plan was to play aggressive and trying to press her from the forehand. I tried to go around a couple of times, but the wind, you know, sometimes I am just too far from the ball.
 It was really hard to do some pressure in this wind.

 Q. Maybe now obviously you might be disappointed, but looking back on this tournament, are you satisfied with the way you played?
 DOMINIKA CIBULKOVA: Um, no, to tell you the truth. I'm really disappointed after this match, because, you know, before the match I was ready to go to semifinals, and I had my plan. Well, with every match here, you know, I was getting confident. I just wanted to go farther. 
 But I think when I wake up tomorrow morning, you know, I just gonna feel better, and I hope keep going like this for the rest of the season.
