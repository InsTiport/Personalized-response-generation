6-1, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. You had such a great tournament last week in Perth. How did you feel coming into Sydney and the different circumstances. Was that a big change for you?
 DOMINIKA CIBULKOVA: Yeah, it was a really big change. Actually, we just arrived on Sunday, so it was pretty tough to get used to playing outdoor. It's so different. 
 I still feel a little tired from the last week, so it was pretty tough to play today, and I guess Caroline especially because she likes long rallies and I got tired really quickly. So it was a very bad match.

 Q. What did you feel she did particularly well today? 
 DOMINIKA CIBULKOVA: Actually, I cannot say what she did well, because I played terrible. I just couldn't hold the ball in the rally. You know, I got tired after a few points and I felt my legs were so heavy, so I couldn't play my game today with her. 
 I made a lot of unforced errors. My mistakes. It was actually I beat myself.

 Q. How will focus on your preparation for the Australian Open?
 DOMINIKA CIBULKOVA: Yeah, we may be flying tomorrow to Melbourne, and then we start practicing there. You know, to get relaxed a little bit and start practicing well. 

 Q. Is there any particular shot that you will focus on? 
 DOMINIKA CIBULKOVA: Yeah, sure. I have to focus on serving outdoor. It's a little different to serve indoor than outdoor. So serve for sure, and maybe my forehand. 
 But today was just everything so bad, so I hope it will get better.

 Q. Are you planning to team up with Dominik Hrbaty again?
 DOMINIKA CIBULKOVA: Yeah, sure. We'll see. Hopefully. I would love to. 

 Q. If I'm not wrong, I think you've had more top 10 wins last year than Jankovic. In that context, what sort of goals have you set for 2009?
 DOMINIKA CIBULKOVA: My goals are to play -- you know, to play my game, to be fit. Actually, if I play well I play like in Perth, so I'm able to beat top 3, top 2 in the world, so my goals are to get close to top 50 and closer and closer to top 10. We'll see how it goes.

 Q. What did you do for fun in the pre-season?
 DOMINIKA CIBULKOVA: In the pre-season i went for holidays for two weeks, and then I was practicing pretty hard.

 Q. Two weeks. Where did you go?
 DOMINIKA CIBULKOVA: To Maldives.

 Q. Maldives?
 DOMINIKA CIBULKOVA: Yeah. I had a great time, and then I started practicing. It was a pretty tough time. I had a lot of fitness and I worked hard, so I hope it will show up in Melbourne.

 Q. Was it in Bratislava?
 DOMINIKA CIBULKOVA: No. It was in Saddlebrook. We went to Florida to practice.
