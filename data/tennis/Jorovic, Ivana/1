    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please.   
   
 Q.   You had a 4‑1 lead in the first set, and then you kind of like let her back in the door or something.   What happened there?  
    IVANA JOROVIC:   I don't know what happened with me, but I gave my best and I won first set.   But I just lost my emotion, you know, in the second and third.   
    She deserved to win this time.  
   
 Q.   Do you think it was the occasion of playing in the Roland Garros final maybe?  
    IVANA JOROVIC:   Maybe.   I don't know.   I have to talk with my coach and my team and see what's going on with me in the match.   
    But, you know, she's a good player and achieved her best today.   She deserved it.  
   
 Q.   But you're proud of what you have achieved this week?
