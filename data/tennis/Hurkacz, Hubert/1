3-6, 6-3, 7-5
THE MODERATOR:   Talk to us about your experience today at Melbourne Park because obviously it was a very busy day.  How was your experience today?
HUBERT HURKACZ:   Yeah, I mean, today was a long day in Melbourne Park.  I played pretty decent, those two matches.  At the end, I mean, Stefano played really well, so that's good for him.  Yeah.
THE MODERATOR:   Going into a Grand Slam, as much as it isn't ideal to play some of these matches back to back, do you feel it at least gives you good preparation leading into the first Grand Slam of the year?
HUBERT HURKACZ:   Yeah, I think days like today which are, like, a little bit tougher physically, give good preparation and, yeah, I think I'll be even more ready for the Grand Slam.
Q. Just want to switch gears and ask if you could just touch on what it's been like to play doubles with Jannik this week.  You have a pretty good history of playing with your fellow young guys.  Just curious to hear your thoughts on how that's been.
HUBERT HURKACZ:   Yeah, I mean, Jannik is unbelievable player, like, the way he can hit the ball.  Also, he brings a lot of great positive energy.  So it's been fun.
Q. Who tends to take the lead when you're on the court?  Do you guys kind of wing it, or do you have a strategy when you're out there?
HUBERT HURKACZ:   I mean, we try to put a little pressure when the opponents are serving, and obviously try to play good when we're serving.  And, yeah, that's pretty basic strategy.
