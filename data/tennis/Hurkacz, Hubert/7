7-5, 5-7, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You're having a good February, aren't you?  Won your first match of the season last week, now beaten the top seed.  What was the secret of your success today?
HUBERT HURKACZ: Yeah, I mean, I was trying to fight for every point.  I mean, Kei is unbelievable player.  Yeah, I had to serve good.  That gave me some opportunities to attack after the serve, also win couple of easy points.  Against such a great player, it's very important to have some free points.
Yeah, I was also I think returning quite well.  I mean, the match was a little up and down.  But, yeah, I'm very happy with the win today.
Q. To win the first set after being down 5-1, did that give you a lot of confidence?
HUBERT HURKACZ: First set was 5-4.  Yeah, I mean, so first or second set?  So after winning first set, yeah...
I mean, for sure I wasn't returning well.  I was missing some easy shots at the beginning on his serve.  Yeah, finally I played a better game.  Also was a little surprise for him because I was making some balls.
Then I was staying aggressive.  Yeah, so it gave me a lot of confidence.  But, I mean, the second set didn't start the way I wanted it.  I had to fight to come back.  Yeah, I mean, happy with the win in three sets.
Q. When you came in here last week, what was the goal in your mind?  How big is this win for you?
HUBERT HURKACZ: Yeah, I mean, I was lucky to get last into the main draw.  Yeah, I thought I was going to play quallies, then I end up playing in main draw.  It was a very tough match yesterday.
Today, I mean, it's huge win for me because it's the first top 10 win.  Last week I didn't play the best match against Stefanos.  I mean, also it helped me.
Maybe I was better prepared mentally for this battle today.  I mean, it's give me huge confidence.  I'm going to try to keep going forward.
Q. Is this your first time here?
HUBERT HURKACZ: Yeah, it's first time here.
