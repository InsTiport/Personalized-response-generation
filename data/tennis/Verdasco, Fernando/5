F. VERDASCO/D. Thiem
4-6, 6-4, 7-5
(Transcribed from recorded ATP audio.)
Q. 2 hours and 44 minutes.  Down the stretch, what gave you the strength to pull it off in the third set?
FERNANDO VERDASCO: I don't know.  I mean, Dominic is right now for me top three on clay, for sure.  Obviously I think that 3-o record for me in the previous matches gives me extra confident.  Even losing first set, to still try to still believe that I can come back.  I been able to do it.
Obviously I think it was an unbelievable match.  I think both of us had chances to win the match.  I think he played much, much better obviously than the last time we played in Rio.
For me is always amazing to beat a player as good as him because, as I say, he's top three for me, and I think for everybody.  That gives me a lot of happiness and a lot of hopefully confident.
Mentally I think I will be ready for this afternoon, hopefully physically.  Let's see physically, no?  I hope with the confident that I played this morning, I hope I can play it also now against Karen Khachanov.  Super tough match.  Last week we played in Madrid, I beat him also 7-5 in the third.
Right now I'm just enjoying for a couple hours this victory, because it's not going to be too long, then just get ready for the next one, give it all.  Let's see.
