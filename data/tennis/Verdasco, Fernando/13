6-3, 3-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  How do you feel after this victory in five sets?  
FERNANDO VERDASCO: Well, I feel better than when I started the match, honestly.  Of course, I'm happy with the victory.   
Playing always against a local player is tough.  You know, like, having the support of almost everybody at the court and everything.  It makes things tougher and more difficult to win.   
But, you know, I tried all the time to play the best I could.  Just I started the match with stomach problems.  And, you know, also the match before me went super fast.  The second set, I think, was like 15 minutes, and I couldn't really prepare for the match.   
And I think even if I won the first set, I was not feeling great.  And, you know, I'm very happy to went through anyways in five sets and have one more chance in two days.   
 Q.  Your next opponent is Marin Cilic.  
FERNANDO VERDASCO: Cuevas.   
 Q.  Cuevas.  Sorry.  I missed.  
 What do you think about this next meeting?   
FERNANDO VERDASCO: Well, he's a tough opponent.  He's been playing really good the last weeks.  And he's a great player, one of the toughest guys on clay between the 20 and the 30 in the world.  And, you know, I know he's going to be super tough.  Maybe he's even top 20 now, because he has been winning many matches.  And I don't really know exactly the ranking of everybody, but I know that it's going to be a difficult match.   
I want to prepare as best as possible and hopefully I will feel without any problems as today and being able to 100% for that match, because I will need to 100% if I want to have chances to win.
