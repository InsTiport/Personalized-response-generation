 M. MATOSEVIC/F. Verdasco
  6‑4, 4‑6, 6‑4, 6‑2 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Was all his recent grass court experiences he's had, was that a big factor, the fact he's had a lot of success recently on grass?  
FERNANDO VERDASCO:   Well, I don't know.   I think it was more the chance I had in the 4‑3 in the third set.   I had two break points and didn't make them.  
Then he broke my serve and won the third set.   That really hurt me, of course.   
He started the fourth playing much looser and much better and took advantage, and I couldn't come back.  
So of course I didn't play my best tennis, and I cannot really say something else.   
   
 Q.   Is it frustrating given how well you did last year?   Would it have been nice to build on what you did here last year?  
FERNANDO VERDASCO:   Yeah, but, you know, tennis is like this.   I tried to play my best.   I didn't.   That's it.   I cannot really, like I said, say anything else.
