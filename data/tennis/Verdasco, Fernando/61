 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. You were in control of that match for a long time, then it changed in the second set. Describe what happened in that game, what you remember about that game. 
 FERNANDO VERDASCO: I think that, you know, he was playing really good, and I had few games with my serve with problems till that game, and he finally break me in that one. So, you know, it was also the set. So it was really important game, no? 
 But he was playing good and having his chances, no? I also my chance in 5-All with Love-30. This passing shot going out for nothing. You know, tennis is like that, no? 
 After that, my fitness, it start going down. He also get confidence and the match change.

 Q. Did you feel more nervous in those two games at 5-All and 6-5?
 FERNANDO VERDASCO: No, it was not nerves.
