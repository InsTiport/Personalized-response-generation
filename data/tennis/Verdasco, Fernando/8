N. DJOKOVIC/F. Verdasco
6-3, 6-4, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. I just wanted to ask you, I mean, you know Djokovic well.  How was he in that match in terms of his level compared to, you know, recently he's come up a lot?
FERNANDO VERDASCO: Well, actually, the beginning of the match was not good for both of us.  I think we made many mistakes.  And we were not able to close even the game for 1-1 and the game for 2-1.  It took 30 minutes for three games.  That's pretty unusual.
And we had, like, both of us chances, many chances, him with 1-0 for 2-0, and me with 1-1 for 2-1 with break, to break those serves.
And, actually, I think that, you know, that maybe if I took that chance, or at least the most clear one that I had with my forehand that I lost, that I miss an easy forehand in a break point for the break, I think that maybe, you know, the match could change at least a little bit, no? and take a little bit out the confidence in his game.
I think that he start to play better and better in the important moments of few games.  He served to the lines, and he defends, like, pretty deep and good.
And he made, you know, very difficult for me to find the way to make winners or to find myself comfortable on the court.
It was also a little bit windy, and it was not easy to hit the ball clear, but I think that he start playing better and better every set.  And for me, it was, of course, tougher to find the way.
I tried, but I think that, like I said, the beginning of the first set was very important, and I didn't took the chance to maybe make the match different.
