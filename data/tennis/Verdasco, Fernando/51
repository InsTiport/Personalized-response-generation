 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. How difficult were the conditions today?  
 FERNANDO VERDASCO: Very. Very difficult for both of us. But I think that, you know, for the game I need to beat Rafa, these conditions was very bad for me.  
  
  Q. What bothered you most, the serve?   
 FERNANDO VERDASCO: Everything.  
  
  Q. What was your game plan going out, and how did you have to change it because of the wind?  
 FERNANDO VERDASCO: My game plan was try to push him all I can with my serve. It was very difficult even to make the toss of the ball. And try to play aggressive, try to play inside of the court, play, you know, normal, but good tactically.  
 When I had the chance, tried to play hard and go to the net to close the point, but it was -- when I had these balls, the ball was moving all the time and was impossible to play the game, like I said, that I think that I need to make -- to try to have chances to beat Rafa.  
  
  Q. With Rafa playing so well here at the US Open, how does somebody beat him?  
 FERNANDO VERDASCO: What?   
  
  Q. With Rafa playing so well here at the US Open, how does somebody beat him?  
 FERNANDO VERDASCO: Well, I don't know. Everybody have better days than on others. He's playing good, but I think that he will have a tough -- if I am not wrong, I think that he will play the final against Roger.   
 It's gonna be a tough match, because I think Roger play really good in these conditions. He gonna be a very tough final for Rafa if he plays against Roger in the final.  
  
  Q. So you think Roger's about the only one who has the game to beat Rafa right now?  
 FERNANDO VERDASCO: Well, Novak is a player that also on fast surface like this one, he already beat Rafa many times, and he have also the game to beat Rafa. But, I don't know.   
 I think if I need to bet here, I will bet for Roger. I think that he won five times here and he like these conditions.
