  Q.  You must be very happy with that?   
 FERNANDO VERDASCO:  Very happy, yes (smiling).   
  
  Q.  Where do you think you were better in the game?  Where were you stronger?   
 FERNANDO VERDASCO:  I don't know.  I think there was different games, you know.  The first set, with my serve, I have a lot of problems to win easy.  And, you know, for him, I think it will be very tough -- don't break me one serve, no, with 12 or 13 break balls.   
 And after I start to play well.  I play well both tiebreaks, and on the third set, no?  I think I play well all the match anyway.   
  
  Q.  Is this the biggest win of your career so far?   
 FERNANDO VERDASCO:  No.  I think is one more match and is a very big player, is No. 3 or 4 in the world.  Is one of the biggest wins.  But with Roddick in Miami the last year was very big win, too, you know.  I have -- is not the best one.  Is one of them, but not the best.   
  
  Q.  Beating the fourth seed must build your confidence levels?   
 FERNANDO VERDASCO:  Yeah.  I feel I playing good, and I hope to play like this, keep play like this the next matches.  This is what I want, no?  I don't think in more things.   
  
  Q.  Did you know David Nalbandian requested that the match be played as early possible in the day so he could watch the Argentina football.   
 FERNANDO VERDASCO:  Yeah, I know.  Is normal.   
  
  Q.  Do you agree with that decision, to bring the game forward?   
 FERNANDO VERDASCO:  12 is not one hour, like you must wake up at, you know, at seven or six in the morning like if you play ten.  I think is good hour to play, too.   
  
  Q.  That third set finished very quickly.  Do you think he lost heart and spirit in the third game?   
 FERNANDO VERDASCO:  I don't think so.  No, I don't think so.   
  
  Q.  You don't think that he wanted to watch the football, it affected his performance in the third set.   
 FERNANDO VERDASCO:  No, I don't think so.  I think is more important to win the match, the tennis match, than see the football.
