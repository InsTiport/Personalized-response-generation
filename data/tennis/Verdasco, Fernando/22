 F. VERDASCO/R. Bautista Agut
  3‑6, 7‑5, 7‑6 
   
 Q.   How good a win was that for you from a set down?  
FERNANDO VERDASCO:   I hope that very good for my confidence.   I mean, it was very difficult match.   He's very tough to play on grass because he play very flat and his shots are going so low.  
So it's very difficult to attack.   I mean, now, the next round I will have it even tougher.   Hopefully I will have a chance to keep practicing and improving.  
   
 Q.   Hopefully, from a British point of view, that's from Andy Murray in the next round.   The let cord on match point down, somebody somewhere is on your side.   
FERNANDO VERDASCO:   Yes.   I mean, of course sometimes that happens against you.   Well, maybe not in a match point and in that way so often, but some days you're just there at the court and you think it's just not my day.  
Today it was just my day, no?   Because with that let and then some other points that were very important, they came at the end to my side, and I think was the key to finally win the match.  
   
 Q.   One final question, because the subject of the speed of play has been a big issue in tennis for a long time now.   You play so quickly.   Is that because it suits the way that your game goes or is it to try to unsettle your opponent or what?  
FERNANDO VERDASCO:   Well, I mean, I think my style of play is like that, no?   Is like powerful strokes on the baseline.   
Of course, sometimes I try to change the pace, but, I mean, I think I'm a pretty aggressive player on the court.   I always try to make the point and be on top of the point.   
So, I mean, that's how I like to play, how I been playing or trying to play all my life.   
   
 Q.   If it is against Andy Murray, good luck in the next round.   
FERNANDO VERDASCO:   Thank you so much.
