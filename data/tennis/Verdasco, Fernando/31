THE MODERATOR:   Questions in Spanish, please.   
   
 Q.   Apart from your opponent's good game, can you say something about your match?   Can you give us a summation of what happened out there?  
FERNANDO VERDASCO:   Well, I think that this match talks by itself.   I think it's not always that way, but I think today it is.   
I think I have gone from more to less of course.   The second set hurt me a lot, because even though I was a break down‑‑ I don't know.   
I was seeing that if I was playing well and I did what I had to do, I had possibilities to win the tiebreak, even at 6‑5.   But he played pretty well in the tiebreak.   I think that he was playing well and I think I played badly tactically talking.  
In the third I had 0‑40 at the beginning of the third set.   I don't know really very well if it was that I did it wrongly tactically or whatever, because he has done it pretty well, too.   He was playing long shots in that game, and I think that once he was able to recover from the 0‑40 he got a lot of confidence and started to play with a lot of confidence very hard and didn't commit any errors.  
Well, I just tried to put the level up to maybe equal him, but just whatever I was trying to do, I was committing more errors.   I think that in the end it was clear on the court.   There is nothing more that I can say.
