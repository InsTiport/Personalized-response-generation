  F. VERDASCO/G. Soeda6-3, 6-2, 7-6An interview with:FERNANDO VERDASCOTHE MODERATOR: Questions, please.Q. Talk about what it was like playing Go today, and looking forward to playing Novak.FERNANDO VERDASCO: Yeah, well, I mean, with Go, I only have play once before here in Shanghai a few years ago.  I think he played better today than that day.  I mean, on the third set, he started playing like more inside the court and serving better and pushing me more.  It was tough for me to finish the match.  But, I mean, finally I did it.  I'm happy in general with the level that I play today.  About the next match, of course, is a match that I'll have nothing to lose and a lot to win.  I will just go out there and try my best and fight every ball.  Hopefully I will have my best day and he don't (smiling).
