 THE MODERATOR: Questions.   
  
  Q. You got broken in the first game of the match. Was it a slow start because of the different conditions?   
 FERNANDO VERDASCO: Oh, I don't know. Maybe yes. I think I start a little bit cold and not the same like I was starting outside.   
 But I don't know if is because of the conditions, no? But also the day, you know, I been yesterday all day without do anything, like without playing all day. So maybe it was also that.   
  
  Q. Two tough tiebreak sets in the match. Are you glad you were able to finish it in two sets before the final tonight?  
 FERNANDO VERDASCO: Yeah, of course. For me, I think it's important to finish in two sets, better than three, to try to be more rest for tonight for the final. So I am happy for that.   
  
  Q. What will you do now, between now and the final?  
 FERNANDO VERDASCO: I will go now to eat something and rest few hours and then warm up just before the final again.   
  
  Q. And you're playing Sam in the final. What are your expectations?   
 FERNANDO VERDASCO: I know that he's playing so good tennis. He have been playing all the summer so good. He won the US Open Series. So I think I will need to play so good to beat him. But I'm feeling good and I will try just to keep doing my game.   
 I think if I play good, I will have my chances.
