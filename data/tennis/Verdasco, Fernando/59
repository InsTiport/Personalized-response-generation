 F. VERDASCO/S. Koubek
  6-1 (ret.) 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Is it disappointing that you didn't get more match time, that the match finished early? Would you have liked to have a little bit more?  
 FERNANDO VERDASCO: For one part for sure. I want to play more to get more rhythm for the next round. If I win, of course. But it's not bad also to win fast, no, and have one day even more to recover. Because the next round is gonna be so difficult against Davydenko.   
 Of course you never want one guy to play sick and to feel like this, no? But it's also good and I have more rest, no, for important match in fourth round.  
  
  Q. Will you have to change your preparation for the next match in any way?  
 FERNANDO VERDASCO: I will go now to practice.   
  
  Q. When did you notice that he was in trouble? Did you know at all?  
 FERNANDO VERDASCO: No, I didn't know. I was just focus on myself. I didn't know that he was sick for two days. You know, he just call the doctor and he retire straightaway.   
 So I didn't know that he was like that.
