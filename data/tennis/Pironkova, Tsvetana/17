  T. PIRONKOVA/A. Ivanovic
6-4, 5-7, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. How would that match rank amongst your best victories? 
 TSVETANA PIRONKOVA: Well, I have only one victory over top 10 player which was Venus Williams like two years ago. 
 This is my second victory against top 10, actually No. 2 in the world, maybe No. 3 this week. So it's one of the best games I ever played. 

 Q. You seemed to be able to put her under a lot of pressure and keep the ball very deep all the time. Was that a particular tactic, or did it just work out that way?
 TSVETANA PIRONKOVA: Yeah, actually, I felt that today she wasn't very sure with her game. I wanted to put the ball in the court, and like you said, deep in the court, and I did a good job with it, with that, yeah.

 Q. (From Italian) Did you expect to obtain such a result in Rome?
 TSVETANA PIRONKOVA: Well, I was hoping, actually. Rome is a great city. I have a good memories from here, because when I was younger I played ITF tournaments and I won one 25,000 in Rome. So as I said, I have good memories and I really love the city. 

 Q. You said Ivanovic didn't look too comfortable on the court. Is clay your favorite surface? Because you looked fairly comfortable. 
 TSVETANA PIRONKOVA: Yeah. Actually, I am -- I'd like to consider myself like all-court player, expect grass maybe. 
 And, yeah, I grew up on clay actually, and clay and hard are my best surfaces. 

 Q. (From Italian) It was hard going from being a junior player to being a pro? 
 TSVETANA PIRONKOVA: Well, I actually haven't played a lot of junior tournament. I only have played four or five, and I decided that I want to go to play on the women's tournaments, and I started playing 10,000, 25,000.
 So I started from the lowest level, and took me a while to get to this level that I am now. Yeah, I think I'm doing good job right now. 

 Q. Now you have a good draw because you beat number 2. What do you expect now from this tournament? 
 TSVETANA PIRONKOVA: Well, I wouldn't say I have a very good draw. After this win, as we can see, it's Azarenka or Niculescu, both very good. Did they finish actually, or they're now playing? 
 THE MODERATOR: Still playing.
 TSVETANA PIRONKOVA: Yeah, they're both very good. Only top players at this tournament.
