Q.  Anna, what was the turning point of the match?  It was very close in the middle there?
 
ANNA KOURNIKOVA:  Well, yeah, I think I played the first set really well, then the second set -- the first set she wasn't ready probably for that kind of game.  After the second set, I started to make a little bit mistakes and she got right back in the match.  I think I still kept -- I didn't think that I can lose, I just kept on going. 
 

Q.  You looked to step up your aggressiveness a little more.  You were volleying and taking short balls.  Was that a big factor?
 
ANNA KOURNIKOVA:  I think I've always played like that.  I always mixed it up.  I think that's why I won today, because I did a lot of different things. 
 

Q.  Anna, you were down in the beginning of the third set.  Did you think something is going to go wrong?
 
ANNA KOURNIKOVA:  Yeah, I didn't start pretty well.  I was down 2-Love.  I just started to play a little  bit more safer.  She got nervous.  She thought she could win.  That's why probably she started making a little bit more mistakes. 
 

Q.  A player like that with her pace, is that the kind of game you like to play?  Obviously you relish hitting the ball, kind of plays right into your strengths.
 
ANNA KOURNIKOVA:  I don't see any difference really.  I mean, there is difference, but it doesn't really matter because she plays, she doesn't hit every ball.  You have to keep a lot of balls inside with her, you have to run a lot, have your patience.  She doesn't miss a lot, so it's really hard to play against her.  You have to always concentrate on every ball because she's running everything down. 
 

Q.  Which is the next tournament you intend to play?
 
ANNA KOURNIKOVA:  Excuse me? 
 

Q.  Which is the next tournament you intend to play?
 
ANNA KOURNIKOVA:  I'm either going to play Rome and Hamburg, then French Open. 
 

Q.  Are you allowed to play Wimbledon on the next go around?
 
ANNA KOURNIKOVA:  Well, my next year starts June, so from June I'll be able to play 13 tournaments. 
 

Q.  Does that mean you will be playing Wimbledon?
 
ANNA KOURNIKOVA:  Yeah.  I mean, yeah, if I choose  to. 
 

Q.  You haven't decided yet?
 
ANNA KOURNIKOVA:  Yeah, I'm sure I'm going to play.
