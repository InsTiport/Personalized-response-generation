THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Anna, please.  
 

Q.  You don't seem to be disappointed about today's performance.  Can you explain what happened in the last 24 hours from round one to round two?
 
ANNA KOURNIKOVA: I don't seem to be disappointed? 
 

Q.  I'm sorry.  Can you explain the turnaround in your performance in the last 24 hours.
 
ANNA KOURNIKOVA: Well, I think that, first of all, I wasn't playing really well and Corina was playing really well.  She was making all the winners, but I guess I gave her, you know, the right shots for that.  So I just think that I played  -- it wasn't my day.  I played really bad today.  
 

Q.  Is this going to be good enough preparation for the Australian Open (inaudible), going out so early in the second round?
 
ANNA KOURNIKOVA: No, hopefully not.  I don't think so.  We won the doubles today, so I'll still be in the tournament and we'll play tomorrow.  And maybe that's even good, you know, to give me extra couple days just to practice and  -- because I played in Hong Kong last week so I had three matches there, so I was kind of always warming up and just playing the match.  This will give me a little chance just to practice.  
 

Q.  What was going through your mind on the court? You didn't look like you were anywhere near the court.
 
ANNA KOURNIKOVA: Near the court? 
 

Q.  Yeah.  What was going through your mind?
 
ANNA KOURNIKOVA: I was on the court, inside the court. 
 

Q.  But your mind looked like it was somewhere else. 
 
ANNA KOURNIKOVA: That may be how it looked outside, but when you're on the court, you always think only about the ball.
