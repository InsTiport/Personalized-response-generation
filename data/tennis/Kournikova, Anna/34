MODERATOR:  First question, please. 


Q.  You know what the first question is going to be?  What do you think of the streaker?  Did you see the streaker? 

ANNA KOURNIKOVA:  Not really.

Q.  Did you see him at all?

ANNA KOURNIKOVA:  No.  I wasn't paying attention to that. 

Q.  You looked as if you were hiding your head under a towel.  Were you hiding?

NATASHA ZVEREVA:  That's exactly what happened.  She wasn't paying attention. 

Q.  Has that ever happened to you before?

ANNA KOURNIKOVA:  No. 

Q.  What do you think of men who do that? 

ANNA KOURNIKOVA:  Nothing. 

Q.  You have no opinion?

ANNA KOURNIKOVA:  (Shaking head.)

Q.  Should they be fined?  Thrown out?

ANNA KOURNIKOVA:  That's up to the officials to decide. 

Q.  You talk to each other in Russian or English? 

NATASHA ZVEREVA:  Russian, both. 

Q.  What did you say when you saw him? 

ANNA KOURNIKOVA:  Nothing.  We just buried into the towels, right? 

NATASHA ZVEREVA:  Yeah.

Q.  Did you see what was written on his chest? 

ANNA KOURNIKOVA:  No. 

Q.  Your advertising slogan for the sports bra.  Have you ever had any incidents before in a match? 

ANNA KOURNIKOVA:  You probably have, you played longer. 

NATASHA ZVEREVA:  No, not me. 

Q.  Any comments on the match today? 

NATASHA ZVEREVA:  Pretty solid match.  Under circumstances, especially at the beginning, kind of raining, frustrating to get off the court.  But we played well.  Solid tennis today. 

ANNA KOURNIKOVA:  I think it was a very important match for us not to lose our concentration, not to relax.  We were really, really strong. 

Q.  Was it hard to keep your concentration while security guards were chasing this man, a commotion, the crowd was laughing?  How did you feel at that point about focusing?

ANNA KOURNIKOVA:  Well, that's why we probably are professional athletes, we kind of used to everything around.  I was just trying to think about the match and about the next game especially because it was more important. 

NATASHA ZVEREVA:  Right.  People are still like making noise afterwards. 

ANNA KOURNIKOVA:  It was during the whole match. 

NATASHA ZVEREVA:  That was a little annoying.
