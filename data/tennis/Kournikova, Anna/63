Q.  Talk about what turned it around.  You lost the first set pretty handily, came back.  Can you talk about it?

ANNA KOURNIKOVA:  I think it took me a little while to get used to her game, because yesterday I played Amanda, a totally different game.  She was playing really, really well in the first set.  She was just hitting all lines.  I think she made like five unforced errors.  Then I just started to play the point, you know, make her play a little bit, not try to go for winners.  I think it made her move a little bit.


Q.  Did you also get more confident mentally?

ANNA KOURNIKOVA:  Sure, you know.  After you win like second set, you feel comfortable, just keep going on, trying to do what you did in the second set.


Q.  Are you surprised you're doing this well, happy? How do you feel?

ANNA KOURNIKOVA:  I'm happy.  I'm not surprised.  I worked for it, you know. ?
