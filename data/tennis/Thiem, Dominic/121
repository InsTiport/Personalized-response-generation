6-4, 6-4, 4-6, 7-5   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Question about that court.  Almost like the old Grandstand again.  What do you think of that court?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Yeah, it's an artificial court.  I think it's only this year.  Was a little bit tricky to play because the light shadow from the trees.   
But all in all, it's a nice court.  It was almost packed, so it was good.  I won, so of course I like the court.   
 Q.  The old Grandstand was famous for producing some memorable matches.  Did you ever play a match, tough match, on the old Grandstand?  
DOMINIC THIEM: I played Lopez once, was the first time.  I went into the fourth round of a slam, so I have very nice memories.  I think it was pretty special that the Grandstand was built right on Louis Armstrong.   
I think the new Grandstand is amazing.  The new Louis Armstrong is going to be great, as well.  It's nice.   
 Q.  Looked like you used some nice finesse in this match, dropshots, slice.  
DOMINIC THIEM: I tried to do that because he was firing really fast shots.  That's what he did.  I tried to play a little bit slice, spin, to change it up, to mix it up.  He's not on his comfort zone.   
I mean, it's difficult because it's pretty fast, and he doesn't let you do it all the time.  But from time to time it worked out well.   
 Q.  How difficult was it handling it after he came back?  
DOMINIC THIEM: It was 6-4, 6-4.  It looked pretty easy, but it was not at all.  I mean, he didn't convert one breakpoint first two sets.  Feeling-wise I had almost every serve game Love-30 or breakpoints to defend.  I defended it well or he just didn't make it.  That's why it was 6-4, 6-4 pretty solid.  But it was not like that.   
In the third set he converted a lot of these breakpoints.  That's why it got really close.  All in all, it's not easy to play.  You see all the scores.  Many favorites went down already.  Many other favorites played really close matches, like Roger.  It's everything pretty close I have the feeling.   
It was 4-5 in the fourth.  He made 83 points, I made 84.  Really tight match.  So I'm, of course, happy that I didn't have to go in the fifth.   
 Q.  Playing here at the US Open, we name things like after Billie Jean King, Arthur Ashe, players with legacies that extend off the court.  Is that inspiring to you?  Does it make you reflect on what you may want your legacy to be outside of the tennis court?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Well, to be honest, it doesn't really affect me on which court I'm playing, so what name the court has.  It's nice for them, that they have their own court.  But for me it doesn't really matter, yeah.  That's it.   
 Q.  How do you feel about the state of your game and how does this surface speed suit your game?  How is your net game progressing?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Well, the court speed is fine.  The balls are fine.  But I think there are many players out there, like also Taylor, who make it really, really tough for players like me because they take away all my time.  They play flat.  It's really tough for me to turn the defense what they push you into offense.   
Well, these matches like today, you just have to win.  That's what I did.  That's why I'm pleased.
