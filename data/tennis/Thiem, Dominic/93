THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Obviously a long hard-fought match, very difficult conditions, against an American, US Open.  Just talk about the battle out there today, the challenges, how you feel having prevailed?  
DOMINIC THIEM: I feel very good now.  And, well, before the match I expected a tough one against Steven, because he's great form, played finals in Winston-Salem.  It's not really a great feeling to expect a tough match in these conditions, because it was really, really hot out there.   
At the end, I'm super happy to be through.  Also, after tough last weeks where I was sick, was injured a little bit, I know that I can count on my body full again, 100%.  It's also was nice to win in five sets, so it was a very good day.   
 Q.  You do feel fully healed, fully healthy, ready for the challenges ahead?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Yeah, for sure.  I feel fully healthy.  I mean, otherwise I couldn't play that long in these extreme conditions today.   
 Q.  You will face another American in Taylor coming up next.  Your thoughts looking ahead to that match.  
DOMINIC THIEM: Yeah, it's a rematch from last year's second round here.  He always plays well in the States.  He had a great Indian Wells.  Last year he played well here.  Again, he beat two very good opponents this year.  And yeah, it's going to be a very different matchup than today.  He has a great serve, as well, and a great backhand, which, yeah, other way around than today.   
And gonna be a completely different conditions, so we both have to reset, basically.
