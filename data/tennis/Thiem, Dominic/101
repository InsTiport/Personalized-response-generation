THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
 Q.  How did you feel your game today?  And also I would like to ask you to talk to us about your next opponent, Tsitsipas.  
DOMINIC THIEM: I felt good.  It's very similar conditions from Lyon to here.  So I felt the ball very good from the first moment on.   
I was moving well and playing well, just one little weak part in the second set.  But apart from that, I'm very satisfied.   
But Tsitsipas, we played three times already this year.  He's one very good, upcoming player.  Going to be top 10, for sure, in the future and playing already unbelievable.   
But, yeah, hope that I can have an advantage over best of five.   
 Q.  Just could you talk about physically how do you feel right now?  Because, like you said, you played last week in Lyon.  How do you feel physically?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Good.  I was playing few matches in Lyon but was only four matches. And I feel physically completely fine, and the victory of the tournament helped for sure.  I'm feeling great with a lot of confidence.  Physically great, mentally great.   
So it was the right decision to go there, yeah.
