THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.
Q. You were training on Suzanne Lenglen.  How do you feel it?
DOMINIC THIEM: I love the court, Suzanne Lenglen.  If I could choose to play one match in my life, I think I would maybe choose Suzanne Lenglen.  It's an amazing size, and I have played a lot of great matches there.  I love it every year when I play on that court.
Q. You got to the final last year.  You're one of the men to beat this year.  How do you cope with that status as being one of the players who is under attack?
DOMINIC THIEM: It's a good status.  That's the result of a good season the last years, and it's a nice feeling.  But also, of course, a little bit of pressure.
I always played really good at this tournament the last three years, so I hope it's gonna be similar this year, and it's probably the biggest highlight of my tennis season every year, this tournament here, so I cannot really wait that it starts.
Q. The top guys, first three seeds, are in their 30s.  You're in your mid 20s.  What is it about them that keeps them going?  How do you bridge the gap between yourself and them?
DOMINIC THIEM: I think it's a very special situation, because we have three of the -- or maybe "the" best three tennis players all at one time in their generation.  It's not really a surprise that they are still on the top of their game in their 30s.  And they are all three also exceptional athletes, and they take care amazing of their bodies and they play kind of economics, so that's why they are still up there in their 30s.  But of course we younger players, we try to close the gap and try to finally win our first slam.
Q. What are your expectations for the tournament?
DOMINIC THIEM: I don't have any expectations.  I mean, my goal is to win the tournament, that's for sure.  I mean, I played semis, semis, final.  So I really would love to make that one last step, but it's so tough.
I think Rafa is the huge favorite, and then after that, there are also five, six players who can win the tournament.  So it's gonna be very interesting two weeks.
Q. How do you intend to close the gap in order to win the first -- what can you do to improve more than last year?
DOMINIC THIEM: Last year was the first time I have played the finals.  It was a very good experience, but I also learned a lot, because gonna be a very long two weeks.  It's very important to save energy, to still be on the top of the game in the last match.  That was not the case last year, but it was still very motivating to give myself hopefully more chances to improve in the next Grand Slam finals, which I really hope I can reach.
