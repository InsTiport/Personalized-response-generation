D. THIEM/A. Mannarino
7-5, 6-3, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Just talk about that.  Seemed like there was quite a battle in the first set.  Can you talk about what you did to overcome that and then you really took hold of the match from there on out.
DOMINIC THIEM: I didn't get the best start.  I mean, the only break I got was in the first game, so it was a tight first set and could easily go in his direction.  But, well, I threw everything into the last, into the game at 4-5, and luckily it worked out, and I think this was also the turning point in the whole match, because I broke him a little bit, also mentally, I guess, with this first set.  It would be, I think, very complicated if he would have won it.
Q. How do you feel about your performance?  You battled back to take charge.  Are you content with how you played today?
DOMINIC THIEM: I am pretty satisfied.  I mean, it was way better than the first two rounds, because he's a very -- I don't really like to play against him.  He can hurt me or it's not really easy for me to get to my good shots against him, because he's playing flat.
So it's tough for me to get my topspin and everything.  I'm very happy that I'm through in three sets.  Also, I mean, he's in a very good form now and also the previous weeks and months, so it was a tough match.  For sure, by far, the best performance by me.
Q. How are you feeling overall with your performance?  Do you still feel like you have room to improve, or are you playing the way you really want to play?
DOMINIC THIEM: Of course there is always room to improve, but it was really way better, and I really like the feeling that it's getting better from match to match.  It's necessary to improve a lot for the next round.
