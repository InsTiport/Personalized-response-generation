THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Do you think to lose a match like this will stick in your mind for a long time?
DOMINIC THIEM: Yeah, it's going to be stuck in my mind forever.  Forever I'm going to remember this match, for sure.
But, I mean, it's cruel sometimes tennis, you know, because I think this match didn't really deserve a loser.  But there has to be one.  And I would say if we skip the first set, was really open match from the beginning to the end.  Yeah, the way it ended up in the fifth set tiebreaker, there it's 50/50.  He made one more point than me.
Q. The start of the match, you were dominant.  What was the key to that?  What do you think changed for the rest of the match?
DOMINIC THIEM: Yeah, I started of course really fast.  That's what I was hoping to do, as well.  That's what I was preparing for.  But I think he was also not on his top level in the first set, for sure not.  Normally he doesn't lose against nobody 6-0.  But still it was great.  Of course, my level dropped a little bit.  Besides this first set, it was just an open and great game.
Q. Is there something you learned about yourself tonight?
DOMINIC THIEM: Not really.  I mean, I would say the first really epic match I played.  I played some good ones before, but not that long, not that long against the great guys on the Grand Slam stage.
I'm happy that I did this for the first time, even if it went the wrong way.  Of course, now I'm devastated a little bit.  But in few days I will look back and will remember now great it was to play in front of a packed Arthur Ashe this great match.
Q. Rafa said at the end of the match he told you he was sorry.  What went through your mind when you heard he was sorry?
DOMINIC THIEM: Well, I don't think he's really sorry (laughter).
But, no, I mean, he's a great guy.  I don't want to lose against anybody.  But now I wish him the title the most, that's for sure.  I think we almost all the time have great matches.  I hope that we have many more in the future with a different end.
Q. Did you learn something about Rafa from being in this match with him?
DOMINIC THIEM: Well, there is not really something I can learn.  I grew up watching him playing these epic matches.  I played him 10 times on clay, which was amazing.  Today this first match on hard court, which was ending really unlucky for me.
But I think he did everything already, so there is nothing I could learn you from him.
Q. You had the crowd on your side not because you were the underdog, but you showed them fantastic shot-making.  That had to make you feel good.
DOMINIC THIEM: Of course, crowd was great.  I think I have a pretty attractive game.  I really love to play these big matches on the big stage.  It's even nicer if the crowd is also on my side.
Q. You played him 10 times on clay courts before.  What was the difference in your matchup on hard?
DOMINIC THIEM: I think this is a pretty slow hard court, so it was maybe a little bit similar to clay.  Of course, not the same.  But, yeah, it was just I think way better for me than, for example, the French Open final.  I don't know if it was the surface or if it was something else, but it was a good and also tough experience to play him on hard.
Q. How did you find the conditions?
DOMINIC THIEM: Yeah, I mean, I already played under worse conditions.  It's nicer to play night than under the full sun.  The only thing which was uncomfortable was the sweating.  I couldn't run any more in the fourth set because the shoes were completely wet.  Also changing the clothes doesn't really make sense because after three, four points anyway you're completely wet again.
But, yeah, we're used to it.  It's not only here.  It's on some other tournaments like this.
