6-4, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How do you feel in this moment right now?
DOMINIC THIEM: I feel great.  Of course, I mean, it means a lot to me to play a finals.  My first finals in this level.
These kind of tournaments are so strong, so it's amazing for me to go that far.  I'm very happy at the moment.
Q. Against Dimitrov you showed a good physical performance.  What do you expect tomorrow against Rafa?  Do you have the physical level?
DOMINIC THIEM: Of course, it was very, very hard days for me.  First very intensive match against Grigor physically and mentally.  Last night it was very late.  Tonight is going to be very late until I come to the bed.
Adrenaline is going to be very high tomorrow.  I'm going to be fit, I guess.  I will give everything tomorrow, and hope that I can play a good final.
Q. I saw on your social media you got challenged to a touch tennis match.
DOMINIC THIEM: Do you know the guy (smiling)?
I mean, I just saw some videos on Facebook.  Of course, I really like it.  I mean, every tennis player likes these kind of games.
So, yeah, we somehow set up a charity match.  Maybe in the future I'm going to get a wild card in one event of this touch tennis.  Yeah, I mean, I never played it.  I just know the guy over Facebook.  It would be very interesting to try it out.
Q. You made the final in Barcelona, playing Rafa.  What do you need to do differently tomorrow compared to Barcelona?
DOMINIC THIEM: Well, I mean, I think he played a very, very good match in Barcelona.  First set there was I think close.  I also played well.
But obviously even if I'm at my best and he's at his best on clay, probably he's the better player.  If you see his records on this surface, it's just amazing.
But, yeah, tomorrow is a new day.  I will try to improve the things I didn't do that good in Barcelona and then we will see what happens.
