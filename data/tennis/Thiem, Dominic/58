T. FABBIANO/D. Thiem   
6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Can you explain what happened? I heard you had some sort of virus, but I don't know if that is true.  
DOMINIC THIEM: No, I mean, nothing happened. What happened is what I said before the tournament, that I'll play, I'll be able to play the match, but I don't know what's going to happen.   
Well, I got very, very tired and exhausted after two sets. I'm far away from 100%. Like this, it's very tough to win. I went on court because in tennis, especially in such long two-week tournaments, anything can happen.   
But it is what it is.   
 Q.  Apart from your physical condition, do you think that Fabbiano played particularly well? He had beaten already one top 10, Tsitsipas, in Wimbledon. When he won the second set, did you think, Now I can do it?  
DOMINIC THIEM: I'm honest with you that, I mean, congratulations to him and I'm happy for him. But it was not the real me there on the court. All I was thinking about was me, how I somehow can win the match.   
But I don't know how much his performance is worth because was not against the real me. That's why.
