J. DEL POTRO/D. Thiem   
6-3, 3-2 (ret.)   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  What was the injury.   
DOMINIC THIEM: It was the knee.  So, yeah, I had some problems with blisters, and maybe because of the compensation the knee started to hurt.   
But anyway, I'm going to do an MRI now in the next couple hours, and then I will have more information about it.   
 Q.  When did you start feeling it?  What were you feeling?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Started two or three days ago I think already.  Didn't get that much better.   
Yeah, at the beginning of the match it was basically okay, but maybe also because of all the excitement and this.  And, yeah, from the end of first set, beginning of second set, it got worse and worse.  No other choice.   
 Q.  How disappointing was this for you?  You were right there.  
DOMINIC THIEM: Well, every time you have to retire it's disappointing, of course.  But, yeah, I mean, knee is something where you shouldn't try out too much.   
Yeah, I have to check it out and then I will see how it's going.   
 Q.  When did the pain started?  Did you play 100% in any time of the game?  
DOMINIC THIEM: I have the pain since three days and never got -- got a little bit better maybe over the night, but then it started again.   
Yeah, in the beginning of the match it was okay.  But, yeah, in no time of the match I could bend my knees.  Like I couldn't bend it too much like the last three days.   
So I was all the time a little bit handicapped.   
 Q.  You were feeling this in your third-round match?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Well he, it started very slowly.  That's why I thought it because of the blister, because of the compensation, because I already had it a couple of times.   
So I thought, yeah, if the blister is gone I can walk normal again.  It's also the knee pain goes away.  Was not the case, unfortunately.   
But, yeah, third-round match, well, I felt it in the morning a little bit but during the match, no.   
Yeah, it started basically in the evening two days ago.   
 Q.  So the issue with the knee was blister?  Which knee was it?  
DOMINIC THIEM: It was the right knee.   
 Q.  But it was blister?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Yeah, the blister was on the toes, but I was all the time like somehow running strange because I couldn't put all the pressure on the toes.   
So that's what I thought, you know.  But, yeah, I have to do MRI because...   
 Q.  MRI for the knee?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Yeah.   
 Q.  You were playing very good in the first games of the match.  Do you think you would have beaten Del Potro if you were 100% healthy?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Nobody knows.   
 Q.  This was your 69th match which leads the ATP.  How will you approach your schedule next year based on what you've learned this year?  
DOMINIC THIEM: For sure I will adapt it a little bit.  Yeah, I never expected to play that many matches of course this year.  But, yeah, it happened obviously, and for sure next year I'm going to change it up a little bit.   
 Q.  Can you talk a little bit about how you saw Juan Martin Del Potro playing today, at least in the first set, first games where you were feeling healthy?  And if you think that right now Del Potro can beat anyone in the circuit again?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Of course the forehand is amazing, and also the service is really good.  Backhand probably not like when he was at his best, but I think it's getting better and better.   
He's unbelievable dangerous player.
