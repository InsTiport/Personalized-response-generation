THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What were your thoughts on today's match?  
DOMINIC THIEM: I had a really good start, obviously.  I mean, he was not really there in the beginning.  He was giving me the set almost, and then he changed his game a little bit.  He was playing much better.  I didn't know the right answers straightaway.   
Yeah, it was set 2 until set 4 was really close and tight match with a lot of breaks.  Yeah, could be easily a fifth, but I'm happy to be through in four.   
 Q.  Did it take you a while to adjust as opposed to throw you off a little bit, the way he did fight back in that second set?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Second set?   
 Q.  Yeah, the way he came back into the match.  
DOMINIC THIEM: Yeah, he just started to play better.  Of course I expected it, because it was -- it's normal that he doesn't continue like in the first set.  It was pretty uncomfortable for me, all his dropshots and his -- he was coming to the net a lot.  So he was -- he knew how to hurt me.  Yeah, break up also in the third.   
Yeah, was pretty lucky for me to win these two sets.   
 Q.  David Goffin had a good win over Karlovic.  What's your thoughts on playing him the next round?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Well, there are not many secrets.  It's going to be seventh or eighth match.   
We are really good friends.  We had already some very important and good matches in the past.  I hope it's gonna be another one.   
Yeah, I would say both of us, we have good chances to reach quarters.   
 Q.  What happened in the fourth set when you called the trainer?  
DOMINIC THIEM: I was feeling a little bit some part of my body.  Yeah, I'm hitting the ball quite hard, so it's normal that there are some parts of the body hurting.   
It's no serious issue.
