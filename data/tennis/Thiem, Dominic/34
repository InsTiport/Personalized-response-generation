THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Dominic, obviously a tough match. Are you happy to at least get a nice battle under your belt to start the year?
DOMINIC THIEM: I mean, I'm really disappointed with the results, but I think it was a typical first match of the year. I'm always a little bit struggling with the first match after a long while. It was the first one since London.
So many things were not working out that well yet. But it's fine. It's coming. I hope that it's going to be much better on Monday already.
And also, he played well. I mean, I think that he had a good preparation, because he came out fit, came out playing well. So also a lot of credits to him.
At the end, both matches were a little bit unlucky. We both had chances. Now it's 0-2, which is very sad.
Q. What did you think of the atmosphere? When either of you guys hit a great shot, the fans were really into it and you were trying to pump the crowd up a little bit.
DOMINIC THIEM: It was nice atmosphere. I think the whole event is great. It's a lot of fun to play. It's a lot of fun. And also a big honor to play for the country.
It's amazing that so many people are coming out to give us a nice atmosphere and was great to play there.
Q. Was it your serve or backhand? What was the thing that was giving you the most trouble that you were struggling to get into gear out there?
DOMINIC THIEM: Yeah, exactly. I mean, first serve was good but was too inconsistent. Second serve I had some troubles because it was long indoor season, and I'm still not having my kickback yet, so I need to work on that still a lot and that it's working great again. Too many double faults I hit.
And the backhand was great in practice. I just failed to play it well also in the match, because just few things here and there which I did great at the end of the last season. I did a step in. Today I did always a step back. So these are the small things which make the difference.
And that's it. But I hope that it's coming with the matches, I hope it's coming with more practices. And that's it.
Q. That loss put you guys in a pretty precarious position now. Moving forward, are you confident you've got wins in you in the next two matches to progress?
DOMINIC THIEM: Of course. I think we both played good today, especially Dennis. He played a great match. He had all chances to win, as well. Also, we didn't convert our chances, so if we do that in the next two matches, I think we can win both of them.
But we have a very tight group, very tough group where every team can beat any else team, so it's going to be similar like today, like, 50/50.
