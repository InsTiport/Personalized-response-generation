Q. Laver Cup, your thoughts coming into this weekend here in Geneva.
DOMINIC THIEM: It's a very special event. I love it. Every single session is so loud from the very beginning, and I had an amazing experience two years ago, so I'm happy to be back.
Q. What's it like being teammates with these guys rather than being against them on the court?
DOMINIC THIEM: It's nice, because all year long we are all for ourselves. We have to fight against these great players.
So it feels good to be teammates with them and don't have to play against them. To help each other to win the Laver Cup for Europe, it makes it a good week.
Q. Who is the person that surprised you the most personality-wise that you have actually been on a team with rather than against?
DOMINIC THIEM: Well, I mean, it's my sixth year on tour, so I know all of these guys. There was no surprise. We really understand each other well. We have a good relationship.
So nothing surprised me. Of course was a little bit different to spend more time with them, to have dinner with them and everything. But still it was no really surprises. They're all nice, and the week is very enjoyable.
