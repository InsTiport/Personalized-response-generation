D. THIEM/S. Querrey
3-6, 6-3, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You fought a lot in this match.  Was it so tough?
DOMINIC THIEM: Yeah, it was very tough.  He played a very good match.  I think he's not the biggest clay court specialist, but today he really played well.  Yeah, again, I saved match points, so it could easily go the other way.
He really played a good match from the start to the end, basically.  So I'm happy that I beat today a very tough opponent.
Q. You are going to meet Nadal tomorrow, so you had a match last Sunday in Madrid.  Is it going to be tough?
DOMINIC THIEM: It's going to be a really amazing experience for me to play him third time in a very short time.
I mean, it has been two very good matches, Barcelona and Madrid.  I hope it's going to be a third very good one tomorrow.
