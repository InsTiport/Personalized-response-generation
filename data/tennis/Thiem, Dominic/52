 Q.  (Talk about your win today.)  
DOMINIC THIEM: I'm very happy with my win because I never won a match against Richard before. He's a great player. Also started to play strong again this year. I think made semis of the Cincinnati.   
I was very ready from the first point on. All in all, it was a very good and consistent performance. I'm getting back to the top of my game since now pretty long period where I didn't feel that great.   
I'm happy and pleased.   
 Q.  This is your third time at the China Open. How has that experience helped?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Yeah, of course I'm much more experienced. I think also a much better player than I was four and three years ago. This tournament is very strong here. Only great players. There is no guarantee to win matches or go deep in the tournament.   
I'm happy that my first match is done.   
 Q.  What are your expectations for the tournament?  
DOMINIC THIEM: As I said, I'm trying my best to go deep, to win as many matches as possible. But every opponent who is playing here is so strong. It's getting more difficult each round. I'm trying to play my best tennis and to enjoy every match here.   
 Q.  The next opponent is a Chinese player.  
DOMINIC THIEM: Yes, he's a very good player. He beat Edmund in the first round. I think he was also playing well last week. Of course, it's an advantage because he's playing at home. He has the crowd in his back, which is always giving some extra percent.   
I have been ready and try to play as good as today.
