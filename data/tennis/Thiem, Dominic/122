D. THIEM/S. Bolelli
7-5, 6-1, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. Are you satisfied of what you have done today?
DOMINIC THIEM: It was a solid match, solid performance.
And a little bit of a bad start, I mean, 0-3.  So it was a pretty early match, so I had a bad start, and then it got better and better.  And I'm happy that I'm through in three sets.
Q. What did it feel to play against a guy who has skulls everywhere on his shirt?  Does it bother you?  You don't matter?  You don't see it?
DOMINIC THIEM: He was what?
Q. His T-shirt.  You didn't notice at all, like, the skulls that were in his shirt?
DOMINIC THIEM: I didn't understand the word.
Q. Skulls.
DOMINIC THIEM: Oh, skull.
I was not really scared, but -- no.  I know the brand.  It's a nice brand.  They make nice shirts. But I was not scared of the skulls.
