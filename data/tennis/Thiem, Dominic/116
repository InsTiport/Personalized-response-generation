7-5, 6-4, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Congratulations on qualifying for the fourth round first time here.  I have been in your match.  I see you playing very aggressive.  You took every serve very early, attacking.  What do you feel made the difference for you this year in Wimbledon comparing to last year?
DOMINIC THIEM: I think I'm in general better player than last year.  This is also paying off on grass I think.  It's different than on clay.  On clay I can go back on the returns and everything.  It's just not possible on grass, and that's why I try to play more aggressive and to take the balls a little bit earlier.
Q. He had big serves and you were attacking it.  Why do you think -- I didn't understand only difference between last year to now you're feeling you're better player so it makes you -- because I see your game.  You have a lot of weapons to play good on grass?
DOMINIC THIEM: Yes, of course, but I also improved these weapons on all surfaces.  I mean, it's of course very different on grass, but still, if you get a better play in general you will also play better on grass.  It's a very short time of the year so there is not a lot of possibilities to practice on grass and to prepare specific for this surface.
I also tried to come in a little bit more on clay and on hard court, and on grass of course that helps more than on clay or on hard.
