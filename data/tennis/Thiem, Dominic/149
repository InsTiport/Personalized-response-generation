An interview with:
DOMINIC THIEM
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. I don't think you wanted to win this way, but how do you evaluate your improvement at the US Open?  Thomas Muster reached the quarterfinals at the US Open 22 years ago on your birthday.  What kind of emotion do you have now?
DOMINIC THIEM: Especially very happy today because, yeah, it was my birthday.  If I would lose would be little bit a bad birthday.  Now it's a really good one actually.
Of course, nobody wants to end the matches in this way.  But it's really tough conditions out there, so I hope that he has nothing too bad.
For me, of course, if I watch on Saturday, I have a really tough match ahead.  So for me it's not bad for me that I didn't play full-time out there.
Q. How do you handle the situation at home, expectations of the fans, becoming a new star, rising star?
DOMINIC THIEM: I think it's little bit easier for me than it was for Jurgen, for example.  I'm only the second generation after Muster.  I think Jurgen was much more pressured to be the first generation after him.
There was a big tennis hype in Austria.  Everyone wants this continues, then it's very tough.  But, yeah, don't want to compare myself to Muster because obviously it's unbelievable what he won.
Q. Have you had any conversations with him?
DOMINIC THIEM: I played him four years ago, but that was the last contact.
