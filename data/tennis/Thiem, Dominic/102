THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  How do you feel now coming into this from where you were?  You had a pretty solid run up to here.  I just want to know how you feel health-wise and mentally too.  
DOMINIC THIEM: I feel very good.  I mean, always a nice feeling to win a title, especially this one.  Last week I fought really hard for it.   
So mentally I'm on top right now.  Physically I'm feeling fine anyway.  I didn't have any issues all week long last week.   
And so I come here with a really good feeling.  Like two years ago, I also won the title the week before,and then I made a good run here.  So I hope I can do similar maybe.
