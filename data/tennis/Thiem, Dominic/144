D. THIEM/G. Garcia-Lopez
7-5, 6-4, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.
Q. I read your comment the other day about wanting to play more versus having to practice, but you have played a lot of tennis.  How is your body feeling right now and how is the energy at this point in a Grand Slam?
DOMINIC THIEM: It's very good.  Of course, I'm tired in the evening after tough singles and after doubles, but in general, I'm feeling very well, and I think that I'm latest on Saturday.
Q. You next take on a friend of yours, Zverev.  Can you talk about your friendship and also trying to play against a friend?  You just played in Nice a few days ago.
DOMINIC THIEM: Yeah, it's going to be the third match in just four weeks, I think.  Munich, Nice, and here.  Yeah, it's -- he's a very nice guy.  We are good friends.  He's an excellent player, so it's going to be a real tough match on Saturday for me.  For him, too, I hope.
But, yeah, in Nice I think he was a little bit tired from the tournament, and, yeah, on Saturday probably he's not going to be tired.  So it's gonna be a really tough match.
Q. So since you know him so well at this point, what kind of challenges does he pose to you?  His game?  His strengths?  What do you think is the hardest thing?
DOMINIC THIEM: He doesn't have any weaknesses, actually.  And he's returning really well.  He's so big.  Returning far behind the baseline, almost every return is in from him.  So yeah, there are not a lot of free points.  For sure it's gonna be also physically a tough match, long rallies.
Yeah, basically he has no weaknesses, and that's, that's what makes him very uncomfortable to play.
Q. How difficult is it to play someone three times in such a short succession and replicate that performance every time?
DOMINIC THIEM: Well, there are good things about it and bad things about it now.  I played twice, twice guys which I never played; Servant and Garcia-Lopez.  Twice I had a pretty good start into the match, because I didn't really know what they do, what I have to expect.
Against a guy who you played more often, you know from the beginning a little bit what's coming and what can come.  But on the other hand, yeah, it's the same for him.  He knows the same.
Q. Is he someone that you want and expect to have many matches against in the future?  There is a lot of talk about the both of you having good success in pro tennis.
DOMINIC THIEM: For sure.  I mean, it's now already the third match, and in Munich we talked about it, that maybe it's gonna be a nice rivalry.  So probably it already started now.
Q. At this point in your career, how close do you feel to making that breakthrough on the big stage?
DOMINIC THIEM: Well, I mean, I had some really good results this year, but still, somehow a very good result at a big tournament is missing.  And, yeah, maybe when I make this one, then I can say maybe I made the breakthrough.
