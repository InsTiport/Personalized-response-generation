THE MODERATOR: Alright, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to the first-ever kids press conference at the Qatar ExxonMobil Open.  We have some hard-hitting reporters here who will ask some difficult questions.  For those of you who aren't familiar with this man right here, he won three titles last year alone, reached five finals and one of those was his first Grand Slam final appearance at Roland Garros.  He was a semifinalist here last year.  Show some love for the world number eight, Dominic Thiem.
(Applause)
DOMINIC THIEM: Thank you.
THE MODERATOR: Do you have any opening remarks for the kids first off?
DOMINIC THIEM: No, I'm surprised and happy to see some kids in the press conference.  It's nicer sometimes than journalists! (Laughter) No, it is amazing see all these happy faces.  I'm happy to see.  Thanks for coming and I am looking forward to getting some good questions.
THE MODERATOR: We can't thank you enough for making the time and wish you the best of luck at this year's Qatar ExxonMobil Open.  If you have a question, raise your hand and we will bring a microphone over to you.  We will start right over here.
Q. This is my question:  What do you eat for breakfast?
DOMINIC THIEM: (Laughter).  Here or in general?  In Doha, I like eggs all the time and I love Arabic breakfast, like hummus and pitta bread and all the traditional stuff.  And for last a bit of sweet stuff like bread with chocolate cream or something.
Q. Hi.  This is my question:  What is the best advice that you have ever been given?
DOMINIC THIEM: Maybe it was the advice from my coach when I was 12-years-old that I have to change to a one-handed backhand.
Q. My question is:  How often do you practice?
DOMINIC THIEM: I practice every day and sometimes twice a day and, like today, when I have a match in the next day, then only once and for two hours or four hours if I don't play the next day, so I will also choose how I feel and then I decide.  But almost every day.
Q. My question is:  How old were you when you started playing tennis?
DOMINIC THIEM: I was four-years-old, five-years-old when I started to play a little bit and when I was 11, 10, 11, I started to play every day.
Q. My question is:  How do you handle stress and pressure?
DOMINIC THIEM: I sometimes cannot handle it.  That's when I have a little, when I get crazy on the court, but most of the time I think of myself that it's actually great fun to play on all the centre courts on the ATP Tour against the best players in the world and then I see myself what a nice job I have then it's easier to take the pressure and the stress.
Q. My question is:  What is your greatest strength?
DOMINIC THIEM: My greatest strength is my forehand.
Q. My question is:  What has been your best moment on a tennis court?
DOMINIC THIEM: My best moment was when I won my semifinals in Roland Garros and it was the moment when I was, when I reached my first Grand Slam finals and it was pure happiness.
Q. If you weren't a tennis player, what would you like to be?
DOMINIC THIEM: I would love to be a football player.
Q. What is your greatest accomplishment as an athlete?
DOMINIC THIEM: I think the same.  Like that I made my finals in the Grand Slam which was amazing for me and I hope I can make even better in the future.
Q. Who was your idol or role model growing up?
DOMINIC THIEM: I didn't have one role model.  I just loved watching tennis and I was loving all the guys who were good, so not one special player.
(Applause)
