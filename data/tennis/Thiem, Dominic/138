7-6, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You nearly came back.  What is your opinion, in the second set?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Yeah, I mean, I got a break in the first game.  Basically I couldn't do the rebreak until the end of the match.  I had some chances in the last game.  I didn't do any bad mistakes at my break chances.  He was defending it well.   
I think it was a good fight out there.  I was much, much better and much closer than in Barcelona.  I think I already had worse weeks in my life than this one.   
 Q.  How did you approach this match compared to the one from Barcelona?  What were you trying to do differently?  
DOMINIC THIEM: I was trying to get my first-serve percentage a little bit higher, then also change a little bit my return.  It's, I think, one of biggest weapons, the serve.  Even that it's not that hard or not that strong, but how he plays after his serve, it's unbelievable.  He hits so many forehands.  You're under pressure after his serve almost every time.   
I tried to change it up a little bit.  It was better than in Barcelona.   
 Q.  I don't know if you agree, but the level you played today would have been enough to beat almost every other opponent, and still you come out as a runner-up.  Do you still believe you could have done something more or do you think you did everything you could have done?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Of course, I gave everything that I could.  But there were many or some chances in the first set.  But obviously if you want to play a close match, if you want to have a chance winning against Rafa on clay, I mean, you have to play your best.  There's no other way.  And, of course, it would be enough against many other players.   
But, I mean, it was a final of a Masters 1000, my first one, against the best player on this surface ever.  Sometimes against the best players in the world, you even lose when you play well.  That's the thing in tennis:  there's only one winner.   
 Q.  It was a great week for you overall.  How much confidence does this give you going into future events?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Of course, it were unbelievable two weeks in Spain:  Barcelona and Madrid.  I'm going to enjoy the next hours, then I'll think about Rome.  It's, again, a big and important tournament.   
Now that I did it once, play really well in such a big tournament, next step is to maintain this level to the next week.  That's what I will try.   
 Q.  Your relation with Joakim Nystrom, he was a great player on clay, but you have more topspin than him.  
DOMINIC THIEM: I think I also have better racquets than him back then.   
No, he's a great coach.  Always very nice to travel with him, like, 10, 15 weeks a year.  I enjoy it a lot with him.   
Of course, he was a great player.  Everywhere I go, he won the title almost.  It's pretty funny.  Also he's helping me he a lot with all his experience.   
 Q.  Speaking of coaches, Mr. Bresnik was not here this week.  Did he give you some advice during the week on phone or messages?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Of course, I mean, I talk to him every day one hour before the match, to talk about tactics or how I should play.  He's going to be in Rome next week.   
But I was playing well these two weeks without him, so everything was fine.  Looking forward to see him next week or tomorrow.
