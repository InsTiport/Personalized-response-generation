D. THIEM/J. Munar
7-6, 6-3 [Ret.]
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. What do you know about your next opponent and what are your thoughts on facing him, Sumit Nagal?
DOMINIC THIEM:   I saw his match last year against Roger first round here.  I actually saw the full match.  He was playing well.  I just remember that he has an amazing forehand, like a really, really good one, and the rest I don't remember that much.
So maybe I'll see some highlights of that match, some highlights of his match today.  But it's the same like I said before my first round, that every single player here in this draw is amazing.  Really, really good tennis players.
Well, it depends if I'm there 100%, and that's what I'll try to do again.
Q. What effect does the absence of Roger and Rafa have on you and on the tournament?
DOMINIC THIEM:   As I said, I mean, the absence of them is never nice.  Because obviously, I mean, I can speak only about myself.  I love to watch them, as well.  Even if I'm player myself, I love to watch them, watch them compete.
But I think it's not too big of a deal, because it's not the first time in a major that these two are not playing.  And in a few years it's going to be every major without them, so I think it's not that big of a deal.
There are still many, many super players around.  So it doesn't really matter, as it's not the first match where they are not competing.
