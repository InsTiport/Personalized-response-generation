D. THIEM/M. Cilic
2-6, 7-6, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Tough match first match here against Duckworth.  How do you feel playing now as opposed to that day?
DOMINIC THIEM: Obviously the first match was really tough, but it's always a little bit tricky first match after two month.  Duckworth played really well and I think it was a big fight.
And then second round was a very good match from me.
Today a big test.  Bad first set where he destroyed me, but then, yeah, I'm really happy about the win.
Q. If Roger wins you play Roger next.  I read you hit with him on the clay courts going into Monte-Carlo for a week.
DOMINIC THIEM: Yeah.
Q. What was that experience like for you?
DOMINIC THIEM: I think it's for every young player an amazing experience to play with the probably greatest of all-time.
Yeah, you can learn so many things from him.  Actually, I hope he wins tonight so I can have my first match in a competition against him.
Q. Can I ask you what are some of the things you learned from practicing with Roger for a week?
DOMINIC THIEM: I mean, you see many things which you don't see during a tournament, because it was a really professional practice.  There are too many things to tell them now.
Q. You're one of the younger players in the top 30.  I think there are four of you under the age of 24.  How do you feel your career has progressed, developed?
DOMINIC THIEM: Was tough the steps from juniors to the pros.  Took me I think two years on the futures, but the last two years were really good for me.
I think I made a good progress in the ranking and also developed as a player.  I think this year I want to make the next step and want to play well in the big tournaments.
Q. Just looking at the ATP tournaments you've done well at, they appear to have been on clay.  Is that your best surface?
DOMINIC THIEM: It's still my best surface, yeah.  I grew up on it.  I practiced, I don't know, from 12 years to 18 years I think 99% clay, indoor and outdoor.
So that's still my best surface.  I love to play on clay.
Q. Can I ask you about another 22-year-old, Bernard regard Tomic.  Any thoughts about Bernard and yourself perhaps going on to the top 10 together?
DOMINIC THIEM: I hope so, but I think it's a big difference between the ranking Bernard and me, we have now, and the top 10.  It's really double the points.  You really have to step up we big tournaments.  We both didn't do it yet, so...
But I think this year it might happen.  I don't know.  I hope so.  Would be great from some young guys come in the top 10.
Q. Your record in Australia, you've only played the Australian Open twice.  Is there something about playing on hard courts you've understood in recent times?  To make the semifinals here is a very good result ahead of the Australian Open.
DOMINIC THIEM: Yeah, two years ago was a really good Australian Open for me.  Was the first time that I was ranked outside the top 100.  I qualified, so it was a good record actually.  I think 4-1 back then.
Last year I had a bad preparation, so it was clear that I couldn't play so well here.
Yeah, this year I played really well, and I'm happy that it already pays off the first tournament.  I mean, I like to play here.  It's this special summer feeling what all the people have.  It's holidays here.  I think people enjoy to come here and watch the tennis.
Q. And just lastly, your military service, is that done?  Finished?  Do you need to go back to that at some stage or want to?
DOMINIC THIEM: No, that's done.  That's why I had a bad preparation last year, because I had to do this.
Then in May last year it was finished.
