D. THIEM/K. Anderson   
6-4, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You're in the finals.  It's obviously a good feeling for you today.  Did yesterday's match give you confidence?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Of course, it gave me a huge boost of confidence.  That's for sure.  But in the same time, it was a completely different matchup today.  There was also the fact that I never beat him.  It was 0-6 before today.  Some things were a little bit shaky.   
I was keeping my level up from yesterday, so that was a great thing.  The way I started was also well.  Even though I played really different, I was returning very far back today.   
Yeah, almost everything worked out.  To beat him 4-2, it's a very good result.   
 Q.  Is it sometimes hard to come back down to earth after beating someone like Rafa in a quarterfinals, really focus at the job at hand, avoid complacency?  
DOMINIC THIEM: No, not really.  I mean, of course, it's something special to beat Rafa, or a guy like this.  I mean, you enjoy it for a couple of hours maybe, but then you know, of course, inside of yourself that a very tough match is coming up.   
In the same way if you take out a big guy like this, your chances increase to go deep in the tournament.  There are many reasons why it's not too tough to keep everything up.   
 Q.  How confident are you that you deserve this title and your moment is now?  
DOMINIC THIEM: The thing is that my opponent tomorrow in the final is going to deserve it the same way like me.  It's not really a difference.   
Of course, I will try everything.  A Masters 1000 title would mean a lot to me because it's obviously really tough to win one.   
To be honest, I thought also myself that I was pretty far away before this week started.  Now I'm in the finals again, which is amazing for me.  Would be definitely nice if I win the title than if I lose tomorrow.   
 Q.  We don't know who you're playing yet.  Could you give us a word on both opponents, what challenges you'll face.  
DOMINIC THIEM: Yeah, still I think it happens more often than I played older players.  Tomorrow I'm going to play a younger one, for sure.  I know both guys.  I'm friends with both of them.   
Against Sascha, we've played five times already.  Last time was over one year ago, though.  In this year, he increased his level dramatically.  He won two 1000s.  He came into the top 10.  If I play him, it would be definitely something different.   
Denis, we had one off-season together, 2016.  We just played in Acapulco.  Yeah, if he continues his way, we going to find him very soon in the top 10.  Anyway, if you're in finals of a 1000, it's going to be a hard matchup.   
 Q.  All of this is gearing up to Roland Garros.  Talk about how your game, in your view, has improved over the course of the clay court season.  What are you doing differently, if anything?  
DOMINIC THIEM: There was a little bit lack of confidence in Monte-Carlo and Barcelona.  Even though I beat Novak, which was a huge result, then of course it's tough to digest 0-2, even if it comes from Rafa.   
I was a little time out before Monte-Carlo because of the ankle injury from Indian Wells.  Took me a while until I was moving my best again, until I was playing my best again.  I think the level of my game increased especially in this week.
