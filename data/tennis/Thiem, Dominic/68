D. THIEM/P. Cuevas   
6-3, 4-6, 6-2, 7-5   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  Third time in the Open era that the Top 10 seeds are through to the fourth round.  Curious about your thoughts on that, what it means, if anything, to you?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Yeah, I also read it on Twitter before.  I mean, it's pretty unique.  Third time in the Open era, which surprises me a lot, actually, that it happen the first time here.   
I think it's just a hazard.  I don't think that there is any big history or story behind it.   
 Q.  It just kind of is what it is?  It doesn't, say, Oh, the top is really consistent this year or anything like that to you, or...  
DOMINIC THIEM: I don't think so, no.  Many of us or many of the guys who are top 10 seed, they had tough matches and of course some of them were also lucky to be in the fourth round.  Maybe some balls here and there are different and it wouldn't be the case.  But it's of course nice for the history books.  I don't think there is any story behind it.   
 Q.  How are you feeling overall?  Just your thoughts on today.  
DOMINIC THIEM: For me, it was my best match so far at the French Open.  Not at all perfect yet, but the best so far.  He played well, especially in the beginning and then at the end of the match.   
Me, I had a very bad start, but then I played very well.  I was stupid to give the second set away like that, and then third and fourth was solid.  I think was quite a good clay court match.
