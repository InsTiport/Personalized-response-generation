  D. THIEM/F. Lopez6-4, 6-2, 6-3THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.Q. Straight sets despite the weather.  How did it feel?DOMINIC THIEM: Great.  It was tough to come out again.  I had immediately Love-40 in the first game after coming out after the rain delay.  I think it was very important to bring this game through.Q. Next up Berdych; what do you think?DOMINIC THIEM: He's a great player.  It's going to be the first time for me when I play against him.  Of course I know him from television and everything, but very tough match. I'm looking forward.Q. How much are you excited about getting into the fourth round of a Grand Slam?DOMINIC THIEM: It's my first ever US Open.  It's a special tournament, all the night matches, and I'm very happy to reach the Round of 16 here for the first time.Q. What do you think worked very well today?  Your backhand?DOMINIC THIEM: I think the best thing was the return today.  Worked very well.  He played serve and volley most of the time, and I could return in the uncomfortable (indiscernible), so this was I think one key point for the match.
