6-3, 3-6, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Two years ago, did you think that now you could be so close to the top 10?  
DOMINIC THIEM: No.  I'm really happy about it.  So two years ago I was very sad that I couldn't play Rome because I got sick in Madrid.  But, yeah, the level I play now and the level back then, yeah, I really play better now and everything got better.  So I'm very happy about it.   
 Q.  Do you feel competitive with the top five players on clay?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Yeah.  I played some very good matches against them, also on clay, but -- for sure I'm competitive against them, but, yeah, to be competitive and to beat them finally, it's a difference.  Yeah, I mean, I beat Nadal and I beat Ferrer on clay, so it gave me a lot of self-confidence.   
But, yeah, I'm still missing a good result at a big tournament, so I hope it comes soon.   
 Q.  And if you feel confidence for Rome and Paris?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Yes.  I had a very good start of the season, and now I got a little bit tougher.  I didn't play so good anymore the last two weeks, but, yeah, I had a good win today.  I hope it's a little bit a turnaround again.
