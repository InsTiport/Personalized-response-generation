7-6, 5-7, 6-7, 7-6, 6-2
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. About this French Open, after the US Open, mentally, physically, it was tiring.  How do you see this slam as a whole?  Do you think you had it in you to go more physically and mentally or do you think this was your limit?
DOMINIC THIEM:   Well, to be honest, I was over the limit today.  But if I would have won, I mean, Diego in that case, he has two days off now.  Maybe I would have recovered.  Even though I'm physically and mentally on the edge, you never know in a slam.  Especially tomorrow and Thursday off, two full days to recover.  You never know what's happening.
But, well, at the end I gave everything what I had out there.  It was an amazing match.  I think the first in my career over five hours.  Diego fully deserves it.  Well, it's fine.
Q. Could you give us an idea of the type of mental fatigue you're feeling.  How did you prepare yourself for these last few rounds given your tank was quite empty?
DOMINIC THIEM:   I just tried to do everything I could, like in the days off, to recover.  Tried something also new, which I've done before.  For example, before the round of 16 I did nothing the whole day.  Just to try to be on 100% again.
I mean, I was doing it quite well I have the feeling.  Also today I still could play at quite a high level for more than five hours.  But, I mean, he was keeping it up until the end.  He was probably a little bit fresher than me in the fifth set, so that's why he won.
In general, I mean, I'm not sad with my performance here in Roland Garros.  I mean, it was pretty short time with the long trip home, jet lag, and everything.  Then, of course, the first slam, which is a special thing.  Come here, play in pretty brutal conditions, I would say.  I cannot say it was a bad tournament, I'm pretty happy about it.
Q. Does time fly when you're focusing like you have to in a match like that?  Did that five hours feel like two days?  Can you share what you said to Diego at the net?
DOMINIC THIEM:   Time flies, to be honest.  It was still quite an enjoyable match, like amazing rallies, so close four sets actually.  Time was flying there.
At the net I just told him that he deserves it.  I think he's for the first time top 10 with that win.  That's also great achievement.  First Grand Slam semifinals.
I mean, we both gave everything.  Well, the thing in tennis is that there is one loser, one winner.  Despite I'm so disappointed, I'm still happy for him.
Q. Can you go back to the start of the fourth set when you were the break up.  Do you think that was the moment maybe it changed a lot for the rest of the match?
DOMINIC THIEM:   I came back unbelievable in the fourth set.  When he served for it at 5-4, 40-Love, I played this down-the-line winner.
The match was basically all the time on the edge for both of us.  Tiebreak at 5-All, he played a great point.  With that in the back, I think he had a little advantage in the fifth set.
I think if I would have wanted to win that match, I should have done it in four.  In the fifth set, he was just a little bit more fresh and better than me.
Q. What do you think Diego as confirmed top 10?  I know he is your friend.  He won very important matches during more than a year.
DOMINIC THIEM:   As I said, we both gave 100% in the match.  I'm super disappointed that I lost, that I didn't make the semis this year.  But at the same time I'm happy for him.  He really deserves it.  It's an amazing achievement by him to break into the top 10 for the first time in the career.
As I said, I'm happy for him.  Maybe to lose against a friend hurts a little bit less, yeah.
