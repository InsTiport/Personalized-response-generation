THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
 Q.  A couple of tough matches yesterday and today.  What do you think is good, positive things and what do you think you should improve going into London?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Well, I almost only take positive things of all three matches here.  I'm in the semifinals of a Masters 1000 only for the fourth time.  And especially here it means a lot for me because I didn't do too well in the previous years in this part of the season.  So it's something really special to reach the semifinals here.   
And fighting-wise all three matches were great.  And also playing-wise it was really good.  And three very different opponents.  Three opponents which were playing very good.  So I'm satisfied in general.   
 Q.  There was a very important moment in the third set, the eighth game, 15-40 down.  You must be pleased with the composure you showed there.  
DOMINIC THIEM: Exactly.  I think we always have to be aware of getting broken here.  Somehow a lot of breaks happening.  I don't know why.  But it's a little bit comfortable to return here, I have the feeling.  And that's why it wouldn't have been the end of the world if I got broken.  So lucky I landed two very good first serves there.   
And at the end it's nice a 5-3 and then 4-All for sure.   
 Q.  You said on the court that Karen is a friend of you.  Since when you know each other?  
DOMINIC THIEM: We practiced always a lot together, and because his coach before Vedran was Carlos and we always had a good relationship together, and we even did once the practice week together before US Open.   
And he's a very nice guy and also one of the best practice partners on tour.  It's always really good intensity.  And we are both looking forward to the match.  I mean, it's surprising that it's the first encounter.  And it's I think one of the last guys in the top I have never faced on the tour.   
 Q.  Did you talk to each other before the game of tomorrow?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Yeah, I mean, not about the game tomorrow, not how we will make it tactically.  But, no, we talked a little bit, yeah, after his match.  So was good.   
 Q.  Back to today's match.  You were probably aware that your opponent was defending champion, was also in a tough position ranking-wise.  Did you feel any additional pressure knowing that he was, like, all or nothing in this match for him?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Me, not.  Still I felt some pressure and it was not easy for me because, as I said, it's something pretty special for me to reach the last four of an indoor Masters.   
And always, I mean, reaching a semifinals it's not a daily thing for me.  That's why I was also little bit nervous.  But he I think also must have been tight because many points were to lose for him.  But I think at the end both of us we were thinking to win that match and not too much about some other stuff.   
 Q.  And what do you think about Novak coming back to rank No. 1 next week?  Are you surprised?  
DOMINIC THIEM: No.  I mean, he's one of the best ever players so it's not a surprise at all he came back to No. 1.  I mean, it's little bit surprising maybe that he made it that fast, because when we saw him in Indian Wells, Miami, he was not looking that confident.  And I think after Wimbledon he was completely back on his way.  And from the moment he won there, it was I think just a matter of time until he's reaching No. 1 again.   
 Q.  Last couple years there's been a lot of talk about Alexander Zverev.  Maybe not so much about Karen Khachanov.  But can you see him becoming in the top 10, top 5 player in the next couple of years?  
DOMINIC THIEM: He's now, I think, 16 or 15.  So it's just five more places.  I mean, it's not a matter of if, just a matter of when.  And also I think he played very well at the end of this season.  So he can make a lot of the points so I expect him in the top 10 in the first half of next year.   
And he's a little bit similar to Sascha, I would say.  Both are very tall, have a great serve, but still are good movers.  They move both really good from the baseline.   
So yeah, they're both going to be in the top 10 for a very long time I guess.
