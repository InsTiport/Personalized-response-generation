K. ANDERSON/D. Thiem
6-3, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. After beating him twice this year, what was the biggest problem today with Kevin?
DOMINIC THIEM: I didn't have a good start.  I mean, at the beginning I was trying to return on a similar position than in New York.  Was not working out at all.  I mean, I had no chance basically in the first set to break him.  Me, myself, I was in trouble almost every service game.  So the first set was not really good.
Then the second one was a very good set of tennis, I would say.  Was just one little ball here and there why I lost at the end.
Q. Last year's champion, Grigor, suggested Anderson was perhaps the most likely player outside of Federer and Djokovic to win the title here.  You just played him now.  Do you agree with that assessment?
DOMINIC THIEM: Well, for sure.  I mean, like every player who is competing here, I would say.  But he's very dangerous.  He serves well.  I think out of the taller guys, he's playing outstanding from the baseline.
Well, of course, he can win the title here.
Q. You'll be playing Kei Nishikori in the round-robin.  You beat Kei in Roland Garros, lost in Vienna.  Playing indoor hard court, does the speed of surface make any difference?
DOMINIC THIEM: Yeah, of course, it makes a difference.  But I think that he's playing a really good tennis the last weeks - since the US Open again, I would say.  So he really raised his level again.  That's why at the end he qualified here.
I think next match I'm going to play the loser of tonight, so either Roger or Kei.  Yeah, I'm fully focused on this match.
