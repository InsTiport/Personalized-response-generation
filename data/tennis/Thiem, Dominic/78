6-4, 6-1
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. Just a quick summary of the game today.  What did you think of Karen's performance?  Was he too strong for you today?
DOMINIC THIEM: Yeah.  He played a great match for sure.  Put me under big pressure from the first ball actually.  And me, I mean, I really put a lot of effort in the last two matches and maybe a little bit too much.  So that's what I felt today.
But still, I have to give all the credit to Karen.  He was serving well and returning well.  And didn't let me really get into the rally.  That's what I would have needed.  So he was making everything right today.
Q. There are a lot of big hitters on the tour now.  How does Karen match up amongst the biggest hitters?
DOMINIC THIEM: Yeah, I mean, I think for his size he's moving really well and that's why he's I think 13 or 12 already now.  So soon top 10.  So absolute world-class player.
And in general there are many big hitting guys right now on the tour.  They don't give you any time and they are serving all really good.  So if I'm not playing really, really good like today, then what's happening, they kill me.
