D. THIEM/G. Simon
5-7, 6-4, 6-2, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You finished there with some really big serves.  Did you feel like you were in control in the end, you just wanted to give it a little bit extra?
DOMINIC THIEM: No, I mean, I felt well at my serve the whole match basically.  I had a quite good percentage, many aces for my average, I think.  It's an important shot on grass.
Of course, the last game was perfect for me.  I'm happy especially with my serve today.
Q. Are you feeling more comfortable with grass overall?
DOMINIC THIEM: It's still not my natural surface.  But, of course, these victories give me a lot of confidence, also on this surface.  For the first time in the third round of Wimbledon is also pretty special.
Q. What have you been working on particularly to adjust to grass?  What parts of your game have you needed to focus on?
DOMINIC THIEM: Footwork, of course, is important.  Then, of course, I cannot change my swings and everything, but I try to play with less spin, to come in a little bit more.  I worked on my volleys.
I didn't work specifically on my grass court game.  I think if I improve my game in general, it's also going to improve on grass.
Q. Your confidence level going into the next round?  What about that situation?
DOMINIC THIEM: I know both, of course.  Well, as I said, for me on grass it's tough every match.  Today was also very close.  I expect the same in the next round.
