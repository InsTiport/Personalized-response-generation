2-6, 7-6, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Borna had you on the ropes, serving for the match in the second set.  You found something.  How do you feel you performed overall?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Well, it feels like a great victory.  I didn't play the way I wanted or the way I was preparing for.  In the first set, he was starting really good.  I couldn't counter at all.  Then the first set was gone pretty quickly.  I was almost out of the match, out of the tournament at 4-5 in the second.   
From this moment on actually I picked up my game.  From there on it became a very good match, I think.  Was a little bit similar than yesterday.  In the close moments and the third set I played my best tennis.  Even though, of course, I could easily lose the match today as well, but luckily I didn't.   
I'm happy because it's a great win for me.  He's in a terrific form.  He played two amazing matches here.  Also previous in the year he was playing very well.  I think it's worth a lot, this victory today.   
 Q.  What do you think about the scheduling?  A match of this potential quality consigned to Court No. 3.  Do you think it should have been scheduled for stadium?  
DOMINIC THIEM: I mean, for me, I really love it to play in little bit smaller stadiums if there's completely packed, like it was the case today.  For me it's way nicer to play two and a half thousand packed than to play in a stadium for 12,000 where there are only 7,000 inside.  The atmosphere was really nice, was really loud.  For me, was fine the scheduling.   
Tomorrow I have a packed center court anyway (smiling).   
 Q.  How are you feeling coming into the match tomorrow against Rafa?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Yeah, I mean, it's the biggest challenge in tennis right now.  It's really, really tough.  I'm going in the match to win, even though it's not very realistic, the way he plays now, the way I play now.  But, of course, I'm not going in to make a good show and to go home.  I'm trying to win.  I'm trying to play that way, chances to do that are the highest.   
Of course, I know how tough it's going to be.   
 Q.  You beat Nadal last year in Rome.  What do you have to do to bother Nadal on clay?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Yeah, last year was little bit different.  I lost to him easily in Barcelona.  Then here I was closer to him.  It was a really good match here, the last year's final.  Then in Rome I was able to play 100% the way it takes to beat him.   
But, yeah, it was one of the best matches of my life.  If I want to repeat, to win against him tomorrow, if I play him, then it's requested the same.  It takes the same.  I have to play the best, one of my best matches of the life.  I have to play very aggressive with not many mistakes.   
Doesn't look like I can win the way it is right now.  It was way more realistic last year.  Anything can happen in tennis.  Tomorrow is a new day.  That's what I'm trying, of course.   
 Q.  Do you think it's a little bit easier for you to play Rafa with a bit of altitude?  
DOMINIC THIEM: I think, yes.  If you're allowed to say it's a little bit easier against him, then it's here and in Rome.  Here it's little bit altitude, faster.  In Rome the same.  That's what also is maybe a little chance there.   
 Q.  Your ankle is ready for this potential against Nadal?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Yeah, I mean, I don't have any pain or any problems since Monte-Carlo.  I'm ready to run.
