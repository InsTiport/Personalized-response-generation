6-2, 2-6, 6-4, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  What's your feeling about this victory yesterday and today?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Yeah, it was a very good match, I think.  The key was, for sure, that I went home yesterday with a one-set lead.  It was really important.  The first set today was very, very good tennis from me.  Very focused and everything.   
But still, the key for the match was the third set yesterday night.   
 Q.  What is your feeling about playing on this court No. 18?  
DOMINIC THIEM: It's a nice court really.  Reminds me little bit of Pietrangelo in Rome, and amazing new stadium.  It's, I think, always full because there are always great matches there.  People really want to be there, and it was a great investment from the tournament to put the court there.   
 Q.  Were you disappointed about not playing on Chatrier or Lenglen?  
DOMINIC THIEM: No, not at all.  The court was packed yesterday, and it was really packed today.  I prefer to play on a full center court with, I don't know, 2,000, 2,500 people like court 18 than in front of 7,000 on Chatrier, because it feels kind of empty, and the atmosphere was amazing on court 18, so I prefer to play there.   
 Q.  You won in Lyon.  You're here.  Two matches.  What's your feeling about your shape, if you're good?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Really good tournament, victory last week, was great for my confidence.  Always something special.   
And then the first match here was good, and Tsitsipas was for sure one of the toughest second-round opponents possible here, and I did it in four sets.  It was overall a very good match, so my shape is great and I'm ready for everything that's coming up.
