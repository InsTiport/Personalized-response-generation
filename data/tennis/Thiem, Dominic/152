When did you sense the match change in the third set?DOMINIC THIEM: I think I started to return better in the third set.  Also, of course his problems physically started in the third set.  This was a little bit the changing point.Q. You warmed up together this morning?DOMINIC THIEM: Yes.Q. Have you ever done that with an opponent before?DOMINIC THIEM: Yes.  Back in the juniors I did it sometimes, but I think nothing bad about it.Q. You two are friends.  How was it to play?DOMINIC THIEM: It's tough.  I hated the situation.  Something really, really special. I mean, it's a really great win for me.  It's first time zero to two sets, first time five sets.  I would prefer it against everybody else, but not him.  I would be happier if it would have happened against someone else.Q. Ernests said that LÃ³pez would be a tough matchup for you next round.DOMINIC THIEM: I couldn't go on the court against him in Madrid, so I have some revenge.  But he's a great player, serve and volleyer.  Going to be a tough match. I have a day off tomorrow so I can get ready.  I have doubles, which is good to keep the strokes and everything. Then I'm going to be ready for Sunday.
