6-3, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Could you talk a little bit about the match, the conditions, and the form you're in at the moment?  
DOMINIC THIEM: It was a tough match.  Obviously he's in form.  And me, I had some issues when I arrived here.  I got a little bit sick.  That's why I also pulled out of doubles.   
But, yeah, I recovered well.  But for opponent like Stefanos who is playing great right now, who had a great run last week, also already one good win here, it was just not good enough.  And that's it.   
 Q.  Do you normally need time to adapt when you change surface, when you come on the hard court, or do you quickly?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Well, I mean, I think it's a little bit unlucky because I lost early in Kitzbuhel, which was very painful to me.  But the good thing of it was that I arrived on Thursday here in Toronto.   
But still I couldn't practice because I got sick.  So I didn't have enough time to prepare, plus my body got destroyed of this virus or what it was.   
And I don't really know where I am right now.  And, yeah, I try to work my way up again for Cincinnati.   
 Q.  Just a couple of words on Stefanos.  What makes him so tough to play and how close are you two?  What do you know of him?  How well do you know him?  
DOMINIC THIEM: Yeah, he's a very tall guy, serving big.  But I think for his height, he's moving very well.   
And he has no, really, weakness.  He's playing fast and aggressive from both sides.  I think top, top player of future.  And I think in the next one, two years, we will see him in the top 10.
