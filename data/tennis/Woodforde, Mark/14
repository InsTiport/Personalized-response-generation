 Q. What happened, guys, in the third set? 
 
 MARK WOODFORDE: They played really well. They served well. Sandon served very well the
whole match. We didn't really get a chance until when he served for the second set. We had
a couple breakpoints. But he came up with the goods. Then Cyril started serving pretty
well. Usually, you can get a chance on his serve. But he served exceptionally well today.
Didn't hold back. We probably didn't make the shots that we would have liked. Sometimes it
doesn't work out. It was a pretty good match other than that, I thought. 
 
Q. How do you rate them as a pair?
 
 MARK WOODFORDE: Well, I think today they played very, very well. I don't think we were
entirely happy with the way that we played. I mean, we can play a whole lot better than
that. I think they can play days like that, but they haven't really put it on the line the
whole tournament. You know, they're a dangerous pair. That was the first time they beat
us? 
 TODD WOODBRIDGE: Yeah. For them to do well, Cyril has to serve pretty well. He served
well today. We kind of let him -- he got that break in the second -- let them kind of get
a bit settled. I think Sandy played very well, I thought. He was probably the most solid
player on the court. 
 
Q. You spoke last week about you and Todd talking about aspects of your game after
Wimbledon, which you've worked on. What areas will you two talk about now before the
Australian Open?
 
 TODD WOODBRIDGE: We'll have to serve better, probably both of us. Our serve percentage
was way low. 
 
Q. Anything to do with the wind?
 
 TODD WOODBRIDGE: Not a high enough percentage, mine especially, with the drop serve. I
think a couple of games there, we got through tough games, missed a lot of firsts. I think
that's one of the things we -- if we would have served another 10, 12% better in that
match, we probably would have got out of it, at least through to a tiebreak in the third.
Would have had more pressure on their return games. We were struggling to hold. It was
always -- it's always good if you can hold quickly, then put pressure on the return, then
they feel under pressure the whole time. We weren't making them feel enough pressure. 
 
Q. Will your programs allow you to work together much before the Australian Open?
 
 TODD WOODBRIDGE: We have the European indoor section, Davis Cup, tournaments in Asia.
Still plenty of tournaments left for this year. 
 
Q. What about next year, much the same schedule?
 
 TODD WOODBRIDGE: Yeah, I would imagine so. At this stage, that's our plan. 
 
Q. It's been a difficult period in the last couple of months for you and your wife. Has
that affected your tennis at all?
 
 TODD WOODBRIDGE: It's hard to say. Possibly. My job -- I've just really been
concentrating hard on getting out on the court, working hard, putting a lot of good effort
in. That's all I could ask from myself. I'm pleased with the effort that I've given. I
didn't play as well the past few weeks as I would have liked. That could be from a number
of reasons really. But I gave, you know, my best performance that I could give. 
 
Q. We had Patrick Rafter, Mark Philippoussis in here the last couple of days, talking
about the expectations from Australia on them to go deep into the tournament, particularly
Pat and now Philippoussis because he's into the quarterfinals. Do you guys feel that
expectations, because you're the Woodies, possibly the greatest doubles team ever, do you
feel an expectation from home and a disappointment when you lose in the third round?
 
 TODD WOODBRIDGE: I don't feel it from home. 
 MARK WOODFORDE: No. 
 TODD WOODBRIDGE: We have our own expectations on our own performances and our own
goals. That's why you become a player, why you continue to try to improve as a player, and
aim for more -- in our case, aim for more achievements. Same for the younger guys. I think
you learn that a little bit more as you get older. I know for me when I was younger, you
struggled with that, and maybe Scud may struggles with that at the moment. You learn you
can only do what you can do and not what everybody else wants you to do. 
 
Q. Sandon was saying it's the seventh time that he's played you. He's had two victories
against you. He said he had learned off you. Do you feel because you've been so good for
so long that everyone is having -- knows a lot more about your game what they may have
previously and perhaps are using that now?
 
 MARK WOODFORDE: That's part and parcel of the game. I think when someone plays, leads
the way in standard, like I think probably we have over a number of years, it's
inevitable. If they want to win, they've got to be able to come out and beat us. I mean,
there's not too many times when we give a match to anyone. You know, Sandon is a bright
guy. You know, he had a very bright father as a champion tennis player. He knows a lot
about doubles. 
 TODD WOODBRIDGE: You see a lot of people play now. That's probably good. It means the
standard has improved against, picked up. 
 MARK WOODFORDE: That's why, after Wimbledon, we need to reassess where we're going, set
our goals to the end of, say, 2000, or the immediate goal for the rest of this year, next
year, then the ends of 2000. I mean, we have our high expectations, high standards. We
have to keep them up, otherwise you start sort of just shuffling down in the pack. It's
good because it keeps us working, not sitting on our laurels. 
 
Q. How disappointing is it not to win a Slam this year?
 
 TODD WOODBRIDGE: First time in six years or so. So it's not good. I guess that happens. 
 
Q. Is it any consolation that this is the best of three sets? A lot of people would
think it's not a championship test because it's not five.
 
 TODD WOODBRIDGE: Definitely I think the Championships of the Championships is
Wimbledon, where you go through a match like we had in the final, and even the
quarterfinal this year. That's where everything gets tested to its utmost. In some ways,
yes. I think we'd like to see it, at least from the quarters, go to five. If they have
trouble with whatever their reasons are, it's not like there's not enough courts or enough
time. You know, to add to the importance of the event, I think it would be good to do
that, like Australia does. Otherwise, they're just trying to get it over early, they don't
really care. That's not the way that the people of the game should run the game, if they
want to promote it to its best. Certainly a final like Wimbledon was promoting that game
to its best. 
 
Q. From a Davis Cup perspective, the American journalists have been asking their
players the last couple days, particularly Andre Agassi. Is it disappointing that the
Americans are going to put out a semifinal a team far different than the ones you played
last year? For the future of the Davis Cup, being such stalwarts of the competition, does
it disappoint you?
 
 MARK WOODFORDE: We were beaten by the best team they could put up. 
 
Q. I guess I'm asking, are you disappointed with their attitude towards the Davis Cup
this year.
 
 MARK WOODFORDE: I think if you start worrying about their team and what they're doing
-- 
 TODD WOODBRIDGE: We have to do our job, win our next match. 
 MARK WOODFORDE: We don't want to lose against Uzbekistan. If we worry about what the
Americans are doing, just because it's not in Agassi's backyard or Sampras is too tired
from winning here, whatever. It's like mind games. We've got a job to do. The next one is
going to be -- hopefully it's going to turn in our favor. You just get down there and do
the job, get into the World Group next year, try to start beating some of those countries. 
 
Q. I guess what I was asking, does it disappoint you that their commitment to Davis Cup
is not matched like, say, the Australian's feel for that?
 
 MARK WOODFORDE: They have their reasons. Someone like Chang wants to probably forego
Davis Cup to try and get back on track. Well, they should have another pool of players to
choose from. Probably Mark's option was to try and really lift his ranking up. Everyone
has their reasons. 
 TODD WOODBRIDGE: It doesn't disappoint us. The only thing is they lose a chance at a
good experience because some of the best matches and best experiences that you have are by
playing that event. Some of your greatest matches. 
 MARK WOODFORDE: For the two of us, I'm happy that my partner is committed to it. 
 TODD WOODBRIDGE: There's nothing better than playing a match in Australia where you
win. That's part of the reason, for me, I started to play tennis, was for that, to do
that, to get that feeling. But for them, they obviously don't have the same goals. 
 MARK WOODFORDE: And the luxury of winning it a few times. 
 
Q. What doubles team really kind of drives you crazy that you can't get a rhythm
against them, that you sort of dread before you get out there?
 
 MARK WOODFORDE: I don't know. For me there's not one particular team that drives me
absolutely crazy. The one team that probably we have good matches with and who push us and
we push them is Jacco and Paul. I think that's how we gauge the way we play and how our
year goes. When it's those, us, and them. They don't send shivers down my spine, the
thought of playing Jacco and Paul. I'm wanting to play them because I want to see how I'm
playing and how we're playing. It would be nice if there were other teams out there that
could make you a bit more focused on trying to improve and lift the standard up. 
 TODD WOODBRIDGE: I agree.
