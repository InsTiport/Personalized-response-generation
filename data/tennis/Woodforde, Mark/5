MODERATOR: Questions for Mark and Todd. 

Q. Nice sustained applause there after the match. 

TODD WOODBRIDGE: Yeah. I think everyone knows that was our last Slam. Good crowd. 

Q. What does it feel like? 

MARK WOODFORDE: I mean, you know, disappointment that we lost, I mean, at this stage.
That's what it feels like, disappointing. I think they played pretty well the first set
and a bit. We were trying to just find a bit of a groove. We nearly grinded it out, but I
think the rain delay sort of did us in a bit. It's disappointing. Got to look at it that
it was another match. We always knew it was going to be tough. I think that was going to
be maybe the biggest hurdle for us, which it always is in a Slam, one of the early
matches, whether we're ready to go straightaway. They got the jump on us. Disappointing.
Last tournament, last Slam. Wanted to do pretty well in it.

Q. In the bigger picture, people saying good-bye to you on the court in the way they
did, kind of touching?

MARK WOODFORDE: I didn't hear them say good-bye. I just heard the applause. I guess
it's something. 

Q. Is it a little frustrating to kind of end it on a double-fault? 

TODD WOODBRIDGE: Yes, that's disappointing. But, you know, played a million matches
together, a thousand matches or something we played so far - a couple more to go in
Sydney. Yeah, a little disappointing because we did well to get back into that match. We
had our chance, up a break in the third, as well. But that's the game. Some people have
done it to me and done it to him.

Q. How about you, Todd, any sadness?

TODD WOODBRIDGE: It's really hard to really figure that out just yet. But, yeah, you
know, that was a hard finish in the sense that I didn't even want to shake his hand. I
wanted to more give him a hug and say, "Thanks, very much," because it's been
great. It's one of those things that I never dreamed about, being able to do as well as
we've done. This year, no matter how we do in Sydney, has been nearly the best year of my
career because I've enjoyed it the most. Losing today and everything like that, that's
just part of everything, but this whole year has been the most enjoyable that I've spent
playing with Mark. I realize that now because I appreciate a lot of what we've had
together. 

Q. Mark, talked to a couple doubles players today, Nestor. The word that keeps popping
up when they hear the name Mark Woodforde is "sportsmanship," some sort of
derivative. Is that the appropriate word for you, one that you want to be --?

MARK WOODFORDE: Nestor usually calls me an asshole when I walk by him. 
TODD WOODBRIDGE: That's why I'm laughing. 

Q. Maybe he mellowed at the end of my career. 

MARK WOODFORDE: Nestor and I rib each other a bit. I'm sure I called him a few names,
as well. Yeah, that's great. I mean, I think they've been -- not too many times have they
been on the winning end, but they've certainly been on the losing end a few times. I guess
it's something, not necessarily me, because I think it's sort of us, easy to sort of hold
yourself out on the court, performing as a duo. I mean, I've always had a good work ethic.
I love competing. I love being out there. I've enjoyed the wins. The losses, you sort of
thrive on them to come back out. If that's sportsmanship, I'm out there trying, then
that's me. I think that's us anyway. You know, I think I just tried to apply myself. I got
the most out of myself, and I think we've got the most out of each other. Maybe I think a
few of the other guys are probably breathing a sigh of relief now that we're out of this
tournament, that we're not going to be around too much longer. I think we've raised the
level over a number of years. It's been tough for some of the guys to keep up. I don't
know if that's necessarily sportsmanship. You've got to take some of the losses on your
chin. There always has been another day, another tournament to play. I've never been
frightened to show up and try again. You know, you always put in a bit of a mediocre day.
As I said, there's always the next tournament or the next day to come out and play a
little bit better. I've never really sort of had this cloud hanging over me. I've tried to
just keep getting out there and playing.

Q. Have you ever thought about what role models you have been for the game, how younger
kids look up to the two of you, the way you present yourselves on and off the court?

MARK WOODFORDE: It's not something that we deliberate a lot about. Obviously, being in
the public's eye, especially back in Australia, they know who we are. It's like we're a
household name almost. When you mention tennis, you know the Woodies, you know Rafter, a
couple of the other guys. We've always tried to I think be professional. I think that's
probably more -- hopefully a lot of the other guys realize we're being professional. We've
gotten the most out of this tandem. If some young kids are looking at that, that's the way
to go. You can't go hell bent playing match after match, tournament after tournament, not
train properly. I mean, I think we can look back. 
TODD WOODBRIDGE: For up-and-coming players, I think that's what Mark is saying. 
MARK WOODFORDE: Yeah. 
TODD WOODBRIDGE: We have set a good example of what you need to do to become a good
tennis player, what you need to keep working on. If I was a young player hanging around
the tour, like a Lleyton Hewitt, sort of sapped every bit of information out of Patrick
Rafter and the Woodies. 

Q. Todd, you will go on, but what will you miss about this guy? 

TODD WOODBRIDGE: I'll miss confidence in himself, in the other guy on my other side of
the court, the ability to really want to come out the next day and improve. If the day
before wasn't very good, come out and get it better. You know, you talk about his work
ethic. For the Woodies it's always been when we had a bit of a dry spell, didn't play so
well, we found a way to get through it. That came from both of us. I don't know whether
I'll be able to find someone else that will have that same aptitude.

Q. There's a young South Australian that drops a curtain on your career. Where were you
at 19, compared to Lleyton? 

MARK WOODFORDE: At 19, I probably was struggling, trying to become a tennis player.
Certainly wasn't at the level that Lleyton is at now. I think that's the process, due
process, Mother Nature maybe. It's like each player perhaps from a state. When I was
growing up, John Fitzgerald and Brod Dyke were the people just above me. I like to believe
that I became -- used that information or learned from them and became a little bit
better. I think Lleyton has done that. To be able to say you're one of the best ones from
your state, even in Australia, it's fantastic. He will no doubt erase some of my
achievements. He already has in singles. Certainly hope he keeps going with the doubles,
as well. He plays very well. Yeah, he's just evolved into a better player. I mean, he just
-- you just sort of pass over the next player again. Hopefully there's somebody else from
Adelaide that will come on after Lleyton. I think I said when he first beat me, when he
won Adelaide, I said, "I think he's a tough little shit." He certainly is a
tough little shit tonight for digging that match out. He came up with the goods. That's
great. You know, he never flinched one bit. He believes in himself, that he can win.
That's why he's out there winning. I guess if you have to lose to someone, it's better to
lose to a countryman, teammate. 

Q. What are you going to do now? 

MARK WOODFORDE: I'm going to just enjoy the next stage of my life. I've again worked
very hard at this, gotten everything out of my ability. I'd like to take a breather, just
sit back for a while. I haven't really thought too much about anything besides raising a
family. I mean, both of us are having kids later in the year. That will certainly take a
lot of my focus, perhaps my focus that there are tournaments going on back in Australia
without me. I've given myself about a year to decide what I want to do. But I'm sure
probably after a month I'll be itching, "Where am I going to go here?" But the
beauty of it is that I guess we've made a name for ourselves, we've been very
professional. I don't think the Woodies will ever disappear at all. The Woodies that name,
us, we're certainly one of the -- hopefully I can finally say it, one of the greatest
teams out there that have played. You know, we're hoping that we can still, while I'm
maybe not around too much at the tennis tournaments, Todd is playing with someone else,
that we're still able to push our name and associate ourselves with some quality products,
with quality companies, you know, go on that way. Who knows, when Todd gets 35, we might
look at playing some of those events at the Slams. That's a long way away yet, isn't it? 
TODD WOODBRIDGE: Yeah. 

Q. This being your last Grand Slam, each of you, what is your best Grand Slam moment in
your career? 

TODD WOODBRIDGE: I think -- it's two. This year, winning back-to-back French and
Wimbledon. Those were the two great ones. I know you asked for one, but I find it
difficult to be able to single out one of those because winning the French meant we'd
captured everything. I think Wimbledon was the one we felt was our own personal one. To
leave Wimbledon for the last time together winning that, that was just the best. That was
the best, the most pleasing, fulfilling feeling I've had in our partnership, those two
months. 

Q. Would you agree, Mark? 

MARK WOODFORDE: Yeah. You know, to bounce back from a bit of a barren year in 1999,
where I guess a lot of people had written us off, there was a lot of doubt, you know, I
think from this tournament last year onwards, we could feel there was a bit of a
turnaround for us. So to bounce back and win a Grand Slam that we'd never won, had wanted
to win so badly, to win it, then two weeks later to win another Wimbledon is incredible.
Even like the first Slam you win, that's something very, very special. For me, I certainly
remember that very special feeling. I felt like then that, "Hey, I've got a decent
partner, and we're going to do pretty well, and I think we can win all of the
tournaments." That was a very special moment for me because I felt like I picked well
and we could blend well. He was not going to let me down. If we're out of singles, we were
going to do well in doubles. That was a special moment, as well, that very first one. 

Q. What else are you playing this year together? 

TODD WOODBRIDGE: At this stage, it's just the Olympics. At this particular moment,
yeah. It's been our goal, that one has always been our goal, we talked about. I still
believe we can win there, get a medal. I think if we could do that, that's just perfect.
