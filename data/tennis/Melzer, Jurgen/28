JURGEN MELZER: I played him in the finals of Newport this year. 

JURGEN MELZER: He won in three sets. It was close two first sets and he won third set pretty easy, but quite different match. Now we'll see how it goes. 

JURGEN MELZER: Grass. 

JURGEN MELZER: I think I serve better than him and he returns better than me. We'll see how it goes and if I serve good, I think I have a chance. 

JURGEN MELZER: Well, I think it's easier being first match because you don't have to wait for the other matches so that's the only thing which is an advantage, but you cannot change it anyway and you have to take it as it comes and well, I am glad that I am first match. 

COACH BRESNIK: Playing indoors a lot. Stefan doesn't mind to play indoors/outdoors. He used to be a claycourter, but decent success on hard court and the speed of the surface, I think is very, very fair. It's not too fast. It's really a nice high bounce so it's the perfect setup for a good match. 

COACH BRESNIK: No matter how the first match is going to be finished, and all -- he is experienced enough and tough enough to have no pressure no matter if it's 1-Love or love-1 coming into the second match so it's not going to be -- not going to make a big difference tomorrow. 

COACH BRESNIK: It doesn't matter, Andy Roddick is not going to be affected by the score of the first match. 

COACH BRESNIK: He had what? 

COACH BRESNIK: He's a very experienced player. He has a lot of experience with Roddick, lately, playing doubles together, so they know each other very well, but it's not going to be a big difference on the outcome.
