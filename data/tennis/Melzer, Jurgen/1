 6-6 [Ret.]
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. I know it's weird to say congratulations after that, but congratulations.  I just wanted to clarify, I know about a month ago you posted about how you were going to finish after the Australian Open, but I understand that now maybe things are changing a little bit?  Can you just clarify for people your situation?
 JURGEN MELZER:   Things are not changing.  I'm still gonna retire after the Australian Open with a possible chance of playing French Open and Wimbledon.  That's the maximum tournaments I would play next year.
 But I start working for the Austrian Federation in February, so that's a done deal.
 Q. Got it.  I remember speaking to you when you first started focusing on doubles and you wanted to see sort of where it could take you and like what you can achieve.  So now that you're here, especially after the strong finish to the year and you're still going, how proud are you of what you have been able to sort of prove to yourself?
 JURGEN MELZER:   Well, in the end I'm very proud, because I think every athlete's dream or goal should be you retire at a level where you don't embarrass yourself and your peers think, okay, this is still a good player.  Now you finish on your own terms.
 I think I'm going to achieve that.  I'm very happy about that.
