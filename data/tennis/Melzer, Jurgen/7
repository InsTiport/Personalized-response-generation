J. MELZER/D. Tursunov
  6-3, 2-6, 7-6, 7-6

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Next round it's Xavier Malisse. What do you know about him? What do you expect?
 JURGEN MELZER: Well, I expect a tough match. He knows how to play on grass; former semifinalist here. I think we have had two matches. I'm not sure. It's been a long -- three maybe? Okay. It's been a long time ago. 
 I know I won one in San Jose; I lost one in St. Poelten, and the third one... 

 Q. Chennai. 
 JURGEN MELZER: Chennai, I lost to him in Chennai. It's going to be a tough match, completely different than the one I had today, I think. 
 Xavier plays the ball. He's not hitting as hard as Tursunov. I'm actually looking forward to play tennis because today it felt like it's a little more goalkeeping and guessing which side to go.
 But I'm positive. I mean, I've played -- I haven't played a lot of matches lately, and I still beat a good opponent today with Tursunov. I'm happy with my performance. 
 As I said, I'm very much looking forward to the match.

 Q. Is it 50/50?
 JURGEN MELZER: Probably. I mean, if you consider the rankings I might be the favorite; if you consider that I haven't played any matches almost since Rome, then it could be an even match. 

 Q. Why haven't you played since Rome? 
 JURGEN MELZER: Well, I have played, but I have been injured on my back. 

 Q. And you are 100% okay?
 JURGEN MELZER: I'm 100% fine, yeah.
