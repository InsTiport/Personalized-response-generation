BRYAN-BRYAN/Melzer-Petzschner
  6-3, 7-5

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Overall, how do you think you played in the match? 
 JURGEN MELZER: I think, besides serving, it was okay. I mean, we played an okay match. We had break chances the first set. We broke them in the second. If you lose three times your own serve, you might not beat the Bryans. 

 Q. In the first set I know that the Bryans got a break with the net cord that dribbled over. Are you happy about the way you performed particularly in the second set, the fact that you broke them? 
 JURGEN MELZER: I think you cannot be happy losing a set. 
 I mean, it was an okay performance, considering the circumstances. We haven't played since the US Open. It was our first match. 
 But it's always tough. You go out there, you want to win. When you end up losing, you're obviously disappointed. 

 Q. As regards the place and the court, how was that? 
 JURGEN MELZER: I think fair. I mean, it's quite fast, but not too bad. I mean, low bounce. Nothing special. 
 I think it's a very fair court.
