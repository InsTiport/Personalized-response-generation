THE MODERATOR:  First question, please. 


Q.  Were you surprised after the first set?

STEPHANE HUET: (Through a translator.) He was really surprised.  It's not easy to go in a big tournament like that, and he saw Norman very nervous.  He said that he wanted to use that, which was difficult because he got a lot of confidence in him.  And he said as well, I haven't got any pressure and that I have to play my game like that.  I tried to play it free. 

Q.  You played extremely well in the first set, the first half of the second set.  Did you get too confident?

STEPHANE HUET: (Through a translator.) No, no.  He was not too confident, but he was a little bit tired.  It was difficult physically because he just arrived last Thursday because he was actually asked to come last Wednesday.  And then he arrive on Friday, last Friday.  It was short, and he was tired at the beginning.

Q. You've played a lot of these tournaments but have not gone past the second round.  What keeps you in the game?

STEPHANE HUET: Just the fact to be able to play in stadiums like this and to play at that kind of level, it gives me motivation to continue.
