THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  We haven't spoken for a few days.  Anything in the last few days that was really cool about Maui that you want to mention?  
ALL: (Laughter.)  Escape the Room.   
COACH RINALDI: We're obviously enjoying our time here in Maui.  We've had some great meals at your local restaurants and had a lot of fun.   
 Q.  You guys did a kids' clinic earlier in the week.  Can you talk about that a little bit?  
COACH RINALDI: Sure.  The kids' clinic was great.  Always great when you get such a big group of kids coming out that are so enthusiastic and passionate about tennis.   
Obviously they get a kick out of playing with the pros, and the girls did a great job.   
Hopefully we inspired some kids.  I think that's one of the highlights of the week really.   
 Q.  Can you give an initial reaction to the order?  
COCO VANDEWEGHE: I think it was pretty much expected.  That was my call and my bet with Craig and everyone as to who they were going to play.   
BETHANIE MATTEK-SANDS: You'll see them streaking on the beach later.  (Laughter.) (Laughter.)   
 Q.  What would you say has been the most memorable part of this trip so far from the team building activities you've participated in?  
COACH RINALDI: Oh.  Got to pick one?   
 Q.  Yeah, any one.  
SHELBY ROGERS: Escape the Room was amazing.  We really came together.   
BETHANIE MATTEK-SANDS: Yeah, and escaped.  We got out.  Otherwise we would've still been in there.  (Laughter.)   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH RINALDI: I think the girls have put in a great week of practice.  I think the expectation is really to go out there, represent your country, do your very best, and we're going to have some fun and compete hard and leave it all on the court.   
I can't ask for more any more than that from any of these players, and I know each and every player well and I know that's what I can expect.   
 Q.  Coco and Bethanie partnering again on doubles, double trouble.  
BETHANIE MATTEK-SANDS: Coco is my big spoon.   
COCO VANDEWEGHE: True, true.   
BETHANIE MATTEK-SANDS: We're pumped.  We're not going to high five each other as hard as we normally do.  We do have to save our hands for something great.   
COCO VANDEWEGHE: (Indiscernible.) (Laughter.)   
BETHANIE MATTEK-SANDS: But we're ready.   
CAPTAIN RINALDI: Struggling with the team chemistry part.  (Laughter.)   
BETHANIE MATTEK-SANDS: We don't like each other, no.  (Laughter.)
