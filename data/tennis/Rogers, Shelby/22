An interview with:   
SHELBY ROGERS   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Your reaction to the match as a whole?  
SHELBY ROGERS: I'm very happy.  I'm really excited to be into the third round for the first time at any slam.  It's been a really great week for me.  You know, I have a lot of confidence.  I'm really happy with the way I'm playing and happy to be healthy again.  I've had a couple injuries.  Pretty big one I'm coming back from.  It's just nice to be back on court, playing well.  I'm loving every minute.   
 Q.  Tell us a little bit about how you got through the match, the strategic decisions you made, and a new milestone?  
SHELBY ROGERS: Yeah, that's definitely in the back of my mind.  I'm happy I got through it today.  I was just trying to, you know, play my game, do the things that I know I can execute and do well.   
Yeah, I served pretty well today, better in the second set.  That got me out of some tough situations.  Yeah, but I'm happy overall with the way I fought.  I didn't play my best tennis but fought really hard.  Stuck out some of the bigger points, so I'm happy.   
 Q.  You're from Charleston.  It's been an interesting summer there.  Do you have any connection to the church that the shooting happened on?  
SHELBY ROGERS: Not personally.  The reverend was pretty well-known throughout the city.  It really affected the whole city, even though it wasn't personal.  I didn't really know the people.  But it was just a really tough incident to watch.   
I was in Europe at the time.  So seeing how my city reacted was really special.  I was so proud of them, the way they came together.  It was really cool to watch.   
 Q.  Have you been back to Charleston since?  
SHELBY ROGERS: No, I haven't been there since April.  But my parents have come to some tournaments.  I hope to get back soon, though.   
 Q.  What are your expectations about the next match against Simona Halep?  
SHELBY ROGERS: Yeah, I'm so excited.  That's why we play the sport.  That's why we try to win each match, is to get to the further rounds and play the bigger players.   
I'm really excited.  I just hope to bring my A game.  I'm going to fight like crap to win every point.  Just enjoy the experience, you know.  It's been an incredible couple weeks for me already, so...   
Yeah, just enjoying every moment out there.   
 Q.  Being an American, any special significance to achieving a personal milestone at the US Open?  
SHELBY ROGERS: Of course, yeah.  It's always special playing here as an American.  The crowd gets behind you.  Unfortunately I've had to play a couple Americans in my draw.  Today was a lot of fun.   
There was a guy wearing American flag pants, the bandana.  It's always fun to see the fans come out and kind of have a little pride for playing for your country, as well.
