   ETIENNE de VILLIERS:  So you're probably wondering what the hell this is all about, and it's really simple. 
 I just wanted to get you here under false pretenses to thank you for everything you do over the year and every year to make our sport better. 
 I had to find a reason to buy you some champagne, and this was the reason.  I knew if I did anything else, you wouldn't come.  So I had to lie to you and say there was something important. 
 I just want to say thank you.  You keep us honest, and that's important.  I don't expect praise when I don't deserve it.  I don't even expect praise when I do.  I expect you to keep us honest. 
 But I love what you do.  You keep our game alive.  Without you, we don't have a sport.  I just wanted to say that I recognize that, and I thank you, and there's some champagne.  Please enjoy that. 
 We'll keep seeing you every other tournament.  Thank you (applause).
