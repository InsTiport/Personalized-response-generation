  Q. Can you just explain why you're pulling out of the tournament?   
 OLIVIER ROCHUS:  My foot, the end of my match against Lopez at 3-0, Love-30, I went back, I land on my foot, and I really felt a sharp pain on my foot.   
 I thought it would be better, but I cannot put my feet on the ground.  Especially it's on my heel.  You know, my heel is so painful.  So there is no way I can go on the court.   
 Unfortunately, it would have been such an honor, and a great match to play against Rafa in the next session, but there is no way, otherwise I would have really tried.  But you know, it's just the way it is.
