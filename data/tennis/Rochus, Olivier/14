MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

Q. No one knew who you were prior to today. Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself?

OLIVIER ROCHUS: I played Juniors. I made some good result. I was No. 1 in the world
under 14. I finish No. 10 in Juniors. I made a semifinal here in Wimbledon. I begin to be
professional last year. It's my second Grand Slam. That's it. 

Q. You've had two very good wins here. 

OLIVIER ROCHUS: Yeah, it was my first win with a top hundred. Today I beat the No. 2.
It's great, yeah. 

Q. In the final set, when he gave the racquet to the ball girl, must have been
difficult for you because you were so near to winning. 

OLIVIER ROCHUS: Yeah, that's true. Was very difficult. I had to stay concentrate on my
game. It was 5-Love, so even if I lost the game, was still 5-1 for me. But it was
difficult.

Q. Could you laugh?

OLIVIER ROCHUS: I laugh a little bit but I knew I had to stay concentrate. I was not
finish. 

Q. How far do you think you can go now in the tournament?

OLIVIER ROCHUS: I don't know. I'm just playing. I have to play Pozzi. He's very tough
on grass. He's a grass court specialist. I have nothing to lose, so I don't know.

Q. You're quite short for a tennis player. You're obviously very fast. Is it a problem,
your height?

OLIVIER ROCHUS: I don't think so. I don't know. I don't think so. 

Q. Not today. 

OLIVIER ROCHUS: Not today. 

Q. It was a wonderful win. You came through the qualifying. Did you picture when you
left home that you're going to be sitting here today?

OLIVIER ROCHUS: Not at all. I was playing a Challenger on clay court last week.

Q. Where was that?

OLIVIER ROCHUS: In Portugal. I didn't know if I was coming to play Wimbledon. At the
last moment, I say, "Yeah, I'm going to play qually." Now I'm third round, beat
the No. 2. That's great. 

Q. Our fans in America don't know too much about you. If there's one thing that we
should know about you, what would that one thing be?

OLIVIER ROCHUS: That's a tough question. I don't know. 

Q. What are your interests, aside from tennis, other than tennis?

OLIVIER ROCHUS: I like really much playing golf. I like it.
