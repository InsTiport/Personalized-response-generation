  Q.  Roger said in the Juniors you used to beat up on him.  Is that true?   
 OLIVIER ROCHUS:  I beat him?  No, no.   
  Q.  That's what he said.   
 OLIVIER ROCHUS:  No, I only beat him when I was -- when we were 15 years old.   
  Q.  That's what he was talking about.   
 OLIVIER ROCHUS:  But after Juniors, 17, 18, he beat me all the time.  I only beat him once when we were 15.   
  Q.  Did you think you were going to beat him today?  Did you have confidence you were going to win the match?   
 OLIVIER ROCHUS:  Yeah, I think when I was in the third set.  Second set, he played really good.  I had some chances at 3-1, you know, to break back.  He had one lucky shot with the frame.  Then he won 6-2.   
 In the third set, I think I had breakpoint at 2-All.  He made aces.  I had breakpoint at 3-All.   
  Q.  He hit an ace.   
 OLIVIER ROCHUS:  He hit an ace.  He just played great on the big points.  Had almost breakpoint on every game.  Me, I just lost my serve at 6-5.   
 Yeah, I think I've never been so close to beat him.  That's the way it is.  On the big points, he always serve aces or make the great forehand.  He's not No. 1 for nothing.   
 Yeah, during the third set, I was fighting a lot, I was really feeling good on the court.  I was saying, "Why not?  You can do it."  Unfortunately, it went on the other side.  That's the game.   
  Q.  The crowd gave you a standing ovation at the end of the match.  Did that make you feel good?   
 OLIVIER ROCHUS:  Yeah, I mean, was great at the end.  The crowd was so noisy.  I mean, was really an unbelievable feeling.  But, you know, when you lose, it's always tough after such a great match against the No. 1.   
 But, yeah, the crowd was amazing.  I will never forget this match.   
  Q.  What is your best win?   
 OLIVIER ROCHUS:  I don't know.  One year I beat Magnus Norman, he was No. 2.  Safin was No. 2.  I never got the No. 1.  I was close today, but...  It will come one day.   
  Q.  He said you used to beat him when you were 14.   
 OLIVIER ROCHUS:  We only played -- only once.  Under-14, Roger was not so good and I was No. 1.  Now it's the other way around.  He's the No. 1 and I'm trying to do my best.  The time has changed.  Yeah, Roger became the World No. 1.   
 But, yeah, I can say I beat him once when we were 14 years old.   
  Q.  Off to Miami now?   
 OLIVIER ROCHUS:  Yeah, I'm going Friday to Miami.  Rest a few days.  Play one or two days of golf.  Yeah, trying to be ready.  I'm playing good.  I hope for a better draw.  Last year I played three times Roger.  Bad draw.  Always tough draw.  I play Nadal in the first one in Marseille, Safin in Dubai.  I'm just playing really the best guy.   
 But if I keep playing like this, I can improve my ranking, yeah, and just have to work hard.
