MODERATOR:  Questions. 
 
 
Q.  Was there a letdown coming into this match after the Safin match a couple days ago? 
 
OLIVIER ROCHUS:  No.  I knew that Clement was in really good shape.  He was, I think, playing better than Safin on grass.  I knew that he was tougher than the second round.  So, no. 
 
Q.  Did you feel the pressure that people were expecting you to win, whereas last time people didn't give you a chance?
 
OLIVIER ROCHUS:  I told you, I knew that maybe Clement is not Safin No. 2 in the world.  On grass last week he played very good.  I knew that he was really confident.  Okay, the press, the people, maybe they say, "You beat the No. 2, so you in final."  Me, I know that is not working like this.
