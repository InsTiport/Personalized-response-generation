Q. Matt, First National Championship, and yet you go back to serve you seem pretty relaxed like it was just a basic everyday kind of event? 
 
 MATT LUCENA: We try to keep that way the whole tournament. We just decided first match we are just going to go out there and have fun and we weren't going to get stressed out and angry if we lose serving or if things go against us. Our motto was just to have fun; if things go bad, they go bad.  
 
Q. So you didn't realize that you were out there playing stadium court in front of thousands of people; that never really crossed your mind, no pressure? 
 
 MEREDITH McGRATH: I think we are aware --  
 MATT LUCENA: I think you are definitely aware of it. We just tried to put it out -- lucky, I have played on stadium before and have been in other situations close to that. I mean not quite playing for serving for a Slam, but close to that situation. I think that helps out a lot.  
 
Q. How long have you two been playing together? 
 
 MEREDITH McGRATH: First time.  
 MATT LUCENA: Five matches. Four matches. Five.  
 
Q. How did you get together? 
 
 MATT LUCENA: It is kind of -- I was supposed to play with Patty ^ fend dick, but she just had an operation on both her knees.  
 MEREDITH McGRATH: I was supposed to play with Rick Leach and he never called me back, so we are stuck with each other.  
 MATT LUCENA: Luck.  
 
Q. How did you guys -- how did it work out then? 
 
 MATT LUCENA: Where did we decide to play?  
 
Q. Yes? 
 
 MATT LUCENA: I think --  
 
Q. How did it come about? 
 
 MATT LUCENA: Tuesday or Wednesday I was sitting there eating lunch.  
 MEREDITH McGRATH: Five days before the tournament --  
 MATT LUCENA: I said maybe she doesn't have a mixed doubles player.  
 MEREDITH McGRATH: Well, he was too chicken. He sent his coach -- just kidding.  
 MATT LUCENA: Scott McCain walked over. He is knew. I was looking for a mixed doubles partner.  
 
Q. Did you ever imagine that you would be winning? 
 
 MEREDITH McGRATH: No -- well, we had a tough first round. We had to play the second seeds first round. I don't know what Matt was thinking --  
 MATT LUCENA: I only played mixed doubles one other time; that was against Stark and Martina at Wimbledon, so...  
 MEREDITH McGRATH: You never know with mixed though, anything can happen.  
 
Q. Who did you play with at Wimbledon? 
 
 MEREDITH McGRATH: Tami Whitlinger Jones.  
 
Q. How about you? 
 
 MEREDITH McGRATH: Lan Bale.  
 MATT LUCENA: First round losers. (GIVE EACH OTHER HIGH-FIVE).  
 
Q. Do you think this is the first time a Stanford and Cal alumni matchup at a Grand Slam... 
 
 MATT LUCENA: That is what we said.  
 MEREDITH McGRATH: I had forgotten that when I said yes.  
 MATT LUCENA: See.  
 
Q. I presume you are planning to continue to play? 
 
 MATT LUCENA: Sure, why not.  
 MEREDITH McGRATH: Sure.  
 MATT LUCENA: That is if she goes to Australia.  
 MEREDITH McGRATH: Planning on playing.  
 
Q. Matt, you won NCAA's in 1991 and 1992. 
 
 MATT LUCENA: Can't remember -- I think it was '90 and '91.  
 
Q. And your partners? 
 
 MATT LUCENA: Duug Eisman for 1990 and then Bent Pederson for 1991.  
 
Q. How do you plan to celebrate? 
 
 MATT LUCENA: I will call United and try and get home as fast as possible. I don't know if I can make it.  
 
Q. How about you? 
 
 MEREDITH McGRATH: I am going to wait 'til I get home to celebrate, I think.  
 
Q. Can you guys talk a little bit about your individual years this year, what you have been doing? 
 
 MATT LUCENA: I am just happy to be back playing. I have been hurt for the past 2 1/2, three years. I have had shoulder problems; elbow problems; wrist problems. This is the first year that I have been able to play, you know, without taking off a good month to three months and I have just mainly played doubles because I don't know if my shoulder can hang in there to play singles.  
 
Q. You dropped out of a lot of singles events. You didn't play as many singles event this year. What is up with you? 
 
 MEREDITH McGRATH: I hurt my Achilles in Australia and I have just -- all year I have really been struggling with that. I mean, I manage fine in doubles, mixed, but singles I am a little bit slow and it has shown in my results.  
 
Q. What is the prescription, rest is the only thing that is going to make it better? 
 
 MEREDITH McGRATH: Yeah, need some time off. I don't know exactly when, but...  
 
Q. You guys aren't going to do any kind of celebrating together? 
 
 MEREDITH McGRATH: I'd like to.  
 MATT LUCENA: She has a previous engagement for tonight.  
 MEREDITH McGRATH: I have a dinner that I have to go to.  
 MATT LUCENA: And I don't know what I am doing. Kind of up in the air. Any good night spots?  
 
Q. Always good night spots in New York. 
 
 MATT LUCENA: Yeah, New York City....
