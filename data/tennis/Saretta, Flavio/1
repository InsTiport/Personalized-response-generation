MODERATOR:  Questions for Flavio.  
 
 
Q.  When did you discover your liking for grass?
 
FLAVIO SARETTA:  I didn't discover it.  I don't know that (laughter).  I won this match, but that's my third tournament that I play on grass.  I play here Juniors, and I play well, but was Juniors, so a little bit different.  Last week I played against Escude in the first round in the ATP in Holland.  I play well.  I lost, but 7-6, 7-6.  Then I start to believe that I can play in grass.  And today I won a very good match for me.  Maybe the best match that I play in my life.  So I'm very happy.  
 
Q.  Is there still room for improvement next match?
 
FLAVIO SARETTA:  Yes.  I know the guy that I'm going to play next match.  I know that he has a good serve.  I'm going to fight like today.  Now I can believe a little bit more that I believed yesterday.  So I'm going to fight.  I'm going to fight like a Brazilian grass so my country will have a lot of grass, but not to play tennis.  Now I can play tennis in grass.  It's funny.  
 
Q.  How do you know the guy you're playing?  Where from?
 
FLAVIO SARETTA:  He's from German.  I know him.  I saw him in a lot of tournaments, so I know him.  
 
Q.  Is it good chances?
 
FLAVIO SARETTA:  Yeah, I think so.  I think today I played a very good match.  I played very well.  For sure I think in my head that I have a good chance.  I'm going to play. 
 
Q.  What about your legs and the body after such a long match, do you feel something?
 
FLAVIO SARETTA:  Yeah, I feel a little bit tired.  It's normal.  We play like four hours, you know.  But today I can make a massage and tomorrow I can make a massage, too.  So I can go to play, I don't know, Wednesday or Thursday, very well.  I don't know how to say (laughter).  
 
Q.  The German played today while the soccer players were playing in the semifinal of the World Cup. 
 
FLAVIO SARETTA:  Who won?  
 
Q.  Germany. 
 
FLAVIO SARETTA:  Germany?  
 
Q.  Can you imagine playing at the same time?
 
FLAVIO SARETTA:  I can't play.  I can't play.  Impossible, impossible to play (laughter).  I can't play the same time. 
 
Q.  Do you think your win will register back home with the World Cup going on at the same time?
 
FLAVIO SARETTA:  Yes.  No, if Brazil plays the World Cup, I can't play at the same time.  Impossible. 
 
Q.  Do you think the people at home, the papers and television, will take up your win, even though there is the World Cup going on?
 
FLAVIO SARETTA:  I think a little bit less.  I think all the Brazilian people are looking just the World Cup.  Just for me and my family and my friends, that's okay.  It's more important. 
 
Q.  Obviously, Gustavo Kuerten is not playing this year.  What's your relationship between each other?  Do you know each other well?  Are you friends?
 
FLAVIO SARETTA:  Yeah, we were friends.  We play in the Davis Cup.  Everybody's together, so I know him.  Everybody who plays tennis in Brazil, everybody are friends.
