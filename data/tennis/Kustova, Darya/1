THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   If you could, just speak to the kind of doubles team that Liezel and Venus made together and what you thought of them as a pair. 
SPEAKER:   Yeah, well, it was really like we were a little bit tired from the singles, as well.   Yeah, we tried to keep the spirit up, but it was tough.   They're very good players, so it was difficult for us to play the best tennis we could play. 
Yeah, that's what you have to do against them because they are very good players. 

Q.   With Venus not having played in almost half a year now, how do you think she looked across from you? 
SPEAKER:   Well, for me she played really well.   I mean, she didn't make any stupid mistakes or something.   She returned well.   As well, doubles is different than singles.   You don't have to move that much. 
I think she did well.   She played a good match. 

Q.   How much did playing two matches so close together put you at a disadvantage? 
SPEAKER:   Well, it's tough, but we used to it. 

Q.   Tatiana, do you think your team got any benefits from playing this weekend? 
CAPTAIN POUTCHEK:   Well, of course every match is a benefit, you know.   You play; you get experience.   I think it was unfortunate that Vika, our No.1, couldn't play.   But I think it was a good experience for our team. 
I mean, we're going to get better from this. 

Q.   Was there any prospect of her playing today?   Was that ever considered? 
CAPTAIN POUTCHEK:   Yes, it was.   But, yeah, the injury is pretty serious and we didn't want to risk putting her on the court.   There was no chance today.

Q.   Do you know if she's going to be out of action for any extended period? 
CAPTAIN POUTCHEK:   Well, for now I don't.   We will see.   She will see.   Her doctor will see.
