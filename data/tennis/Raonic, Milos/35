M. RAONIC/S. Wawrinka
6-7, 7-6, 7-6, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What do you think made the difference?
MILOS RAONIC: Not much.  A few points here and there.  I think I had my chances in the first set.  Was up a break in the second.  He was the better player in the fourth there.  Sort of just held on, got through.  Was a little bit lucky there, as well.
Q. You said you liked the roof closed.  Is that particularly because of the serve or just in general?
MILOS RAONIC: I think my record indoors has always been better than my record outdoors.  I think less external factors.  You sort of get a more consistent feel on the serve.  Depending on if it's overcast or not, the roof gives you a reference point for the ball toss.
Q. You seemed to switch up your tactics a little in the fourth, started to serve-volley a little bit, which didn't necessarily pay off.
MILOS RAONIC: I serve-volleyed the whole match.  I think I came in almost a hundred times.  It worked better in the beginning.  I slowed down a little bit in the fourth.  But also at the same time it worked when I needed it.  Tiebreak it got me two free points.  It goes up and down.  I can't control what the other guy does.  I can try to hit my spots, come forward, so he can't feel free to just sort of chip the ball in.
Q. Is it a nice challenge playing him?  He's a very good player.  He sort of counters you in lots of ways.  A major challenge to play a guy like that, isn't it?
MILOS RAONIC: Yeah, it's difficult.  I'm glad I passed sort of the test in that aspect.  Obviously both matches considered, it's a very difficult way to start the tournament.  But I'm happy with the level I put forth.
Q. Could you talk us through the third-set tiebreak.
MILOS RAONIC: To be honest, I don't really remember too much of it.  I don't think either of us had a set point on serve until I had the last one.  So he was serving extremely well when the roof was open.  I think he was out-acing me at that point.  And then, yeah, just came down to a few shots here and there in that third set, and in the fourth, as well.
Q. Pierre-Hugues Herbert?
MILOS RAONIC: He's played well.  Two very good wins over Sam and over Chung.  I think we're going to try to play a similar way.  I think he does things at the net well.  He tries to play aggressive.  He tries to take swipes at the ball.  I think we're both going to be looking for the opportunity to dictate and who can control more.
Q. Was your chef a little bit slow with the meal tonight?  Is that why you were late for the press conference?
MILOS RAONIC: No, I was taking my time.  I was like, Tom Tebbutt, all the times I had to wait for him, it wouldn't hurt in the new year if he has to wait for me.
