M. RAONIC/V. Hanescu
  7‑6, 6‑4, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   On a scale of 1 to 10 in terms of fun today, where would you rate this day?
MILOS RAONIC:   I don't think 'fun' is the right word.   It was a day with a lot of different adversities.   It was okay.   It wasn't too difficult of a day.   I'm just happy I got through it as efficiently as I did. 

Q.   I noticed you were a little bit cranky out there.   Unusual for you when you're winning.   Was that just a combination of it being a long day and wanting to get it over with?
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, just a lot of different things.   Also sort of before the rain the conditions were quite different, a lot quicker.   Then I come out starting from the first game getting everything figured out.

Q.   Have you played under the lights in the outside courts here ever?
MILOS RAONIC:   No.   It's a little bit difficult.   The lighting is a little bit yellow.   Pretty much high tosses get lost a little bit because the lights only face down.   There's no upwards or sideways lighting. 

Q.   You got like a five‑minute warmup?
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, that was about it. 

Q.   The big forehand that you hit to save set point in the first set of the match, talk about that. 
MILOS RAONIC:   What happened?   I don't remember, to tell you the truth (smiling). 
No, I just got to play the situations as they come, deal with the situations.   My way of putting myself in a good position and getting out of trouble is by going for the shots, not waiting for my opponents to dictate.

Q.   When you find yourself playing more defensively, maybe not being as aggressive, do you know what that's triggered by?   Is it nerves?
MILOS RAONIC:   I think it's a discipline thing.   Sometimes I get in the comfort of I feel like I can step back a little bit and make a lot of balls.   I don't always pick up on how much it eases off the pressure off my opponents. 

Q.   Talk about Dimitrov. 
MILOS RAONIC:   A difficult match.   Very talented, very capable, can do a lot of different things.   Sort of have to go about and try to take control as much as I can and try to dictate as much as possible.

Q.   Do you watch him much, whether it's YouTube or in matches at tournaments?
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, when it's televised.   I watched a little bit of him while I was in Hopman Cup playing in Brisbane.   Sort of when it's televised, when we're at events like this where you can watch sort of in the locker room.   Obviously today we're playing pretty much at the same time. 
But I do like to watch him play.
