  6‑3, 4‑6, 6‑4 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Some may have thought you had a little bit of jitters last night because maybe it was your first match.   I heard the comments that you're feeling more comfortable now with your performance today.   Just want to get your thoughts on that.   
MILOS RAONIC:   Today I was much more in a comfort zone.   Created my opportunities.   Had a bunch there at the end of that third set.   Had to adjust a little bit after playing poorly in that second to lose my serve twice, but other than that, the two sets I won I didn't face a single break chance.   
Did well there and created my opportunities on the return games.  
   
 Q.   That was a pretty snazzy point in the middle of the third set, slice forehand approach and put‑away volley.   Did you enjoy that point?  
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, I missed the exact same one yesterday.   Probably should go down the middle more with that one, because I already do put a lot of spin on it.   Put a little bit more pressure and not play so close to the line.  
   
 Q.   Are we going to see more forehand sliced approaches like that?  
MILOS RAONIC:   If I move my feet well enough?   No.   (Smiling.)   
   
 Q.   Do you expect obviously a similar challenge from your next opponent, Lopez?   Just maybe some thoughts on his game and how you'll approach him.   
MILOS RAONIC:   Obviously as a lefty, things are going to change a little bit with the angles.   I have been able to find answers in the past against him, so just gonna have that same approach.   
I feel like I have improved since the last time I played him.   I'm looking forward to playing better tomorrow than I did today.  
If I do so, then I can dictate and control the center of the court.   I feel like I will be able to create some possibilities and opportunities.  
   
 Q.   Safe to say you and Feliciano are good buddies?  
MILOS RAONIC:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   How did that friendship develop?  
MILOS RAONIC:   Just I got along, especially when I started on tour, well with a lot of Spanish players because of the team I had surrounded myself.   Feliciano previously had worked with my fitness trainer and Galo and they were good friends.   And Feliciano is one of the Spanish guys who speaks better English, so it was easier to get along with him at first.   
He's a good guy.   He's a very good person in that sense, and he's good to be around.  
   
 Q.   You guys met twice toward the end of the last hard court season.   How do you feel you played against him?   I believe you won both matches.   
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, I have played well the last few times against him.   Sort of had a better understanding what I need to do, and hopefully I can produce that same type of level and have similar results.  
   
 Q.   You looked very fresh.   It almost looks like you didn't look like you played a tournament last week.   The two days off between Washington and here gave you a chance to start fresh and start from zero?  
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, I sort of learned the disadvantages of that last year when I had to go to Cincinnati with just one day to adjust.   
It's not even just the two days off.   After Wimbledon we spent most of the time working on fitness so I understood I was going to play Washington mostly tired, because I was training.   In and around every match I was doing a lot of fitness, as well.   
Then it was all sort of build my level up for this here, Cincinnati, and especially the US Open to sort of be in the best physical shape I can be in playing my best tennis by that time.  
   
 Q.   You came in here, you looked over at the TV to see Roger's score.   Without looking past Lopez, is it not in the back of your head about thinking about getting a shot at Roger in the semis again?   
MILOS RAONIC:   No, I just enjoy to watch tennis (smiling).   
   
 Q.   You're in the night cycle now until the final.   How do you feel about playing any of these matches at night, and how does it fit into you being good or bad for your game or give you more chances?  
MILOS RAONIC:   It's okay for my game.   I requested it from the start, and I found sort of a groove in it.   I like the schedule the way it's going.   I enjoy playing at night.   More people come out because of work, and the atmosphere is a little bit more‑‑ when it gets darker, you can only see from the lights, can't really see around.   The atmosphere gets I think a bit more hard core.
