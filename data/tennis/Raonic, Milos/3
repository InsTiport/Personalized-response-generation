M. RAONIC/D. Lajovic
6-3, 6-4
Q. Talk about the win and how important it was to get your country off to a winning start.
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, it's the most important thing.  The way you put your first foot forward can do a lot.  Denis has a great opportunity now.  He had that incredible match with Novak in Sydney last year.  So I'm sure he wants another go at him in this format.
Hopefully I've done my part and we see where this goes for the rest of the way.
Q. What was key to winning the match?
MILOS RAONIC:   No, I think I was sharp.  I was there in a lot of return games.  I kept putting pressure.  I missed a few breakpoint opportunities but I kept sticking around and took care of my serve, which is always important.
Q. Talk about winning for your country and playing in the ATP Cup.
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, for me this is the first time playing in this event for Canada.  I got to see it on TV last year.  It's a lot of fun to be here.  It's a great honor as well to represent Canada.  Throughout the year we play with the Canadian flag, says 'CAN' by our names.  This time they don't say our names when they say the score, they announce the country that we're grateful to represent, that's given us great opportunities.  That means a lot to me, to the team, to my family, to all the people around me.
