M. RAONIC/M. Youzhny
  6‑4, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Do you feel that was better than last night?
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah.   It was quite a bit better.   Just a lot more fluid, a lot more within myself.   But I don't think it was too far off.   I think if maybe if I would have converted one of those opportunities, got myself ahead a break, I wouldn't have felt as much tension, I could have stayed a little bit more relaxed. 

Q.   What did you feel was working tonight that wasn't working last night?
MILOS RAONIC:   I think coming in, I was much more efficient.   Even just first strikes at the ball.   I knew against him, he likes to hit a lot of balls, sort of get into longer rallies.   I wasn't hesitant, even if I missed a few in a row.   There were a few games on his service games that I think were very quick. 

Q.   Tried to keep them short?
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, it's not just trying to keep them short.   If I go for the shot, if it goes in, fine.   But to keep going after it.   As long as I keep him out of rhythm, it's better for me. 

Q.   A lot of players complained about the conditions, but especially about the balls here.   Do you have anything to say about it?
MILOS RAONIC:   The balls are quick.   They're the same.   Last week was much quicker than this week.   It's not a bad thing for me. 

Q.   And about the wind, how did it affect your game today?
MILOS RAONIC:   It's something you have to deal with.   It's for both of us.   It's windy for me, windy for him. 
I think I managed it pretty well.   I didn't think about it too much.   When I had the shots really to go forward and to be aggressive, I didn't hesitate.   If you hit the ball well, the ball's going to go in, doesn't matter if it's windy or not.

Q.   What do you do during a rain delay to stay focused?
MILOS RAONIC:   I just sat there. 

Q.   Nothing special?
MILOS RAONIC:   No, nothing.   Ivan just told me, Keep going the way you have been.   I just sat there.   People were talking.   I was eavesdropping.   That was it.   It wasn't a long rain delay.

Q.   Any interesting conversations?
MILOS RAONIC:   No.   They were talking about the other matches that were going on.   It was about tennis. 

Q.   This is a match you've been waiting for for a while.   Your last couple matches haven't been up to your standard obviously. 
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, you sort of keep working away.   You keep hoping you get closer and closer to this.   The thing is, I felt like I was getting closer definitely on the practice court, I just wasn't really doing it in the matches. 
So yesterday to get by, give myself the opportunity today, a little bit more relaxed to play, it definitely helps.   Just sort of the pieces coming together.   Today still I made a few errors in some critical situations where I wouldn't want to, but mostly I played clean. 
I think keep working away, those little pieces come together better and those errors disappear. 

Q.   Anything helpful about him being a very good opponent compared to some other guys you played recently?
MILOS RAONIC:   I think you just play a little bit more freely.   If you're disappointed with things, you don't get as frustrated within yourself, that's the only thing, because you know what he's really capable of, how tough he can be.   Sometimes against others you don't expect the situation to be, you get a little more frustrated with yourself quicker.

Q.   Did you feel at any point any pressure to finish this as the clouds were getting darker?
MILOS RAONIC:   I didn't notice.   I noticed it before the first rain delay.   Sort of I knew there was going to be no chance to finish it.   I didn't really look up too much.   I didn't really expect it to rain that second time the way it did. 

Q.   You and Vasek have moved on to the third round.   What does this say about the state of Canadian tennis as a whole?
MILOS RAONIC:   It's a great thing.   It's doing really well.   I think it's great for us to have had five Canadians in the second round. 
The one thing that I think stood out the most was obviously four of the Canadians were wild card entries.   They took and made the most out of their opportunities.   But to have five Canadians be the most from any one nation in the second round of a Masters Series, that stands out.   I think the second was Spain with four, which you're used to them normally having the most in that situation. 
These kind of things, it's definitely very positive to see.   It's just an accumulation of work coming together for many, many of us. 

Q.   It's still early, but you could face Del Potro in the next round.   You've mentioned this new style, aggressive style.   You're trying that because you want to beat the top players.   Are you looking forward or maybe cheering for Del Potro to win that match so you can test it?
MILOS RAONIC:   Not really.   I have no control in it.   For me to sit there and be hoping for one guy to win, for a result, it's just a waste of energy at the end of the day.   If you do that every week, it's going to get pretty depressing after a while. 
I know I can still do much better.   I know I got to keep going this way.   Obviously when the opportunities arise against top guys is where I'm really going to try to push myself to show the best of myself. 
But I still know there's a lot of steps I need to take really.   I can be a step in my next match, in a few weeks.   It really doesn't matter.   Even if I was to play well in the next match, that doesn't mean it's always there solidly.   It's about making it a consistent thing.   The work still has to happen even if it comes together.

Q.   Bleu, blanc, rouge in MontrÃ©al means something, their colors.   We have rouge, bleu.   Should we expect blanc tomorrow?
MILOS RAONIC:   I don't know.   We'll see how I feel. 

Q.   Any reason for the blue tonight?
MILOS RAONIC:   I think it's a nice shirt, no (smiling)? 

Q.   You won in red last night.   Why would you change a winning combination?
MILOS RAONIC:   It's a shirt, Tom.   A shirt is not going to win a match for you.
