M. RAONIC/C. Berlocq   
7-6, 6-4, 1-6, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Four-setter, a bit of a workout there.  Good to have that first one under your belt?  How do you feel about the way you played?  
MILOS RAONIC: Yeah, I had my moments.  A little bit too much up and down.  Lacked a bit of discipline on my service games.  Otherwise I, you know, got the job done and have to be happy with that.  And when there was sort of pressure on me, I stepped up and I was able to play better in those scenarios.   
 Q.  Are you 100% physically?  At moments, you were quite erratic compared to usual.  
MILOS RAONIC: No, I think I was just rushing too much on my serve.  I was holding handily and I think I would get ahead of myself on the serve.  If I fell behind in a game, I wouldn't take my time.  Just that kind of thing.  Just discipline, lacked.   
 Q.  And the conditions?  
MILOS RAONIC: Conditions were good.  They were a little bit warmer than the last few days, but I don't think anything out of the ordinary.  There's many days like that here throughout the last years.   
 Q.  Some people really thrive on this atmosphere.  Halep was saying was saying it's never been really for her.  The hustle bustle of New York is a little bit discombobulating for her.  What are your thoughts of coming here and playing this tournament?  
MILOS RAONIC: I think it's just everybody has to find, let's say, their little niche in it.  I think there are different ways to go about it.  I think there was a lot of other players in the past that were quite quiet players that found a way to play well here.   
Some people like to stay in the city and sort of be enamored by it all.  Some people like to stay away from it.  You have to sort of figure out what works for you and try to embrace it from that aspect.   
I think New York has a lot to offer, but it also has a lot to take energy away from you.  If you get caught up in that too much, it can be a tough two weeks.   
 Q.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I didn't see Goran there today.  Is he not here?  
MILOS RAONIC: He's not here.   
 Q.  Is there a reason for that?  
MILOS RAONIC: He's expecting a kid any day now.   
 Q.  Is there a chance he could be here...  
MILOS RAONIC: Depends how everything goes for him.   
 Q.  Your form coming in, how are you feeling?  Just your expectations for the tournament.  
MILOS RAONIC: I'm feeling good.  I played well the last few weeks; last few months, as well.  Things have been on the up.  I have been able to stay relatively healthy, as well.  I'm eager to do well here and hopefully I can produce a good level of tennis and that can result in some good results.   
 Q.  Now that you know your opponent for the second round, what sort of adjustments do you need to make for Gilles Simon?  
MILOS RAONIC: I have to be more disciplined.  He's going to let me get into points and that kind of thing, but I just got to be more disciplined from the start throughout, especially on the serve.  I will get chances from his and sort of be very much on top of the match all the way through.   
 Q.  A lot of people are impressed with the match you played against Djokovic.  With, you know, hindsight, a couple of weeks, whatever, how do you look at it and how pleased were you with the way you played?  
MILOS RAONIC: No, it was very good for me.  Definitely one of the better opportunities I have had against him.  Some things that I wish I dealt better with towards the end of that first set.   
But overall I think my level has been improving steadily.  I think I have been finding more and more of my game, and I'm happy with where I'm at now.
