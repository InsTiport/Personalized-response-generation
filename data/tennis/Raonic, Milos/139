  6‑2, 6‑3, 3‑6, 7‑6 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   You're a numbers guy.   
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   B‑, C+, or how would you grade it?  
MILOS RAONIC:   Those are the options?   (Laughter.)  
Umm.   B.   I'm happy to have gotten through, and that's the most important thing today.  
   
 Q.   What about the little sort of hiccup in the third set?  
MILOS RAONIC:   It wasn't just the third set.   There were just many throughout the match.   I've just got to clean up that discipline part of it.   That's just something that comes down to myself, and it's not really a very demanding thing.  
   
 Q.   In a match like that, did you feel the serve was locked in from the beginning, or does it take some time...   
MILOS RAONIC:   No, I don't really think I actually served that well.   I just lacked a little bit of intensity and discipline in the right parts of my game.   
I think it sort of showed, because I would have to dig out of a few problems a few times Love‑30, a break points, maybe situations that I wouldn't normally let myself get into.  
   
 Q.   Do you have to get into best‑of‑five‑set mode?   Because you missed the French, so it's been like four months since you played well?  
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, it takes a little bit extra, and it's just something you ask of yourself, really.   I don't think you need to sort of play matches to get in that mode, but you just have to be disciplined with yourself mentally about it.   That's it.  
   
 Q.   The court didn't seem that fast for some reason.   
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, but so far all the courts I have practiced on, none have been too quick.   Compared to even Aorangi, it's quite a bit slower.   The ball sits up a little bit more.  
   
 Q.   Is it juicy, or what do you think it is?  
MILOS RAONIC:   Even just the movement.   He did slip a few times, but even just from the first day that I practiced on the court, probably because it hasn't been that wet here, even just ‑‑ the court feels pretty gritty.   It doesn't feel like you're ever really slipping around other than from what you saw from him.   
Compared to normally how I feel when I really get on the first days of the courts here inside the main match courts, it's definitely a bit more gritty than normal.   There has never been a single issue with footing here.   
   
 Q.   Do you like old guys?   Do you like playing old guys?  
MILOS RAONIC:   I know what's ahead of me.   I haven't played him for a while.   He's been doing some great things really, so I think age is irrelevant.   I've just got to face Tommy and try to play my best.  
   
 Q.   A lot of people think he's a very nice player to watch.   When you were coming up, did you ever watch him and enjoy watching the way he plays?  
MILOS RAONIC:   I did.   I remember when Toronto was at the old site.   I think he might have gone very far.   
   
 Q.   Yeah, he did.   
MILOS RAONIC:   One year in Toronto when it was at the old, was it called ‑‑I don't know what the name of that old stadium was.   
   
 Q.   There is no name for it.   
MILOS RAONIC:   There was no name?     
Du Maurier Cup?   
   
 Q.   The tournament was called that.   
MILOS RAONIC:   I remember watching him there.   It was nice.
