THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
 Q.  How do you feel?  
MILOS RAONIC: I feel pretty good.   
 Q.  Sort of coming in after the last tournament, it's sort of tough to get pumped up or more pumped up?  
MILOS RAONIC: No, no, more so.  I have had some really good weeks and I've had some pretty bad weeks.  That was one of those.  Doesn't really take too much to turn those things around.  Hopefully I can play some better tennis here.   
 Q.  You had this ankle injury in China that I think wasn't solved in Shanghai yet.  Was it better in Basel?  
MILOS RAONIC: It's still a little bit of an issue that we have to take care of.  It's constantly improving, and I know it's something I'm going to have to deal with with the tournaments throughout the rest of the year.   
That's something I was made aware of quite early on, so I'm just trying to make the most of it and trying to find a way to win as many matches as I can.   
 Q.  Mentally, do you feel fresh enough to still be able to perform at your best here and in London or is this season feeling really long?  
MILOS RAONIC: Oh, it's not feeling that long at all.  I think I'm playing pretty much the minimum amount of tournaments that I'd have to, and I think that helps me in this time.   
For me, it's just really about getting my tennis together, getting my head together.  I feel like I can play some very good tennis throughout these last tournaments, especially in these indoor conditions.   
 Q.  What was the main issue with the Berankis match?  Because when we saw the results, it's indoor.  How is Milos losing this match against him indoor?  
MILOS RAONIC: I was the main issue.  I believe in a lot of ways I didn't find a way, and I didn't really do what I needed to do to win that match in the sense of my attitude wasn't great on court.  I was short-tempered.  All these things that I have constantly improved throughout this year I wasn't sort of disciplined enough with throughout that match.   
 Q.  The commentators just kept talking about you lost to him two years earlier.  Do you feel that was a factor at all?  
MILOS RAONIC: No, I don't believe so.   
 Q.  Have you sorted out things with what happened at the US Open, figured out exactly what happened?  You're at peace now and it won't happen again?  
MILOS RAONIC: I don't think I can nail it down to exactly why it happened, but I think I have taken the sort of precautions as much as possible for it to not repeat itself.   
Does it happen again?  It could happen again, yes, but I think I'd also know how to deal with it better, as well.   
 Q.  How do you feel about a big event without Roger and Rafa?  Is this a sign of things to come, the fact that they're not here?  
MILOS RAONIC: They will be here next year, you know.  That's the difference.  Both of them are injured at this moment, or something along those lines.   
It happens.  It just happened, especially one of them was always quite healthy.  So it's just a coincidence that it happens at the same time.   
 Q.  You have had quite a few practices here already.  What did you think about the conditions?  
MILOS RAONIC: They're good.  They are conditions I like to play in.  Not too fast.  The ball doesn't bounce too high, so it's conditions I like to play in indoors, and I think it's just going to get slowly -- the more the courts get used, a little bit quicker and quicker, which will help me, as well.   
 Q.  The ankle, is there anything in particular, any shot or movement that it bothers you with?  
MILOS RAONIC: It's not anything particular.  It sometimes bothers me, sometimes doesn't.  Depends what angle I push off my foot is at, which I can't completely control.   
So I tape it up to sort of limit how much my ankle can move, and that's sort of when it gets me.  Some days it doesn't bother me at all.  Some days I can feel it on one or two shots, some days more.  It's trying to be as controlled as possible.   
 Q.  Is the tear there in any way?  
MILOS RAONIC: It's still a partial tear, but I was told it's going to take six to eight weeks to heal completely.  It's at no risk.   
 Q.  How much more excitement is added this week because it's a chance Murray could become No. 1?  
MILOS RAONIC: I think that significantly helps.  For him, obviously, it's a very important thing.  I'm sure it's an important thing for Novak to try and stop him from doing that.
