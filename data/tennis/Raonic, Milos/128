M. RAONIC/T. Bellucci
  7‑6, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.

Q. Two tight sets. How did you feel regarding the conditions of play comparing to Beijing and previous weeks?
MILOS RAONIC: Yeah, the center court is a little bit slower than the outside courts, as well. That's normal with a court that's been used much less. 
It's dry here. The ball's been moving through the court pretty well. It's good conditions for me. 

Q. How do you feel starting this last part of the season, fighting for London? Do you feel fresher because you had weeks off due to injuries or is it still draining?
MILOS RAONIC: No, I feel like I'm in a good place physically and mentally. Now I hope I can play some good tennis. 

Q. Did you feel overall it's been a weird kind of season for you?
MILOS RAONIC: Yeah, it has. I wouldn't say 'weird,' it's just been in a lot of ways a frustrating season. For most of it, through many important tournaments, not to be able to play at 100%, that sort of has its own downfalls, I guess. 
I'm trying to make the most of it now for the rest of the year.
