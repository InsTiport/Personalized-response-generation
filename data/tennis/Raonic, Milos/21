 Q.  How did you feel out there, considering it was your first match in a month and a half? You had some chances early, breakpoint chances, and just weren't able to convert them.  
MILOS RAONIC: Yeah, I think I tried to do the best things within my ability. You know, it's a tough first match. I'm used to playing tournaments where you get to work your way into a tournament and so forth. But to play the guy who just won the US Open two weeks ago, especially a guy that plays the way Rafa plays, it was tough.   
I had my opportunities in the first. Didn't make the most of it. Got ahead in the second. Tried to, you know, make it count, but he played some darn good shots, especially throughout that tiebreak.   
A lot of positives to take away. I'm happy with the way I was moving, the way I was competing, the things I did. It gives me a lot to build off of and hopefully have an opportunity to step up for the team again tomorrow.   
 Q.  What was the injury again that you had in Montreal against Felix? Walk us through from there to now.  
MILOS RAONIC: Yeah, I was having issues with my back in Washington and Montreal. I think, as a compensation, I tore my left glute in Montreal. That took a while to recover.   
Came to the US Open to get ready, exactly a week before, just start playing points and hitting for the first time with other players, and I retore it again.   
I missed the opportunity to play in the US Open by a few days, so I took that time since the US Open to really try to get fit and try to get strong and really try to give myself the best possibility to be able to push through this last part of the season to try, you know, to salvage some things where I feel like I have been missing out and some things I could have done better throughout the season. Hopefully I can stay on the right track and stay healthy, as well.
