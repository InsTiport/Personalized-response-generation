  6‑1, 6‑4 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How do you analyze that for your first clay start?  
MILOS RAONIC:   Well, I think it's very good.   A lot of things I did well, especially only having a limited amount of preparation before here.   
Davis Cup, it was a very good thing, but it was also a very draining thing.   It takes a lot of energy to get through that weekend.   So I was very happy with how I was able to prepare and play today.   
   
 Q.   How much did the Davis Cup impinge on your actual training?  
MILOS RAONIC:   I think shown by today, not too much.   I think I came here feeling really good, especially playing as well as I did in Davis Cup.   
So the training was always smooth.   Only thing maybe I would have done is a little bit more specific exercises to learn a bit better the movement and quicker the movement on the clay that I didn't have time.   
But I think I played really well.   I managed to do this really well regardless.   
   
 Q.   How comfortable are you on clay right now compared to maybe last year, the year before?  
MILOS RAONIC:   I think much more.   From the first year to last year to this year, it's not as much of a mental stress, I think.   That's the biggest change.   Still takes a lot of effort for the transition and everything.   But it's not as mentally draining, as stressful for me as it has been the last two years.   
   
 Q.   You're probably going to have to make a step up when you face Jarkko.   How do you see that match?  
MILOS RAONIC:   I played him last year.   Didn't do so well.   Did a lot of things poorly in that situation.   
But I feel like if I play and I keep going for it like I was today, I was able to dictate play a bit, I think if I can get ahead in the points, I can keep that advantage to me and I think I'm pretty good in that position.   
   
 Q.   Julien said your serve, even on clay, is an unbelievable weapon.   Are you using it differently regarding the surface?  
MILOS RAONIC:   No.   I pretty much stick to it the same way.   The only thing I change a little bit more is the second serve.   
On hard courts I will change it up more, the direction.   But here I have to change up the speed, I think, to keep my opponents a bit more off balance.   
Also after the serve, I tend to shift over more to the left because most of the time I can have a forehand on the first ball, whereas sometimes on hard courts you can be rushed.   
   
 Q.   What are your expectations about the season on clay?  
MILOS RAONIC:   Hope to do well.   Hope to play and win quite a few matches.   I've gotten my ranking up to a situation where it gets me seeded in all the big events, so that definitely helps.   
I don't know what the fortune of the draw is, so forth, each week.   But I want to win matches I'm supposed to win, which I feel I'm supposed to win.   I want to keep getting better week in and week out.   I think I can do that.   I think I'm on the right track.  
   
 Q.   Was it difficult to pass from the Davis Cup, very fast surface, smaller balls, to today's match?  
MILOS RAONIC:   It was difficult.   Sort of came into it with the mentality to use this week as a building week because I only had probably four days to prepare on clay.   The thing is, I think I managed with it really well.   I had a lot of confidence and relief with how well I played in Davis Cup coming here.   That also made it a little bit easier.   
I'm happy with how I dealt with all that.   
   
 Q.   If you're playing doubles with Tomic, is it something you want to get into seriously?  
MILOS RAONIC:   I take every match very seriously.   I think doubles I take seriously, but also at the same time I use it more as a way at this point to build for my singles.   Here it's really about getting as many matches on clay as possible.   
I don't know how I will do and so forth.   So having that doubles is having a chance to go out tomorrow, discuss a few things with my coach today, incorporate a few more things before my next match.   I think that's a good opportunity.   
   
 Q.   Do you get frustrated when you cannot make as many aces as you are used to on fast surfaces?  
MILOS RAONIC:   I don't think 'frustrated' is the right word.   I think a little bit more during my service games.   I'm understanding of the situation, so I don't think I allow it to become frustrating.   
But it's I'd say not as easy.   
   
 Q.   What was the reaction of the Canadians when you won the three important matches in Davis Cup versus Italy?  
MILOS RAONIC:   It's been amazing back home.   I flew out the next day, so I haven't had the opportunity to sort of relish and be a part of it.   
But to get the kind of recognition we did as a team, and myself, has been pretty spectacular.   Getting pretty much every newspaper in the country the front page, giving us a lot of attention for tennis, which I think will help the sport grow, which is a very important thing to me.  
   
 Q.   Do you think sponsors may have different interest in tennis because of this semifinal?  
MILOS RAONIC:   I hope so.   But I don't think this is my thought process.   This is something for an agent to worry about.   
   
 Q.   What would you be happy with finishing here?   Do you have a goal?  
MILOS RAONIC:   My goal is just to win my next match.   Who knows the problems I'll have during that match or the match after, if I'm fortunate tough to get through.   I just have to deal with my next match.
