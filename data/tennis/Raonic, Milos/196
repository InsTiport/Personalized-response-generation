 R. GASQUET/M. Raonic
      6‑7, 7‑6, 2‑6, 7‑6, 7‑5 
  
    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Not to be too philosophical, when a match is that close, is it hard to figure out why one guy won and the other one lost?  
    MILOS RAONIC:   He played better down the stretch than I did.   I think that was pretty clear.   Created a lot more opportunities.   I struggled a lot more on my service games.   
    I think that's pretty much what it came down to.   Playing that way in the end, it only matters who wins that last point.  
   
 Q.   He was getting a lot of looks in your service games in the fifth.   Just a matter of your serve tiring out a little bit?   
    MILOS RAONIC:   Well, I had my look there I think at 3‑4.   I played a little bit too defensive.   That's really the only thing.   You just need to convert on one of those chances, that's it.   So he wasn't able to do so, and neither was I.   Then he did at the end.   That's what it came down to.   
    Let's say I go for a shot, I make it, I'm serving for the match, maybe we're having a different talk right now.   But he won the points when he needed to win them.   That's what it came down to.  
   
 Q.   You seemed to play well fending off all those breakpoints.   Any consolation in that?   
    MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, no, I'm doing a lot of things well.   Unfortunately just didn't hold it up long enough today.   And then also I think that in that fourth set he played an unbelievable game to sort of break me back.   
    I think he's playing really well, as well.   So I'm doing a lot of things well.   So there's a lot of good things coming out of it all, out of the work.   So there's a lot of positives.   I don't really think of them as consolations.   
   
 Q.   You looked a bit tired on your serve, but you looked fresher than he did.   
    MILOS RAONIC:   I felt heavy from early on in the match, sort of was trying to battle my way through that.   I didn't do my best to recover.  
   
 Q.   Why did you feel heavy?  
    MILOS RAONIC:   Just been sort of a little bit under the weather, but that's about it.   
   
 Q.   Davis Cup coming up.   How are you seeing that in terms of how your prospects are looking brighter, you and Vasek after MontrÃ©al?  
    MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, I think we're definitely good enough to create the opportunities for ourselves.   The question of the fact is are we going to be able to convert when we create those opportunities.   
    I feel like I'm playing well.   Obviously I'm going to have to put in work for the change on clay.   I feel like Vacek is playing well.   I feel like him and Daniel are playing very well together.   That was a very good match that I watched a little bit of yesterday that gives you a lot of confidence for that, which is a critical point, that doubles point.   
    Things are going very well for myself and the rest of the team.  
   
 Q.   How soon do you get on clay?  
    MILOS RAONIC:   I don't know.   I have to see how I feel and how my body reacts after today.   
   
 Q.   Losing after you have a match point, how much tougher is that?  
    MILOS RAONIC:   It's the same.   I felt like I did an okay thing on the match point.   I didn't really do too much wrong.   I went for that return down the line.   I think he played a great defensive shot deep.   I got a little bit hesitant on that next shot and sort of popped it up short.   
    I think the first initial shot I went for it, and I did it the right way.   I think in general I returned well and I did a lot of things well.   It's unfortunate, the result, but I don't think I would change the way I approached too many of the big points in the match.   
   
 Q.   Have you talked to your coach after the match?  
    MILOS RAONIC:   No, we have not talked.  
   
 Q.   What do you think will be the basic stuff about the chat?  
    MILOS RAONIC:   Uhm, I think I didn't do a lot of good things with my serve.   I felt I got pretty predictable.   I was serving mostly T on deuce, wide on the ad.   Probably this is going to be one thing up for discussion.   
    Other than that, I think I played well from the baseline.   I think I returned well.   When I had those second‑serve return opportunities, I went for them.   Maybe the only other thing that's up for discussion is when he was doing that chip and charge, so many times I was trying to go around him when I could have just gone at him and waited for another opportunity.   
    I don't think that's really a big thing that's going to be discussed too much.   It's just next time you're in this position, do that.   
   
 Q.   He really kept going on the backhand chip return of serve.   Are you saying you went there too much?  
    MILOS RAONIC:   He got his timing.   He has good hands, that's for sure.   The thing is, obviously I don't think I was hitting my second serve the best, but I think I wasn't making him doubt which side he's covering enough on the first serve.   I think that was more so the issue.   He was able to get in a comfortable zone.   
   
 Q.   Thinking of how you went out of Wimbledon, no fun losing this one.   
    MILOS RAONIC:   I'm a much better player than I was at that stage.   I think I've improved a lot of things.   
    I'm playing quite a different way.   I think it's the way I need to keep playing if I want to achieve what I want to achieve.
