A. DE MINAUR/M. Raonic   
6-4, 6-4   
 Q.  Immediate thoughts on the performance?  
MILOS RAONIC: Yeah.  You know, I need to be better than I was.   
Obviously, he was playing extremely well.  He does a lot of things well, stays close.  He was playing quite confident.  Wasn't making any errors.  Wasn't giving me many looks.   
And I was just a little bit errant with my game plan and the things I needed to do well today.   
 Q.  You mentioned the game plan, but what about the shots, the serve, the backhand, the forehand.  Anything that concerned you?  
MILOS RAONIC: Well, I could have served better.  I could have moved a little better.  I could have found my way to the net a little bit better.   
I sort of played into his comfort zone.  I didn't do enough to pull him out of it or, when I did, it would be only for a few points at a time.  I wasn't consistent enough and that's sort of what cost me.   
 Q.  First match back, is it somewhat understandable or were you still disappointed with the performance?  
MILOS RAONIC: No, heavily disappointed.  Things I was hoping to do better.  But it's normal.  You don't expect to go out there with all the things clicking.  You expect to go out there to have to fight and hopefully put things together, and I wasn't able to do that today.   
 Q.  Change any plans for the Australian Open?  You go straight to Melbourne, do you?  
MILOS RAONIC: Yeah.   
 Q.  You're not playing Kooyong.  
MILOS RAONIC: No.   
 Q.  So just the one match before the open.  Final question, is that a concern?  Just one match before the open?  
MILOS RAONIC: No.  For me, the main thing is just get myself really sharp with my game.  And that's going to be done through good practice rather than matches for myself.
