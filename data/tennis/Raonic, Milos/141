R. FEDERER/M. Raonic
  7‑5, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Kind of tough playing Roger.   Seemed like a small stretch for you that won the match for him. 
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, he played well.   He was neutralizing well on the serve, but especially during the points I felt like a few times I was able to stretch him. 
He was doing a good job of getting legs behind and always playing deep cross so I could never find that short forehand I was looking for.

Q.   Any regret you have on the first set, or do you think you were playing the best you could today?
MILOS RAONIC:   There was just one point; 15‑30 I had a short forehand that I would have maybe treated ‑‑I'm not sure what the game score was, but sure wish I would have treated a little bit better.
Other than that, I thought it was a few points here and there makes a difference.   I tried to put everything out there that I could, and the outcome was as is.

Q.   Was it difficult to come back on court after the day you had yesterday against Nadal or mentally you were fresh?
MILOS RAONIC:   I felt good.   I felt energetic.   I felt like I had the right attitude put forward, and I was going to give it my all.

Q.   Do you get a better sense where your game is compared to those top guys after playing and beating Rafa for the first time and playing the way you did today against Federer?
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah.   Obviously it helps when you have these moments, these experiences, and you try to take the most away from them.   I'm happy that I'm getting more and more traction each time and I can get some hopefully wins in my favor. 
But it's not‑‑ with them, it's never like you get on top of these guys.   As you see between each other, they keep going back and forth with the results.   I'm just trying to sort of get myself in that mix and give myself that opportunity where it can go back and forth.

Q.   How tricky is Roger's backhand?   Like today when he is slicing a lot, does that make it difficult for you to play against him?
MILOS RAONIC:   No.   Before obviously today I thought he played really well.   He played a solid match, but it's always been sort of against him that you have sort of maybe a little bit of a sense where to go in the important moments. 
Today I thought he was very clean with it, very methodical, and he used that to his advantage, sort of knowing that's where I would go on the important moments.   That's the side I tried to sort of get through him on.

Q.   Was part of the game plan you felt you didn't execute as well as you wanted to?
MILOS RAONIC:   I wish I would have served a higher percentage, but I felt like when I was putting my first serve in I was doing a good job.   I don't think I mixed up my second serve enough.

Q.   Can you give this Indian Wells/Miami portion of the season some perspective?   Real meat of your season comes up with the clay and grass season.   What are the positives and negatives of going deep?   The weather is grueling and the tennis is obviously at a top level. 
MILOS RAONIC:   I think it's only positives from it.   Yeah, the weather can be warm, but it's not extremely hot or humid.   I think the humidity can sometimes drain you when you're losing a lot of bodily fluids.
You're playing two out of three.   You play every other day.   As far as compared to the next Masters that really come through in the schedule, it's very generous on the recovery process and the timing.
Especially you want to do your best this being the best surface before you go on clay to start off with a good base going into that.

Q.   Who do you think will win tomorrow?
MILOS RAONIC:   It's not mine really to say.   If I knew that million dollar question, I think it's really irrelevant.   I think those guys are always going to have a great matches, as they always do. 
Novak is playing well; Roger's playing well.   It will hopefully be something I can watch.
