M. RAONIC/B. Becker
  6‑3, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Quarterfinal first time, and I think you won your 100th hard court.   What do you make of all that? 
MILOS RAONIC:   It was good Timbits.   No, just stuff I think that is a bonus on getting the win, which was the main focus.

Q.   Were you a little frustrated on the first two match points?   You didn't look particularly pleased. 
MILOS RAONIC:   No, I don't think it was the match points.   I think it was just I felt like I played well, and then the first ‑‑I was not losing any points on my serve pretty much, and then I was not dealing with it the right way when he was getting a few returns back in play.

Q.   Are you a little bit beat up over the last couple of weeks?   Noticed that you did your left leg like the second set, kind of a funny landing and you got a whole bunch of Kinesio tape on it. 
MILOS RAONIC:   No, I think just really, really minor things that are little knacks, but nothing that affects me in any way.

Q.   Your arm? 
MILOS RAONIC:   No, the arm, it's just a rash that's almost gone, but I'm just not taking any risks with the sun aspect of it.

Q.   So I guess next match, Nadal, Fognini. 
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, both players that obviously I would say a little bit different, but very much the same in what I would want to do.
I got to try to impose on both of them.   Especially Rafa.   When he gets ahead in the points he's difficult to keep up with.   I have to get ahead in the points early and stay ahead.   And obviously serving, as well, is going to be key.

Q.   Playing Rafa, is he somebody that you like playing?   What are the pros and cons of playing somebody like him?
MILOS RAONIC:   I think the biggest difficulty of playing Rafa is there is really nobody that plays like him, so whenever you come up against him in the tournament it's quite different. 
Doesn't matter if you play lefties or whatever, it's still quite different.
Do I like playing him?   Yes, because it's a challenge.   But last few times I have struggled quite a bit with him.
But first few times I played him I was a little more comfortable.   For me, it's more important that I find myself rather than focusing on it's Rafa on the other side.

Q.   When you say that he's different to anybody else, what do you mean by that?
MILOS RAONIC:   Left handed, the angles he plays with.   Even ‑‑I'm trying to think who would you put that's the closest thing to him style‑wise?   Maybe Fernando, but still very different.   Very, very different, the two of them.
So it's ‑‑you've got to really ‑‑you can't be like, Oh, he played this guy yesterday.   You know how it might be.   It's going to be similar against Rafa. 
No, it's quite a bit different.   You have to adjust, and you have to step up.
