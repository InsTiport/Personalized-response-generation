THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please.   
   
 Q.   Great week, but obviously a tough way to finish.   What were your thoughts on what you weren't able to sort of close the gap with?   It seemed like late in the first especially it was pretty tight for a lot of it.   
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, I thought he played some great tennis; neutralized my serve well.   Even when I was able to open him on the backhand side, he was moving really well.   He was always getting two hands on it.   It was never sort of defending with a slice.  
And when he was, whether that be off a serve or me trying to be aggressive, he was always play deep.   He didn't really give me too many looks.   Even on the break chances I had, he played them well.   He just made life difficult for me today.  
   
 Q.   How was your feeling before going on the court?   Nervous?   
MILOS RAONIC:   I was feeling good about things.   I have been playing, especially the last two matches, some really good tennis.   I felt sort there ready to sort of face on the challenge and try to make the most of the opportunity.  
   
 Q.   Did your final in Canada at all prepare you for this sort of feeling of a Masters final?   Did you think back to that experience at all?  
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, it helped a lot.   I think if I faced it or played the same way, same way I did in Montreal, I'd probably be a little too embarrassed to show up to this press conference.   
   
 Q.   You're headed to London for the first time for the Masters.   What are you expecting out of that?  
MILOS RAONIC:   I think the toughest thing that's going to be‑‑ especially for the first time going to London, toughest thing that's going to be to adapt to is not really having those early round matches where you sort of find your way into the event, tournament, per se.   
So you're going to have to be obviously with a limited expectation, because you can't be really expecting to play your best tennis your first match.   But you will have to find a way to accelerate the sort of search or solutions on search of a certain level of tennis.   
It's going to be something new to me, but I'm more than ready to make that adjustment if need be.  
   
 Q.   Have you ever feared to be whistled like Ivanisevic because of your serve?  
MILOS RAONIC:   What?   
   
 Q.   Whistled by the public?   
MILOS RAONIC:   Whistled?   No.   If my serve is working, I'm happy.   Doesn't matter what anybody is telling me.   If I'm able to get aces, I'll be smiling all day.  
   
 Q.   Your serve didn't work as well as against Roger Federer.   Do you think it was because Novak was able to return well or you were a bit apprehensive today?  
MILOS RAONIC:   I believe there were a few factors.   I believe I did serve better against Roger.   I think I served better against Roger than in my last two matches.   
But Roger also, at the beginning of the match, there was a few returns he would get his racquet on; whereas Novak today, every time he put his racquet on the ball, he was making me play a deep ball.   
And the short one, even if he gave me a short one and I would attack, he would be there.   So I think it just sort of elevated a certain pressure or demand of having to serve close to the lines, which sort of weighs on your shoulders when the guy is playing as well as he did today.
