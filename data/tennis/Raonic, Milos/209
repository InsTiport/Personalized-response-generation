 M. RAONIC/G. Rufin
  6‑2, 6‑4 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Did that play out the way you wanted?  
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah.   It was pretty quick, short points, and pretty straightforward.  
   
 Q.   What do you need to do to lift it for Querrey?  
MILOS RAONIC:   I think I just need to be a bit more consistent with the returns and play on my terms.   I felt like today I did.   I don't think he was able to get too many serves back.   
I don't think he really stretched me in too many situations.   I just have to clean up a little bit and get healthy.  
   
 Q.   Should be a bit of a contrast the next round, no?  
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah.   They both like to play short points, but obviously Querrey is well‑established.   I have played him already three times.   It's okay.  
   
 Q.   Changing gears a little bit, could you describe the feeling of what it's like to play Roger Federer and why it's so hard to play him and what's your most memorable Federer match?  
MILOS RAONIC:   I think the one I played the best in was in Madrid last year.   It's tough to play him because he plays very well.   He can do a lot of things.   (Smiling.)  
You walk out on the court to play the guy and you have a lot of respect for him.   You'll hear it when they introduce the guy.   It's not like they forget to say 17 Grand Slams and so forth.   
But you try to forget that, and you see it as a guy trying to take at that way from you, what you want.  
And you try to, in a respectful, way don't respect them on court too much.   
   
 Q.   Everybody back home in Canada is very excited about you leading Canada historically to their first quarterfinal matchup against Italy.   Any thoughts about your Italian opponents and playing them in Vancouver?  
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, I think they're very good.   They're a very strong team, a very deep team.   They have three guys that play quite differently.   You have Seppi, who has had a great last year; Fabio who is capable of a lot of good things and has had a lot of good wins.   You have Bolelli who is talented and he is as well capable of a lot.   
   
 Q.   You have a teammate with Jessie Levine.   What does he add to the team that compliments the Canada's Davis Cup?  
MILOS RAONIC:   He adds comfort and depth.   There is a lot of ties that aren't always the smoothest.   You don't play home, you play away.   Maybe not everybody is healthy, so it gives comfort this in a situation.
