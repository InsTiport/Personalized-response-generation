M. RAONIC/R. Federer
  7‑6, 7‑5

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Can you just walk us through the match from your perspective and how you felt like things worked out?
MILOS RAONIC:   Things worked out really well on my end.   I played well.   Most of the service games I was able to at least get a little bit into them, and then when I was getting closely thought I was playing all the points the right way ‑ even the first break chance I had in the first set. 
And to save myself out of that break chance towards the end of the second, I played maybe two tight points, but every single time I needed that serve wide I pretty much hit the same spot three times in a row, which was good.

Q.   Where does this rank for you as far as wins in your career?   Is it one of the biggest?   The best?
MILOS RAONIC:   It would have to be up there definitely at this stage of my career sort of the level I have gotten myself to, that's for sure. 
And considering all the circumstances around it, I think this was the biggest win for me.

Q.   Do you think this is some kind of a small breakthrough?   I mean, given the situation, you're in London, that sort of thing; beating Federer for the first time.   You have never beaten anybody in the top‑‑ well, Nadal, Djokovic, Federer.   First time you beat any of them.   Aren't you a little bit excited?
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, it's all very good.   But knowing ‑‑ sort of you know everything that's sort of on the line this week.   There is a lot of sort of humility to it, because there is a lot more I've got to keep going about and finding a way to win.

Q.   How motivated are you for London?   How do you keep that out of the way when you still have a semifinal to play?
MILOS RAONIC:   I'm very motivated.   I think I have been sort of trying to find this level; fortunately I have been able to do so this week.   Definitely struggled the last few weeks.   If it wasn't sort of me biting away the whole time and having that kind of motivation to need and to want to do well here, I don't think I'd find the answers that I have this week.

Q.   How do you see that next match against Berdych from your point of view?
MILOS RAONIC:   It's going to be difficult.   He's playing well.   He's played quite well since the end of the US Open. 
So I'm going to have to do what I did today in the same kind of concept of take care of my service games and control the center of the court as well as I can.

Q.   Comparing to your two previous matches, does it change something when you play on central court in terms of motivation or... 
MILOS RAONIC:   No.   Everything that's on the line is the same.   I think maybe just that energy, because Court 1 is pretty small.   Even if people do get excited about it, like towards the end of the two sets I played against Sock and Bautista, there are just not as many people in there.   I think there is a different kind of energy on center court.

Q.   And your game has improved since yesterday.   How do you explain it?
MILOS RAONIC:   Well, just ‑‑you go out there and keep trying to get better.   Fortunately each match I have played I have been playing better and better.

Q.   Do you care the result of the rivals that are competing for the race to London, or do you avoid to watch the results of rivals?
MILOS RAONIC:   I'll hear about it, but I will just watch tennis because I like to watch tennis.   But there is ‑‑I've got to eat and all these kinds of things.   I'm not going to delay my diner to watch some tennis tonight. 
When I have a chance, I will be in my room and I'll be watching.

Q.   (English.)   It will be nice to hear a few words in French as to the joy, what represents for you to beat Federer for the first time. 
MILOS RAONIC:   (In French)     Yes.   It's the first time that I beat Federer.   It's fantastic for me.   This is an important tournament for me because there is a final of London coming up.   It's a great victory today. 

Q.   (French.)   And you think you can win the tournament now? 
MILOS RAONIC:   (In French.)   Yes.   Even the first day I started the tournament, and today too I always thought it was always possible for me.
