F. LOPEZ/M. Raonic
  6‑4, 6‑7, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Describe what happened in the third set, why you weren't able to wrestle away the momentum and keep it in your way. 
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, he did a good job.   He stepped up and played well on the important moments, especially on his service game.
I just need to show in a few situations more courage and go for a little bit more.   Not just that third set but all throughout the match.   I just felt like I never let it go through or impose myself, and I think that's what cost me over time.

Q.   Did you find that with having the home crowd behind you, did you find that to be uplifting?   Did you find it as a hindrance with added pressure?   Was it somewhere in the middle? 
MILOS RAONIC:   No, it was great.   The crowd was great.   They helped me out with a lot of difficult situations this week where I wasn't able to play necessarily my best tennis, but they helped me be able to gut through a lot of important moments like that second‑set tiebreak today and the previous two matches. I'm grateful to have that kind of support when I'm playing at home.

Q.   Tough match.   Could have gone either way.   Casey was here yesterday with a youngster, said that what you have accomplished has been inspirational.   I just want to get your thoughts on that. 
MILOS RAONIC:   It's great to hear all those kind of things, and I put so much focus into always getting better and trying to do everything I can to win.   To have that kind of an effect go on and make a difference for people is really endearing and special.

Q.   Did it take some time to adjust to his style of cuts and his slices and change of pace on the court?
MILOS RAONIC:   No.   I think it was only about adjusting really to the serve.   But the thing I would say that I can take away most from this match is making sure I step up in certain moments and really go for it and try to make a difference rather than sort of just staying a little bit too much and too passive and letting things happen to me.

Q.   Have you ever had nine break points in your career before?
MILOS RAONIC:   I have had nine break points.   Not nine in the same game.

Q.   Anything similar in your career to that?
MILOS RAONIC:   There's been, I would say, five, six maybe.   But he came up with some good serves.   I came up with one great return on a second serve.   He played that point well.   Not much I could do.   He just played good courage and he went for it and it paid off for him.

Q.   You have had a pretty good start to the hard court season with the win in Washington and now getting to the quarters here.   How are you feeling going to Cincinnati and your expectations for the US Open?
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, I feel good.   I may not show it right now, but in general when I sort of step away from this after a little bit of time, everything is going the right way. 
I'm competing well and fighting well, and I know I can play much better tennis.   The goal has always been get better each week to be playing my best tennis in NewYork, and that's what I'm most looking forward to. Cincinnati is the next step to getting better.

Q.   How are you feeling physically?   Do you feel any fatigue from a busy past couple of weeks?
MILOS RAONIC:   No.   I feel good.   I have been fortunate that I haven't had any aches or pains, and I feel like energy‑wise I'm good.   Just probably need a day to just sort of clear my mind and refresh a little bit mentally.
It's a pretty busy week.   It's a little bit different from any other week.

Q.   You were asked earlier about Eugenie Bouchard and her early exit and how she should handle that.   You had said she should essentially put it behind herself and forget it as quickly as possible.   I'm wondering if that's advice you'll take, or what's your plan going forward from here?
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, it's about putting this right away behind me, learning what I can from it, understanding what I need to do different in the same situation. 
It hurts to lose today, but there's a lot of possibilities of stuff I could do well over the next week in Cincinnati and possibly after in NewYork that I could give myself a lot of reasons to be able to forget about this quickly.

Q.   How does this compare with Wimbledon?   After that you said you were very disappointed and you went off and trained without being around tennis. 
MILOS RAONIC:   It's quite different.   It's great to be at home, and it's great to play in front of a home crowd and playing in a Masters Series and have that possibility to play here.
But I would say it happening in a tournament that's only four a year and with such prestige that Wimbledon has, it has a different kind of sting or burn to it.
