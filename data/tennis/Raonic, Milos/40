 Q.  So, Milos, bad luck.  Can you just explain what happened yesterday during the match and why you were forced to pull out of the second round today.  
MILOS RAONIC: Yeah.  Yesterday, in the long match with Jo, in the middle of second set, I overextended my elbow and it did some kind of pain.   
Preceding the match, after I spoke with the doctors here, I went and I did an ultrasound and MRI, and they found some kind of a lesion in the tricep.  And after that, it presented me with only this option, the risk being too high and the hindrance on my play being too high as well.
