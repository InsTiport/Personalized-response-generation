  THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
   
 Q. How are conditions here for you in China this week? Have you been out to have much of a practice and how are the courts playing?  
MILOS RAONIC: The courts are pretty quick. The ball flies through the court pretty good. Those situations suit my game.   
   
 Q. You're looking to do well here and hopefully qualify for the yearâ€‘end championships. You have Viktor Troicki in the first match. Talk about how you feel.   
MILOS RAONIC: It's a difficult match, a difficult challenge ahead of me. I'm going to have to play well.   
First round of the tournament is always difficult to sort of find your bearings and so forth. I'm really going to have to focus on myself and try to simplify my game as much as possible.  
   
 Q. How are you feeling after the win in St.Petersburg?  
MILOS RAONIC: I'm playing much better. I'm getting ahold of my game, so I'm happy with that.
