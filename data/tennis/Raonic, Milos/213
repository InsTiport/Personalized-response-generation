A. MURRAY/M. Raonic
  6‑4, 6‑4, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   If you could change one thing in the way you played tonight, what would it be?
MILOS RAONIC:   In the way I played or about the match? 

Q.   In the way you played. 
MILOS RAONIC:   That he didn't play as well (smiling). 
Not much I could do.   I tried everything.   I tried three different ways.   I tried playing back, playing high to him.   I tried coming in a lot.   Everything really. 
Didn't have solutions all the time.   But he would put it together for a game. 
I got ahead a few times on his service games, Love‑30, but like one of the last games I think it was forehand winner down the line, two aces.   Not just much really I could do.   He took me out of the match. 

Q.   Is that what you said to him at the end? 
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, he said, Sorry, I got lucky a few times.   I said, Don't be sorry, it was simply amazing, keep it up and you'll do well. 

Q.   You lost the serve in the first set.   Much better chance if you won the first set.   You had a couple of doubles in that game.   Was that going for it or just missing those?
MILOS RAONIC:   No, I was going for them.   The thing is he was getting close in other games.   He was putting pressure all the time.   He was holding easier than me. 
I made two mistakes, but I think the other two points he won he played well.   It was like that pretty much every time I got broken.   Maybe I'd contribute half or one‑quarter of the time, but every other one he was doing well. 
He was blocking returns.   It's tough in there.   Something I haven't really experienced, which Ashe is a little bit different.   It's windy constantly and from all different directions.   So it was hard to really just step in on them. 
I felt like I was doing it well most of the time, except maybe a few shots I didn't go for as much in the beginning just because I didn't know how to really read it. 
But he was blocking ‑‑ pretty much every return he got his racquet on was coming back in.   I was hitting a lot of good shots.   I was a little bit ahead in the points.   But he was neutralizing really well, just to let me stay a little bit ahead but not really get far ahead in the points. 
When I did get far ahead on critical moments, quite a few moments, he just did something I really have no answer for, something I haven't really experienced. 

Q.   Is it hard to come up against a returner whose reflexes are so good? 
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, it's tough.   It makes it tougher, for sure.   It wasn't just that.   I was hitting the ball well after that. 
I think a perfect example is the one game I got myself to 15‑30.   15‑All I hit a good slice.   He runs it down.   It's a pass down the line. 
15‑30 I come to the net, hit a really deep volley, making contact behind him.   I saw the replay of that shot.   He hit a winner down the line.   Not too much I could do.   He just did a lot of things too good today. 

Q.   I don't think you sounded like this in the matches against Federer.   Is that one of the best matches?
MILOS RAONIC:   Considering what I was able to put into the match, have somebody that took me out of it and neutralize and took it even one step further more.   I haven't really felt in that situation too much when I feel like I'm doing things well. 
There were moments when I lapsed just a little bit because he was just on top of me so much.   But the way he just handled so many of the situations.   The whole time‑‑ I don't really show that much energy in between points and everything.   The whole time I was trying to get myself going, trying just to do anything to destruct him as much as possible.   I couldn't. 
He was just too good, unfortunately, because I was playing well.   But too good. 

Q.   This is pretty obvious, but does it make you feel any better that he said he felt you played really well tonight?
MILOS RAONIC:   I think I would feel worse if he said, This is the worst match I had all year.   I think Milos is an awful player.   He's so easy to beat. 
Even though he says it, I think many people could see it.   I could see it.   My team could see it.   I think his camp could see it as well. 

Q.   Comment on playing on Ashe for the first time. 
MILOS RAONIC:   It was fun.   It was a great experience.   Never got really too rowdy.   I guess I didn't give them too much opportunity, or he took away every opportunity of that.   But it was fun. 
I think I handled this time around much better than playing in Rod Laver Arena against Lleyton earlier this year.
