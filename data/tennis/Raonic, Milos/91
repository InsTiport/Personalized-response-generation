THE MODERATOR: We are here to announce that Milos unfortunately has to withdraw from the tournament with a right ankle injury.   
Milos, maybe a short statement.   
MILOS RAONIC: Yeah, yesterday during my second match in the evening, early on in the match, I believe it was the third game, I rolled over my ankle, obviously caused it some level of a sprain.   
I did a test this morning when showed I had a partial tear on the outside of my ankle.  I was told to give it a try.  I tried to warm up just before the match like I would normally, and I was unable to play.  Therefore, it seemed to be the correct decision to have to withdraw from this match I was looking forward to this evening.   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  A partial tear on the ligaments?  
MILOS RAONIC: The ligaments, correct.   
 Q.  Are you going to go to Shanghai and try or...  
MILOS RAONIC: I will go to Shanghai and try just due to the fact that I have a bye and I can get a significantly later start which will buy me four to five days, which could make the difference, not to heal the issue but at least to make it bearable.   
 Q.  You had a lot of injuries this season, setbacks, coming back trying to get your level up.  Is it starting to become frustrating that every time you're playing your best tennis, something happens?  
MILOS RAONIC: Yeah, it's been frustrating the whole time.  Since it's happened to me quite a few times now, I understand how to deal with it better.  I keep trying to improve everything I can to keep those injuries away.  To some extent I am getting better at it.   
But I'm going to try, I guess, to find the next answer to staying healthy, as well.   
Thank you.
