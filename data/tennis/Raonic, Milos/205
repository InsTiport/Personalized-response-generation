Q. Can you just tell us what happened? 
MILOS RAONIC:   Just got sick over the last two days.   Even a little bit strep throat.   Had a fever before my first round going into the match, and just got really bad over the last two nights.
I wasn't able to sleep and just a really high fever and discomfort and pain. 

Q.   When did you decide to pull the plug?
MILOS RAONIC:     Five minutes ago.   I was trying to sort of play it out as long as I could really to see if I'm getting better with time.     It wasn't the case. 
I just feel completely drained.   I was able to get rid of most of the fever, but still just on low reserve.

Q.   This is the second bad luck year in a row here, isn't it? 
MILOS RAONIC:   Ah, but it's bad luck.   Twisted ankle and getting sick, so hopefully that's it for bad luck in Miami. 

Q.   So it's because your ill and not injured?
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, strep throat. 

Q.   What do you think for Davis Cup?
MILOS RAONIC:   I should be fine.   This is something that's going to pass.   I'm already quite a bit better than I was at 2:00 in the morning this morning.     I'm sure it will pass.
