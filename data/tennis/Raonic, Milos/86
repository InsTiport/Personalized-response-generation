A. MURRAY/M. Raonic
(Walkover)
THE MODERATOR: Hello, everyone.  Unfortunately, Milos won't be able to compete in the second semifinal.  He has an injury.  He will explain what is wrong and what the doctor told him.  Then we will open up for a few questions.
MILOS RAONIC: So yesterday at I believe 4-2 in the first set I started feeling some pain in my leg.  I didn't think too much of it at that point.
This morning I had trouble waking up and getting out of bed.  So I went to sort of clear any serious diagnosis.  Did some tests.  Did an MRI half an hour ago, let's say.  They found that I have a tear, Grade 1 tear in the right quad.  Unfortunately, I'm not able to compete against Andy today in the second semifinal.
THE MODERATOR: Questions?
Q. Did they give you any idea of recovery time?  Does it endanger your position in London?
MILOS RAONIC: Yes, it does.  I still have the possibility of making it, but I was told five to ten days.  So I'm on the borderline for that.
Q. You've had so many injuries like this.  Just getting back on track.  Is this one more frustrating because it's at the end of a long series of injuries, or...
MILOS RAONIC: They're all frustrating.  I guess it's also a little numbing because I get a little more used to it.
But in a way, it's not as bad as it could be, so I guess there is some light in that.  I still have a possibility that I might be able to play more this year, obviously in one of the biggest stages, important moments in tournaments, for us as tennis players.
Now, just rather than feeling bad about it and this kind of stuff, I try to put the attention on trying to make the most of these days I have and trying to really find as many solutions as I can.  Fortunately I have, I believe, at least eight days before I play a first-round match.
Q. Can I get clear, so you went to bed last night, as far as you're concerned, with full mobility and woke up this morning with very little?
MILOS RAONIC: Well, I was feeling some discomfort, which I thought was just tightness standing, getting up and out of a chair.  Then this morning, it ramped up quite a bit when I woke up and got out of bed.
Q. What is the plan now, Milos?  You go back home and treatment?
MILOS RAONIC: I don't know necessarily.  I have to see what the possibilities are for this kind of injury.  It's not necessarily the most clear, because the muscle that is damaged is very close to the bone.  So any kind of external sort of rehab is ineffective.
So I have to see, with the situation I have, what is possible and try to make it as possible as possible.
Q. If, in the worst-case scenario, this is the end of your year, how do you look back on your year?
MILOS RAONIC: Oh, it's been my best year so far.  I think sometimes I get a little bit too hard on myself and I don't appreciate the good moments enough, but I think that's the life of a tennis player.  We get so warped up in what's next.
But at the moment right now, it's really about trying to give myself a chance.  Right now there is few guys that are realistically fighting for a chance to finish third.  If I can have a chance to play, that's where my attention and my goals go towards.
Q. You pointed out the exact stage of the match when you think you hurt yourself.  What did you do?
MILOS RAONIC: I couldn't remember exactly what happened or what I did, because it wasn't that I felt it during the point.  The point was finished, and the next point I started feeling -- I thought maybe my muscles were just getting tight.  Where I sort of felt it a bit more was standing and getting up and out of the seat on the changeover, sort of when I had cooled down a little bit.
During play, staying warm, wasn't too obvious of an issue.  So I didn't give it too much thought.
