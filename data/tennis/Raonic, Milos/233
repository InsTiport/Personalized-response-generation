 L. HEWITT/M. Raonic
  4‑6, 6‑3, 7‑6, 6‑3 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   You said earlier today or yesterday, regardless of his injuries in recent past, Hewitt knows how to win.   Is that basically the summary of tonight?   
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, he took everything into perspective and he made the best of it and he played I think quite a bit better than me and it showed.   
He was more steady.   He was more constant the whole match.   I was more up and down.   It's going to win the race that way.   
I guess it's unfortunate in a way because I felt like I had the ability to win, but I just didn't do it.   
   
 Q.   Would you say experience played a part?  
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, for sure.   I'm only going to keep learning.   As much as I hate to really look at anything positive out of today, it's a learning experience.   There's so much to take from it.   
I'm probably just a little stubborn at the moment now and I won't listen really to too much.   But when the time comes, I'll open up my ears, I'll learn from it and hopefully be better next time.   
   
 Q.   There's no way you can duplicate in practice what this experience is going to be like.   What was it like compared to what you might have thought or hoped it would be like?  
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, I started out nervous.   I struggled more with him than I did with anything else really.   He was keeping the ball very low.   
He was hitting always constant pace and quite low.   Even when he was defending, he was always defending low.   
At the beginning I was trying a little too much just to go through rather than getting down and playing a little bit more conservatively and getting down and sort of hitting the ball the right way.   I don't want to get into it technically, but...   
And then after that, you could see his belief start to grow more and more.   He's a very smart player.   He knows how to win.   When he smells a little bit of weakness, he just really pounces on it and he knows how to expose it.   He's not the type of person that will give you really anything.   
Doesn't matter how hurt he's been, how old he is, he's as much of a competitor as he ever was.   He got me with that.   
   
 Q.   How did you feel playing with the Australian crowd?   A lot of support for Lleyton out there.   
MILOS RAONIC:   I thought it was actually fun.   I thought the crowd was really respectful.   It never really became an issue or anything like this.   I thought it was fun.   
I was surprised with the kind of response I was getting.   So that was obviously fun.   
Obviously I expected a lot of support for him.   But you never felt like anybody was weighing down on your shoulders or anything like this.   It was a really enjoyable moment and I wish I could have played better to enjoy it more.  
   
 Q.   The smash you lost that break on, would you hit to again?   Is that normally what you do in that situation?  
MILOS RAONIC:   That's what I do in that situation 365 days a year.   
   
 Q.   When you say you got a lot to learn from this, will you watch the video and analyze it?  
MILOS RAONIC:   I have a long flight home.   I'm pretty sure it will cross my mind a few times.   I'll look at a lot of things.   I'll sit down and talk with my coach.   
I'm not going to really watch a video of it.   I haven't watched a video of myself playing really since probably a few years now.   I always watch little clips, but that's mostly technical stuff.   Things I need to work on is more how I just deal with the moments.   So it's more just talking about it, figuring it out, finding a routine that will work for me in the future.   
   
 Q.   Do you think an environment like this tonight is going to help you in things like Davis Cup?   
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, for sure.   It's a starting point for many things, not just Davis Cup.   I hope to be in this kind of a situation many, many times.   I'm only going to get better with it each time.   I feel not only as a tennis player I'm going to improve with matches and practice and everything, also I'll improve with knowing how to deal with the situation, knowing what I can expect, and knowing especially when it's against an opponent like Lleyton that really competes well but also he thrives off the crowd and he loves to play here, just knowing how to sort of just block that out and focus strictly on the tennis.   
   
 Q.   You kept your cool pretty well when things were slipping away.   Did you struggle to do that?   Are you at the point now where that was all right?   
MILOS RAONIC:   No, it was okay.   I never really felt like I was going to have a single, like, outburst.   It was hard to accept a lot of the things the way they were going.   It never got close to me, blowing a fuse.
