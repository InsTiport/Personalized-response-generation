 M. RAONIC/N. Kyrgios
      6‑3, 7‑6, 6‑3 
  
    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please.   
   
 Q.   It could have been a bit tricky for first round against him.   How did you feel out on the court today?  
    MILOS RAONIC:   I felt very good.   I was able to do the things I wanted to do.   Sort of the first round you go in not knowing exactly how things are going to play out, and I was able to, when it mattered, put forward the right attitude and the right level of tennis.  
    I'm happy with that.  
   
 Q.   How do the conditions compare with Rome?  
    MILOS RAONIC:   They're quite similar.   I think here though they can change a little bit more due to the cloud coverage and not really that much sun the last few days.  
    It wasn't bouncing as much as it had actually the last days on the outside courts.  
   
 Q.   What's been the follow‑up, especially the first two sets of Novak, how much encouragement has that given you?  
    MILOS RAONIC:   It's been great.   It's given me a lot of confirmation on the things I have been doing, especially what I have been trying to do and the approach I have had on the clay courts, but also it's given me a lot of motivation just aside from everything that, to put it together and get it right, and I could give myself a possibility to do very well.  
   
 Q.   At the end of the second set how did you feel your game, you seemed a little bit frustrated?  
    MILOS RAONIC:   I was getting it together when it mattered, and that's all I can really ask.   There was some moments where I was losing a little bit of concentration on my level, and I was able to put it together when I was in the important moments.  
   
 Q.   He's tipped to be one of the young players coming up.   Can you just talk about his game and what you found difficult to deal with?  
    MILOS RAONIC:   He's very capable, he's talented, especially off the forehand side, he can surprise you in many ways.   
    I haven't been really on tour that long that I can tell you, seeing a lot of guys come up, what really the big differences are.   But there is definitely weapons there and stuff that can make a lot of players feel uncomfortable.  
   
 Q.   How was your performance in French for the interview after the match?   
    MILOS RAONIC:   As good as my tennis.   
   
 Q.   As good?   
    MILOS RAONIC:   (Laughter.)  
    Q.Vesely or Rosol, I don't think they have played yet.   What do you think about them?  
    MILOS RAONIC:   I think very much similar players, both guys that go for their shots.   For me the most important thing is going to be about controlling the center of the court and dictating and forcing them to adjust to myself rather than myself to them.   
   
 Q.   I know you have the history with Rosol.   Vesely is‑‑  
    MILOS RAONIC:   Haven't played him before.  
   
 Q.   Have you studied him very much, seen him play?   
    MILOS RAONIC:   I have seen him play two, three times.   I watched that one match against Murray because I was playing the winner of that one in the following round in Indian Wells, so I have seen a bit of him play.  
   
 Q.   You said you're going to tweet in French?   How is your French?   Because you speak pretty good, but you don't have any opportunities.   
    MILOS RAONIC:   As much as Google Translate can help me (laughter).  
   
 Q.   That's how you're going to tweet?  
    MILOS RAONIC:   I'm going to double‑check I'm saying everything right.   When I'm tweeting something I can check it; when I'm saying something live on TV I can't.   I will go through the due diligence.  
   
 Q.   You both double‑faulted twice in a row fairly early in the match.   That's not that common, but is that just nerves or was something going on?  
    MILOS RAONIC:   I was just struggling throughout the whole match especially on the second serve to sort of get the range and distance, and I just ‑‑it started from early on.
