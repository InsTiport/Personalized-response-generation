THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Can you talk a little bit about how maybe your expectations for the clay season have changed?  You had not a bad week in Madrid but obviously came in to Madrid and before that had injury issues.  Expectations, have they leveled down a little bit, or how do you see the next three weeks pan out?  
MILOS RAONIC: I think they could be very good for me.  I think for me obviously the No. 1 priority through the last two weeks was staying healthy through them.  I hadn't completed a week this year healthy.  That was a primary goal.   
Now that I'm aware my body can handle week-after-week stress to some extent, it becomes more of a focus on specifically the tennis things and going about that.   
Thankfully I have been able to put in yesterday and today, as well, with that kind of intention, and hopefully I can continue throughout this tournament to have many matches to focus on exactly that.   
 Q.  Your feeling with the tournament, with the city.  
MILOS RAONIC: Yeah, the tournament is one that I think gets the more excited crowd around the year.  People come from all ends and corners of Italy, and the tournament does a great job in facilitating that.   
It's a lot of fun to play here.  The courts, every court is a little bit different.  Some are a little bit quicker than others.  I try to adjust for each day where you have to play and so forth, but if it's dry, it can be quite quick here, which helps me, and the courts are pretty small, so it helps me also with my serve.   
The city I think is one of the most fascinating and beautiful cities in the world.  I have had opportunity over the last few years to see some of it.  I already took time this year to go and to see some exhibitions.   
I like indulging in the different cultural aspects here in Rome.   
 Q.  You just said you have been able to train injury-free and pain-free over the past two weeks and also the past days here.  Is that something that's kept you maybe a little bit on edge or a little anxious in a way that you knew that maybe there have been issues that have been reoccurring every now and then throughout tournaments and throughout months?  
MILOS RAONIC: Well, I think it would just sort of just cause a sort of a paranoia and a stress, because then every little kind of nagging pain or discomfort, I would automatically, just through defending my body, I would think it's more than it is.   
Whereas now I have gotten to the stage that if I have a little bit of nagging pain or discomfort, I don't overthink it too much.  I try to monitor it, but I don't give it too much value.  I just try to deal with it as it is and try to be better the next day.
