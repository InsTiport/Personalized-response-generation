M. RAONIC/J. Del Potro
  7‑5, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Do you have a medical report?
MILOS RAONIC:   It's a little bit a muscle that's tight and a little bit inflamed, pinching a nerve, causing sort of a dead feeling. 

Q.   Muscle in the neck?
MILOS RAONIC:   Muscle in the neck. 

Q.   Kind of went away?
MILOS RAONIC:   It got a little bit better.   It sort of limited me on a few shots.   Sometimes if I would hit the ball off‑center, I would feel it go through my arm, it would stay there for a while, then sort of dissipate. 

Q.   Two Canadians in the final eight in the tournament since 1989.   Your thoughts on that? 
MILOS RAONIC:   It's great.   I'm happy to have gone through today.   I was able to watch a lot of Vasek's.   He seemed to be playing confident and well.   It was big he battled out the ending of that match.   It's good for him.

Q.   You against Del Potro, what were the keys to success?
MILOS RAONIC:   I think both of us were not 100%.   Obviously he was also far from that.   Sort of stuck to it.   Sort of played aggressive.   Just tried keeping points short.   He was a little bit limited from what I could tell on his rotation.   He wasn't able to sort of pass as well as he normally would or serve as well. 
Just gave me a little bit more opportunities.   I feel like I grinded it out a little bit and got lucky in certain parts.

Q.   You arrive here not on a hot streak, and now everything seems to go your way. 
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, I enjoy playing here.   I want to play well here.   At the end of the day a big part of it also is it's hard courts where I'm most comfortable.   So as soon as I get going a little bit on it, I can sort of figure out the solutions a little bit easier. 
It's a good thing. 

Q.   Two Canadians maybe in the semifinal if everything goes well.   A few years ago it would have been impossible to think about. 
MILOS RAONIC:   No, it's a good thing.   But tomorrow's another day, right? 

Q.   DelPo was upset in the second set, felt you touched the net.   What was your view of that point?
MILOS RAONIC:   I was fortunate that the line judge didn't see it.   It's a lucky thing for me in my sense, unlucky for him.   Something that can go really both ways. 
It's sort of the exact same thing as having no challenges left and you get a bad line call.   It's like a bad‑luck thing.   It was hard to sort of be able to take this point on such a big point.

Q.   He seemed to think you should have called it on yourself. 
MILOS RAONIC:   It's a big point.   I don't know.   If you can put somebody in the situation being down breakpoint, same thing happens, do you call it on yourself? 

Q.   But it was his point. 
MILOS RAONIC:   Hypothetically yes.   Technically no. 

Q.   It hasn't been easy for you lately.   How does it feel to be at the top again?
MILOS RAONIC:   Yeah, it's a very good feeling to sort of have these kind of sensations on court, to be getting this confidence through match wins. 
At the end of the day, it's work I've been putting in on court long before my first match here, long before Washington.   I felt like I was doing a lot of good work.   It's nice to see the pieces coming together.

Q.   How do you explain the difference between a couple months ago and how you're playing right now?
MILOS RAONIC:   Hard work and things coming together.   I have found a lot of solutions.   I wouldn't necessarily call them distractions, but there were a lot of things on my mind a certain part of the year.   I think I've sort of found peace within all of that.   I've been able to focus on my tennis and get that together.

Q.   The neck thing, is that something that is going to be a concern for tomorrow and possibly after that for the rest of this tournament?
MILOS RAONIC:   I think it's something we can get under control quite a bit by tomorrow.   I don't think it's something that's going to disappear necessarily. 
But it is a tight muscle that's inflamed.   If we can sort of calm that down, I think it's going to help significantly lower the pain and the discomfort in my arm. 
Tomorrow's another day.   I don't know.   I could sleep well and it could be something really good, or I could have a bad sleep.

Q.   Did it just come up today?
MILOS RAONIC:   I've had it a few days.   But today was the first day that the antiinflammatory didn't work. 

Q.   It's a quick turnaround for tomorrow.   You're on at 2 p.m.   You've always played during the night.   Would you have preferred to play during the night?
MILOS RAONIC:   No, it's okay.   Normally for me daytime is better.   It's normally a quicker situation.   It's going to be a little bit different tomorrow.   But it's not a situation I feel uncomfortable in. 

Q.   The court is quicker in the day?
MILOS RAONIC:   When the sun's out, it's warmer, the court it's quicker. 

Q.   How many more miles per hour?
MILOS RAONIC:   I wouldn't say 'miles an hour'.   It's the way the ball bounces off the court.   So you can't call it miles per hour.   It sort of shoots through the court and the ball bounces up higher, which is a good thing for me.

Q.   Does the ball go faster through the air, too?
MILOS RAONIC:   Most likely.   I would think that's probably correct.
