6-4, 4-6, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You played in Monte-Carlo and won in two sets.  Today, three sets.
MILOS RAONIC: Yeah, I thought he played better today.  The conditions were a little bit difficult.  I should have been a little bit more disciplined with myself in certain scenarios, but I'm happy to win and give myself an opportunity to play better in my next round.
Q. What's pleasing you most about the way you're playing at the moment?
MILOS RAONIC: I'm competing well.  I may not be playing well in every single match, but I'm finding a way and I'm keeping myself alive in tournaments.  Each match I play I get better and better.
Then by the time it gets to the weekend and the important matches, I'm there, I'm fighting, and I'm giving myself always an opportunity.
Q. How much improvement your job with Carlos in this period?  Do you have a percent of increasing or changing your play?
MILOS RAONIC: To put a number on it is difficult, but he's definitely helped me with the way I deal with situations.  He's helped me also understanding my game a little bit better and helped me to be more efficient.
It's been a very positive effect on my tennis, for sure.
Q. Do you think it's possible for you to win a big title on clay?
MILOS RAONIC: Yeah, I think so.  If I play well and I do the things right I can give myself a possibility and a chance against each and every player.
Q. You have learned some Italian words?  And what?
MILOS RAONIC: A little bit.  I don't know what to say exactly right now under pressure, but I can understand them because there is two guys on my team that speak Italian.  Even my fitness trainer that's Croatian, he speaks Italian.  So when they speak between each other I can understand them and put it together and they can't say mean things about me without me understanding.
Q. Nick Kyrgios next.  What do you think is the biggest challenge about playing him?
MILOS RAONIC: You know, he has a lot of firepower.  He can do a lot of different things.  It's about sort of getting ahead in the points before he does, because that's where I'd say both of our games excel at is that aggressive tennis.  It's about who can take control of the points first.
