M. RAONIC/L. Pouille
6-4, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Good match.
MILOS RAONIC: Yeah, it was a good match minus maybe two service games a little bit.  Maybe got a little bit ahead of myself and that was it.
Q. Two matches isn't a lot to gauge, but are things transferring from the practice court to the match court?
MILOS RAONIC: Yeah, they were.  I think yesterday I was being aggressive and coming forward; today I thought I came forward as well, but I was probably more efficient today.
Overall I think it was a better performance today.
Q. It was quite a long match last night.  Ice bath?  Yoga?
MILOS RAONIC: I came here hoping to be ready for three out of five, so yesterday I was hoping wouldn't be an issue.  I was able to recover well.
Q. Have you had a chance to look at any of the action?
MILOS RAONIC: Yeah, I've been watching pretty much the whole time so far.
Q. So of your likely opponents, what sort of observations have you made?
MILOS RAONIC: Well, you know, Bernie, he's doing things well.  He's serving well; making him play a lot.  He's hitting the ball well.  He's hitting through the court and keeping Kei off balance and so forth.
Also with Kei, like you know, he's going to be there.  He moves really well and gets in position well and likes to move the ball around the court.
It will be two matches you approach differently, but at the same time, both players like to play and have rhythm.  Fortunately for me, my game is to take that away.
Q. Bernie is very much a confidence-type player.  There will be a reasonable crowd in if he's your opponent, and a home crowd.  Do you feel like you have to silence the crowd?  Block them out?
MILOS RAONIC: No, I think you sort of just focus on what you can control and what's ahead of you.  I've played Lleyton a night match in Melbourne, I've so had the sense of what that's like.  The fans here are very passionate.
At the same time, it's something out of my control.  I got to focus on what I need to do to find a way to win and simplify it as much as possible.
Q. Have you seen much of Bernie lately?  There is a newfound maturity in his game seems like.  When was the last time you saw his tennis?
MILOS RAONIC: I believe the last time -- it's been a while since I really sat down and watched him play because I was struggling with so many things over the last period of time.
But, no, I always pay attention from afar.  I think I got to see quite a bit today, and, you know, he's made great strides forward, which he always had within him, but it was sort of the professionalism and what he did off the court to put those pieces together.
I think he's doing that now.
