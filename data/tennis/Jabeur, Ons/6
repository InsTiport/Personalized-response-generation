O. JABEUR/J. Brady
6-4, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions please.
Q. Just talk about your match today, Brady is just a tough one, had a great week in Dubai, you also had a great week. What did you need to do to win today?
ONS JABEUR: Yeah, Brady she plays really good. We played each other couple of times last year. Big serve, but I think I was ready in the return. I know she improved a lot her backhand, so it was kind of tough to manage with that. It was also a little bit windy so it didn't help me or her.
But I'm happy with the way I played, changing up the rhythm kind of disturbed her and I think today the return and my forehand was the key to kind of bother her and I'm happy that I got the win in two sets.
Q. And what are you most pleased with out of tonight?
ONS JABEUR: I think the return and then mixing up some slices kind of bothered her with the, especially on her forehand. She surprised me with her backhand today because last time when we played it wasn't like this.
But I'm glad I got the win and I'm glad that I, in the important moments, I played really good.
Q. And then next for you is Pliskova, she's a tough one. You're also familiar with her. Talk about that matchup.
ONS JABEUR: Yeah, tough match last year. She's a big server, I'm going to honestly be ready, no pressure on me. I think I could get the win tomorrow, she doesn't like when I mix it up or make like drop shots and everything.
I think the key tomorrow is also going to be the return. I'm going to be ready to serve well and return well and hopefully it's going to be a great match.
