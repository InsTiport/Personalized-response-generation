A. KERBER/O. Jabeur   
W/O   
 Q.  Thank you so much for talking to us.  You must be so disappointed.  Just talk us through your decision to pull out of the tournament.  
ONS JABEUR: Well, I am disappointed.  I wanted to play here and why not get the trophy?  But my health didn't allow me to do that.   
I wake up sore in the morning, a little tough to walk.  Then I tried to warm up.  Wasn't the best warmup.  Tried to tape, run, do a few movements that I do on the court.  It was very difficult for me.   
Tough decision.  I hate to withdraw.  I hate to do this kind of stuff, I mean, especially in the semifinal.  But, I mean, I hope this is a good thing to start maybe a good Wimbledon.  I don't know.  I'm just trying to keep very positive here.   
 Q.  I was just going to ask you, do you have any indication of how long it might take to heal and whether you will be able to play at Wimbledon?  
ONS JABEUR: Well, I hope as soon as I can.  I'm doing some scans now.  Hopefully I can do better and even better Sunday.  We'll see.  You know, I'm just gonna take it each day, and we'll see how my ankle will heal.   
The only thing is I'm going to keep a good attitude, so maybe it will help me to recover fast.   
 Q.  And on a positive note, you must be very proud of what you have achieved here this week?  
ONS JABEUR: I am.  It's such a nice tournament here.  First time here.  I love it.  Unfortunately it did end like this.  Hopefully I can come back next year and do better.   
I want to thank the crowd, they are here, my team, they were supporting me.  Thank you again, Eastbourne, for having me here.  Such a nice tournament.  Hopefully I can recover very fast and you can come to see me in Wimbledon.   
 Q.  Well, heal well and thank you for talking to us.  
ONS JABEUR: Thank you.
