Y. DUAN/O. Jabeur
6-2, 6-3
Q. Obviously frustrating, but how much of that was you were unable to get your game going and how much of it was her?  She came through a tough qualifying campaign as well.
ONS JABEUR: Well, she played already two matches and she's kind of used to the court.  And I was trying to play to get the rhythm.  It was tough.  It was windy, and especially against a player like her, she hits really hard.  Wasn't going really well for me lately, so hopefully it's a new challenge for me to win a match and probably later just because of other stuff, you know.
Q. When you talk to coaches and people, is there anything that you can pinpoint as to why it's been a tough start to things for you?
ONS JABEUR: Well, the good news is there is a lot of things that I could work on, especially, you know, to be more regular on the court, to maintain the ball.  That's what makes I think the difference between the top players and players like struggling a lot with the ranking.  For me, no, it's to go practice and just never give up, you know.  That's the point.
