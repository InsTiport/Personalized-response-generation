 6-4, 4-6, 6-4
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Danielle was saying she had a lot of trouble with your dropshots, that you were able to them from almost anywhere and completely upset her rhythm.  Can you talk about your ability to do that and how you think maybe the match got away from you at 4-4 in the third set.
 ONS JABEUR:   I think it was very close today.  I had my opportunity.  She had hers.  I mean, that's tennis, obviously.
 Actually, I'm a little bit disappointed in my dropshots today because it was kind of hard to do them the way I wanted to.  I know she was running really good to them and she was kind of making me not, I mean, happy with the way I did it.  So honestly I feel like today the condition also bothered me.  It was sunny but then raining and then the court was heavy.  It was kind of difficult.
 But I'm kind of disappointed but hopefully this won't hurt much.
 Q. I wanted to ask you a question that has to do with the men's draw, because we do a Roland Garros Live show every night and we have a debate.  The debate tonight is about whether or not we are headed towards a Rafa-Novak final.  I want to have just your honest opinion on that if you think so.  I know you were wearing a Tsitsipas mask the other day.
 ONS JABEUR:   Well, I know that Rafa is unbelievable on clay court.  He's playing young talented player today, so I don't know how that's gonna go.
 But Rafa is still Rafa on the clay.  I mean, I'm hoping to see Tsitsipas go far here.  I'm also like really supporting him anywhere.
 So, yeah, I think it could go like Nadal-Djokovic, but I always hope that Tsitsipas goes far here.
 Q. Wondering if you have had any time to think about what your schedule will look like going forward now and what the communication has been from the WTA Tour about which tournaments are going to be taking place.
 ONS JABEUR:   Well, the plan was to play Ostrava and Moscow but then Moscow got canceled so only going to play Ostrava for now.  I have to switch again to hard court obviously, but hopefully I can be ready for that.
 Probably will be my last tournament of the season.  I'm not sure how this gonna go, because of travel restriction going on right now.  Plus I can only be with one person since I'm in qualifying, which surprising because I thought if I made it to this ranking I can never play qualifying.  But since the draw is so small and is the only tournament now going on, so I think I will have to play qualifying.
 Q. Who is the one or two people that you most miss with the restrictions on who you can travel with?
 ONS JABEUR:   Well, for now, actually I'm traveling with my husband who is also my fitness coach and my tennis coach.  I usually sometimes get my physio here, so I'm kind of missing my physio right now, being with me.
 I mean, you know, you have to do what you have to do right now.  There is only one tournament left in the season, so I'm hoping for next year won't be that strict.  I mean, let's see.
