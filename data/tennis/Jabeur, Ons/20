O. JABEUR/S. Halep   
6-1 (ret.)   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  In the second set, after Halep retired, you didn't look too happy.  Why was that?  Usually people are really happy after winning a match.  
ONS JABEUR: Yeah, I mean, I didn't want the match to end like this.  I wanted a real battle.  Unfortunately she was injured.  I didn't look happy because I didn't want to win this way.   
But, of course, I take the win.  I hope next time we can play a real match without anyone injured.
