 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. It was a tough game today against Naomi Osaka.  Can you talk us through the match.
 ONS JABEUR:   Well, she played really good.  I mean, you can see the high level there.  I honestly tried to play my game a little bit, but it was tough.  I had a lot of opportunities in the first set, obviously.
 I wish I have done better or I took really the breakpoints.  But, I mean, she was much better than me today, and I'm gonna go back and work harder to be ready for the next tournaments.
 Q. Curious just playing her, obviously you have seen her play a bunch and things like that.  How different was it playing against her than what you thought it might be like with your scouting reports and what you have seen?
 ONS JABEUR:   Well, she had really tough shots, really tough angles.  She had, like, she went to the right spots on the right time.  I mean, you can see she's top-level player.  Like, even I felt it on the court.
 Just like I was hoping, like, in the right moments I took really the right shots, and played better.  I felt like we didn't have a lot of rallies.  It could have helped me get more into the game.  But, I mean, she played really good.
 Honestly, I cannot say I have regrets.  I kinda don't, because she was much better than me on the court today.
 Q. Is there any sense of kind of, like, bad luck with the draw in terms of how you were playing, maybe your confidence level, thinking that maybe if you don't go up against Naomi that you get further, is there any of that at all?
 ONS JABEUR:   No, I try not to think that way.  I like these matches.  I like these kind of challenges.  I know, like, if I was maybe better prepared I would have played better obviously on the court.  I mean, it is what it is.
 I want to face these players.  I know I can beat them, but it's okay.  The draw this time, it was like this.  Maybe next time it would be better.
 Q. Just recapping your Aussie swing and going forward, what is your plan for the next, you know, month, month and a half or so, and what do you take out of this first section of the season?
 ONS JABEUR:   Well, I'm supposed to play the 250 next week, but I pulled out because, I mean, it's not -- honestly with the hard lockdown, I don't think I could really play more.  I had few blisters that were bothering me, so I'm going to try to go to Doha now and focus to practice there.  Be prepared for Doha/Dubai.  That's my main goal for now.
 Yeah, the beginning of the season I expected better, but under the different and difficult circumstances, I hope I can do better after.
 I know that I need time to prepare myself to be ready physically and on the court.  I'm pretty optimistic.  I'm playing good.  I feel like I have the level to play good.  Hopefully I can do good in Doha.
