ONS JABEUR: I'm very proud to represent my country and all Arabic countries in my sport.  My advice is to trust yourself and pursue your dream.  Never get tired and do hard work to reach your dreams.
Q. What is your favorite match or moment in your career?  How did you feel after that?
ONS JABEUR: Maybe last year, I would say it was a tournament actually in Moscow.  I played really good and I felt really good.  I felt like I was having fun on the court, really happy with my game, and I kind of discovered a lot of things in me that I could do.
After that tournament, I reached my best ranking.  I was really proud of myself.
Q. How often do you practice?
ONS JABEUR: Per day, like, around five to six hours.  Every day till probably Saturday.  I take some time off on Saturday afternoon and Sunday off.  I'm allowed, right (smiling)?

ONS JABEUR: Hmm.  Now?  My favorite song?  Let me check my phone.
It's actually a French song from Soul King.  Do you know Soul King?  No, you don't know probably.  Do you speak French?  So you listen to it.  It's good.
No Arabic questions?  Come on.
Q. As you come every year to Qatar, what are your favorite place in Doha?

ONS JABEUR: I don't know.  Maybe.  I'm going to let them do whatever they want.  I'm not going to pressure them to do anything.  And if they want to be professional, I'm going to tell them it's going to be a little bit hard, but I'm going to try to push them and help them as much as I can.
Q. How do you spend your time outside the court?
ONS JABEUR: I watch a lot of movies.  Serious, I like football.  I play football, either PlayStation or outside, both.  But I also listen to music.  That's it.
