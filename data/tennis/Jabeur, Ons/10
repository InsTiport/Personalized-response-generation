1-6, 6-2, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How do you describe that match?  
ONS JABEUR: Honestly, it's crazy match. I don't think I played really well. I don't think she played really well. It was kind of a lot of changing of momentum.   
I played really good, I mean, tennis first set. She played better second set. Then it was a tricky third set. She had more opportunity than me, that's for sure. I had one match point.   
A lot going in my mind right now, a lot of frustration. I'm a little bit disappointed. But it is what it is. It's tennis. It's going to hurt for a few days.   
Hopefully I can learn from it.   
 Q.  Playing in front of a crowd like that, a lot of fans for her, for you. What does it mean to play a match at that stage?  
ONS JABEUR: I was really stressed at the beginning to see them fighting who screams louder or who's better. At the same time, I mean, I was really happy because obviously she's Simona Halep, she's supposed to have more crowd than me. I thought it was equal for a point.   
I know it's amazing to see a match court like this with a lot of crowd screaming. Definitely for concentration was not easy. She's obviously more used to this than me.   
It's good first time to learn this for me.   
 Q.  You said it might take you a few days. Was there a specific point besides the match point, any key moments? After you broke and served for the match, what went through your mind?  
ONS JABEUR: Honestly, she played really good. I didn't even have time to think about that game. I knew it's going to be tricky. I mean, I don't think I will so much regret for this game. I served so bad the whole match. It's not like I served good but this one was worse.   
The only thing going to replay in my head is match point. Should have been patient more. But then the stress and everything, it wasn't really easy. Yeah, it's going to hurt for a few days, that's for sure.   
 Q.  You said before the match you have a new mentality where you enter a match like this and go for the win. Are you happy how much you fought?  
ONS JABEUR: Yeah, I mean, if it was last year, probably I would be happy because I made three sets against Simona Halep. Now I'm more angry because I didn't win the match. I know I could have. I know I had the level to.   
Unfortunately I didn't play my best tennis today. There is a lot of positive things in this match, but I feel like a lot of negativity right now, which is going to take time for me to be in a better spot I hope.
