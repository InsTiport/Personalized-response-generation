J. ISNER/D. Lajovic
7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 7-5
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Four sets but really tough.  Talk a little bit about it.
JOHN ISNER: It was a tough match.  Every time I've played him, it's always been tough.  I expected that tonight.  But I'm happy to get through in four sets.  I was out there for more than three hours.  It was a pretty long match.  All in all, I think physically I feel pretty good, so that's a good sign going forward.
Q. Very different conditions from the beginning of the week.  Did that have an effect on the way you played at all?
JOHN ISNER: I think the court maybe is playing a little bit slower, which I don't mind.  I like slow conditions actually.  But maybe not bouncing as high.  I would, of course, prefer the ball to bounce a little bit higher.  Still humid.  Went through a lot of shirts.  The temperature cooled off a lot.  I think all of us players appreciated that.
Q. Getting deeper into the tournament.  You also have home on your mind.  A player has been known to go home during a Grand Slam for a birth and come back.  Would you ever consider doing that?
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, I mean, if it worked out where I could get there and get back.  If it was the day of my match, not possible.
Q. No?
JOHN ISNER: I'm not going to miss the birth, but we'll see.  Again, I said before, can't control that.  We'll see what happens.
Q. Your thoughts on playing Milos, what you've seen from him so far in this tournament?
JOHN ISNER: I haven't really seen him play, but I've seen his results.  He seems to be playing very well.  I think back to his level of a few years past.  I mean, I have the utmost respect for him.  I think he's an excellent player, he's proved that his whole career.
It will be a tough match certainly.  We've played a handful of times.  Matches between us are inherently close, as you can imagine.  But we'll see what happens.
Q. When it comes to American tennis, who gets more shine, the men or women?
JOHN ISNER: Who gets more shine?
Q. Yes.
JOHN ISNER: Probably the women, but rightfully so.  They're better.  Their results have proven that.  Some of us break through and win a bunch of slams...  None of us are going to win 20-some slams like Serena.  On the American side of things, the women's side has so many good players.  Two legends still going right now, then Sloane and Madison right behind them.
The women.  As I said, rightfully so.
Q. You have a reputation for playing long matches.  Why do you shy away from that, especially --
JOHN ISNER: Why do I shy away from it?
Q. It seems like you do.  You said during the Anderson match you weren't thinking about Mahut.
JOHN ISNER: I don't know that I shy away from it.  I don't go out broadcasting it on my own.  I don't know.  I don't know how to answer that.  I don't think I can use it as an intimidation factor.  I don't think that would work on the players.
