 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
  Q. I assume you didn't know a thing about that guy.  
 JOHN ISNER: I didn't. I kind of knew what he liked to do like on the court. You know, my coach told me a couple little things, but not much.  
 With the way I play, it's more about, you know, what I have to do in the point instead of what my opponent does well or doesn't do so well.  
 So, I mean, I knew he was obviously playing well. I knew it was going to be a tough match. And it was.  
  
  Q. What went well for you in the match?  
 JOHN ISNER: I served well. I didn't get broken, so that helps. I was a little bit tired out there. I played a lot of matches in the last, you know, eight days or so. So I was a little bit tired. But once I was able to get that second set, I kind of felt relieved after that. And I felt a little better in the third set than I did in the second.  
  
  Q. Do you feel you're riding a confidence wave right now?  
 JOHN ISNER: Yeah. I am. I mean, that comes with winning. So the more matches I win, the more confident I'm gonna get. I've won seven in a row. I've never done that in my career. So this is a first.  
 Having tomorrow off will be real big for me. So, you know, hopefully I can in two days' time be ready to go and put forth a good effort out there.  
  
  Q. Will you do just a light hit tomorrow?  
 JOHN ISNER: I have a doubles match.  
  
  Q. Who are you playing with?  
 JOHN ISNER: Sam Querrey.  
  
  Q. I think, if I'm not wrong, you have Monfils next?  
 JOHN ISNER: Yes.  
  
  Q. You played him?  
 JOHN ISNER: Three times. I won 7-6 in the third. He won 6-3 in the third. I won 6-4 in the third. They've all been down to the wire.  
  
  Q. Just talk about that matchup, things that he does, what challenges that presents for your game.  
 JOHN ISNER: Just his athleticism, the way he can run down balls. The point's never over with him. No matter where you hit the ball, he's going to get the balls that you really don't think is humanly possible, but it is with him.  
 So I'm gonna have to serve well and I'm gonna have to get into the net. I probably don't want to get into long, extended rallies with him. So we'll see what happens.
