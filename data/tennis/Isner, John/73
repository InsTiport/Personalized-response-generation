A. MURRAY/J. Isner
6-3, 6-7, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.
Q. What did you do much better today than Vienna?  And you must have felt you were really in it right to the last minute.
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, pretty much everything.  You know, I knew I had to bring it today if I wanted any chance, because not often do you get to a stage in a tournament like this against a guy like that where he plays poorly or sort of gives you the match.  I knew that wasn't going to be the case.
I certainly did a lot of very good things out there.  I thought I have given Andy a few tough tussles throughout our careers.  I have never won, but that's why he's right now the greatest player in the world.
Q. Can you take satisfaction from taking him to 6-4 in the third?  Or did you get so close it's actually a bit of a disappointment?
JOHN ISNER: No, I can take satisfaction.  You know, it was very close.  I had a few opportunities, but really, you know, it's one set all.  He was the better player in the third set.  So, yeah, on the scoreboard it looks pretty close, but I guess it wasn't as close as it appeared.
It's a good week for me.  It's definitely disappointing.  You know, I certainly wasn't happy to be there today, getting to the finals, I wasn't happy about that.  I wanted to win, and I expected to win.  I just fell a little bit short.
Q. What's your assessment of your performances throughout this week and where your game is at right now?
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, my game is the best it's been all year, without a doubt.  There's no question about that.
So for me it's important to take this into the off-season and do all the right things.  Of course rest up and take care of myself.  Keep working hard and, you know, working smart, getting ready for next year and keep up this style of play.
Volleying incredibly well, better than I have ever volleyed.  The more I do it in practice, the more I do it in matches, the better I'm going to be.
So just keep that up, and I have the right team on my side.  I look forward to 2017.
Q. When you reflect on the game, there were a few chances.  I think you had six break points.  Would you say that's a frustrating thing for you?  Missed opportunities?
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, I had those break points in the second set, Love-40, and then another one, but I still won the set.  The first set -- the first break point he saved was pretty spectacular from him, but that's what he does.
So, yeah, I had some opportunities.  But, you know, I have played Andy a bunch and he always clamps down on me whenever I have a little bit of an opening out there.
He's a tough matchup for anyone, really, and especially me.  He does a lot so well, and he makes it tough for everyone.
Q. You spoke about how you see him hardworking on the circuit and when you're in the locker room he's going off and working hard.  Does he serve as an inspiration to you perhaps and the other players around?
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, he definitely does.  You know, he's the guy that everyone is looking up to right now.  And he's been at the top of the game for so long.  Whether it's 2, 3, 4 in the world, everyone knows how hard he works and how dedicated he is.
He's a big inspiration to myself, and I'm sure he's a big inspiration to other players, as well.
Q. When there is a "3" in the start of your age, obviously you're towards the end of your career.  How much tennis do you think you have left in you given that we're coming to the end of one year and starting another?
JOHN ISNER: That's a good question.  I think I have a lot of tennis left in me.  You see nowadays players playing very well into their 30s and mid-30s.
For me, I guess, fortunately, you know, my style of play, I'm not grinding too much out there, or at least I shouldn't be.  That's going to save me a bit.
But I consider myself to be in pretty good shape.  I know I do all the right things.  For being such a big guy, I have stayed incredibly healthy throughout my career, as well.  So I know what to do.
And of course I want to do this as long as I possibly can.  My career does have a shelf life to it.  So moments like this, playing out there, matches like this, is what makes it very, very special.  I hope to be in a big match like this again and in an atmosphere like that again.
Q. Djokovic has been top of the world rankings for 122 weeks in a row.  Do you think Murray has it in him to enjoy a similarly long run at the top?
JOHN ISNER: I do.  I mean, I think he does have that in him.  But it will be tough.  Novak sustained such an incredible level for so long, you know, and then Roger before him.  So we are in an era right now, it's pretty spectacular with these guys.  Everyone keeps upping the ante.  Right now it's Murray doing that.
So, you know, he achieved his goal of getting to No. 1.  I know he had that written down forever.  But I think his next goal is staying there for a very long time.
He's going to give everything he has to achieve that.
Q. Just to follow up on Murray, I mean, you know, three Grand Slam titles.  Considerably behind the other three.  But do you think that's an unfair reflection of his real ability?
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, I do.  I think -- I mean, I'm not great with the tennis stats.  I know he's made a lot of finals, as well.
Yeah, so, again, I mean, put him in any other era, he probably has more Grand Slams, but he's at the top of the game right now and he's going to give himself plenty more opportunity to win these big tournaments.
You know, as it looks right now, he'll be the favorite going into Melbourne.
