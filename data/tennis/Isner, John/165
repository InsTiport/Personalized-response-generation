R. STEPANEK/J. Isner
  6‑4, 6‑7, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Do you feel like your return let you down today?   Your serving seemed like it was okay. 
JOHN ISNER:   Yeah.   That and I just missed too much, so...   I didn't deserve to win that match at all.   I mean, no, it wasn't as close as the score looked. 

Q.   Are these the matches that are kind of your stumbling block?
JOHN ISNER:   I don't know.   I mean, it's just disappointing.   It wasn't a great effort.   I mean, you know, it wasn't a great match on my part, I should say. 
It's disappointing.   I wish I could have played better. 

Q.   What is next for you?   Where do you go? 
JOHN ISNER:   Valencia. 

Q.   Is it just different, too, being on other court, the center court? 
JOHN ISNER:   It's different, but it doesn't make any difference, so...   The court is the same. 

Q.   Can you put a finger on it?   You played pretty well here.   I guess today when you started the match, did you not feel that great?
JOHN ISNER:   No, I felt fine.   I mean, I feel fine.   Nothing's hurting.   I'm healthy.   I just was missing my shots, then I would scale back a little, that doesn't work.   I couldn't quite figure it out today. 

Q.   Got to put my NewZealand hat on.   Are you coming back to Auckland to play in January?
JOHN ISNER:   I'm not sure. 

Q.   Is it fair to say that maybe you prefer a slightly slower court surface than what is here?
JOHN ISNER:   Yeah, I do.   But, you know, that's just my personal preference.   It's not the reason I didn't play well.   But that's all right. 

Q.   You played long matches and tiebreaks.   Did you notice that?
JOHN ISNER:   Yeah, I noticed that. 

Q.   Why?
JOHN ISNER:   I just do.
