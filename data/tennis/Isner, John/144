  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   It's 10 years since Andy Roddick won the US Open, last American man to win a major.   What are your thoughts about that?   What do you think in terms of Andy's legacy is to you?
JOHN ISNER:   Well, it has been a long time, but I know and Andy knows and everyone knows how tough this game is today and how deep and international it is.
You know, the drought has been going on for quite some time now.   But really, I don't think about that too much at all.   I'm just very fortunate to play professional tennis.   I want to do it as long as I can. 
As Andy's legacy, he's a Grand Slam champion, and not many people can say that.   On top of that, he was the flag bearer for American tennis for so, so long it seemed like.   It seemed like 10 years. 
So he did a lot for our sport, you know.   And a lot of the guys currently, American guys currently playing today, look up to him.

Q.   How are you doing physically?   How are you feeling?
JOHN ISNER:   I'm feeling all right.   I feel nicked up a little bit, but I'm doing everything I can to get myself 100% ready to go for my firstâ€‘round match.   Still have a little ways to go. 
It's maybe cutting into my practice a little bit more than I would like, but at the same time, you know, I'm coming into this tournament playing pretty well, and I'm going to try to rely on that as much as I can. 

Q.   Your thoughts on the draw?   Did you see the draw yet?
JOHN ISNER:   Yeah.   I mean, I know who I play first round.   Everyone is good at this tournament.   I'm not good enough to forecast myself any further than the first round, so I'm just focusing on that.   Yeah.
