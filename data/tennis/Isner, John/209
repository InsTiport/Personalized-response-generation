 D. NALBANDIAN/J. Isner
  4-5 (ret.) 
   
  Q. John really bad luck. Tell us what happened on court?  
 JOHN ISNER: Yeah, just a routine -- second serve return, you know, it went into my body, so I moved to get out of the way, so I had to jump up for it.   
 Upon landing, my right foot just twisted really quick on the outside. That was it. I couldn't play after that.  
  
  Q. Tough to say now what it is. It feels bad obviously, it's hurting.   
 JOHN ISNER: It's hard to say. I feel like I did this least year in L.A., and I came back pretty quick. I don't think the US Open is in doubt. I didn't sprain it. I rolled it pretty good.  
 But in ten days' time I'll be fine.   
  
  Q. What are your plans? Getting some scans, see what it is, and rest for a couple of days?  
 JOHN ISNER: Yeah, tonight I'll get a scan, and then, yeah, rest and treat it.
