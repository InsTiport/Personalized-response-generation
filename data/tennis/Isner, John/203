  4-6, 6-4, 6-2, 6-1 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions.   
  
  Q. Rough start?   
 JOHN ISNER: Yeah, it was a rough start. He's tricky to play. He mixes it up, will dink the ball around. Up until 6-4, 5-4, the only thing I was doing was holding my serve. It was the only thing I could do at that point.   
 Then I started to play a little bit better. The point at 30-All, 5-4 in the second, was huge. That kind of got me going. I finally played a good point, took off from there.   
  
  Q. Did you think it was going to be as easy as that?  
 JOHN ISNER: No, I didn't. I mean, I definitely started playing better and putting more balls in the court. But, you know, I think he was having trouble with the shadows. It was really tough out there. Once the sun started going down it created some tricky shadows.   
 No, I didn't think it was going to be that easy. But, you know, I'll take it.   
  
  Q. Made a lot of errors, didn't he?  
 JOHN ISNER: He did. Whereas in the first two sets, really he didn't make any errors. The third and fourth was kind of littered with some. But, yeah, I was fortunate.   
  
  Q. What about next round? Is it Cilic?  
 JOHN ISNER: Yeah. He's obviously playing well. He's kind of steamrolled through his first two matches. He obviously likes playing here in Melbourne.   
 The game plan is going to be the same: just go out there and try to hold my serve early on, try to get into his serve games a little bit. But, you know, he's hitting well from the back and serving well. Just try to hold serve and keep pace with him and see what happens.   
  
  Q. What is your take on the Americans remaining: you, Andy and Venus, and Venus is injured?  
 JOHN ISNER: Well, on the women's side, I don't really have anything to say about that.   
 Yeah, me and Andy left. I mean, Mardy, you know, Robredo in the second round is a tough match. Sam lost a five-setter. Ryan lost to Nadal. It would be better if we had more than two left in the final 32.   
 But I think Andy has a good shot to do well here, and I also think I do. So I think we're both going to want to do a lot better than this, and it starts with him tomorrow. I'm just going to try to keep pace with him.
