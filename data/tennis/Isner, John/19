J. ISNER/K. Edmund   
7-6, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You were up in that first set and then you were down.  You know, is there a comfort zone here?  You have tinkered a little bit with the shade.  You have been on this court a lot now.  What are you thinking at this point?  
JOHN ISNER: Well, I really like center court.  I said that after I played my first match.  I appreciate the fact that I have played every match on there, and I think as long as I keep going, I'll probably stay on center court.   
So I really like the court.  I like the fact that the shade comes over it right around 2:00, but playing at 12:00 can be a bit tricky, because, you know, the top of the stadium is toying with the sun a little bit.  The sun is kind of half guarded, half out.   
It's pretty difficult.  I think it was difficult for both of us today.   
 Q.  A few weeks ago you told me you were a little bit nervous about this tournament based on the charm of Key Biscayne.  You said you sort of have to create new memories, especially as a defending champion.  Are you still feeling that way, or has it sunk in already?  
JOHN ISNER: No, I think it's sunk in.  I think all of the players on the ATP and WTA were a bit maybe, I guess, interested in how this tournament was going to turn out.   
For me, personally, I absolutely love it.  I think they have done an incredible job, and I think moving the tournament here has been a big success.  I think you can look at the weekend attendance records that this tournament has set this past weekend.  It's pretty amazing.  So all in all, they have done a great job here.   
 Q.  Have you ventured out at all to that sort of outdoor playground where people are sitting around on those chairs?  Have you been out there at all?  
JOHN ISNER: I have, yeah.  I didn't spend too much time out there, but I've seen it.   
 Q.  You're hard to miss when you go out there.  
JOHN ISNER: Exactly.  I have seen it.  It's kind of a similar feel to Indian Wells, also.  It's very cool.  I think the fans here are enjoying their time, as well, which is the most important.   
 Q.  Lastly, potentially Djokovic in the next round.  Do you want to talk about that a little bit?  
JOHN ISNER: Yes.  I have played him a bunch of times and have had some success.  Most of the times I haven't.  If I play him, it will be a huge challenge for me.  It will be a match that will be a lot of fun.   
 Q.  (Question off microphone.)  
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, that is tough.
