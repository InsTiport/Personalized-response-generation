6-7, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You're one of the few men to have reached the semifinals of Wimbledon.  When you are progressing in the rounds, do you feel any pressure that we haven't had a U.S. man win in a long time?  Do you feel the pressure you have to be the one?
JOHN ISNER: No, I don't feel that pressure.  I think maybe four or five years ago I may have felt that.  But right now I don't feel that pressure.  I mean, the Wimbledon match was tough.  I would have loved to have had a chance to win a Grand Slam.
Look, I'm proud of what I've accomplished in my career, in my career thus far.  I want to go as long as I possibly can.
To answer your question, I don't feel it.
Q. Venus and Serena now play each other in the third round.
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, wow.
Q. What goes through your mind when you think about matches between the two of them?
JOHN ISNER: Two of them?  Yeah, well, I don't know how many times they've played.  I know it's a lot.  We're not accustomed to seeing that matchup so early in a Grand Slam, in the third round.  But wow.  I had forgotten those two play each other.  Certainly is going to be out on Ashe at night.  It will be a good match.  Two of the greatest players ever.  They're going at it in the third round, so...
Pretty unique matchup.
Q. Do any particular memories come to mind when you think about them playing each other in the past that you've observed?
JOHN ISNER: Oh, no.  I mean, I know they've had some matches that maybe quite weren't as good.  It's tough.  You have two sisters playing each other.  That's rough.  They've had some other ones that were really good.  They played in the finals of Grand Slams.  They played in the final here how many times?  Is it more than once?
Q. I know in majors it's a 10-5 record for Serena.
JOHN ISNER: In finals?
Q. In majors.
JOHN ISNER: Overall?
Q. Yes.
JOHN ISNER: I can't single out one particular match.  I think everyone involved would like another good match in a few days from them.
Q. What do you imagine the psychology must be like for siblings to go against each other the way they do?
JOHN ISNER: Oh, it's very tough.  I mean, I can only speak from playing my brother in pickup tennis growing up in North Carolina.  But those two, I don't really consider them a rivalry.  They're best friends, so...  In my opinion, I could be wrong, it's not a rivalry.  I don't think those two really enjoy playing each other, which could be the case.
But, you know, it's inevitable, of course, with how long they've both played and how successful they've both been.  It will be a good one in a few days.
Q. What was it about having your back against the wall tonight that seemed to bring out the best in you?
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, tonight, it was a struggle.  Really from the get-go.  I mean, he played well.  He served well.  I had chances.  Five breakpoints at 3-All in the fifth.  Disappointing not to break there.  But I just kept plugging away.
The fifth set was far and away the best I played the whole match.  So that's pretty encouraging, I think.  It was a struggle at times, but I'm happy to get through.
Q. The last 10 months was one of the greatest runs in your career.  Do you give any importance to your marriage, private life, to this?
JOHN ISNER: I do.  Of course, everything that I do in practice, in the gym, that of course helps.  But that doesn't necessarily keep you relaxed on the court.  I think being married, being very grounded in my personal life, does help.  I mean, there were times out there on the court today, I was like, Well, this doesn't go the right way, I'll go home tomorrow and be with my wife, who is very pregnant.
Look, it does help a lot.  I think it helped out there tonight.
Q. How would you describe your sense of belief in yourself right now versus previously in your career?
JOHN ISNER: I've always had pretty good self-belief.  This year in particular.  It helps having good results coming into this tournament.  I certainly turned things around in Miami.  Since then I thought I've kept my foot on the gas pedal pretty well and have played pretty solid since Miami.
I'm certainly very confident.  I've had a very good year.  I mean, probably the best year of my career.  Doing that at 33 is pretty cool.
