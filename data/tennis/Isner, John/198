 J. ISNER/M. Baghdatis
  7-6, 7-6, 2-6, 6-4 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions for John.   
  
  Q. What was it like playing an opponent that is so animated like Baghdatis? Does that change preparation?  
 JOHN ISNER: No, it just makes it more fun, quite simply. He's always been a crowd favorite. He's just such a good guy and a good competitor. He just has fun out there. You can tell, you know, he plays tennis for the fun of the game.   
 So, you know, it was the third time I played him this summer. We've had three competitive matches, so it's always fun playing him.   
  
  Q. Going up against a fellow American, Ginepri, in the second, is that more special because you're playing in the US Open on American soil?  
 JOHN ISNER: Yeah, you know, it's going to be an interesting match. The last time I played an American here was maybe Andy, if I'm correct, in 2009.   
 So it will be a lot of fun. I know the crowd will be split down the middle probably. Two Americans.   
 He's a good friend of mine, so I expect a good, clean match.
