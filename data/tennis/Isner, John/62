6-7, 7-6, 5-7, 7-6, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. That was a long match, but I guess you're used to long matches.  How are you feeling right now?  It was tough out there.
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, I'm very, very disappointed right now.
Q. Do you feel in certain things you needed more practice or something would have helped you?
JOHN ISNER: No.  It's all between the ears, I think.  I had opportunities, of course.  When I don't go for it, bad things happen.  That was the case throughout the whole match, me not going for it.  That's why I lost.
Q. You're still leading in aces, something like 70 aces.  Your serve was great.  How were the conditions out there?
JOHN ISNER: It was hot.
Q. You played him four times before?
JOHN ISNER: I don't know how many times I played him.
Q. Was there anything in his game that troubled you?
JOHN ISNER: No.  Look, he won the match fair and square, of course.  But, I mean, I knew what to expect from him.
As I said, I didn't go for my shots at all the whole match.  So that cost me.
