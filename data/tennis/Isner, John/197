  7-5, 5-7, 7-6

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. What do you take away from a really tough loss like this, a very close match?
 JOHN ISNER: Yeah, it was close. I don't feel like I played too well, to be honest, but I'll just put it behind me and just, you know, not think too much of it. Try not to let it bother me too much.
 I get to go home now, so...

 Q. Take us through the point construction: 40-30, 4-5 in the third set. I think it was a key moment of that match where you moved him around a lot and had a variety more so than normal. 
 JOHN ISNER: I have no clue what you're talking about.

 Q. I'm talking about the point construction when you were up 40-30, 4-5 in the third set. 
 JOHN ISNER: Oh, okay, I think I remember. 

 Q. You moved him around a lot, more so than usual. Was that reactive? Planned? 
 JOHN ISNER: Yeah, I mean, it's planned. I was hitting forehands and they were finding the court. A lot of my shots weren't finding the court today. So I had him on the run and he made some good gets, but I was in control of the points.
 So, I mean, that's that. 

 Q. You mentioned you're going to be going home. What's the game plan between now and the Open?
 JOHN ISNER: I'm going North Carolina, so...

 Q. Okay. 
 JOHN ISNER: I playing Winston-Salem because I'm from there, so...
