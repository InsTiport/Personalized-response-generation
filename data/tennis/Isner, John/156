M. CILIC/J. Isner
  6‑3, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Few points here and there, could have turned it around, couldn't you?
JOHN ISNER:   Yeah, probably, but I just made too many errors, especially on my forehand side.   I mean, it felt like every ball that he made I then missed with my forehand.   That's what it felt like out there.
I know I had a lot of unforced errors, and that's just ‑‑it's too hard to win if I missed too many shots like that.
I don't know the stats, but I can't imagine, you know‑‑ points that I won on my second serve had to be bad.   He got the return back; I would miss a forehand.   That's what it felt like.
So I think honestly it's just technically things I need to work on.   You know, I'm a big guy.   Missing that many shots, it's probably from getting too high up and I'm not staying in the saddle.
So it's something I need to key in on and really work on.

Q.   You had way more winners than he did, and obviously way more aces, but that didn't translate into winning the match for you. 
JOHN ISNER:   No, you know, doesn't always translate that way.   A lot more winners, a lot more unforced errors, just as I said before. 
I mean, I want to play a match ‑‑most of my matches I will have more unforced errors than my opponent.   I'm fine with that, but not to that degree out there tonight.

Q.   So what's the plan?   Go back and train a bit?
JOHN ISNER:   Yeah, I'm not tired.   I'm not physically tired; I'm not mentally tired. 
I'm healthy.   Go back, train, and try to get my ass in gear for Davis Cup.
That's a big task for our team, a big task for me.

Q.   Do you like the idea of going to small towns for tennis, or would you rather be in a big city?
JOHN ISNER:   No, I like the smaller towns personally.
