J. ISNER/M. Ilhan
  6-3, 6-4, 7-6

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. When you're playing somebody who doesn't have as much firepower like you, do you feel like the match is in your hands more so than usual?
 JOHN ISNER: Uhm, yeah, a little bit. I'm holding serve easier than he is. That puts a lot more pressure on him. And I think maybe it kind of showed a little bit today because I was able to, the first two sets, get that one break I needed. Also got it in the third. But credit to him, he kept fighting back. He broke back. 
 But I know, you know, if I went to a tiebreaker in the third set, I was really confident because I've been playing really well in them. 

 Q. I know you're coming back from having mono. Are you feeling 100%? 
 JOHN ISNER: I am. About six weeks ago was my first tournament back. I felt pretty good, not great. Now I think I've gotten a little bit stronger as each week has come on, so... 

 Q. You said in the last press conference your immediate goal is to get into the top 50. That's going to happen after this tournament. Now that that is the case, what is your next immediate goal?
 JOHN ISNER: You know what, I haven't really made one for that. Maybe I'll sit down and think about it. I know the fall's gonna be real important for me. I was pretty much hurt all of last fall, so I don't really have much anything to defend. Gonna be playing all ATP tournaments, indoor tournaments. That's a chance to even get my ranking up even more. 
 If I had to guess right now, my goal would be to try to get seeded in Australia. 

 Q. So far this seems to be a great tournament for American tennis. American men's tennis is making a comeback or improving? 
 JOHN ISNER: I think so. I think this is a tournament that most guys want to do well in. We're gearing up for this tournament all summer long, really putting 100% of our focus into this one. You want to do well here. This is the surface most of us, you know, excel at. 
 I don't think it's any surprise -- I don't know. We already have like four people through to the round of 32, is that right? That's a good number. 

 Q. The match hasn't played yet, but in all likelihood you'll play Andy Roddick in the third round. You played him in D.C. this summer. What did you learn from that match that you can apply?
 JOHN ISNER: That's something that I will -- you know, that's something for my coach to come up with. He saw that match. Basically he kind of wore me down in that third set against him. I was exhausted and he was fresh. He's just in such great shape. He's in better shape than me. I'm not going to lie. 
 I think right off the bat, this is if I play him, I don't want to get in long, extended rallies with him because he's in such great shape and he's hitting the ball so well from the back. Maybe keep the points shorter and get in a little bit more and attack. I think that will help me out a lot. 

 Q. I know you're playing doubles with Sam Querrey. How is that working out? Make a good team? 
 JOHN ISNER: Yeah. We're in the second round tomorrow. Yeah, I mean, we serve really big, so we're going to hold serve a lot. I feel like we return pretty well also. We have a lot of fun out there. Hopefully we can do well here.
