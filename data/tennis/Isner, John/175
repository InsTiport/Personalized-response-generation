  7‑6, 6‑2 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How did you feel you played?  
JOHN ISNER:   I was happy with how I played.   I was not happy with how I played at 5‑4 and 6‑5 in the second set.   You know, I think I had six set points there and I didn't win any of them.   I played way too passive, just didn't go for my shots.   At this level you can't do that.   
I don't think the first set should have gone to a tiebreaker.   I think I had a lot of chances to win it earlier.   But I played a good tiebreaker.   From that point on it took a lot of pressure off of me.   
I played a very, very good second set.   I was very happy with that.  
   
 Q.   How did you find the atmosphere today and what do you think of it so far?  
JOHN ISNER:   It's great.   First time I played on a show court here.   I never played on Centre Court, I never played on Court1.   
I like that court a lot.   I think it's a very good court.   The atmosphere is great.   You know, it's special.   You're at Wimbledon, you get to play on one of the big courts.  
   
 Q.   Are you feeling pretty patriotic here?  
JOHN ISNER:   Uh‑huh, yeah.   I mean, this tournament, I'm not playing for myself, you know.   I'm playing for my teammates, and most of all I'm playing for my country.   I am feeling patriotic.   
   
 Q.   Looking ahead a little bit, with this tournament wedged in the way it is to the calendar, what do you anticipate at the US Open?   Do you think it's going to be a little more unpredictable, late change to hard court?   What do you anticipate?  
JOHN ISNER:   That's a good question.   
I don't think so.   I think guys are going to come into the Open as rested as possible.   
As far as changing to hard court, I've always found it that from whatever surface to hard court is the easiest change.   You know, if we were on hard going to grass, that would be a little bit different.   Hard court is the easiest court to adjust to.   
I think once the Open rolls around, guys will be very comfortable on that court.   But, you know, there's three huge events after that one.   There's two Masters Series and the US Open.   Guys are going to try to conserve energy as much as they can.   It's going to be a critical next month or so.   
   
 Q.   Do you change your schedule at all?  
JOHN ISNER:   No.   I'm playing all the way through.   I'm playing the tournament in North Carolina before the US Open.   But for me, that doesn't feel like I'm on the road.   That's where I'm from.   I was born there.   I stay at my parents' house.   I get spoiled by my mom.   
I played it last year and I won it.   It was good preparation.   I don't feel like I'm on the road when I'm there, so it's nice.   
   
 Q.   You were talking the first set.   Could you pinpoint any reason why it went up and down a little bit?  
JOHN ISNER:   No.   You know, I played well, especially at 5‑4, to get to 15‑40.   Then I just played passively after that.   It's stupid of me.   I can't afford to do that.   I'm not going to win running side to side trying to scrap out a point.   That's not how I'm going to win matches.   That's not how I need to win big points either.   Did that at 5‑4 and the same thing at 6‑5.   
I think when my next match rolls around, if the opportunity arises, I'm going to have to play a lot better.   
   
 Q.   As you were talking about playing on that show court, have you ever been inside that court before?   Was it as made out as it was cracked up to be?  
JOHN ISNER:   I know what you mean (smiling).   
No, I've never been on there.   When I first entered the court, I didn't know whether to go right or left.   I had to ask someone.   
It's a nice court.   I enjoyed it very much.   It was my first time ever on there.   I've always been relegated to the outside courts.   I would prefer my next match be on that court.   I don't know if it will be, but I wouldn't mind that.
