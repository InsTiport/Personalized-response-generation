THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
   
 Q. Your impressions of the match?  
JOHN ISNER: It was‑‑ you know, I thought he played pretty well, better than me, so that's all there is to it.   
   
 Q. It's tough to play a friend, obviously. Also just, you know, wondering about that and how your body is feeling in general.   
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, no, it's tough, but, you know, it's going to happen a lot. It's something everyone deals with.  
   
 Q. That you're not 100%?  
JOHN ISNER: No, that you're going to play a friend. That's that.   
   
 Q. The body? How are you feeling again?  
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, I have definitely felt better before. You know, that's the thing. You know, you put some good weeks together. It can put you in a bit of a deficit, you know, the following week.   
But regardless, it's disappointing to lose. I definitely have time to rest up and regroup and get stronger, whatnot now. But, you know, I wish I wasn't out so early from here.  
   
 Q. What did you feel wasn't working so great for you today?  
JOHN ISNER: He had a lot to do with it. He played well and served well and, you know, put more pressure on me than I did on him.  
   
 Q. Will you rethink at all playing next week?  
JOHN ISNER: No. I'm not playing next week.  
   
 Q. You're definitely not playing next week?  
JOHN ISNER: No.  
   
 Q. That's a done deal?  
JOHN ISNER: Uh‑huh.  
   
 Q. You're gonna rest up and...   
JOHN ISNER: Uh‑huh.  
   
 Q. ...practice?   
JOHN ISNER: Uh‑huh. Yeah, it's a bit different preparation going to the Open this year than years past. Two years ago I made the finals here, you know, and then last year I played in Winston but pulled out.  
But we will see how it goes.  
   
 Q. What's most important to you heading to NewYork at this point?  
JOHN ISNER: I'm not thinking about it, honestly. I want to get away from tennis for a little bit. I have played a lot of matches, so it's two weeks away.  
   
 Q. Will you go home?  
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, I will. I'm not going to stay here. As much as I love it here, I won't stay here.   
   
 Q. Football, precollege football, barbecues?  
JOHN ISNER: Yeah. I will take it easy, you know, at night certainly, but I'm not going to ‑‑I will be back in the gym tomorrow doing some stuff to try to get stronger or try to get healthier. There is always things can you do.   
When I say rest, that doesn't mean sit on the couch, because that's‑‑ that does make things worse.   
   
 Q. Can you give me a couple of thoughts on Mardy? He's going to finish up in NewYork, obviously a former top 20 guy. When you see his career and his legacy in American tennis, what do you think about it?  
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, he had a bright career and bright moments and some moments that he would ‑‑ with the health issues that he's had that were very difficult for him. I think he would say the same.   
But more importantly than all that, he's been a good friend of all of us, good friend to his peers, like Andy and James, and then the guys a little bit younger than him, myself, Sam.   
He was a good guy to have around in the locker room, funny guy. Kind of shoot the S‑h‑i‑t with him. Just a good guy to have around. It will be different without him in the locker room, but got a few more tournaments left.  
   
 Q. How much were you watching those guys, Roddick and Blake, Ginepri and Fish when they were coming into their own in '04 or '05?  
JOHN ISNER: Not that much, actually. I was more watching college football when I was at Georgia. Then I got to know them after that and they were great guys.  
   
 Q. What do you like about Sam's game?  
JOHN ISNER: I mean, I don't know. He serves well. He hits his forehand well.  
   
 Q. How long have you played doubles with him?  
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, we play doubles a lot. We get along very well.
