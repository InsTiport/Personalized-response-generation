J. ISNER/R. Federer
  7‑6, 3‑6, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please. 

Q. Well played. 
JOHN ISNER: Thank you. 

Q. You had 6‑2 in the deciding tiebreak. Gets back to 6‑5 serving. What do you think then? Did you get any more nervous than you had been?
JOHN ISNER: No, I was still confident. It's different, you know, 6‑5 serving rather than returning. So I still had confidence in my serve. I was able to put a first serve in, and that was it. 
It was a great match for me and a good one to win. It was a lot of fun.

Q. What sort of decision you make? You went for the wide one to the backhand? Why did you do that?
JOHN ISNER: If you know me, you know that that's my favorite serve. It's sort of one of those things, a lot of people know I'm going there. Catch it if you can. It's like a pitcher with a fast ball, I guess.

Q. Ivani?evic once said that you think it's easy to hit these big serves. It isn't, especially not in the big points. How much confidence do you have on those big points that you know you will find what you need?
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, I have a lot of confidence. It's certainly my best shot, no doubt about that. It's a shot I have hit a million times. A lot of reps, and I have played a lot of matches in my career now. I have been in that situation before. Maybe not depends a guy like Roger, but I have been in that situation before. 
I told myself to go for it. That's all I really could do. Try to rear back and hit my best serve. 

Q. You also hit a great backhand volley on break point. 
JOHN ISNER: Yeah.

Q. That was a very big point. Roger looked in good touch there. 
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, that arguably saved the match for me. If he goes up a break, things probably don't look good for me. That was a very big volley for sure. One that I'm glad I came up. I missed a volley on break point in the second set that I would like to have back. I guess it evened out. I missed an easy one and made a tough one, so...

Q. Where does this rank in your best wins?
JOHN ISNER: It's up is there, for sure. I don't know off the top of my head. It's certainly top 5, I would say. 
This is a very big tournament. He's an incredible player, obviously. My favorite player and the greatest of all time, my opinion. It was a huge win for me. I'm very proud I was able to get it done.

Q. Any word about playing Ferrer tomorrow? 
JOHN ISNER: I haven't played him in a few years. I can't remember the last time I played him. I played him here once, actually, I think four years ago or something. It's been a while since I have played him. That's sometimes how it works out. You play a lot of the top guys, three, four times a year. Some you never play. 
This will be a tough challenge for me. I know going in he's never going to give up and he's always going to fight. He's an incredible player with an unbelievable work ethic, and he's earned everything he's ever gotten. It will be a fun match.

Q. You have a sparkle about you. We haven't always seen that. Are you always in as good of place as you have always been?
JOHN ISNER: Thank you (smiling). 
Yeah, I mean, I'm in a good place. I have nothing to complain like with anything, tennis, life, whatever. Everything is peaches for me right now. It's nice. I'm very lucky to play professional tennis. A lot of good friends and family. Healthy. A lot to be thankful for. 
I guess I can't really, if I look at it that way, there is nothing to be mad about or sad about.
