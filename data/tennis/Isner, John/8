Q. Massive congratulations. That was obviously a huge win, not just for yourself but obviously for the team, as well. At a set and 4-3 down things weren't looking too promising.
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, they weren't. I wasn't making any inroads on his serve at all. He was the better player for, you know, 85% of that match. Of course I got a little lucky there at 4-All, but once I got up 5-4, I had a lot of momentum and I think I showed that in the tiebreaker.
Q. Team World have had a few tough losses in Prague and in Chicago, yourself obviously in the match tiebreakers as well in some of the singles obviously against Dominic Thiem, Sascha in Chicago, and Roger. Was any of that going through your mind?
JOHN ISNER: Of course. Against Sascha last year in Chicago, I think he beat me 10-7, and then last year in Chicago, I think Roger beat me 10-7, so maybe we are turning the tables just a little bit.
It's 3-All. Team World is in this, and we're here to win. So let's get it going.
Q. Obviously everybody in this stadium looking forward to watching Roger take on Nick. As a tennis player yourself, is that the kind of matchup that you love?
JOHN ISNER: Oh, of course. This is the marquee matchup of the event so far. On one side you have Nick. On the other side you have Mr. Switzerland, Roger Federer.
So it's going to be an incredible match. All of us are in for a treat here. I can't wait to watch it.
