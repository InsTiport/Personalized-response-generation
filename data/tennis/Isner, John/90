A. MURRAY/J. Isner
7-6, 6-4, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Obviously a long first set tiebreak.  Thoughts on how that obviously was a big turning point in the match?
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, I think it could have been a little bit different if I won that set.  I had it on my racquet at 6-5 serving.  I had a short forehand, too, and didn't do anything with it.  I hit it right back to him and he passed me up the line, because he's No. 2 in the world, and that's what he does.  I didn't take advantage of that opportunity right there.
It was a bit deflating, but, you know, I felt good coming out of the rain delay.  Felt fine.  Just he was much better than me today.  That's why he is where he is.
Q. How much did you feel like the conditions played a role today?  Did you feel like you were kind of fighting against them and him?
JOHN ISNER: No, no.  The conditions were fine.  You know, if it's faster conditions, I don't know if the result is any different.  There is certainly no complaints about that.  He's tough on any surface.
Q. First set could have changed things, but that court, Milos lost to Ramos, the heavy ball is bad for the servers, in general?
JOHN ISNER: Maybe.  But I feel like I served pretty well today, and I was frustrating him a little bit on my serve even in the heavy conditions with the balls pretty heavy.
Again, I don't think the conditions had much to do with it.  I have lost to Andy on every surface, really (smiling).  It's fine.  It was no big deal.
Q. You already talked about your plans for the rest of the summer and not playing the Olympics.  Is the Davis Cup against Croatia in the cards?  If it is, can you make some comment about that?
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, if Jim selects me, I'm going to be playing that Davis Cup tie, for sure.  I guess it's coming up pretty soon.  You know, it's after Wimbledon, something I'm looking forward to, considering how well our team did in the first round against Australia.
It's been a few years since we have been in the quarterfinals, and we have a home tie, so it's going to be very exciting.
Again, if I'm selected, I hope I am, I'll be there.  I'll be ready to go.  I'm looking forward to it.
Q. On the Olympic note, what kind of feedback have you gotten from folks?  I understand your reasons.  Little unusual for a top player from a country not to play the Olympics.  What has the feedback been, inside tennis, outside tennis?
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, I think it's been mixed.  I think I would say 70 to 80% probably negative feedback I have received.  The other 20% people have recognized my feelings on it.
But I respect both sides of it, certainly.  You know, I have been told unpatriotic.  I don't think it's that.  I don't consider myself that at all.
But I have explained my reasonings on why I'm not going to the Olympics, and again, it wasn't a surefire thing, Oh, I'm definitely not playing the Olympics.  I thought through it a lot.
Q. You're on the Player Council now.  A few of the other players have talked about the no ranking points being a point.  Do you think it was a mistake not to offer them?
JOHN ISNER: I do.  I personally lobbied for points in the Olympics.  I know in 2012 we had points, and I didn't think it was enough points still.
I can't recall exactly.  I think I made the quarterfinals, and it was like 120 points.  I think still I should have gotten more for that.
But now, no points, you know.
So again, as I said earlier, it was a very, very big factor in my decision.
Q. On that same topic, did anybody try to persuade you not to skip them and to go to Rio, fellow players or anybody in the USTA?
JOHN ISNER: No, it was my decision, solely.  No, I had no persuasion one way or the other.
Yeah, it was, again, it's not without precedent, either.  I believe Andy didn't play in 2008 and Mardy in 2012.  So again, that's not a reason why I'm not going, but it has happened before.
Q. Switching back to today's match, just wondering, Andy Murray, how you would rate his return game?  Is he as effective a returner as you have faced or are there others you would put above him?
JOHN ISNER: Oh, he's up there, for sure.  I mean, I can say -- I guess you could say maybe Novak is a little bit better than him, if that.
I think he's got an uncanny ability to get his racquet on the ball somehow, and after that, he's so athletic and quick and anticipates so well and moves so well.
He's arguably the best defender in the game.  He showed that a bit today, as well.  It's not necessarily just his return.  It's everything after that.  It's his ability to get balls back in play, and he's a gifted guy.
Q. You said the other day that you were desperate to break through and get to another quarterfinals.  I'm wondering if after today you feel it's kind of a bang your head against the wall kind of moment or get back to work kind of moment?
JOHN ISNER: I believe it's more of a get back to work.  It's disappointing.  I would have liked to have had that forehand back at 6-5 in the tiebreaker.  I think I went with option D there (laughter).  A, B, and C would have been better.
But I do think I did turn a corner on my season this week, considering how I was down and out in my first-round match.  So I'm leaving this tournament with positive feelings going forward in my year here in 2016.
So it's not going to be a somber ride back to the States for me, whereas a lot of times this year I have left the tournament with a very bad taste in my mouth.  It's not so much that this week.
Q. Looked like you played really well today.  Do you think you might have just been knocked out by potentially the finalist or someone who can actually go on and win this tournament?
JOHN ISNER: Oh, no, for sure, I was beaten by a better player, no doubt.  That's why he's No. 2 in the world.  That's why I'm whatever in the world.  He showed that today.
I played already.  I'm not disappointed in that.  I could have done obviously a few things better.  I think Andy would say he could have done a few things better out there.
Yeah, he's playing very well, playing well on this surface.  I think he proved that leading up to this event, winning Rome and making the finals of Madrid.
It was a tough task for me, for sure.  But that's what happens when you get to the second week of Grand Slams and I'm seeded where I'm seeded.  I'm going to have to run up against guys like him, and I didn't have the goods today.
Q. Change this year in Davis Cup about adding a fifth-set tiebreak.  You're somebody who has experience in that region of matches.  What do you think of that rule?
JOHN ISNER: No, I like it.  I'll always lobby for that.  I had no idea of that rule, actually, until the day before our team press conference or whatever.  Someone was asked about that, and I didn't even know in Australia.  I like it.
But this week I did win a five-setter that wasn't long and drawn out, which I'm pretty happy about.  But if I had any say, I would choose a tiebreaker (smiling).
