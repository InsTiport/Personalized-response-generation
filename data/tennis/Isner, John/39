J.M. DEL POTRO/J. Isner
6-4, 6-4, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Obviously, just one break each set in the match.  What do you think wasn't able to keep you from getting broken and getting more looks or converting, I guess, the looks you had on his serve?
JOHN ISNER: I don't know.  I guess I just wasn't quite comfortable out there.
I think early on in the match he kind of came out a little bit slow.  If I could have played a little bit better early on, maybe I could have settled down.
So it was a case of me not really being able to settle down and him doing the opposite and getting more comfortable out there.
So certainly I was outplayed by a large margin today.  So it's a little disappointing.
Q. Still are you satisfied with your run here?  Is it a satisfying trip for you or not so much?
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, I mean, it's better than going out early.  But, I mean, if I would have lost today, I would have liked to maybe put up a better fight.  So that's a little disappointing, yeah.
Q. And, obviously, he has such a great forehand.  Could you just take a moment and maybe compare his forehand, very different strokes, with Roger and Rafa?  Or just for you, what do you think the top forehand in the men's game is?
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, Delpo certainly has one of the best forehands in the world, especially when he's feeling it out there.  And if he's able to get in position and take a rip at that shot, it's going to be very lethal.
So it's very good for tennis to have him playing well again and being healthy.
Q. Can you compare and contrast it with Roger and Rafa?  Pretty different strokes?
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, I mean, Rafa is a lefty and hits it up over his head.  Juan's is a little flatter.
I'm not in the mindset right now to dissect strokes right now.  Sorry.
Q. You played your first three matches all on the same court.  Did that sort of put you in a groove and then was it tough to move over to a different court?  I don't know what your mindset is like on that.
JOHN ISNER: No, I don't think so.  I think that's a little bit overrated, getting used to a court or I hadn't stepped on that court this year.  That had nothing to do with it.
And I think he played a match or two on that court, but I don't think that had anything to do with it.
Q. Are you staying over here?  Are you going home?  What is your schedule?
JOHN ISNER: Oh, I'm going home.  Yeah, not staying over.
Q. Are you playing?
JOHN ISNER: I'm entered in Halle, yeah.
Q. Entered meaning you're not sure you're playing?
JOHN ISNER: No.  It means that's where I'm scheduled to play.
Q. Do you follow a pretty good athlete from Carolina?  Steph Curry?
JOHN ISNER: Who is that?
Q. Steph Curry.
JOHN ISNER: Who is that?
Q. He's the basketball player for the Golden State.
JOHN ISNER: I have never heard of him.
Q. Okay.
JOHN ISNER: I'm kidding.  No, of course.
Yeah, he's incredible.  His highlights last night were absurd.
He's from Charlotte and played college ball in Charlotte.  And just a little mad the Hornets weren't able to get him.  But he's setting some records out there in Golden State.
Q. Would you like him to become a Panther owner?
JOHN ISNER: Yeah.  I mean, I guess if -- it's up to David Tepper if he wants to open it up to other people.  You know, if Steph wanted to buy a little piece of that, that would be pretty cool, yeah.
Q. Could I ask you, you might not be in the mood for this, but looking forward to the U.S. Open, it's the 50th anniversary.  Is there one particularly either memorable or quirky or different or meaningful, whatever, moment that -- your favorite moment at the U.S. Open for you?
JOHN ISNER: Like me personally?  That I was involved in?
Q. Yeah.
JOHN ISNER: I think I had one of the latest match finishes of all time, like, 2:30 something in the morning.  I lost, but I was a part of that.
It was 2:00-something.
Q. 2:26.
JOHN ISNER: 2:26 -- there you go, Ben -- in the morning.  So set some record for length and stuff.
Q. How many people were watching?
JOHN ISNER: It was a decent amount.
But losing in five sets at 2:30 in the morning is rough.  It kills your body.  I felt terrible the next day.
Q. Who took you down?
JOHN ISNER: I lost to Kohlschreiber.
