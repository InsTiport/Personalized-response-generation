THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
   
 Q.   John, a good win for you today.   Talk about how you were able to turn it around and get that three‑setter.   
JOHN ISNER:   The second set went by pretty quick.   At a certain point I guess I just decided I wanted to conserve my energy a little bit.   I knew I was going to be serving first in the third set.   I was ahead early on in that third set.   I was eventually able to really get ahead and close the match out.   
Had a lot of adrenaline towards the end of that match and it helped.   
   
 Q.   How has the swing through China been for you, travel‑wise, off court?   It's comfortable, good?  
JOHN ISNER:   Yeah, everything is great.   Beijing was great last week.   I had a pretty good tournament.   Got my tail kicked in the quarters.   But I'm playing pretty well.   I'm still alive here.   I'm glad I'm not on a flight home tomorrow.   
It's all good.   You know, playing better away from the States is something I'm always trying to do and I feel like it's something I've done so far.   
   
 Q.   How did you see the speed of the court?  
JOHN ISNER:   I thought it was a good speed.   To me, I feel like it's slower than last year.   I could be wrong.   I don't know.   But I feel like it's slower than last year.   I prefer that.   
I thought the court was great, very nice.   The speed certainly wasn't too fast or too slow.   Happy medium.   
   
 Q.   Do you prefer slower because the ball bounces higher?  
JOHN ISNER:   Yeah.   That and it gives me more time, being so big.   I got some big swings and stuff.   
I feel like my serve is my serve.   I feel like I can hold my serve no matter whether the court's slow or super fast.   It helps me in other areas if the court is slower.   
   
 Q.   Steve has to win his first‑round match first, but you could play him in the second round.   Your thoughts on his season, how he's been able to improve.   
JOHN ISNER:   It's no surprise to me.   When he left college, kind of I guess on like a similar path as me.   He left college and did really well out of the gate, then he sort of struggled after that.   
This time last year he was horrible.   He'll tell you the same thing.   He was losing first round in challengers.   It was more of a mental thing for him.   He's so talented.   He's a very, very good player.   It's not surprising to me he's gotten his ranking up very high for only being on tour for two years.   
I'll certainly be rooting for him tomorrow.   It will be interesting to play him.   You don't expect to travel this far and play another American, but that could be the case.   I hope it happens.
