THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Was it a late decision for you to come here?  
JOHN ISNER:   I asked for a wild card before I knew‑‑ well, obviously, I didn't know I was going to win the tournament last week.   But I knew that I just felt something, you know, really right after I won my first match in Houston.   I felt like I was starting to play better finally.   And I wasn't tired at that point.   
So, you know, I asked for a wild card to come here.   And it was one of those things that, you know, if Houston didn't go too great, then I would be able to come here and have a little bit of time to prepare and give myself a good shot to do well at a big event like this.   
And if Houston does go well, then it's sort of not a bad problem to have, I'd just sort of try to manage it.   And that was the case.   
I just got beat today.   
   
 Q.   Was it a fatigue thing, because you won the first set?   He started dropshotting a lot.   
JOHN ISNER:   He did.   He didn't do it like crazy amounts.   But I think he started to play better.   You know, I didn't have that much on my serve.   I felt like, you know, a lot of times I can serve a little bigger and a little better than I did.   
I'm not trying to make excuses, but, yeah, I was a little tired.   That's to be expected.   But at the same time, you know, I won the first set.   I don't know, I think it was 2‑All or something and I just sort of fell apart.   I went to sleep for a good bit.   And it was a little too late to come back.   
   
 Q.   You had a massage on the court at one point.   
JOHN ISNER:   Yeah.   My hip was bothering me a little.   It's nothing other than the muscle fatigue or soreness or whatever.   But it bothered me a little bit.   
   
 Q.   Winning on clay must have given you a bit of confidence anyway for not just this tournament but further on.   
JOHN ISNER:   Yeah.   It was my first‑ever clay court win.   At the same time I've had some good wins on clay before.   It's a surface that, you know, I try not to shy away from.   I think I'm pretty decent on it.   
I'm looking forward to the rest of this clay court season.   I'm going to go home though now ‑ quick trip (smiling) ‑ and rest and train and then come back over.   
   
 Q.   Play Madrid?  
JOHN ISNER:   Uh‑huh.   
   
 Q.   Just a question away from tennis.   How shaken were you by the events yesterday in Boston?  
JOHN ISNER:   It's crazy.   I forget at what point I found out.   It was probably 9:00, 10:00 this time.   It was just like I was on espn.com or something.   They obviously even showed it or had news about it.   It's just crazy.   
I hope whoever was behind it gets caught.   Any new developments?   It's just horrible to see that there are monsters like that out there really.   People like that, unfortunately, all over the world and in the U.S.   
   
 Q.   You have an interesting kind of game.   Sometimes you don't have too much room for mistakes.   Houston must have given you a lot of confidence.   You have a new coach also, right?  
JOHN ISNER:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   How is it going?  
JOHN ISNER:   Yeah, no, it's going well.   I put in a lot of good work.   I told myself that eventually I felt like it was going to pay off.   And I think Houston was a little bit of a reward for the work I've put in.   
You know, I started off the year, wasn't great.   I had an injury.   So I just stopped playing.   Then sort of ramped back up from there.   It took me a little while to get back to where I'd like to be.   
I feel like I've turned that corner.   I'm starting to play better.   So I'll keep doing what I'm doing.   I'm feeling good about what the rest of this year has in store for me.   It's exciting.   
You know, anytime you win a tournament, ATP tournament, you're going to have to beat some good players, and that's what I did last week, so it's real encouraging.  
   
 Q.   You and Querrey are on the top.   Do you feel pressure representing America?   You're the only Americans in the draw.   
JOHN ISNER:   No, I don't think so.   I don't look at it that way.   I don't know how, you know, a guy like Sam may look at it.   I'm just out here, you know, trying to make a living playing tennis.   I'm very fortunate to do what I do.   
You know, I was the top American for a long time.   I guess a lot of the cameras were on me or whatever.   But I don't really feel the pressure at all.   I just go out there and play.   
   
 Q.   You saw Djokovic's injury.   Surprised he's going to play here?   
JOHN ISNER:   Actually, no, because I was shocked he continued in Davis Cup.   So nothing surprises me with that guy.   He's got a remarkable way of recovering, it seems.   
You know, I saw the replay right there.   I was right in front of it.   Somehow he was able to continue, which is pretty crazy actually.   But he's a world‑class athlete, and that's what guys like that can do.   
Is he playing tomorrow?   I don't know.   
   
 Q.   Yes.   
JOHN ISNER:   Okay.   
   
 Q.   John, several athletes have said they're going to do something to help in Boston.   Is that something you've considered, like every ace?  
JOHN ISNER:   Yeah, I haven't thought about it now.   But something I definitely could consider.
