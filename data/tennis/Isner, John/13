 Q.  Your thoughts on coming into this weekend's Laver Cup?  
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, it's fantastic to be back again. We're just excited to get going on Friday.   
We know the atmosphere is going to be amazing. It has been the last two years. Can't describe how fun it is to play on that court.   
 Q.  Highlight of the year for you? Would you say one of the highlights?  
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, no doubt. It certainly is.   
 Q.  What's it like for you, you're so competitive, but being on a team with guys that you're normally against?  
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, no, exactly. That's what we enjoy about it, because we are trying to beat each other 95% of the time during the course of the year. This event is much different. All of us get along. We really do. I'm not just saying that. We are very good friends and we have a lot of fun with this. It's just so much fun to compete in this environment.   
 Q.  You have other things on your mind, as well, haven't you, off-court with the baby?  
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, my daughter turned one on Sunday. So I was home for that. She had a big birthday party. It was really fun.   
We are having so much fun with it. My wife has been amazing. We're expecting a baby boy the 1st of November. Might even come earlier than that.   
So we're about to have two kids under 14 months, which is going to be crazy, there's no doubt, but fortunately we are ready for it and we have a lot of help, which is huge.
