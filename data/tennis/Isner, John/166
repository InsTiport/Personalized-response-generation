J. ISNER/K. Anderson
  7‑6, 6‑7, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions for John. 

Q.   That was quite the battle.   Talk about it, what it was like playing it. 
JOHN ISNER:   Yeah, I knew the match was going to be very tough.   Every time we've played, it's been close, and I expected that today. 
Really we both served well.   It's one of the few times where I don't think I was out‑served, but he served right up there with me as far as, you know, aces, percentages, whatnot.   So we both were serving exceptionally well. 
It came down to a few points here or there, and I was able to pull it out.   It was looking bleak for a little bit. 

Q.   You had one match point at 7‑6 in the second set tiebreaker.   Talk about that. 
JOHN ISNER:   I think he hit a good serve that I barely got back and he put it away. 
No, in the first two tiebreakers, I didn't miss a first serve until the one point that I lost at like 8‑All, whatever it was.   I served well enough to maybe win in two sets, but I had to win in three. 

Q.   Is that one of the matches that you say, This is why it's exciting to play tennis, when you're playing that quality, it's so close, or do you just like to get out of there?
JOHN ISNER:   I would have liked to get out of there in two sets.   You know, the quality was good as far as serving goes.   But other than that I think we maybe both could have played better a little bit. 
I mean, I guess it was exciting from a fan standpoint.   Anytime a match comes down to a third‑set tiebreaker, it's going to be exciting.   But at this stage in the game, this part of the season, I don't really care how it looks, I just want to try to get as many wins as I can. 

Q.   It was the longest match in terms of games played at this tournament ever.   Do you enjoy setting records?
JOHN ISNER:   Well, I didn't know that. 
I mean, can't get much longer.   Luckily we were able to put an end to it in a tiebreaker.   Yeah, I don't know.   I didn't think about that, but... 

Q.   Is the most pleasing aspect the fact that you're three match points down in the third‑set tiebreak and you dig deep to get out of that hole?
JOHN ISNER:   Yeah, that's very pleasing.   Maybe take a little bit of pressure off me going forward. 
You know, I came all the way out here for one event.   I didn't play last week.   It would have left a bad taste in my mouth that I came all the way over here to play one match and lose. 
I'm very, very excited to get through.   I know I easily could have lost that one, so... 

Q.   Finally a home tie.   You have never played, and I know Sam has never played a home tie.   Obviously you'll likely be there.   Talk about that. 
JOHN ISNER:   Yeah, I'm very excited.   This is my seventh Davis Cup tie, first one on home soil.   Like you said, I would probably be there as long as I'm healthy.   So something that I'm very much looking forward to. 
I feel like our team has paid our dues the last couple years with all these road ties, road ties against very good teams, too.   It would seem that a lot of home ties should be coming our way in the future. 

Q.   Can you ever remember a match where you won and didn't break serve?   How does that sort of shift your focus going into the next round knowing you were unable to break?
JOHN ISNER:   I think I've had a match like that before.   I mean, I've been playing for a long time.   I don't exactly remember.   You know, I don't think that was the first time for me. 
But, look, my focus is shifting to the next round, and I'm very, very happy to be through.   Like I said earlier, I don't care how it looks out there or on paper or whatever.   I've one goal the rest of the year, and that's to make the final eight.   I think I can do it.   It's all about wins; I don't really care how it looks.
