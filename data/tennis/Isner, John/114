J. ISNER/A. Rublev
  6‑3, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   So you entered this match on a four‑game losing streak. 
JOHN ISNER:   That's not true.

Q.   It's not?
JOHN ISNER:   No.   I played Indian Wells last week.

Q.   Oh, okay. 
JOHN ISNER:   Yeah. 

Q.   Well, what was it like playing someone so young?
JOHN ISNER:   It's different, but he's very talented.   I knew it was a match I needed to be focused.   You know, I needed to come out ready to play, because he's a talented, very talented kid.   Anything can happen. 
So, you know, it was a tough match, but I played pretty well.   I did what I needed to do.

Q.   You only had a few tour‑level victories up to this point.   How was formulating a game plan against him?
JOHN ISNER:   Game plans for me aren't that important.   It's just me taking care of what I need to do on my side of the net. 
My game is a lot different than everyone else's.   It's not rocket science, so I don't try to think ‑‑there were a few things here or there, but I don't focus too much on what my opponent does or doesn't do so well.

Q.   Hearing all this, are you getting any chance to watch the basketball?
JOHN ISNER:   Yeah.

Q.   How's your bracket doing?
JOHN ISNER:   Yeah, I haven't missed many ‑‑watching games.   Sorry, my bracket stinks, but I have watched all the games at night and it's great. 
Grab an early dinner, sit back, and just watch these teams duke it out.   I think I have all my Final Four teams still alive, but still really not ‑‑ prior to that, wasn't too good.

Q.   Do you feel at this point you're probably going to climb up the rankings some?   Are you where you want to be?   Obviously not where you want to be, but do you feel like you're taking steps towards... 
JOHN ISNER:   Yeah, yeah, I think I'm on the right track.   I started the year off a little slow. 
And also, I haven't played that many tournaments, either.   I think this is my, you know, like my fifth ATP tournament of the year, so it's not that many. 
I'm starting to play better.   You know, you're going to lose points and gain points throughout the year.   I'm not really focused on my ranking.   I'm worried about how I'm playing, and I'm definitely starting to play better. 
I wasn't playing too great at the very beginning of the year.

Q.   What would you say has improved since the end of last year till now? 
JOHN ISNER:   No, I mean, you know, I think I have a lot of very‑‑ a lot of good tennis ahead of me.   My results this year haven't been fantastic so it's hard to say, but I feel like I have improved.   I know I have. 
Maybe my results haven't shown that.   I have worked extremely hard with my new coach, Justin, and we are working on some things.   You know, mentally, physically, we are doing a lot of good work.   I know it's going to pay off down the road.
Whether it's this week or whether it's the next week at Houston or whether it's in Monte‑Carlo or whatever, it's going to pay off.   I'm doing a lot of good work and I'm staying focused.
You know, I'm becoming a better player.   I really believe that, and that's the most important thing.
