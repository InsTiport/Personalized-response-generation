F. FOGNINI/J. Isner
6-4, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Another tough night. You served 15 aces, but what was the biggest difference tonight?
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, I couldn't really penetrate on him at all. It was tough out there. He passes so well. Conditions are maybe a little bit slow, so it's tough to I think hit through the court, especially against a player like him.
Of course, that's what I was having issues at tonight.
Q. How do you turn things around ahead of the Australian Open? Back to basics?
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, I think you hit the nail on the head, just get back to basics, try to hit delete this week personally for me on the court. Everything else has been fine. It could definitely be worse. There's no doubt about that. But it's just tennis.
It's disappointing not to play that well here, but I got to be a professional and try to figure it out. I think that's what I'm going to do. Maybe take a little break, put the racquets up for a day or two, try to regroup and see if I can start playing better.
Q. Body it sound? Foot is not giving you issues?
JOHN ISNER: No, my foot is healthy. That's an issue with my bone. Eventually my bone healed. That's that. Hopefully it shouldn't act up again.
Q. What about the ATP Cup? How did you find playing that going forward for the future of the tournament?
JOHN ISNER: I thought it's been amazing. This tournament, you can see the passion from all the players in Perth, in Sydney and in Brisbane.
I think this has been a fantastic event for the ATP, very innovative. As I've said, the players have really enjoyed it.
For us, for our team, it's very disappointing to have finished dead last in our group. Definitely would have liked to have played better in our debut. Again, can't have anything bad to say about this event. I think it's been fantastic.
