 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. You went through kind of a losing streak during the middle of the summer. How important is it to string together a win or two?  
 JOHN ISNER: It's very important. I knew I wasn't going to feel too comfortable out there. Because I haven't -- the truth is I haven't been playing too many matches.   
 Last year this time I had a lot of the matches under my belt coming from college and winning a challenger, going far in D.C. I had so many matches under my belt, and right now I don't.   
 So with that you're not going to feel as comfortable. I took last week off just to practice with Kelly Jones. Got on the court and worked on a lot of things. Tried to implement some of those in my match today, which I did, but still didn't feel too crisp.   
 That's to be expected. As I said, I haven't played many matches.  
  
  Q. What are your expectations for regaining that crispness?  
 JOHN ISNER: Yeah, this is going to help. I knew this was a match I had a good shot at winning. I guess whoever I play next I'm not going to be the favorite. I think I actually play best in that role. Nothing to lose and go out there and play big, and hopefully I can disrupt my opponent's game by playing my style.   
 So hopefully this match is going to help. I'm going to feel more comfortable out there in my next match, so we'll see.   
  
  Q. Are you close at all with Robby Ginepri?  
 JOHN ISNER: Yeah, very close.  
  
  Q. He was in the 170s I think in January and now he's kind of climbed his way back. Seems like he's playing pretty well. You see anything behind that?  
 JOHN ISNER: Yeah, obviously he's been as high as top 20. He's a talent, that's for sure. I think he made a dedication to just work his tail off with his coach. He would go out, and instead of staying in Atlanta where he bases he would go out to Palm Springs and get on the court four, five hours a day and do fitness off the court.   
 That's Robby's game. He's got to be real fit. And when he is, he's going to do real well, which is what all of us are seeing.   
  
  Q. Was that motivation lacking before? Because he was top 20 and kind of fell off.   
 JOHN ISNER: Yeah, it comes to a point where it's tough. I guess he went through a couple tournaments where he would lose first round, one, two, three tournaments in a row. You kind of lose confidence at that point.   
 I think the same kind of happened for me. I lost a couple matches early on this year where I had match points, back-to-back tournaments. Get a tough draw the next tournament, you know, and next thing you know you're on a three-match losing streak and you start to question yourself.   
 I would have liked to have played some more Challengers this year, but I haven't. I've been playing all ATP tournaments just to get matches under my belt, which is important.   
 But I think I've started to -- I know last week for about eight days I was working my tail off and doing the necessary things to improve my game.
