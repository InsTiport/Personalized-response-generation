 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Can you talk us through your match, how you were feeling on the court today.
 ALISON VAN UYTVANCK:   I think it was kind of difficult today.  It was quite windy.  She played tactically well, playing the high balls on my backhand.  Yeah, I tried to fight back in the second set.  I played a good set.  I think in the beginning of the third it was kind of important.  It changed a bit right there.
 I felt in the beginning I had to search for my game with the wind and her game.  But, yeah, the end she was better.
