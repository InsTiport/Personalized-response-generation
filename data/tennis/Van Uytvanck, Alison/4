  6‑4, 7‑5

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French. 

Q.   (Question off microphone.)
ALISON VAN UYTVANCK:   Yes, that's true.   I could have done better.   But from the beginning to the end, yeah, she was present on the court.   She started well.
You know, her backhand was incredible, quite impressive the way she plays her backhand shots.   Then I came back into the match during the first and also the second set. 
But as you said, I had some chances and opportunities.   I'm a bit disappointed I couldn't seize them.   It was a good tournament for me.

Q.   Well, I know it's a bit early, but what will this Roland Garros change for the rest of the season and how people look at you?   And also financially what's going to change?
ALISON VAN UYTVANCK:   Well, yes, it's going to help me a lot.   You know, it will help me in terms of my ranking, which will go up.   It's good to be directly in the main draw for some tournaments, so it's going to be easier.
You know, you don't have to go through qualification, which is what is going to be really good.

Q.   And will you be more ambitious in the future?   Do you think that in Belgium you will have a different status?   Do you think you'd like this?
ALISON VAN UYTVANCK:   I don't know.   I'm trying not to think about all this now.   You know, I play tennis, so I have to work.   I have to work hard.   Of course I need to have some press conferences, but not too much. 
I will take a few days off to rest, and then I will start working for the grass season.

Q.   Did you feel that pressure was going up?   Even perhaps this morning when you woke up or perhaps yesterday evening or at night?
ALISON VAN UYTVANCK:   Yes, perhaps at the beginning of the match I was a bit nervous, but I think it's normal.   You know, it's the Lenglen Court, after all.   The crowd is here.   They are going to put their hands together for you.   Then afterwards I was quite calm.
I enjoyed it really, so that's the most important thing.

Q.   You have just lived I suppose the best 10 days of your career. 
ALISON VAN UYTVANCK:   Yes, absolutely.   So far I must say nobody believed that I would play quarterfinals here, so 10 incredible days for me.   Incredible.
