C. MOUTET/S. Caruso
3-6, 7-6, 6-3
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. I just was wondering how you feel about how you played today and especially how you fought really hard in the second set staving off all those breakpoints?
CORENTIN MOUTET:   I played amazing today.  It was amazing match, I think.  Both players, so I'm really happy.  I'm lucky to be here in the main draw because I got the wildcard, so they trust me to play this tournament.
It's nice from them, so thank you to them.
Q. Was it a little extra pressure getting a wildcard and playing at home, or do you like that kind of pressure?
CORENTIN MOUTET:   Yeah, as I said, I'm really lucky that they gave me the wildcard here.  Without this, I had to play the quallies.  So it's always good.
You know, they give you a chance to play directly the main draw.  It's always nice, because it's a big tournament, it's a 1000, I didn't play many of them.  I think it's my second.  So, yeah, it's a good thing.
Q. Why do you think you won this afternoon?  Why do you think you were the better player out there on court?
CORENTIN MOUTET:   Sorry?
Q. Why do you think you won your match today?  Why were you the better player out on court today against Caruso?
CORENTIN MOUTET:   I don't think I was the better player.  I think it was two players, it was a close match.  I tried my best.  He probably tried his best.  There is one winner at the end.  I lost many matches this year like this.  This time I'm the lucky one.
Q. I know you released music recently.  What has been the reaction like from the public in general?
CORENTIN MOUTET:   It was amazing.  That's why I stopped the social media, because I was receiving a million of messages every day.  So, you know, I couldn't handle it.  It was amazing, amazing, what can I say, answer from them.
So yeah, it was nice.
