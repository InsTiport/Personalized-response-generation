C. MOUTET/G. Dimitrov
7-5, 6-2
THE MODERATOR:   Just wanted to get your thoughts about today.  Obviously it's a very busy day, but you had some great results.  Just talk us through your experience at Melbourne Park.
CORENTIN MOUTET:   It was good.  I did my first tournament last year in Doha and I did the same, I won two matches in the same day.  So it's good to do it one year later against two good players.
So, yeah, I'm really proud and I'm really happy that I'm able to play the semis tomorrow.
THE MODERATOR:   That's a great point you mentioned, having to play two matches in one day, and very different players, as well.  How did you go about working out how to play against two very different players on the same day?
CORENTIN MOUTET:   I don't know.  I'm used to play different guys every day.  So the only difference, it's that it was the same day.
I don't know.  I just tried to recover more I can to be ready for this last match of the day.  I played him in Wimby two years ago.  I know he's a really good player, really physical, and he can play really fast, so I just, like, took match per match.
Yeah, I didn't think about the first match when I enter on the court and for the second.  I just try my best on both match.  I try to focus as much as I can, and here I am.
THE MODERATOR:   How do you see your match with Felix?  Obviously great preparation leading into the Australian Open.
CORENTIN MOUTET:   I played him many times.  For the moment, I never won in the past, so I don't know.  It's the same.  He's strong player, really strong guy.  He can play really fast, as well.  It will be tough.  I will have to be really focused.
Last time, last year in the US Open wasn't a good match from me.  I don't know.  I will just, like, do like today, try my best and try to be focused and then let's see how it goes if I can win this match or not.
