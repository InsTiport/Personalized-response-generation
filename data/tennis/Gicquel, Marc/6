 Q.  How did you turn it over in the third set?  You were in a rather difficult position. 
 MARC GICQUEL:  I didn't want to give up.  I wanted to serve at 5-3 in the third and then it would be up to him to finish the points.  He made a double fault.  He missed some shots that he usually didn't miss before and the trend turned over. 
 I am happy, but at the same time it's normal that I believed in victory until the end. 

 Q.  Is this your best result in a Masters Series? 
 MARC GICQUEL:  Yes.  It's my first win in a Masters.  It's a great satisfaction.  It's also my first tournament on clay this season, and this is good for my confidence.  I hadn't played so well lately. 

 Q.  Do you like clay? 
 MARC GICQUEL:  I'm very happy to be back on clay.  Since Cincinnati we only played on hard courts.  I appreciate that surface.  I had good results with it. 

 Q.  And also you have a very physical game. 
 MARC GICQUEL:  Yes.  That's the reason why it suits me. 

 Q.  What are your goals? 
 MARC GICQUEL:  In the rankings I was Top 41.  I want to improve that ranking, maybe become Top 30. 

 Q.  But your goals on clay? 
 MARC GICQUEL:  I want to do well in the French Open.  Having had good matches before, it's important for your confidence.  Confidence is so important in tennis.  I'm going to Casablanca and Hamburg, so I'm going to have a good preparation. 

 Q.  What do you think of your next opponent? 
 MARC GICQUEL:  He'll be the favorite.  I will have nothing to lose.  However, his best surface is hard courts, so I will try to win.  There's no reason why I shouldn't be able to.
