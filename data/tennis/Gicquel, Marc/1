 M. RAONIC/M. Gicquel
  6-3, 7-6, 6-3 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. I wanted to ask you, what is it like to receive serve against Raonic?  
 MARC GICQUEL: It's tough, because I couldn't see where was the serve of Raonic is going. So sometimes I have to choose some side. Very fast. So I had only one break point. He served so good.   
 So I don't know. It's the first time I played against him. For the next time, I don't know what I can do to return his serve.  
  
  Q. Did it get any easier as the match continued?   
 MARC GICQUEL: I started to return his serve. You know, at the beginning, you know, he started with three aces at more than 200 kilometers.   
 And after, yeah, I was at 30-All or 15-30, or, you know, I had a break point. But after when I lost my serve, I think against that kind of player it's tough.   
 You know he's going to get confident and serve with more aces. It's not easy.   
  
  Q. Was it the biggest serve you've ever played? You've played Roddick.   
 MARC GICQUEL: I played Roddick three times. Both have a very good serve. I never play against Karlovic and Isner, but it's the same.  
  
  Q. Is Raonic different because he's so tall?  
 MARC GICQUEL: Yeah, yeah. He can do a slice, you know, at deuce and go to the T; he can serve every side. Yeah, I cannot read his serve. Yeah.   
  
  Q. Was it difficult just getting to know at the last moment that you were going to play?   
 MARC GICQUEL: Yeah, but for me it was good news. I prefer to know at the last moment that I'm going to play. But, you know, I have to wait all the day and waiting for one player has to pull out.   
 Yeah, I knew like 30 minutes before 12:00, and, you know, I had a warm-up, so I was ready to play.   
  
  Q. Did you know much about him?   
 MARC GICQUEL: Yeah, I saw him playing on TV. Yeah, I know that he had a good serve. (Laughter.)
