 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. The day before yesterday you had a very tough match. Does it seem strange today to be out of it so quickly?  
 MARC GICQUEL: Yes, but immediately after the match I was assessing already the match and I saw that, although I was playing good, he was making no mistakes, and I was not able to outrun him.   
 I did not have the weapons to give him problems today. When I was playing at the net, he was putting the ball at my feet. The next shot he was passing me. He played really well.   
  
  Q. Did the transition from hard courts to clay go well for you?   
 MARC GICQUEL: I believe so. I reached the quarterfinals in Casablanca and I won my match yesterday. Of course, today it was not even close. But I believe the transition has been going well.   
  
  Q. What was your state of mind before that match?   
 MARC GICQUEL: I knew there would be long rallies and that he would give nothing away. I believe he's one of the best returners in the world.   
  
  Q. What did you laugh about at the end of the match?  
 MARC GICQUEL: I asked him how much the tennis lesson he gave me was. He fights on each point. He gives no free points.   
  
  Q. You were the last French player. How can you explain these bad results?  
 MARC GICQUEL: You must ask the other French players, too. I just know that my opponent today was too strong for me.   
  
  Q. Is it embarrassing for French tennis one month away from the French Open?  
 MARC GICQUEL: Well, for some players it's the first tournament on clay. Sure, they are going to adapt to the surface and their game will be in place and they will be ready for the French Open.
