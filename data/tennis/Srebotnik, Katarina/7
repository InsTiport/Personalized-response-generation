THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 
 

Q.  How did you feel about the match today?
 
KATARINA SREBOTNIK:  I think she played very good.  That's my personal thoughts, first of all. I thought I played a very good match also.  I served pretty well, and she was just returning unbelievable.  And in first couple of games, I think only in the fourth game she gave me one unforced error, you know. But apart from that, she was making no mistakes and she was playing very fast, very deep, and she was obviously very pumped, as you could see.  So she knew probably that I'm a tough competitor.  I've been playing well lately also.  Had some good wins on the grass, and I was going confident into the match. But, yeah, she was just too good.  She had to fight for it, and that's what I'm happy about it, that I made her work for it.
