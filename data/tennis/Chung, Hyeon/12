6-1, 7-5, 6-1
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.
Q. What is it that has clicked for you on clay this year?  Because you're having a very good clay season.  What has changed compared to the past few years?
HYEON CHUNG: I don't know, but I trying to focus all the time and I trying to enjoy on the court.  And I think mentally is better than last year, a little bit stronger.  And, yeah, I think mentally is the key.
Q. Based on your schedule and from previous years, it seemed like you tried to avoid the clay.  Did you not like the clay before?
HYEON CHUNG: Not really, but I like clay from this year maybe.
Q. Next opponent will be Kei.  It will be your first time to compete with Kei.  How do you want to play?
HYEON CHUNG: Yeah, I haven't played with him before, never practice.  But I think -- but I want to play with him one time, yeah.  Maybe I have to focus all the time in the match.
Q. Is it interesting in the sense that you don't have that many all-Asian battles, essentially, in the third round of a Slam?  Does that give it a bit more extra sort of -- I don't know -- yeah, just focus and interest, also for you to do well in there?
HYEON CHUNG: Yeah, I think everything come together.  I think a little bit maybe, of course, nerves because he's a top.  And maybe little fun, little excite, yeah.
Q. As there are a few Asian players at the top of the tour, do you consider Kei an inspiration or someone to look up to, or not so much because, obviously, he's from Japan.
HYEON CHUNG: I'm looking for him, because he's really good.  And he's number one in Asian and he's top 10.  And Asian people is little short, but he also short, but he make top 10.  So everyone looking for him, and me too.
