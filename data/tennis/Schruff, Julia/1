THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 


Q.  Would that be your biggest win?

JULIA SCHRUFF:  Yeah, one of my biggest wins.  I won also against Myskina in Berlin.  Yeah, but I'm really happy to win against Dementieva also. 

Q.  What did you think were some of the strengths of your game today?  Why did you get the better of her?

JULIA SCHRUFF:  I think I served really good in the first set, and I tried to play a lot of dropshots.  I was thinking about my forehand shot also.
