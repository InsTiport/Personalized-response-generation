THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.
Q. Have you some regrets for the loss or you are happy to reach this result?
VERONICA CEPEDE ROYG: I'm a little bit sad because I lost, of course.  But I'm really happy because I did reach fourth round.
And she's No. 3 in the world.  So is not easy to play with her.  She's a good player.  She have a lot of experience.
So I'm really happy with the result.  Of course I want more, but I fight every point in my match.  So I play well.  So I think it's a good tournament for me.
