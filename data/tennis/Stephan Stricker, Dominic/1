 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. What an amazing day for you and for Swiss tennis.  What is your reaction to your incredible double victory today?
 DOMINIC STEPHAN STRICKER:   Thank you, first of all.  Yeah, I mean, it was unbelievable day.  I cannot really describe what just happened today.  But I think it's going to help me for sure for the future.  I think, yeah, it was a great day.  Yeah, I want to keep going.
 Q. How do you explain that Swiss tennis right now in the juniors is so strong?  What makes you guys so strong?
 DOMINIC STEPHAN STRICKER:   Yeah, I think because we're actually four players who are pretty strong at the moment.  Yeah, it's great to practice together, so I think we can push each other.
 That's, of course, a big help for me actually to play with them.  I know they're, yeah, the top juniors.  It's just amazing to practice with them every day actually, yeah.
 Q. You practiced with Roger Federer in January.  Anything specific he said to you that you should improve or change or keep doing?
 DOMINIC STEPHAN STRICKER:   Yeah, he actually said I should improve my serve.  That's what I did actually.  So I think my serve is pretty good now.  So, yeah, it helped me a lot here.
 Q. You are the first player to win in singles and doubles since 1998.  What does it mean to you and how much do you enjoy playing doubles?
 DOMINIC STEPHAN STRICKER:   I mean, it means a lot to me.  It was an amazing day for me, as I said.  Yeah, winning singles and winning doubles, yeah, it's just amazing.
 I really enjoy this day.  I think, yeah, I will enjoy every minute of this evening for sure.
 Yeah, I really enjoy playing doubles here.  It was a great tournament for me, for sure.  Yeah, it's perfect.
