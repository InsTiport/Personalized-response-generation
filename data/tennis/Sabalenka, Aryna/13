6-4, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You managed to come back in that second set but couldn't push it to three. I'm wondering, what do you find difficult in her game?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: Well, no, it's tough to control anything when the player on that side also don't control anything. There's like can be winner, can be, like, unforced errors. And, like, you can't control anything. You just try to stay in the match and just try to fight.   
So on the second set, in the middle of the second set when I was down a break, I was just thinking, well, I have a good percentage of winning points from her first serve. I was, like, okay, because I felt it differently. It's help me to break her serve and come back in the match and, like, keep fighting.   
Well, she did great today, like, it wasn't my best match and I wasn't playing really well. I missed so many opportunities today.   
But it's okay. Just good preparation for the Australian Open. Hopefully I'll do better on the next weeks.   
 Q.  Do you feel you've got enough matches under your belt going into the Australian Open?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: Yeah. I feel that I got enough matches. That's why I came here, to play some matches. And I played them. Well, there is always something good, right (smiling)?   
 Q.  What is your mindset? How are you feeling going into the first major? How much do you enjoy being down there?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: You mean Australia?   
 Q.  Melbourne.  
ARYNA SABALENKA: Melbourne. Well, I'm feeling okay. Not everything perfect right now. I'm just -- I don't know. I'm just enjoying the opportunities I have.   
 Q.  Have you pinpointed, I guess, what was different from today as to yesterday where you were hitting almost every shot that was a winner against Simona? Do you have an idea what was the difference?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: Well, it's a big difference between them. Mostly speed difference. I had so much time yesterday, and today there wasn't really time. I was just, like, trying to control shots.   
But it was tough, because she also aggressive player. Well, like I said, I had some opportunities like short balls, but I missed them. Well, I mean, I just want to say that she did well today.   
 Q.  Is it hard to, I guess, come back, if you miss a short ball, and try and get your mind back on track after missing...  
ARYNA SABALENKA: Well, I didn't really think about that. Yeah, I missed this shot, but I was just, like, trying to keep going. I was maybe a little bit aggressive on the court today, but it was only because I was trying to come back in the match and trying to find some opportunities.   
 Q.  Did you get a chance to see the draw for Australia, or you didn't want to look at it before?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: Yeah, I saw that I play against Suarez Navarro, another great player.   
 Q.  She's retiring this season, so I'm wondering, what are your thoughts on her, her career, if you have had any interactions with her?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: Well, she's a great player, of course. She won so many tournaments, I guess, and played really well.   
It's always not easy to play against her, because so many balls coming back. Also big fighter. She's a good player, of course.
