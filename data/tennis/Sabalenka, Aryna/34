A. SABALENKA/C. Garcia   
5-7, 7-6, 6-0   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Quite the rollercoaster.  How did you come back?  You looked like you couldn't find your game.  Suddenly everything clicked.  How did you do that?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: Actually, I don't know.  Probably because when I was down 5-2, there's nothing to lose and I start to play tennis.  I didn't think about, like, how good I am or just like didn't want to put the ball totally in the line.  After that I start just to play tennis.  Doesn't matter how, just put the ball in and try to win every point.   
Well, I was really lucky that I won second set.  After that I don't know what happened with her, but she didn't run that well like the first and second set.  She didn't put the ball in like before.  I don't know what happened with her.   
Well, it was no key.  It was just like, you know, about mind.  She lost her mind probably.  But before third set she played really unbelievable tennis, I couldn't do anything.  I didn't have my serve.  I don't know what happened.  She played really well.   
At the moment I'm just so happy that I won second set.  Third set, I was lucky she didn't play.   
 Q.  You've won 20 three-setters this season.  Where does this victory rank compared to others?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: I don't know.  I mean, this week, it's really important for me.  It's a lot of things in your mind when you're playing, when you're winning a lot.  You start to think, It's too good, probably time to lose something.  When these things come in your mind, you start to, I don't know, lose every point.  You don't understand why.   
After, like, when you lose too much, then you come back, you didn't think about anything, you just trying to play, trying to show your best.   
Well, it's no word to explain what happened today, how happy I am with this win.   
 Q.  Is there any point in the first set or second set where you thought to yourself or say to Dmitry, It's been good, I won all these matches, this dip was bound to come, that's it?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: I was pissed with myself in the first and second set.  I couldn't serve.  I didn't know why.  I called Dmitry.  He said, Don't be pissed with yourself, just try to come back.  It was a lot of matches like this one.  You are coming back a lot of times.  This is nothing to get crazy.  Just try to put the ball in, run for every ball.   
That what he was saying to me.  I don't know.  I was calling him two times I think, yeah, or three.  Well, he was just saying like, C'mon, keep calm, you're too crazy on court.  Nobody is die here.  It's just, like, tennis.  Try to enjoy.   
I was just like, Aryna, c'mon.  Really nothing to lose.  You're down 5-7, 2-5.  Just try to do your best.  It's all that you need at the moment.   
 Q.  I watched your warmup.  You looked quite relaxed.  You were joking, people clapping.  Did the nerves kick in once you stepped on the court or earlier?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: I just want to say this is all about womans.  Five minutes we're happy, another five minutes we want to kill everyone.  This what happened today.  We were really relaxed.  We were just enjoying the moment.  Everything is going well.  It's nothing, like, to get crazy.  Well, everything was really good.   
I was in shock on the match.  Everything was good before, I come on the court, I couldn't put any ball in.  Womans, we are crazy.  That's all I want to say (laughter).  But is true, I mean.   
 Q.  In your next match you're going to play Wang Qiang, she beat Pliskova.  Talk about playing a player that is going to have the crowd behind them, and also what you know about her game, what to expect?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: She's a great player.  She's in a good shape at the moment.  Well, she beat a lot of good players, last week and this week.  It will be another tough match.  I will try to be ready for this one.   
Actually, I didn't saw her before.  I mean, I saw her, but I didn't think about her game.  Well, we're going to think with Dmitry today or tomorrow morning.  We will see.  Just try to show my best tomorrow, not like today.
