A. SABALENKA/J. Goerges   
6-4, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  That's your second win over her this year.  What about her game matches up well with your game?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: Well, she's a great player.  It's really tough to play against her because she's big server.  Sometimes it's impossible to take her serve, I mean no chance.   
Well, this is just about mentality game.  You have to be focused like 100% on every point, sometimes try to find the chance on her serve.   
Well, today on the second serve, it was quite many breaks.  I mean, two for me and two for her.  Well, it's was tough match.   
 Q.  You're 10-2 on North American hard courts this season.  What is going so well as you go into the US Open?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: Good question.  I don't know.  I just came for American series.  Actually I started really bad in San Jose.  I lose in the qualifies because I forget to sign for main draw.  Doesn't matter.  I was so pissed with that.  It makes me work more, even more than I worked before.   
I just came for the next one.  Okay, I said to myself, Relax, just keep going, try to put every ball in, so...   
 Q.  This is your second final of 2018.  You were in Eastbourne.  Any different approach you take coming into this final versus the last final?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: Yes, of course, I play a lot of two sets, not of three sets.  I'm more fresh, ready for the final.  It's not the first time, so I am a little bit know what I have to do tomorrow, I mean mentality, so...   
 Q.  What has been working particularly well for you during this tournament?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: If you not count the match with Gavrilova, I was pretty calm on the court.  I know what happened there.  On another matches, I was really calm.  This was the key for all matches.   
 Q.  How do you keep that confidence going when you're trying to get the breakthrough win, first tournament win tomorrow?  What do you say to yourself going into a final to say, I can do this?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: Well, I will tell to myself like, Okay, this is the next one, the second one, try to enjoy it.  Just enjoy.  Don't be too much pressure on yourself, just enjoying.  It's enough.   
 Q.  When you played in Eastbourne, you ran into Wozniacki, who was still No. 2 in the world.  Tomorrow you're going to play a player that isn't ranked as high as you.  Does that give you a little more confidence?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: I mean, it doesn't matter the ranking of players.  Everyone can play.  This is so.  But you just have to be focused on your game, to bring all what you have on the court.  Doesn't matter if it's second in the ranking or it's like something else.   
 Q.  Where are you going to eat after this?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: Well, I think I will eat something after tomorrow final.  If I do well there, probably I will take something really bad, probably McDonald's or something else (laughter).  But if I lose it, I don't know, probably I will eat McDonald's too (smiling).  I'll have some ice cream or something there.
