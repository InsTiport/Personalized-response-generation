 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. What are you most proud of from your win this afternoon against Marketa?
 ARYNA SABALENKA:   I'm proud that I was playing every point, doesn't matter what the score, because couple of times I broke her serve.  I have been down in the score Love-40 and I came back and get these breaks.
 So, yeah, I'm proud that I was focusing every point no matter what.  Wasn't really following the scoreboard because the score was pretty easy, but I was trying to focus on my movement, on my game plan, and, yeah, it works really well, and this is what I'm proud of.
 Q. Now that you've had a few matches under your belt there in Miami, have you been able to adapt pretty well to the heat and the humidity?
 ARYNA SABALENKA:   Yeah, in the first match I felt really sick and bad out there.  It was really humid and really hot, and I was almost about to throw up there, but I was, like, Keep going.  I was so lucky to get that win in the first match.
 Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, every match there is something which doesn't work really well.  Sometimes it's the tennis things, sometimes it's the movement, sometimes it's just your feelings, your health.  So you always have to find a way to fight and to get these wins.
 Yeah, I think this is what I actually proud so far that I'm trying to fight no matter what.
 Q. What are your thoughts on the next match?  You're playing No. 1, Ashleigh Barty.
 ARYNA SABALENKA:   Well, my thoughts is not going to be easy match.  She's playing really well.  She's a tricky player, and it's not easy to play against her.
 Yeah, I'll prepare myself as good as I can.  I'll do my best in that match, make sure I can get this win.
 Yeah, will fight until the end.  This is everything what I can say right now.
 Q. I have been asking some players, I'm not sure what the situation is in Belarus or wherever else you're based now, about getting the vaccine for the coronavirus.  How much is that a priority for you?  Is that something you have planned to do?  Is it something that's important to you?  What are your thoughts on that?
 ARYNA SABALENKA:   This is a tough question.  So far I don't really trust it.  It's tough to say, but I don't really want it mine yet, actually, and I don't want my family make it.
 I don't know.  I will think about this.  I mean, if I will have to do it, then of course I have to do it, because our life is a travel life and I think we are the ones who actually should make it.  But I will see.
 Because there is the two, and I want to make the one I think is more expensive and the one is not going to your genetic stuff.  There is like two different types of vaccine, and, yeah, I have to think about it.  I have to speak with my doctors and see which one is better for me.
 But for now, I don't really trust it.  For sure I don't want my family make it.  If I will have to do it, I will really think twice before I make it.
 Q. Why don't you trust it?  Where does the lack of trust come from?
 ARYNA SABALENKA:   I don't know.  They just make it, I don't know, in like really quick and there wasn't enough time to test it and to see, like, what can happen.
 So I think this is not enough time to make the good one.  I don't know.  I mean, maybe it's not really good to say, but for now I don't want to make it.  We'll see what happen.
