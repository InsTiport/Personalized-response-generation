6-4, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You are one step closer to holding maybe your first trophy here in Doha. How do you feel?
ARYNA SABALENKA: Thank you, yeah, I'm really happy to be in the final here, especially because I come here first time and made it until the final. It's really nice and I'm really happy with the level I'm playing right now and well, we'll see what's going to happen tomorrow, but for sure I will bring everything I have.
Q. How do you describe the difference between how you feel just kind of right now, kind of how you approach your game, how you play these matches, especially mentally, compared to maybe in January?
ARYNA SABALENKA: Well I think I'm moving better and I'm trying to stay in the longer points and I'm actually not afraid to play like long points and I'm enjoying it.
And that's the big difference, because when you enjoy it, then you're like you can play, actually. When it's like some pressure for you, then it's like not a game, you're like always under the pressure and you're not enjoying the game. So this is a huge difference, I think.
Q. Do you feel like, just talking about Dmitry, like he's the one that can get that message to you, he's the only one that can get that message to you to not go out there and just hit every ball and to believe in your fitness and your ability to win long points?
ARYNA SABALENKA: Yeah, that's exactly what he's doing now and, I mean, it sounds like it's really simple and, I mean, I know it is him, but I mean somehow when he's far away I can't do that and when he's with me on the tournament it's much easier to do. I don't know, something, magic (laughing), so, yeah, he's bringing a lot of things in my game already did and it's still a lot of things left.
Q. Just talking about today's match, first of all you must have been pleased to not see the wind too much today, not as bad as in the last couple days, and what do you think the key in getting a straight set win over Sveta?
ARYNA SABALENKA: Yeah, last two days was crazy wind and today it still was some wind, but it was much better. After yesterday it feels like it's no wind at all (laughing.)
And, yeah, I'm really happy with the win today, it was great match, I expect really great level from her and she played really well and it was not easy. And, well, I'm happy with the level I showed today and that I could stay calm (laughing.)
Q. It is your first time playing in the Qatar Total Open. How is Doha treating you so far?
ARYNA SABALENKA: Oh, I like it. I love it, actually. It's really nice city, nice courts, nice people, great support here. And actually a lot of the Russians are here, I didn't know that, and it's really cool to see them supporting me.
The hotel is really nice. I didn't have time to go out, but hopefully tomorrow or day after I will go out and see more about Doha. But for sure I love it.
Q. Can you hear Belarusian?
ARYNA SABALENKA: Yes, yes, I can. They keep screaming like, Let's go Belarus, or like some, like something in Russian and, yeah, I can hear them, they are good (laughing.)
Q. We don't know who you're going to play yet tomorrow, but either Ash or Petra. Can you talk through the challenges of playing either player?
ARYNA SABALENKA: Well, it's a huge challenge playing against Ashleigh, she's No. 1. And I mean same with Petra, she's also like it's a huge challenge to play against her.
It's like they both are great players and it's going to be tough anyway. They are playing really well right now and I'm just looking forward for this challenge. And like I always say, like I'll bring everything I have and I'll go for it.
Q. You've now made the final of the last two Premier 5 tournaments. You won in Wuhan and then now here. What is it about this type of tournament and your success rate at this level?
ARYNA SABALENKA: Well, I'm really happy that I can play on this level and I can go that far on the tournaments.
I'm just, I don't know, like I'm really happy with the level and I'm happy that I can play against these players and I can show my best tennis and, I mean, yes, done (laughing.)
