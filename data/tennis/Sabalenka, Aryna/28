6-4, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
 Q.  Mixed day today.  Sadly, a loss in singles and then a good win in doubles.  How do you feel?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: I'm okay.  It doesn't matter, win or lose.  It's happened.  That's our life.   
Yeah, I'm happy with the win in doubles.   
 Q.  What happened in singles?  What was tough?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: She played great.  And my serve doesn't work well today, and that was the key for her.  It helps her a lot, I think.   
 Q.  Do you think that with Elise -- you're seeded sixth.  It's the first time seeded in a Slam -- do you think you have a good chance to go far here and win it?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: I don't really want to think about this.  We just go on each match and focus on each game, and that's it.   
 Q.  But it's a good start today.  
ARYNA SABALENKA: Yeah, yeah.  It was a good one.   
 Q.  She's still in the singles.  Can I just ask you to assess her match tomorrow against Sevastova?  How you see that?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: Oh, I think she have good chances to win.   
 Q.  Because?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: Because she's aggressive player, and she's feeling good right now on the clay, and I don't know.  That's my thought.  I don't know.   
 Q.  Sevastova, clay is not maybe her favorite surface?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: Well, it should be her favorite surface.   
But her game is a bit tricky, but I think Elise can handle it.
