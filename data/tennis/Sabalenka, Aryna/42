THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How do you feel after that win?  A little bit about how you feel your grass season has been going.
ARYNA SABALENKA: Well, after the match I was thinking, like, how I did it?  I was down 4-1, and there was no chance for me because my game was like totally died, I would like to say.
I was so happy.  It's good start of the grass season.  Well, now, I'm so happy with this.
Q. Have you always enjoyed playing on grass?  Is this like a new thing for you that suddenly you've clicked?
ARYNA SABALENKA: No, no, I enjoy it.  I played just once, like last year was my first season on grass court.  Never played before.
This is the second one.  I always enjoy it.  I like it too much.  Much better than clay court, actually.  It's better for my game, I would like to say (smiling).
Q. You said in your on-court interview that your coach told you to go out fighting.  Can you tell us a bit more about that.
ARYNA SABALENKA: Well, yeah.  I was call my coach when I was down 1-4.  He said, like, If you lose, but lose in a good way.  I mean, like, just fight.  Give some chance to play shots, because you're always miss like from the first ball.
He said, like, Just keep fighting.  There's only one break.  So just keep going.  Try your best and just try to put the ball in, because it's a lot of mistakes.  Before that 4-1 was a lot of mistakes for me.
Q. And it obviously worked?
ARYNA SABALENKA: Yeah.
Q. I mean, what is it about Karolina's game that can cause challenges, really?
ARYNA SABALENKA: You mean about Karolina's game?
Q. Yeah.  What is it about her game that's difficulty to face, especially on a surface like grass?
ARYNA SABALENKA: Yeah, yeah, on grass it's so difficult to play against her because she's a big server.  It was so tough on her serve game, because I was just stand on the return and just think, like, come on, just try to put the ball in and then just run.  Because, you know, her serve is so big.  You just put the ball and then you start to run because she's on the ball and she's, like, aggressive.
Yeah, she played quite nice shots.  On the grass courts even you feel it more.  So I don't know.  I don't know, actually.  I cannot answer for you, because I don't know how I did it (smiling).
Q. I think you've got Radwanska next.
ARYNA SABALENKA: Yeah, right.
Q. A few thoughts about having to face her.  She's obviously just come back from injury and doing extremely well.
ARYNA SABALENKA: Yeah, I never played against her, and her game is really, really tough because she's a good runner.  She read the game, like touch player.  I don't know how to say it better in English.
So it will be a tough match.  Even if she after injury, she made the semifinals, so after the injury, so it's means that she's in good shape.
Q. Are you expecting to run and run?
ARYNA SABALENKA: I think it will be (smiling).
Q. Did you ever imagine that you'd come here this week and beat three top 20 players and be in the semifinal?
ARYNA SABALENKA: No.  It's always was three sets, and I didn't expect that I gonna beat in like three players in a row.  And so it's good week for me.  Well, it's give me a lot of, you know, believe in myself more.  Well, now I'm really happy.
Q. Does it feel like a breakthrough week for you?
ARYNA SABALENKA: Yeah.
