THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Back when I first saw you at Devonshire Park, no one knew who you were.  Then you reached the final.  What has changed since that time?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: I started working with Dmitry Tursunov.  He's a great coach.  It's like 90% his job.  I'm so happy to have him, work with him.   
 Q.  What aspect of your game did he work on to change things for you?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: He changed I was hitting, like, every ball like doesn't care about anything.  He explain me that you don't really need to hit the ball full power.   
Yeah, we've been working, like, on all aspects of my game.  We improved a lot of things.  Well, I'm so happy with that.   
 Q.  How was the match today?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: Well, the Grand Slams are always something special.  I'm so happy to win this match.  She played great.  Me, too, actually.  It was really good match.  I'm so happy to reach in my third round here.   
 Q.  Was that the first time you played her?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: Yeah, yeah, first time.   
 Q.  What impressed you about her game?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: Well, she's kind of aggressive player.  She's playing down the lines a lot of winners.  It was really hard to pick up the right corner where she's going because she's going, like, really hard and really deep, really flat balls.  Sometimes it's tough to control them.   
But I think I did well today.  I'm really excited with this result.   
 Q.  Unlike back at Eastbourne, everyone knows you.  Do you like the attention and pressure?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: Well, I'm really happy to hear that.  For me it's really important to see that people support me, that they enjoy my game, enjoy the time to watch the tennis.   
Well, it's really great.   
 Q.  Is there anything else that's helping you besides your coach?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: We've been working on a lot of things.  Actually we done really hard work, especially on the pre-season.   
I work with my mind game because sometimes I'm get crazy on the court and I need to improve this part of my game.  Before I really didn't control the game.  Now I understand the game, understand where I have to play, when I need to hit the ball, when I need to be just stay in the point.   
It's makes me confidence on the court.   
 Q.  Do you try to focus one match at a time?  
ARYNA SABALENKA: Actually, I'm excited to be on this level, to have this opportunity to play with the great players, be one of the great players, greatest players.  I'm focused on each match.  Don't really want to think about titles.  Then you're not respecting your opponent, and you need to respect them because all of them, they're really great players.  All of them, it's really tough to beat.   
Yeah, I'm prefer to focus on each match, give all what I have on each match.
