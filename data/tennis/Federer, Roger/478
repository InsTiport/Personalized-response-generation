  7-6, 4-6, 6-1 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
  
  Q. Are you as surprised as the rest of us are by the result tonight?  
 ROGER FEDERER: I don't know. I mean, he beat me at Wimbledon. So I don't know how much of a surprise it is.   
 He's playing well. I thought if he was going to play well again, me not at my best, he could do it again. It's not like he's beating me the first time.   
  
  Q. Describe the conditions tonight. It's cold and windy. How did that affect your game or plan going into the match?  
 ROGER FEDERER: Well, I didn't think it was that particularly windy or cold. It was fine. It was cooler. You know, you don't maybe sweat as much as the previous days. Maybe that's also why we both had to do a toilet break at the end of the second, just because you don't sweat it all out.   
 Other than that, the conditions were fine. Sure, it's different playing under the lights all of a sudden again. It hasn't happened in a while actually. Might be the last match I played under the lights was against him in Rome. That was on clay. Before that, probably Miami. So it takes some getting used to.   
 You know, I mean, I thought the match was all right. From the conditions standpoint, it wasn't an issue. It was a nice crowd, so it was fun.   
 THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.   
  
  Q. Where does he hurt you?  
 ROGER FEDERER: Well, he's confident right now and he played an excellent third set. The first two sets were tighter. I should maybe have won the first one. I had some opportunities. In the second I was able to hold my serve. I might have won, but he was able to finish off the match very well.   
  
  Q. Is it a special combination here in MontrÃ©al against him? You've lost twice.   
 ROGER FEDERER: No. Two years ago he didn't really deserve the victory. I believe he played a lot better today, and he deserved it today. Two years ago I think he was lucky to pull out the win. Tonight he played well and he played extraordinary shots as we know he can do. I was not able to do that.   
  
  Q. What are you going to do now? Are you going to stay here to practice?  
 ROGER FEDERER: I don't know yet. But I will practice before Cincinnati, for sure.   
  
  Q. So the only hope you have now is Stan in this tournament?  
 ROGER FEDERER: Oh, yes, I hope he wins.  
  
  Q. Are you going to give him some advice?  
 ROGER FEDERER: He doesn't need advice. He's strong enough.   
  
  Q. Do you believe that the difference tonight was because Tsonga was playing more aggressive, especially in his return games and also at the beginning of the third set?  
 ROGER FEDERER: He returned from very far back. I don't know if this is returning aggressively. I know I didn't play well in that third set, and he was able to hold his serve, sometimes with the wind behind him.   
 In that third set, he played really nice shots. I did some also. On this fast surface, the match was tight, and it was only a matter of a few points.   
  
  Q. What positive can you draw from this tournament?  
 ROGER FEDERER: I played two matches. I feel good physically. New York is in one month. It's far away. For the time being, the focus is here, not elsewhere. But if you want to talk about the US Open, I can tell you I feel good mentally and I'm playing well, if that's the goal for everybody else, but it's not mine right now.
