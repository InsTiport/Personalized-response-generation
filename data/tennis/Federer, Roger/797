THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Roger. 


Q.  What was the most satisfying part of that, what looked like a very easy win?

ROGER FEDERER:  Excuse me? 

Q.  What was the most satisfying part of what looked like to be a very easy win?  Can you take anything from it?

ROGER FEDERER:  Getting used to the conditions, I think, is obviously the main thing if you're playing against an opponent you're such a huge favorite in.  You know, I thought it was not easy today because, you know, he was serving big, taking a lot of chances on my return.  So we didn't see too many rallies, which didn't really allow me to get the rhythm going, you know.  I guess I still believe it was a good match.  I won comfortably.  That's what counts most. 

Q.  How did you find the speed of the courts?

ROGER FEDERER:  Well, it was quick.  He served me aces, didn't he?  No, I guess it's sort of a fair surface.  It's definitely no faster than last year.  Yeah, sort of a little unexpected after Lleyton already said something last year, I thought they might speed up the courts a little bit.  I don't feel that's the case too much.  He played well last year.  I did, too.  Maybe we can expect the same again this year. 

Q.  He's someone you haven't met, let alone played.  Were you surprised, he didn't seem nervous at all. 

ROGER FEDERER:  You've got to ask him, I don't know.  I mean, he had a good first opening service game.  You know, two aces.  I think that definitely calms you down straightaway.  I got his serve later on.  I also thought, you know, he played pretty good, you know, under the circumstances against me.  Obviously, you know, I have a big repertoire of shots, so I always get a way maybe to find my way into somebody's game, especially ranked that low.  Again, he's up-and-coming.  He's pretty young still.  I hope we're going to see more of him because I thought he played pretty good. 

Q.  Has your deal with IMG made any sort of difference to your activities?  Are you much busier off court now?

ROGER FEDERER:  No, no changes so far.  I don't want to have much more to do because I'm quite booked out already.  I told that to IMG very clearly, that that's not why I'm going back to you, it's you guys that have more to do.  It's the opposite.
