THE MODERATOR:  First question, please.  
 
 
Q.  How was that today? 
 
ROGER FEDERER:  Well, I'm happy.  I don't know what you saw.  The way I played, you know, was what I kind of expected.  It was good.  I'm feeling good here.  The conditions suit me.  The game also has been solid so far, so.... 
 
Q.  What have you been working on in the last few days with your game?  You said in general you weren't happy with your game at Kooyong.  Where has it improved in the last five days or so?
 
ROGER FEDERER:  I felt already during the practice sessions, during Kooyong, that this court was playing a little bit faster, which is better for my game.  I feel like, you know, I'm more concentrating on my serve than maybe in Kooyong.  And it's not as windy, so it makes it easier.  So already, you know, serving better helps for the rest of the game.  I feel also that I'm more aggressive on the return, which I wasn't in Kooyong.  So that's two big improvements I've made.  
 
Q.  You play Todd Reid in the next round.  Have you played him before?
 
ROGER FEDERER:  I haven't, know.  I know him a little because, you know, he's been around for just a little.  But, yeah, I saw a lot of his match today. 
 
Q.  It seemed to take a lot out of him today.  You have to be happy when you're facing someone that has expended a lot of energy like that. 
 
ROGER FEDERER:  It's an advantage.  You know, but at the same time he's got nothing to lose.  Doesn't really matter what happened two days ago.  He's got one day of recovery tomorrow.  Even though he finished quite early today, which is good for him, he'll come out fresh against me.  I'm looking forward to a different game than he played today.  They were rallying a lot.  That's not going to happen against me too much.  
 
Q.  Having now got a Grand Slam to your name, do you come to this tournament with a slightly different mental attitude; you know you can do it? 
 
ROGER FEDERER:  I guess I expect more of myself.  You know, I know I can win this tournament.  But before, you know, I would have been happy maybe with the quarters or the semis.  Now it's an okay result, but it's not satisfying.  You know, I guess I'm more hungry for more.  I know now what it takes, you know, to win a Slam --how to prepare, how to do it all the way because two weeks tend to get very long in a Grand Slam.  As a tennis player, I guess it's things players aren't used to.  
 
Q.  Is it right that you follow cricket, that you like cricket?
 
ROGER FEDERER:  A little bit, yeah. 
 
Q.  Have you had a chance to look at any while you've been here?
 
ROGER FEDERER:  Yeah, I have been watching. 
 
Q.  What are you seeing?
 
ROGER FEDERER:  I just really watch it just because it's relaxing, you know.  I understand the rules (smiling).  That's already something for a European.  The other guys, all my friends, they don't understand the sport, so I got to switch.  But that's fine.  
 
Q.  What is your interest?
 
ROGER FEDERER:  My former coach, Peter, he knew about it.  
 
Q.  Tim Henman won earlier today.  You played him recently in Paris.  Do you see him as being a contender here?
 
ROGER FEDERER:  For the title?  
 
Q.  Yes. 
 
ROGER FEDERER:  Yeah.  If he can win Paris, he can win this event.  Haven't seen anything of his matches this week, but, yeah, I'm not surprised.  He's playing well.  He's dangerous for anybody.  I mean, I'm not going to face him till the quarters, I think.  That's okay.  We'll see how he goes through and how I'll manage to get through the Aussie.
