  Q.  Somebody suggested if he kicked the penalty last night, Switzerland should have won.   
 ROGER FEDERER:  Never know.  Maybe.  Was a big pity.  Very disappointed.   
  
  Q.  Did you ever play better for a first round in a Grand Slam?   
 ROGER FEDERER:  Well, I mean, you have to look at the circumstances first.  Match in Wimbledon again against Gasquet, a good player on grass - on any surface really.  Big talent.  Like I said, it was one of the toughest draws I've had.  To come up and play so well, I'm very happy.  Especially over two days, makes it more difficult, I think.  Also, I was very happy the way I played.  Maybe it was my best, I don't know, but it was definitely up there.   
  
  Q.  Can I ask you about the blazer you were wearing yesterday?   
 ROGER FEDERER:  Yes.   
  
  Q.  What's the story behind that?   
 ROGER FEDERER:  Well, Nike and myself, we thought after three Wimbledons, we could do something special.  They came up with the idea of a jacket, which I thought was pretty nice.  The logo on it has three racquets for the three Wimbledons, it's got the grass logo, it's got the lion star sign, the Swiss cross, and Federer, so it's very nicely done.  It's only one of a kind, so it's pretty nice.   
  
  Q.  The new family shield?   
 ROGER FEDERER:  Yeah (smiling).   
  
  Q.  Can you talk about the streak?  The other day you downplayed it.  I'm wondering if you feel any differently today about that accomplishment.   
 ROGER FEDERER:  Well, I mean, it's nice, isn't it?  To get any streak is obviously nice.  I'm still going, so even better.  I can maybe postpone it, you know, make it even last longer.   
 I've had many, many of those matches in those 42 I've won in a row which have been incredibly close, especially a few of them in Halle.  Had about four or five of them which I could have lost easily.   
 I'm surprised myself I kept it that long, you know, for so long.  To come through today, that was basically my only wish, and not to break the streak really.  But that it comes together, obviously it's nice.   
  
  Q.  Are you more or less impressed with your streak on grass versus your streak on hard courts?   
 ROGER FEDERER:  The streak on hard court for me was quite impressive.  I think the one in the States is still going.  I don't know how many I have there in a row.  I always used to struggle playing in the States, all of a sudden I'm on this incredible roll, winning every Masters Series I play, winning the US Open twice, all this.  So that for me is impressive really.   
  
  Q.  What do you think about the seedings, the fact that in Wimbledon, they change the seeds, they don't follow the ATP rankings?  Roddick has been twice in a final, once in the semifinal, he's not No. 2 seeded, but Nadal is in front of him.  There is a little contradiction.  They change the seedings but they don't change it that much.  What is your feeling about it?   
 ROGER FEDERER:  Well, I think if they would change it too much, then it would be irrelevant to have a ranking almost.  They can't change it too much, I think.  If they do -- I think the way they do it is pretty good.  I think Nadal totally deserves to be No. 2 seed here because, I mean, he's played phenomenal tennis over the last year.  That's also what you have to take into consideration.   
 If you only go for grass and Wimbledon, I mean, that is too much of -- you know, it's not fair really.  So I think the way they do it, it's pretty good, or then don't do it.  I think both actually work out fine here in Wimbledon.   
  
  Q.  Looks increasingly like you'll face Henman in the next round.  Do you have any thoughts on that potential match-up?   
 ROGER FEDERER:  Well, I mean, as tough as it gets for a second round really.  I would absolutely hope that he was not going to be really in my section of the draw, just of me knowing how well he can play on grass, he beating me here in 2001.  Sort of a dark horse early on in my career.   
 Obviously it's not a nice draw.  We're good friends.  It's never nice to play against a friend also.  It's tough.  But somebody's going to win and I hope it's going to be me, so...   
  
  Q.  Having started a few Championships now, does it feel any different, Centre Court, the way it's playing?  Does it feel familiar to you?   
 ROGER FEDERER:  I think it depends on who you play really, how you're feeling.  I'm more calm now walking out on Centre Court than I used to be obviously because I've gotten used to it, you know.  I don't get totally nervous about the first, second or third round.  It's really the semifinals and finals that is really exciting, you know.  That's where you want to be.  That's where the pressure really comes up for me.  Me being used to being in so many finals, that sort of helps, you know, to stay quiet in the early rounds, not getting too nervous about it.   
 But the first round here in Wimbledon is obviously more special than at other events.  Yeah, and the grass obviously plays such a factor.  It's so different now than it's going to be in a couple of weeks' time.  You never get the opportunity to play on perfect grass like you play on the first day, so you always wonder how it's going to go.   
  
  Q.  Some people might say that your streak is not as impressive as Borg's because he did it all at Wimbledon.  Do you agree with that?   
 ROGER FEDERER:  Yeah, I do.   
  
  Q.  You do agree with that?   
 ROGER FEDERER:  Yeah.   
  
  Q.  Why?   
 ROGER FEDERER:  Halle is not Wimbledon.  Halle is best-of-three, even though that's maybe considered a little bit more dangerous to lose obviously.   
 Look, Wimbledon stays Wimbledon after all.  The five Wimbledons and the sixth final is something, you know, beyond almost possibilities for any player.  So for me, obviously he stays a hero.
