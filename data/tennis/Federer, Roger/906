THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Roger. 


Q.  Was that almost too easy?

ROGER FEDERER:  You know, you always got to concentrate in the beginning of the sets.  This is when it went well for me.  I made sure I had a lot of first serves in, you know, so I didn't have to go for my second serve, because that's what he wanted.  I kind of like his game - already did in Gstaad.  I didn't expect to beat him again so easy. 

Q.  You play James Blake next.  You've seen how he's been playing, how the crowd's reacting to him.  What do you expect?

ROGER FEDERER:  I expect a good match, you know, a fair match especially, because he's a nice guy.  We've never played.  It's going to be a first time.  It's nice to play a crowd favorite also.  It's going to be a good crowd.  I think it's going to be a good match.  Looking forward to it.

Q.  When the draw came out, it was pointed out that not just Blake, but after that, you have sort of your nemesis, Nalbandian.  Have you kept track of him, since he's seemed to have your number?

ROGER FEDERER:  He's been lucky on a few occasions.  I'm not too concerned about Nalbandian.  I'm more concerned about Blake right now.  I really cannot look further than that match.  Every opponent what comes now is going to be tougher and tougher.  I expect a much tougher match than what I had today. 

Q.  Yesterday Martina Navratilova was asked, "If you could teach one player, which one would you pick?"  She said, "Roger Federer.  That would be easy, he's got it already."  Can you comment on that?  What's your reaction?

ROGER FEDERER:  I don't know.  I just know her briefly.  I met her at the gala dinner in Wimbledon.  I know my girlfriend knows her better than I do from when she was younger, got her inspired into tennis.  It's always nice to hear that from such a champion.  I hear that she's a very nice person.  It's a compliment for me.
