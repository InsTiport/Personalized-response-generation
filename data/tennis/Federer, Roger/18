Q. With this crowed, did you ever imagine you would see, feel, and experience so much on so many levels of passion and excitement here?
ROGER FEDERER: I was hoping that it was going to be like this. They didn't disappoint me.
Merci Gen√®ve. Thank you.
Q. Today you really needed their support. What was going through your mind when you were serving to stay in this match?
ROGER FEDERER: Yeah, I don't know. It was a bit of a lull in that second set. I was really close in the first set. It was tough to lose.
I could feel it, but I needed to get some energy going, but you can't do that if you don't play good shots, and Nick was playing very well.
I was just trying to stay focused and stay with Nick. I knew like with what John Isner did, it maybe look like you're down, but if you can turn the momentum, the crowd gets back into it. You guys did. I need some ear plugs next time (smiling).
It was just phenomenal. Thank you very much for pushing me over the line.
Q. I know that this crowd love you. You love this crowd. Would you like to say a few words to them in French?
ROGER FEDERER: I don't know how many speak French here in this part of the world?
I'm kidding (smiling).
(Speaking in French to the crowd.)
