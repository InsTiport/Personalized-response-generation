N. DJOKOVIC/R. Federer   
6-4, 5-7, 6-4, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You played an outstanding match.  You were playing so well.  Is there consolation in that, or just disappointment that you weren't able to maybe convert some of those break points and come away with a win?  
ROGER FEDERER: Yeah, I mean, there is definitely consolation it's been a great stretch all the way for many months now.   
Also to receive the crowd support that I did receive.  I don't consider that normal.  I always say.  Say like it feels like you're winning, as well, but I felt like I was sort of up in the score, they kept me going, and that's definitely one of the reasons I still keep playing, because of these moments, goose bump moments.  It's great.   
Yeah, surely I am very disappointed.  Like you said, I had my chances on my racquet.  I should never been down in the score the way I was.  But Novak did a great job of fending them off, and, you know, all of that.   
It was a tough night, but still, I don't know, thrilling at the same time.   
 Q.  Was the third set the key of this match?  Seemed in the third you were maybe a bit better than him.  
ROGER FEDERER: Yeah, third and fourth, really.   
 Q.  He seemed to find another gear.  When you had those break opportunities, it was like he just elevated.  Is that sort of the key to his...  
ROGER FEDERER: I didn't feel that way, to be quite honest.  I had too many break chances.  Of course some of them I could have done better, should have done better, you know, all these things.   
Surely he didn't give me much, you know, and all that, that's for sure, but still I should have done better.   
 Q.  The rain delay and the change of start time, did that disrupt you?  
ROGER FEDERER: No.  I mean, that's part of the game.  That's what we do.  I felt like they communicated well enough with us what was going on.   
Yeah, I mean, the good thing is when there is a rain delay at this stage of the tournament, I mean, obviously there is some pressure involved.  At the same time, wherever you are it's very quiet rather than first match of the tournament where it's just like a thousand people everywhere where you can't even get two square meters for yourself.   
 Q.  The year has not ended and you have already reached the last two Grand Slam finals.  So how do you match these results?  Of course it's always better to win, but how do you match these achievements compared to your expectations and targets and goals at the beginning of this year?  
ROGER FEDERER: Yeah, I mean, I am playing a good year, you know.  I'm playing good tennis.  I am happy with where my level is at.  I'm able to be, you know, consistent, very consistent.   
I'm able to beat the best players regularly.  Cincinnati obviously was a great feeling beating world No. 1 and world No. 2 in the same week.  I don't think I have done that before.   
And then of course it's also disappointment.  Lost too many times in finals.  But at the same time, I did win my tournaments, the ones I was supposed to.  The one I got I was very got happy the way I was playing.  Year's not over yet.  I usually do have a strong finishes to the season, and I hope I can do that again.   
 Q.  The crowd was incredibly in favor of you.  I'm wondering if that's ever difficult emotionally, if you're confused why no one is cheering for the other guy?  
ROGER FEDERER: No.  I take all the positives for myself, I must say.  I don't want to say comfortable, but it's just so nice to feel that, you know, that they want you to get back in the match, they want you to win.  They enjoy what they're seeing.  Feels like they're getting their money's worth.   
I guess it's entertainment to some extent, as well.  It was a great battle, and I'm happy the people stayed after the rain delay and that they were right there when I needed them to the very, very end.   
So of course there is a just a letdown and disappointment that I couldn't push it 5-All, and then who knows what happens?   
I should have never been down in the first place two sets to one and 5-2.  That was a bummer there.   
 Q.  With the half roof, was it louder than you have ever heard?  Different noise at night now with the crowd?  
ROGER FEDERER: Hard to say.  They were unbelievable tonight.  Were they better than ever?  Possibly.   
Was it louder than ever?  Maybe.  It was unreal.   
But I have heard loud New York crowds before.  (Smiling.)  Yeah.   
 Q.  You said something interesting on court.  You said that a match like tonight's match, you learned so much about your tennis and yourself.  I know you just stepped off court, but can you reflect a little bit about that and what you did learn?  
ROGER FEDERER: Well, I mean, usually you learn more when you lose just in the sense that you analyze them harder, deeper at times.  Not always.  Sometimes you just walk away and you forget about it.   
But, you know, I think in especially best of five set matches, ones that exceed two-and-a-half, three-and-a-half hours, you go through some ups and downs naturally.  You can't play two perfect points every single time.  Naturally you're going to have to battle.   
That's where you learn a lot about your game, about your attitude, about your fitness.  This is, I think, the longest match I have played all season.  It was very interesting to see for me how I coped with it.   
I'm very happy I had no problems, and I'm happy I'm putting in the hard work, you know, obviously aside from the matches, because the matches I have played this year have been really quick.  I won't see another best of five match some time except for next weekend.   
Yeah, so I'm happy that I'm able to stay at a great level of play for a long period of time, because I'm match tough and I have worked very hard in the offseason, as well.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible.)  
ROGER FEDERER: I'm feeling confident doing it, you know.  I think it was the right game plan.  Just execution sometimes was missing in some crucial moments.  But other than that, I think I played a good match.   
Maybe I haven't played this offensive for a very long time, and that's maybe the reasons, as well, why maybe I was slightly shaky when it came to the crunch on the break points.  Who knows?   
 Q.  I didn't hear the first question, but 19 break points out of 23 you missed; many with the forehand.  Normally when we look at your stats your forehand is always the winning point.  Tonight you were probably playing better on the backhand.  Am I right?  Am I wrong?  How do you feel?  How was it in your opinion?  
ROGER FEDERER: Yeah.  A lot of opportunities miss the.  If it's backhand, forehand, volleys, it doesn't really matter at the end of the day.   
I know why I lost the match very clearly the moment I sat down at 5-2 down in the fourth or after the match was over.   
So something I will work on, and keep moving forward, you know.  It's no problem for me.   
 Q.  When you say you know why you lost the match, is it just because of those mistakes or the reason why you made those mistakes?  
ROGER FEDERER: Because of the mistakes I made.  I have to get better at that.  It's just pretty simple.   
 Q.  How well would you say Novak is playing now?  How many majors...  
ROGER FEDERER: I didn't hear the end.   
 Q.  How many major titles do you think he can win?  He has 10 now.  
ROGER FEDERER: I think he's playing very well.  Are you kidding me?  I think he's doing really well.  He's having a wonderful season, like in 2011.  He's just really consistent.  Seems like there are not many guys that can hang with him, don't have the tools or dare to go forward, or they aren't dare to serve and volley against him because he's so good on the return.  Which he is.  He's perfected his game on the hard courts, no doubt about it.   
He was always a great clay-court player, and because he moves as well as he does, he's solid and consistent now on the grass.   
To say the least, it's very impressive.  He's having unbelievable career.  You know, I think everybody knows that he knows that, as well.  Tonight is another example of that.   
Clearly he can win many of them.  He already has a ton, so obviously he's got to stay healthy and all that stuff and hungry, but obviously you would think he will win more after tonight.   
 Q.  You did the SABR, of course.  You were successful on four and didn't win four.  Pretty good.  My question is:  He obviously came up with some responses to it.  How did you feel about how it went tonight and his response?  
ROGER FEDERER: Well, I think it worked very well, and I'm sure I will use it more in the future against him and many others.  It was a really interesting last few months or so looking at that tactic.   
If you look at the points you probably have to win, you have to play them perfectly.  So could have won even more so.  Who knows?  Maybe I should have played even more of it.  I did get many more looks on the second serve as the match went on.
