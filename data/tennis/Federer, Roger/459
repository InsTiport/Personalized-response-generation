  6‑2, 6‑3 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   The conditions out there weren't easy.   How did you deal with the conditions today?   Very different from yesterday?   
ROGER FEDERER:   No, not too different.   Still very windy and cold, which makes it tough on the body.   And, yeah, I mean, that's cold, so it's a different type of an environment that I've been sort of practicing in the last few weeks, you know, in sort of during the daytimes.   This is good getting used to sort of the nighttime.  
Obviously it's very cold for all of us, but it's how it goes, you know, especially with the wind.   If the wind wasn't there, things would change quite a bit.   But like this, you're not only focusing on playing your opponent, playing point‑by‑point tactics, but also thinking of the conditions and just getting through the match unhurt.   So that's all going through your head.  
   
 Q.   It was a very quick game.   
ROGER FEDERER:   Yeah.   Again, I'm happy to come through matches easily beginning of the season, because it can, you know, be tricky when you enter, you know, sort of the first tournament of the season and right away you play an incredibly tough three‑setter, let's say.   The body feels that, and that's why I'm happy to be through into the quarterfinals without too much trouble.
