R. FEDERER/F. Lopez
  6‑3, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

Q. There were only two breaks of serve in the match. You broke him twice, but the match had the feel you were in control once you got the first break. Did you feel that way? 
ROGER FEDERER: Yeah, I mean, I did feel good, especially in the first set.
Second set a little less maybe. It was also important game to hold being down Love‑40. That's exactly the kind of match it can become. 
So as an experienced tennis player, I'm aware that matches can turn around extremely quickly.
You know, it's good I got out of that game and was able to break right away and then and bring it home. Yeah, things tend to get away from you super fast against big servers, especially on a surface that's faster like here. 
Very happy with the match. 

Q. Along the lines of being happy with the match, are you happy with your trajectory in Cincinnati? Obviously didn't play last week and hadn't played on hard. Obviously the Open is right around the corner. With respect to match play, are you right where you want to be? 
ROGER FEDERER: Yeah, I mean, I think so. I've had some really good matches, positive play patterns, good energy out on court, you know.
I arrived early here. Looking at the draw I knew how tough it was going to be, so I am really happy to be in the semis and getting a chance to play one more really good match here against Andy.
Honestly at this point it's not about preparing for the Open. It's about trying to defend my title here. I know I got my work cut out tomorrow against Andy who has had a wonderful run. 
Every since he played at Wimbledon, he brought his country home in Davis Cup, and played well in Montréal, won that, and now he's obviously very confident. He might be tired, but still, I always pick confidence over being a little bit tired.
So it's clearly going to be a tough match against him.

Q. Despite the fact that it's going to be a tough match, based on your last match against him, do you feel some extra confidence or just good feelings because of how you beat him?
ROGER FEDERER: Yeah, I think so. I've played him quite well recently. I don't know all the last few matches we played, but I feel like I've always played well against him lately.
Hasn't always been like that. He had a run of matches where was beating me maybe three, four times in a row. Wimbledon was a really good match of mine. I served great.
I'm not going to expect myself to serve this well tomorrow, but I hope I can still play somewhat close to that. There will be more baseline rallies in my opinion, even though it's going to be a day session match.
That's a switch for me going from three nights to a day now. The day plays much faster than the nighttime. 

Q. Talking of experience, I know you're saying you're focusing on Cincinnati right now. 
ROGER FEDERER: Uh‑huh.

Q. Obviously there is a lot of talk about world No. 2 and the seeding. Does that really play into your mind, or are you just prepared for a tough US Open regardless of where you end up in the draw?
ROGER FEDERER: You mean we're playing for No. 2 seed? 

Q. Yeah. 
ROGER FEDERER: No, doesn't matter. Would be great to be No. 2. It's better than No. 3, but... 

Q. But doesn't really matter to you?
ROGER FEDERER: No. Not one bit to me anyway. No. 3 is not bad for a seeding as well. Let's be honest. 

Q. Came very close to playing Rafa. Obviously lost the breaker yesterday. If he had won that you would've played him today. What are your thoughts on the state of his game at this point in time? Obviously he's not winning as much as he used to, but still competing well. Thoughts on his game, where it stands right now? 
ROGER FEDERER: Yeah, I saw a little bit of yesterday. Always going to be a tough match against Feli, Feliciano, on this kind of court for him. Rallies were longer than I thought they would be. He did a good job to stay in the rallies. 
Then of course Rafa, by not winning the French Open or dominating the clay court season, always going to be question marks. But maybe he's just had a harder time coming back from this last injury that he had compared to other ones that he had in the past where he just bounced back and ended up winning everything again.
So, I mean, it would be interesting to follow him. I don't think he's playing bad or anything. He can still just explode any week and win tournaments. He's that good. He's a legend of the game. Yeah, I'm not obviously concerned for him in my opinion.
He always keeps working on his game, and I think that's just the angle he's got to take: just keep on working and things are going to change for the better usually. 

Q. If you could, elaborate a little bit on some of the specifics that you have been working on recently with Stefan Edberg. I know you've been with him for a while now. Anything since you brought him on more recently that he implemented to your game?
ROGER FEDERER: Yeah, I mean, I thought obviously first six months were very interesting for me just to spend time and just speak to him, listen to him, what he had to say, what he thought about my game, you know, how to play on which surface, how to play when and what and how much to play in terms of scheduling and so forth.
So that was very interesting. 
I think he's been really good for the team. You know, he gets along very well with Severin, and he of course also looks up to Stefan like I do. He was a hero of ours growing up, so to be spending time together all three of us really injected a lot of energy into the team, which was nice. 
Also with my fitness coach, my physio, you name it. My wife, my agent. Everybody is really excited he's on the team.
He hasn't done this buildup block. Just after Wimbledon he was home with his family, so I did everything with Severin. Usually the hard work and hard yards I've always done with Severin for the last seven years. That's where I built up the base. 
Then it's really Stefan that's given me some specific things to tryout during the match and practice and so forth, but it's really Severin running the ship.
