A flash interview with:   
ROGER FEDERER   
 Q.  Have you been in that position before where you had to pull out so quickly?  
ROGER FEDERER: Yeah, a year ago I was in Miami and feeling sick and couldn't play against Del Potro.  I think when you're injured it's easier, almost, because you know you can't play.  Whereas when you're sick, you might feel like you could, but sometimes you've just lost so much energy overnight and you're not feeling well.   
I don't think himself, he quite knows how ill he is and what's going on.  He wants to be safe right now, and I understand that.  It's tough for the player, and it's tough for the fans, tough for the opponent.  I mean, I'm the last guy complaining because I'm moving on.   
Overall, it's a tricky situation, and sports is like that.  I think the fans know it.  That's why I came out to explain ourselves.  Tennis goes on, you know.   
I wish him, of course, good health now.   
 Q.  What does this do for your preparation for the semis now?  Does it make it any easier?  Will you do more practice or what?  
ROGER FEDERER: I was actually warming up this morning here on this court, and then when I came back to the locker room I found out.  I might go back to the practice courts and speak to the coach later on.  First just get all the obligations done that I wanted to do and have to do.   
So going out for lunch later on and can relax and spend time with the family.   
 Q.  That was a nice treat to the fans earlier on.  Tell us a little bit about how that song came about.  
ROGER FEDERER: So we were in Australia, at the Australian Open, and we had one of the off days and were hanging out with Tommy and Grigor and David Foster, and we were sort of, like, let's just have fun, let's play some music.  He said, Why don't you guys sing along?   
I actually didn't know the lyrics very well, so we were reading on the iPhone.  And next thing you know, it's like, This is too funny not to put it on social media.   
So we put it out there.  People had a blast over it, laughed at us, and I thought it was great.   
As we regrouped here, got together in Indian Wells again, we thought we could do it again, but this time kind of on a playback, making the boys actually sound nice and better and not cats and dogs singing, like in Australia.   
Now it sounds somewhat okay, but still it's so bad.  Yet I think it's actually so good.
