 SUE BARKER: Roger, I know this must be so difficult for you, but you must know how popular and what a great champion you are to the people here. They'd like to hear your thoughts on the match, because you played such a part in such a wonderful final. 
 ROGER FEDERER: Yeah, tried everything (smiling). Got a little late and everything. 
 But, look, Rafa's a deserving champion. He just played fantastically. 

 SUE BARKER: And I guess it was just the emotion of it all and all the drama, all the rain delays. You had so much to put up with today. 
 ROGER FEDERER: Yeah, didn't make it easier, but you got to expect the worst. And it's the worst opponent on the best court. 
 No, but it's been a joy again to play here. A pity couldn't win it under the circumstances, but I'll be back next year. 

 SUE BARKER: That's all we wanted to hear. That's fantastic. I know it's difficult. 
 ROGER FEDERER: Thank you. 

 SUE BARKER: Rafa, can you describe what you felt when you just fell to the floor, when you knew you were the Wimbledon champion? 
 RAFAEL NADAL: Well, is impossible to explain what I felt in that moment, no? So just very, very happy for win this title, my favorite tournament for me. It's a dream play in this court. 
 But win, I never imagine something like this. So very happy. Thank you very much, everybody. 

 SUE BARKER: But you really won it the hard way, didn't you? I mean, how did you get yourself back having lost the championship points to keep yourself so mentally strong?
 RAFAEL NADAL: Well, disappointing for me I am in the same time like the best player of the history, Roger Federer. So is very tough always play against him, especially here. I have lots of chances for win before the match. 
 But just congratulate Roger, because he always fight unbelievable. His attitude is always excellent when he win, when he lose. So just thank you very much Roger. His attitude is very good for the tennis. 

 SUE BARKER: And the fact that you beat Roger here on Centre Court in arguably one of the greatest finals we've ever seen. Does that make this even more special? 
 RAFAEL NADAL: Well, for sure, you know, win Roger here after five years, I lost the last two finals, close finals. But he's still the No. 1. He's still the best. He's still five-time champion here. Right now I have one, so for me it's very, very important day. 

 SUE BARKER: I know the first thing you wanted to do was to run up to see your father and your uncle that's been your coach and such a support to you. What did they say to you up there? 
 RAFAEL NADAL: Just thank you very much for his support, for their support all the time, coming with me, my uncle, my family. The rest of the family are there. So everybody, thank you very. 

 SUE BARKER: Big celebration planned? 
 RAFAEL NADAL: No big celebration. I forgot one thing. Just thank you very much the Prince and Princess for coming watch my final today.
