MODERATOR:  Good evening, Ladies and Gentlemen.  Roger Federer.  Questions in English first. 


Q.  You finished pretty quickly.  I think it was the best thing you could do.  How did everything go?

ROGER FEDERER:  Yeah, I'm happy I finished today, after so many breaks.  In the end it got really dark, you know.  I was happy, you know, I broke him a second time to serve it out after.  Almost lost my serve because I wanted to get out of there.  You know, most important is that I won today, and I thought I played a good match today. 

Q.  You talked in your last press conference about taking nothing for granted in Grand Slams in five-set encounters.  How do you feel going into the second week knowing you're in such good form?  Can you look a little forward?  People are looking at you as a potential champion here. 

ROGER FEDERER:  Yeah, but, you know, I'm first of all happy to be in the second week, definitely.  I'm happy I passed these tough early rounds.  Now I can look a little ahead, you know, two days, then I play my next match.  But I don't want to look further than my next opponent.  There's just no room for this, you know.  I don't want to make a mistake.  I want to keep the same attitude I had all week the first week.  I hope I can carry it along in the second week, as well. 

Q.  You looked pretty comfortable.  You used to be a player who would show emotions.  Some people say you lack this intensity.  How do you keep everything?  Do you keep your emotions inside?

ROGER FEDERER:  Yeah, I do.  You know, I'm happy when I make a good shot.  I had a few good shots today.  But, you know, I always have my moments of disappointment when I miss.  But for me I'm at a point where I don't need to show this.  I need to keep my emotions under control.  I have the feeling if I show too much, you know, it might hurt me for the next match.  The emotion's left.  I want to keep everything till the end.  This is just the way I feel right now.  It makes me feel good.  I like the way I behave, myself.  I think that is the most important. 

Q.  In Davis Cup you have a very good record.  Do you show more emotions when you're playing Davis Cup?

ROGER FEDERER:  Yeah, I do show a little more maybe, especially when I play at home.  You get so many Swiss fans traveling with you.  Obviously, you pump the fists sometimes to them.  But my matches in Davis Cup have been too easy to pump the fist, you know.  You know, have to go a little further back where I had tougher matches. 

Q.  What do you know about your next opponent? 

ROGER FEDERER:  Well, I think Lopez won.  I don't even know. 

Q.  Yes, he did. 

ROGER FEDERER:  Yeah, I mean, he's tough on grass, a lefty, big serve, you know, dangerous.  He slices.  Yeah, it's going to be a guy who comes a little more to the net.  I guess he's going to have a better chance.  I don't know, I haven't seen him play at all.  I would need to ask people or just look at his matches he's been playing.  I practiced with him one time in Halle this year.  This was his first hit on grass.  You know, he was not quite into it.  I feel  I know he's dangerous, how good he can be, he can be on grass.  He's played good matches in the past.  I have to be ready.  It's going to be tough.

Q.  How does Mardy compare to other guys of your generation?  What do you think about his game, where he could go with it?

ROGER FEDERER:  He's got a big game, definitely.  He's got a very big serve.  I think he can still improve his consistency on the serve because I really feel like he could really have a great serve.  He returns well.  Definitely he has his weaknesses also.  But there's not a weakness that looks out, you know, fully to me.  You know, especially on the grass.  Maybe on the clay, where he needs to move more, because he's quite tall and heavy, which is normal.  All the big guys are struggling to move.

Q.  Other than Andy Roddick, is he the second American of his group that might have the most potential from what you've seen?

ROGER FEDERER:  Him, I've never played Dent since '98, hit a ball.  I mean, James Blake is always up there.  People forget him just because he lost a few matches now.  But I believe that he's also right up there.  Just be patient.  You're going to have your guys, don't worry.  Country's big enough (smiling). 

Q.  I hear you follow FC Basel.  Are you a big football fan?

ROGER FEDERER:  Yeah, I did follow them a lot.  Unbelievable, what they did this year and last year.  They didn't become champion this year.  The season was too good to be not happy.  Yeah, I follow them a lot.  I try to go watch every match I can when I'm home, know a few of the players.

Q.  Do you know Hakan Yakin?

ROGER FEDERER:  Yeah.

Q.  He could be moving on.  Do you keep in touch?

ROGER FEDERER:  I heard he's going to stay. 

Q.  Do you want him to stay?

ROGER FEDERER:  I heard he's going to stay so I'm happy about that.  I also would be happy for him if he leaves and could make his marks in the international.  I heard he's going to go to Atletico or something.
