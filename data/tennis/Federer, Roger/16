Q. You have played in some big stadiums in your time. You have played some big matches. That was pretty special out there.
ROGER FEDERER: It was crazy. Oh, my God, I lost my voice on the last scream. But I just have the voice for one more match. That's all I need.
Very excited. What an atmosphere. What a match. Yeah, I'm thrilled that I was able to give something back to the team after a tough tiebreaker and also tough match with Dominic. Also to see Rafa on the sidelines after having to pull out with injury, it's great, I don't know, camaraderie I feel.
And all the people, merci beaucoup. It's amazing. Thank you.
Q. So much on the line, obviously. You knew if you went out against John, you've got to be patient. You've got the win; otherwise the World are going to win it. Is that something you're still relishing?
ROGER FEDERER: Yeah, I do, but I prefer to be able to win it with this victory, but it's been tough. Team Europe has been amazing. I'd like to give them a lot of respect for coming out and competing as well as they did this weekend.
It really is true. They have fought so hard, played so well. It's been so tough for us. Now it comes down to this.
It's super exciting, I think, for both of us, both teams and all the players. Also with Bj√∂rn and John. How happy I find this day right now. It's still going on, and I hope you guys are going to make more noise than ever before for this last match with Sascha.
Q. Obviously you're hoping that this Swiss crowd doesn't stay neutral for the next one. Does the fact that Sascha won it for you in Chicago, is that a big plus for your team?
ROGER FEDERER: Yes, I hope so. He's a great player, good guy, confident, exactly the right amount. That's what we needed in a final match.
He thought actually that me or Rafa should play the last one. We said, No, you should.
So there you have it. We will support him all the way. I hope the match is going to live up to the expectations. All the matches have been so close, and I'm sure this one is going to go to the wire, too.
We're ready to go. Please make some noise if you support Team Europe, of course.
