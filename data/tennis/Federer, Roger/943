THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 


Q.  What sort of shape are you in, Roger?

ROGER FEDERER:  I felt pretty good out there, actually.  I started the match really well, so I'm really happy the way it went.  Second set he start to serve much better, so it got a little tough.  Had some tough moments there.  So I think that's also good that I got out of them.  And it's going to help me for next match.

Q.  What are your expectations for the next one?  

ROGER FEDERER:  I think it's Vacek or Portas.  So I've played Portas once on grass.  So that's not going to say too much.  Vacek, I don't even really know how he plays, so I really don't know.  I have to maybe go and study them a little bit or ask guys how they play, just to get a little bit more feedbacks.
