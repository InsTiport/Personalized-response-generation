THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Roger, please.  
 
 
Q.  Looks like Agassi has just won his match.  You take him on in the next round.  What's your mindset going into that match? 
 
ROGER FEDERER:  Well, seeing a draw the beginning of the week, I was hoping to play him in the fourth round.  But you don't really think about that yet, because you've got too many matches to come. So now that it's a fact, I'm looking forward to it.  Most likely we gonna play on center court, so it's nice to play here.  
 
Q.  Physically how do you feel?  I mean, this match you just played, it was a three-set match but it went all the way.  How do you feel right now, particularly with the heat?
 
ROGER FEDERER:  I feel pretty good, I have to say.  My injury doesn't bother me.  So that's a really good sign.  I'm saving a lot of energy by winning my matches fairly easy.  So I'm happy the way I played today, and it was a good test.  I really hope I can carry it over to the match against Agassi.  
 
Q.  You have this great record against us Americans.  What's the deal?  What's your one secret ingredient for doing so well against the Americans this year? 
 
ROGER FEDERER:  Well, I just like the aggressive baseline play they have.  They play, there's a lot of risk, hard-hitting from the baseline.  So I'm very similar, but it seems like I do it better than the other guys.  It's  -- I don't know why.  But Agassi, of course, is maybe the toughest American right now.  So it's gonna be a tough one.  
 
Q.  Pete and Andre have been sort of the big figures in tennis over the past era.  What would it mean to you to beat them back-to-back, in back-to-back Slams?
 
ROGER FEDERER:  Well, it hasn't happened yet so I still have some work to do on that.  Beating Pete in Wimbledon was something to me very special.  He was like my favorite player when I was growing up, alongside Becker and Edberg.  Agassi, I mean, my game's totally different to Agassi's game.  So I could never compare myself to him or anything like that.  And I don't know, but it will be a huge success for me if I could beat him here. 
 
Q.  So the Bryans said that they always had Agassi posters up in their room.  I assume you had no Agassi posters?
 
ROGER FEDERER:  No, no Agassi posters for me.  I had Edberg and I think Sampras.  
 
Q.  Where did you get the beads?  What do they stand for? 
 
ROGER FEDERER:  The necklace?  
 
Q.  Yes. 
 
ROGER FEDERER:  I don't know.  First I had a gold necklace from my mother once for birthday.  That one got too small then, and somehow I got into these surfer necklaces.  So I liked them, I started to buy them.  I have a whole collection of them. 
 
Q.  So this is one in a series?
 
ROGER FEDERER:  Exactly.  
 
Q.  Do you surf?
 
ROGER FEDERER:  I don't know, no.  (Laughing).  But I like the beach, so... 
 
Q.  What beaches do you like? 
 
ROGER FEDERER:  Well, I like Miami, South Beach, Key Biscayne, South Africa, Capetown, a lot of places.  Sydney. 
 
Q.  You haven't shared any surfing stories with Guga, though?
 
ROGER FEDERER:  No, not yet. 
 
Q.  How do you think your game has evolved since Wimbledon?  And why do you think you're doing so well this year? 
 
ROGER FEDERER:  Well, I mean since Wimbledon, not much has happened.  I was injured for like six weeks.  I just played the tournament in Gstaad the week after.  But I had to take treatment from then on.  So I haven't been working at all on my game.  I started to hit an hour a day, so, yeah, I don't know if for five sets my physic is good enough.  But I think so, because I don't play with  -- I'm not very tight when I play.  So my looseness gets me through the long matches. 
 
Q.  A lot of people came out for Goran in Split.  Let's say you and Martina both go through here and win here.  What do you think they would do in Switzerland?
 
ROGER FEDERER:  I have no idea.  I mean, I don't know, maybe two people waited for me at the airport in Basel after the win against Sampras.  So I don't know if the Swiss are the same as the Croatians.  But Goran has been around much longer than I have been, so I mean everybody was, like, hoping so much for him to win that Wimbledon.  For us, it will be little bit different because we're much younger.
