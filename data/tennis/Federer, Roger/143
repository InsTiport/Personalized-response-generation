LAVER CUP PRESS CONFERENCE
EUROPE vs. THE WORLD
Prague, Czech Republic
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What are you expecting from this competition?
NICK KYRGIOS: Expecting a lot of fun, but at the same time I know that it's going to be -- I mean, obviously I think we're definitely the underdogs going into it, but I think, you know, we've got the weapons and we can definitely win this competition.
Yeah, I love the team event.  I love to get behind my teammates and do everything I can as a competitor and as a team player to get the win.  I'm really looking forward to it.
Q. John Isner, how does it feel to play on a black surface?
JOHN ISNER: It's going to be interesting.  Haven't played on it yet.  Haven't even practiced on it yet.  But from everything our team has heard, it's an extremely nice court.
It will be a little bit different to get used to the optics of the black court, but I think after one or two days on practice, it will seem to all of us just like any other court.
So I think it's very unique.  This event is very unique.  So I think the black court is going to be very cool.
Q. A question for both Rafa and Roger.  We know that you love team competition.  Please compare Davis Cup to Laver Cup.
ROGER FEDERER: Well, we haven't seen this one yet, so it's hard to -- I know the format, but we still have to wait for the weekend, in my opinion, and it's totally separate.  This one is condensed to three very intense days and then that's it for a year; whereas Davis Cup sort of rolls through the year four times.
I really don't like the comparison between the two, because they are very different.  Like John said, this is a very unique event.  It's new.  We're holding it for the first time; whereas Davis Cup has a very rich history behind it.
Both work very well.  Both seem very exciting.  I mean, Davis Cup has been, and I hope this one also in hopefully a long, long time from now, will be very special for the players to always wanting to play and always wanting to represent their country, and respectfully, their continent, if you like.
RAFAEL NADAL: Well, something a little bit similar, no?  It's difficult to compare.  We don't have experience on the Laver Cup yet, but at the same time it's exciting.  I tell you one thing, no, when the best players of the world are playing always, it's going to be very exciting, no?  Doesn't matter the format.
And the real thing is here we are, we have a great team, and the World Team has a great team, too.  So going to be interesting, no?
Going to be close.  The most important thing is that's for sure going to be emotional, no?  Because with the format that every day there is the value of the victories are more points going to be very, very interesting.  Playing super-tiebreak in third set going to be, all the matches, close.  Anything could happen.  Going to be the confrontation very emotional, probably.
We're happy that we're playing here at home for the first time and we hope to be ready for it.
Q. A question for Nadal regarding the US Open.  How did you recover?  How did you prepare for Laver Cup?
RAFAEL NADAL: I didn't practice yet here.  Of course after US Open, after big event, you go down a little bit.  You need to recover energy.
I practiced a little bit at home last two days, but I am very looking forward to practice this afternoon and see how the court, how it plays, the court.  Everybody told me that it is amazing, big stadium, and beautiful.
I'm very excited to go there and see the facility, no?  So I have today and tomorrow to practice hard.  And let's see, then, when the captain decide.
I'm very excited to play here, and yeah, to have all these great players next to me, being part of something amazing and really looking forward to it.
