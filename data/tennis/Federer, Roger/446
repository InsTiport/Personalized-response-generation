  4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3


ROGER FEDERER:   Maybe.   Actually played pretty good considering again it was a high standard of match on both sides.   We did have our own chances.   Maybe they were just a touch better than us today and it showed in the score. 
We had our chances, played well for a long time actually.   Sometimes we struggled a bit too much.   But they deserved it. 

Q.   Clearly they came in here and went about their jobs. 
ROGER FEDERER:   I think they did really well.   I think they played well in the singles and the doubles, too.   It's a pity we couldn't go to Sunday, but that is how it is, unfortunately. 
Sure, it's disappointing, but we're not too down about it.   We have respect for their performance.   They did really well.   We had missed opportunities. 

Q.   Did you underestimate the capability of the U.S. team to play on red clay, captain? 
CAPTAIN LUTHI:   For sure not.   I mean, we knew that it was going to be a very difficult tie for us on any surface.   That's what it was. 
We know, for example, that Isner is dangerous on every surface.   Mardy is a topâ€‘10 player.   He's going to be a tough one anyway.   We didn't underestimate them at all.   For sure we wished for another result, but it has nothing to do with underestimation.
