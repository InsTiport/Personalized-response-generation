R. FEDERER/L. Mayer   
6-1, 7-6   
 Q.  Your thoughts on the day?  
ROGER FEDERER: Yeah, it's been more tricky, I'd say, for the fans more than anything.  Waiting around all day and hardly seeing any tennis obviously is never fun for the tournament and the fans.  So we're happy that the tournament is back underway.   
Today I tried to really focus on just the one match, not thinking that there is possibly going to be two.  But obviously I'm very happy with my first round today against Mayer.   
Playing Stan obviously is always very special, especially after what we have gone through the last few years with my knee surgery but especially his, which was even bigger and more difficult.   
So I'm very happy that he's back.  You know, it's been just a bit over 10 years since we celebrated Olympic gold medals together.  A lot has happened since.   
And, yeah, I'm excited for a second match today.  Last time I had that I think it probably was in Gstaad in 2004.
