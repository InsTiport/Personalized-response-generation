THE MODERATOR:  Thank you, Ladies and Gentlemen.  First question in English, please, for Roger. 


Q.  Could you tell us what happened to you in the first and second game with your back. 

ROGER FEDERER:  Well, it happened in the warm-up, so I can't really tell you what happened, you know.  I just couldn't move anymore, so I had to call the trainer and hope for a wonder.  It was very tough for me.  I don't know.  I can't still now explain what happened.  Of course, you know, I feel it now.  It doesn't go away like this.  I don't know how I won today.  But that's all right, you know (smiling).

Q.  Is it something that has already happened to you?

ROGER FEDERER:  No, no, not like this, no. 

Q.  And so where did it bother you?  In the serve? 

ROGER FEDERER:  Just in the back. 

Q.  Was it serving when it bothered you?

ROGER FEDERER:  Yeah, a little bit, everything.  Yeah, it was totally blocked.  You know, I was always under a lot of pain.  As the match went on, of course, it went and got a little bit better because, you know, your body gets warm.  Really, you get into it.  You try to forget it.  You know, it got better as the match went on, so... 

Q.  You're won, now you're in the quarterfinals.  How does that feel?

ROGER FEDERER:  Yeah, I mean, for me, you know, I didn't think that I would sit here today as the winner after this shock I had today.  You know, I have to try to take this lucky, lucky match today and try to get rid of this and then be ready for the quarters, because it's a great opportunity I have now.  And I'll try to use it, you know. 

Q.  You seem to be pretty down right now, no? 

ROGER FEDERER:  Yeah, I'm a little bit exhausted, yeah, because of everything what happened today, yes.  It's not something usual, you know.  It's against you.  Just my reaction now, I don't know (smiling).
