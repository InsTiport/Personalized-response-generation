THE MODERATOR:  First question for Roger, please.  
 
 
Q.  How does this compare with other victories, other big victories that you've had so far?
 
ROGER FEDERER: It's for sure one of the top victories I have now.  I mean to play in Basel, in Davis Cup and everything together, it just gives it a great mixture.  And I'm very happy to win this first Davis Cup tie.  I mean, the most important is that I got this first point for the team, and I really hope that Michel can win. I don't think I'm playing alone on this team.  I need some help to win this tournament  -- to win this tie.  (Laughing.) Sorry.  And, yeah, I'm really looking forward to see Michel win also.  
 
Q.  More satisfying than Milan?
 
ROGER FEDERER: Well, it's tough to say.  In Milan I won four matches, I think, in a row.  Four or five, yeah, five in a row.  Here now it's one match.  But it's something very special.  As I told you, Davis Cup here in Basel, and I don't know, a lot of fans watching also.  My family's here.  I don't know, it just is nice.
