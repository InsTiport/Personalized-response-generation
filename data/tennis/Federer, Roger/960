THE MODERATOR:  First question for Roger, please. 


Q.  How do you feel about the match?

ROGER FEDERER: Yeah, it was a good match today.  I'm happy about it.  Three straight sets, it's always good to stay under two hours, it's good for the condition.  I had a lot of unforced errors.  I think I can really improve still for next match.  But otherwise I'm happy to be through to the third round. 

Q.  Your feelings about the Davis Cup tie with out Sampras and Agassi playing next time? How do you feel?

ROGER FEDERER: Well, better for us, obviously.  With Sampras and Agassi, they're really tough.  But now they're coming with Gambill, Woodruff, Todd Martin, I don't know.  But we're gonna have a better chance, and I think home in Basel, we have a good chance maybe to beat these guys, yeah.
