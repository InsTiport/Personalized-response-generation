   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.  Q.  Was that one of the quicker ones that you've ever played?  ROGER FEDERER:  Well, absolutely.  I mean, I've had some over the years, obviously, but this one I think was maybe the second fastest on clay.  I remember I had one in Rome 6-1, 6-1 against Robredo a couple years ago.  So this was unexpected really because I didn't play well in the first round.  Then now to play so different two days later, it's quite incredible actually.  Q.  What clicked?  Do you know why you suddenly switched into top gear?  ROGER FEDERER:  I don't know, you know.  I guess a little doubles here and there helps.  I just thought, you know, from the start I felt good today, even though in the locker room I was getting impatient to get on the court, you know, and had to warm up several times for the match.  I was really getting sort of ready to play and it never really happened.  So once I got out there, you know, I don't know, I played very free, I played very good.  So I'm very happy the way I played, and everything worked out how I want it to.  I couldn't have played any better almost, I think.  Q.  Can we have a football question.  As Arsenal have two Swiss center backs, are you going to support Arsenal tonight against Villareal?  ROGER FEDERER:  Yeah, I'm not even going to watch it, to be honest.  I hope they win, yeah.  Yeah, I hope Senderos is gonna have a good game, yeah (smiling).  Q.  Is Pierre here?  ROGER FEDERER:  He left just now.  End of FastScripts...
