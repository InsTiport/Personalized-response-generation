R. FEDERER/J. Sousa
6-4, 6-3
(Transcribed from recorded ATP audio.)
ROGER FEDERER: -- different conditions, I don't know if the score would have been different.  From that standpoint, I'm happy we got to play a good match.  I think it's a slippery court here, I must say.  It's tough to play I think for all the players.
Every clay court plays slightly different:  Monaco, Madrid, Barcelona, here, Paris.  I think when it's a bit nicer weather here, it slides a lot.
I came out of the blocks well, had a good feeling.  Didn't get broken.  That on clay in a first round is a good sign.
Q. We'll see you again later today.  Unusual situation because of the rain yesterday.  How are you going to prepare for this match?  How challenging is it?
ROGER FEDERER: Yeah, I mean, I think, like any other practice day when you play twice a day, you finish the first session, take a shower, eat something, relax, get ready for the next one.
The good thing is that this one was not very physical.  I think it gives me some good information.  I believe it's going to be similar conditions in the match this afternoon.
The interesting thing is I played today, he didn't.  Is that an advantage?  Is that a disadvantage?  I don't know.  Borna is tough.  I lost to him a couple times last year.  He played really good against me in Halle, Shanghai.
Regardless of the surface, I know it's going to be tough.
