THE MODERATOR:  First question, please. 


Q.  Roger, that second set more into a tiebreak, framed a couple of shots.  Looked like you were dead in the water.  Then all of a sudden, everything suddenly fell into place.  What happened?

ROGER FEDERER: Well, it's true.  I was little unsure in the breaker.  I didn't feel good after serving for the set then suddenly being in the breaker.  I had little bit lucky smash when I hit on the baseline.  It could have gone out, either way.  I kept coming and tried my best to stay in the game.  I'm happy the way I fought today and at the end I came up with some great shots.


Q.  Did you have a difficult time finding a rhythm out there?

ROGER FEDERER: I think obviously against Philippoussis it's not easy to get the rhythm because he's serving at 130 nonstop.  So it's  -- you don't get a lot of rallies, and when you serve, he misses quite a bit or the rallies don't take look.  I wasn't really happy about my game today, but somehow I got through and that's what's most important.
