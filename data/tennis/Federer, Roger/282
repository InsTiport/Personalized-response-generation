 R. FEDERER/A. Murray
  6‑0, 6‑1 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
   
 Q.   Tonight it was too perfect from your part and Murray was not there?   What is your opinion of such a match?  
ROGER FEDERER:   Yeah, I mean, I think the surface here doesn't forgive much.   I think if there's a slight difference of the level from the baseline, hard to get out of it.   We've seen it all week.   The serve doesn't have that much impact.   
I didn't even necessarily serve so well.   But you got to play the right way here, use the court to your advantage as much as you can.   
But I had the upper hand from the baseline, which hasn't always happened against him.   But I definitely was able to play on my terms.   For me, things went very well.   I was able to put Andy under pressure very often, and I think the match couldn't have gone any better for me really.   
   
 Q.   One professional player once said you're only in the zone two or three times a year.   Do you agree with that?   Were you in the zone tonight?  
ROGER FEDERER:   Yeah, I mean, I don't know.   Definitely had a few occasions where I felt like this is a good night.   This is definitely one of them.   But at the same time I also don't think Andy played his very best.   It wasn't a finals.   It was a round robin.   I had already qualified after the first set.   He was already out.   The circumstances were not quite the same.   
Nevertheless, it's a big opportunity, huge arena, with a very even head‑to‑head.   We've had tough matches in the past.   It's a match you don't want to lose.   That's why I kept pushing for it and tried to get to the finish line as quick as I could.   
   
 Q.   You were the only one the other night who said actually this surface probably is the reason for these straight, easy matches.   How do you explain it?   Last year you had the same surface.   Is there something you notice that has really changed?  
ROGER FEDERER:   No, it's the same.   It's just matchups.   
   
 Q.   Why last year didn't this happen and this year it's happening?  
ROGER FEDERER:   Because of the matchups, depending on who plays whom, how the players are in shape.   If there's a bit too big of a gap between the two players, next thing you know, it's a blowout.   
Don't know why that is.   I guess it's just too easy returning second serves here.   It's hard to get free points off the second serve.   Yeah, that's what it is.   That's how it feels anyway.   
   
 Q.   What does it feel being up 6‑0, 5‑0 on one of your toughest rivals?   
ROGER FEDERER:   Yeah, not so cool because I wouldn't want to be in that position.   I was happy to get it done.   At the end I was happy I didn't win the second to last game to be quite honest.   
Yeah, it's uncomfortable.   I don't know.   I don't like it.   
   
 Q.   You said a few times this week you were glad to see that Andy had found a good run of form since the US Open.   What do you sense with him?   Is it a confidence thing still when he plays the top three guys?  
ROGER FEDERER:   I think he played Djokovic a ton as of late.   I don't know how he played Rafa.   
   
 Q.   The French was the last time.   
ROGER FEDERER:   Okay.   Yeah, that's Rafa's battleground.   So, I mean, yeah, I think he's definitely had to work very hard to come back to a level that he's happy with.   
But if I can compare just slightly to me, because I guess we've had some similar issues in the last couple of years.   You just tend to be up and down, especially against the top players.   There's just that little bit of doubt maybe that you need to play unbelievably well and the other guy you hope he doesn't play his best.   Only then maybe you can get it done.   
Maybe he has those kind of confidence issues.   I went through exactly the same last year.   It's like an up‑and‑down battle.   Every point is complicated.   Every day is complicated.   At the same time you do have your good days, you have your okay days.   But they're not so often.   
So I think the off‑season is going to be big for Andy.   I'm confident for him that next year he's going to be much more solid throughout, he's going to be happier in the process, and he's going to be playing better tennis.   
   
 Q.   There's obviously a lot going on for you this weekend and next weekend.   How do you manage to control the anxiety, if there is any?   Do you feel like there's a huge chance because you still haven't won the Davis Cup yet?  
ROGER FEDERER:   Haven't won anything yet.   It all looks very nice right now as we speak, but who knows in the next 10 days how bad it's going to get.   
I'm aware of that.   Moods change very quickly.   I hope it's going to be a tough and long weekend.   Not just an not 1 hour 10, me getting blown off the court, 6‑3, 6‑3 match.   
I'm realistic.   I know that only the big match is coming up now.   I've been very pleased how I've played the last few months.   Unbelievably happy how the round robin has gone because I did expect it to be much tougher than it ended up being.   I lost to Raonic in Paris.   Kei has shown nice form.   So has Andy.   
I'm very pleased how things have gone.   But this is now the business end.   This is where I want to play my best and finish already a very good season I've had to make it a great season.   
So next 10 days are going to be very big for me.   I'm aware of that.   I'm happy to get a day's rest tomorrow and lock my mind into the next 10 days.   This is going to be my last break, so to speak.   
   
 Q.   There's quite a good chance you could play Stan in the semifinals.   How good would that be to play him here, especially of playing with him at the Davis Cup?  
ROGER FEDERER:   Well, I don't know what he needs to do to win.   I just hope he beats Cilic and makes it somehow, whatever that scenario is.   I'd love to play against Stan here in the semis.   It would be historic for us to make it for a second consecutive year into the semis.   If we play each other, it's a good thing that one of us is going to go to the finals.   
It's an extra match for Stan, in particular.   It's an opportunity for both of us to play a quality match ahead of Davis Cup.   
But honestly Davis Cup is so far away in my mind right now.   We care about playing very well here.   I'm very happy I'm getting to play an extra match because I want to arrive in France with a lot of matches in my legs.   I wouldn't want it any other way.   
I'm happy that Stan has also picked up his level.   I hope he can qualify and make it special for the weekend.   
   
 Q.   Very unusual event for fans.   They only get one singles match per session.   They've all been very short.   Is there anything the tournament can do to give people a better show?   
ROGER FEDERER:   I don't know if the people are disappointed or sad or whatever it is.   But I don't think they are.   True tennis fans are not because they know it can happen.   Can't make it best‑of‑five on the guys.   It would be too tough.   There is doubles.   Doubles is fun.   They put on a great show.   
I think the tournament organizers try everything to make this an unbelievable place.   I mean, the venue is fantastic.   Still the fans are going to come.   
I hope that you guys don't kill it, you know, because you guys have a bit of a say in this.   Don't write negative about it because we've seen some good tennis.   If you write too much about it, then we might see a reaction.   But if you guys stay positive, it would be very helpful.   So thank you (smiling).
