R. FEDERER/J. Chardy
  6‑2, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please. 

Q.   Can you give us your verdict on the match today. 
ROGER FEDERER:   Yeah, I thought Jeremy didn't serve very well, and I felt good on the return.   So I was in a lot of the service games when he was serving. 
Then I thought I served well, had a high first‑serve percentage and was able to control the baseline.   On clay, things move ahead very quickly, I must say. 

Q.   I want to ask you generally about which surface you like playing on the best.   I don't mean which surface you have the best results on necessarily.   If I just said to you, You can go and play a match this afternoon, for you to enjoy, what would you choose?
ROGER FEDERER:   Uhm, I don't know.   Probably go on grass just because it's the surface I've played fewest in my career on.   It's only a month long, you know, the whole season.   I find it's so different.   I feel like you have to come to the net a little bit.   You have to do a bit of everything. 
Yeah, that's the surface I would choose. 

Q.   Do you play back matches or situations in your mind while you're in the middle of a match?   In the second set when he broke you back, did you recall Rome last year at all?
ROGER FEDERER:   It might have entered my mind a little bit because it was the only match we've ever played against each other on clay.   But then things are so different there.   It was right after the birth of Leo and Lenny.   It was unbelievably windy.   You couldn't slide anymore because almost all the sand had gone. 
Yeah, you think for one second because it would have been to serve to go up 3‑Love in the second.   It was actually a big game to go 6‑2, 3‑Love.   Instead you're 3‑1.   You're like, Really?   That's your reaction when you get broken. 
It can happen.   I had a bad start to the game.   After that he maybe gained a little bit of confidence and hit the ball a bit better.   So I just tried to break right back, which I was able to do.   That was crucial in the second set.
THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French. 

Q.   If he wins, you might have to play Monfils.   Will that be a revenge after Lille?
ROGER FEDERER:   Well, the preparation is different.   Instead of playing just one hour before a match on clay, this time I had 10 days and I'm better prepared.   I feel more confident than I was in Lille. 
GaÃ«l is such a player.   He has capacities that other players don't have, physically, also because of his power on the forehand and the backhand.   It is a real challenge to play him. 
Often the problem is not on your own racquet against him. 

Q.   But you do like to play against him? 
ROGER FEDERER:   Yes.   The rallies are different.   He stays behind the baseline.   He used to, because now he's coming up to the net more.   But he still needs to beat Dolgopolov, who is a real tough player. 
I practiced with Dolgopolov.   But in Miami he was not well.   It is always a pleasure to play against GaÃ«l.   He's a nice guy.   We had a good time in India when we played doubles.   We really enjoyed it, and we talk about it in the locker room all the time.   It was just one set, but it was fun. 

Q.   You seem to be very calm and composed. 
ROGER FEDERER:   Well, it felt good in practice.   I was able to try all types of conditions.   It was cold, it was warm, the ball was bouncing higher.   Today the weather was more mitigated. 
I was surprised he was not able to find his serving zone.   The conditions were slower here.   I found it easy to get into the rally and to dictate the points. 
I believe he didn't really play a good match today.   But it's difficult to make any kind of judgment after a 55‑minute match. 

Q.   You played very aggressive.   It's no problem for you to do that on clay, too. 
ROGER FEDERER:   Well, not always.   On clay you also need to defend.   Sometimes the rallies are long.   It's not always because you decide to do that. 
But still, I believe it's important for me to keep going forward.   You can't just decide to stay back and slide.   But you need to find and choose the right moment. 

Q.   So that's the goal, whatever player you have to play, Dolgopolov or GaÃ«l?   You intend to be very aggressive? 
ROGER FEDERER:   I think it will depend on each individual point.   Some opponents can be very dangerous.   Sometimes you just need not to make the mistake yourself. 
But if the opponent stays back and gives you the opportunity, then you should go to the net.   The best players can do both.   Most of the time I will try to be aggressive.   But like today, I sometimes stayed back to try to play higher balls. 
I will decide with my coach what I'm going to do. 

Q.   If you win next round, you will have 200 victories on clay.   Does that figure mean something to you?
ROGER FEDERER:   Well, it's nice.   I've been struggling on clay for a long time.   I think overall I have a thousand victories.   200 seems little in comparison.   Also the clay court season is shorter. 
I just played seven months in a row on hard courts.
