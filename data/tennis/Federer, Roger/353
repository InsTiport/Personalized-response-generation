THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   You got off to a slow start.   Talk us through the opening set.   
ROGER FEDERER:   Yeah, I think it was a combination of two things, that Lleyton played good.   Definitely got a lot of returns back and put the pressure on me from the baseline.   I really was struggling with all sorts of rhythm.  
I wouldn't say I was serving poorly, but it was just a tough set for me.   I was put on the back foot very often.   In quick conditions to find the rhythm is a difficult thing, because it's almost something you don't want to be looking.   
You want to keep playing your game and hope that things turn around for you eventually.  
Kind of did in the second set, so that was better.  
   
 Q.   How are you going physically after the week?   You had doubles and singles this week.   
ROGER FEDERER:   Yeah, I mean, I feel actually pretty good considering playing five sets yesterday and coming out and playing another three‑setter today.   And the warmer weather the last couple days in particular.  
Yeah, I'm looking back now, last three, four months it's been very positive going through Basel, Paris, and London, all three weeks in a row where I played a lot of matches, a lot of three‑setters as well.  
Went through all of December.   Probably practiced more than all the guys ranked you ahead of me because they were playing exhibitions and all that stuff.   Then I did that for a full month, a lot of training there, and now here I had another busy week and I'm actually holding up very good.  
So that's a good sign moving into 2014.  
   
 Q.   You served very with the in the third apart from that one game.   Is that a concentration thing?   
ROGER FEDERER:   Don't quite remember exactly what happened, but it's definitely a game I have regrets on.   I don't exactly remember what happened, so it's hard for me to pinpoint what went wrong.  
I think on the deuce side I missed too many first serves.   Maybe instead of going wide I went down the T.   Missed a few of those, ever though it's probably the safer serve to hit.  
Lleyton did a good job hanging around, but I should have taken advantage already earlier I think in the 1‑All, 2‑All games.   So I have some regrets there.  
It's unfortunately one of those matches that got away from me.   I got to try to do better job next time around when I get in this position.  
   
 Q.   You said physically you feel good after the last couple months.   Form‑wise going into Melbourne how do you feel?  
ROGER FEDERER:   Yeah, pretty good, especially having played all the matches I have here now with the doubles in particular.   It's a good thing.   Didn't quite know what to expect from myself before the tournament.   
I played consistent, I must say.   No breaks in the first three matches and then rough first set, but then after that was able to sort of clean it up and play solid, I would say, for the remainder.  
I didn't play great today which is a bit unfortunate, but also Lleyton was the best player I played this week.   He made it toughest on me.   So I have a clear idea what I need to work on, and I have a clear idea where my mind and body is that.  
I'm very hungry and eager to attack the Australian Open next week.   
   
 Q.   How do you rate this match against Lleyton compared to other matches you've played against him?   
ROGER FEDERER:   Yeah, I mean, I think conditions were definitely a little faster this time around than what we've played in the past.   We've played on some faster courts, but there was less rallies as such.  
Also, I don't know if he played more aggressive or me, too.   I was making a lot of the shots early on, so also we didn't have the classical rallies we usually have against each other.   He's definitely adjusted his game throughout his career as well.   He's hit thing the ball more flat.   
He doesn't allow you to come to the net as much anymore like he used to before back in the day.   He used to almost make you come in and then pass you and frustrate you that way.   
So he's changed that around a little bit because of the power game that exists in today's game.  
   
 Q.   Do you whether Stefan watched that match?   And what would you work with him about in Melbourne?  
ROGER FEDERER:   He'll arrive in a week's time.   I don't know if he did see the match.   I think he did see the Chardy match.  
Yeah, that's an interesting question.   I don't know what he's going to say after this week or this match if he did see it or not.   That's for me to find out and give him call and speak about it.   
I already had a good conversation with Severin just now for a while, just how we're going to go about it for the next week, what we need to work on, and how was this week overall, you know.  
Pretty pleased just that my body is holding up good in the first week, because you don't quite know what to expect.   So overall many good things, but then also a couple things you need to just readjust maybe, and also get to Melbourne and see what the court speed is down there and then you'll have a real good idea of what you need to work on.  
   
 Q.   What would be a good Australian Open for you?   How do you set the bar?   
ROGER FEDERER:   I haven't thought about it a whole lot, you know.   I think I can play very well.   Depends on how I play more than anything right now.   Just need to make sure I‑‑ I think I was able to sort of serve better overall, more consistent this week than I have in a long time.   So that's very good.  
And then as you move along, hopefully you'll get more and more confidence.   I definitely needed a little bit more confidence to play well and hopefully win the tournament and so forth.  
But I'm not thinking too far ahead.   I'm not thinking short‑term.   I'm definitely going there to hopefully be there for a long time and putting myself in a good position.  
   
 Q.   You had no problem at all with your back today?  
ROGER FEDERER:   No.   No.   I was feeling good.
