  6-1, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.

 Q. If you could give us your thoughts on tonight's match with Roger Federer.
 DAVID FERRER: Well, I think I serve very bad through all the match, and this was the key, no? With Roger, is impossible to take the chance if you no serve good.
 The first set, I play a little bit nervous. The second set I improve my game. But Roger, he serve really good when I have one chance or two chance.

 Q. The second set was very close. Do you feel a little hard done by that score line?
 DAVID FERRER: Well, not close, no? But maybe I improve my game. I play better, feel good maybe in the second set. This important for to good play the next match, no?

 Q. Federer had quite a bit of support in the crowd during the match. Did that affect you at the start of the match?
 DAVID FERRER: Well, is normal. Is the No. 2 of the world and the best player of the history. Always when plays Federer, the people support more him than the other players.

 Q. The bounces are very low here. Is it okay for you or not really?
 DAVID FERRER: No, I played with this surface in Valencia and I won the tournament, no? I win all that. It's similar. The court is very similar what we are playing all the year.

 Q. At 5-4 in the second set, on the breakpoint, you made a crucial mistake on your forehand. Do you remember that?
 DAVID FERRER: Well, maybe I have the chance there, no? But I have an easy ball for to get 5-All. But when I lost this point, Federer serve really good. Is very difficult.
 I take my chance there, a little bit chance. But, you know, if I fault I need to play very good to beat him.

 Q. This year you changed your racquet. What is the weight and how much are the strings?
 DAVID FERRER: Well, with the racquet, I have more power, no? I played a lot of time with the other one, the white one. I think I improve my serve with this racquet. Not today, because today I serve very bad (smiling). But I improve my serve and volley with this racquet.
 Maybe, of course, I play better this season for the racquet.

 Q. How much are the string?
 DAVID FERRER: Well, the string is 24, 23 kilos.

 Q. All the time?
 DAVID FERRER: All the time. Sometimes I change. Depends of the surface. But normally I play with this tension.
