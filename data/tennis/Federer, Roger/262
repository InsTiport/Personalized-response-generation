 R. FEDERER/R. Gasquet
  6‑1, [Ret.] 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Can you offer us any insight on what Richard's problem was?   We had no idea out there.   
ROGER FEDERER:   You mean like if he told me anything?   
   
 Q.   Yeah.   
ROGER FEDERER:   No.   He just said he couldn't keep playing anymore, and to me it looked more like back, but then again, that's assuming from the other side of the court.  
But I felt like I sensed it right away maybe when it happened.   If he's gonna say he felt it in the second game, then I would be surprised.   I felt like it happened at 5‑1, 30‑Love, maybe a score like that.  
Yeah.   I know enough about the back and I know how horrible it is to play with that and how much worse it can sometimes become.   So I guess if it is back, you know pretty much how bad it is a couple of points right after that.   Especially being down 5‑1 in a match like this it's always going to be tough.   It's maybe better not to take any chances at this point.  
   
 Q.   You're obviously happy with the way you played?  
ROGER FEDERER:   Yeah, I mean, I think I played well.   I served well.   Then again, you know, the test was so short that it's tough to judge on a 20‑minute match.  
But, you know, I think I was hitting the ball well again like yesterday.   I felt able to play aggressive and do what I was hoping to do, so I was very pleased, actually.  
   
 Q.   Next game is against Coric, a man who has beaten Nadal and Gulbis and Murray today.   He sees himself very similar to Djokovic on his game.   What's your opinion of him in the next match?  
ROGER FEDERER:   I think I can tell you much more tomorrow, but I have seen some of it against Nadal in Basel, and then I only saw three games today.   So other than that, I haven't really seen him play much or at all, to be honest.   So I think I can give you a proper answer tomorrow.   
But I agree probably he is more into the Djokovic kind of type of player from the baseline, very steady.   Moves well.   Bigger guy, as well.   Can serve well, you know.  
He seems to really play up when it matters against the better players.   Today I think it was a great victory.   I didn't see any of the match, so I can't tell about Murray's level.   But regardless of the level, to beat Murray 6‑1, 6‑3, it was, it's a great score.   Because historically Murray has played very well here in Dubai.   It's definitely a message I get (smiling).   
   
 Q.   When you play somebody brand new to you, do you sit down with Severin and talk about what Severin knows about him?   Do you formulate a game plan in that respect, or do you just say, It doesn't matter what the guy on the other side of the net is going to do.   We're going to play this way?  
ROGER FEDERER:   Yeah, I think that we may be slightly naive.   I think that's maybe underestimating the opponent, or you're just going in very confident.   
But I think the thing is if you do get surprised and you are all of a sudden in a tussle and you don't know enough about his game, it would have been good to maybe know some of his weaknesses.   And then clearly you need to understand how the court plays and his preferences maybe about serving, where he goes on the bigger points, maybe his tendencies a bit.   
You know, it's helpful, but at the same time I do agree and do believe you have to go with your strengths.   Severin would maybe go ask other players, as well, if there is still anybody around from today until tomorrow to find out what they have to say maybe about Coric who have maybe played him.  
Or then you just check online maybe or you try to get some matches, like the Nadal match, and you break it down a bit more and see how he played there.   I mean, I remember seeing some of it, but then you forget how he played on the big points and all that.  
What I do remember is he makes very little errors, and I think that's why he is able to put a lot of the top guys under pressure, as well.     A top guy would maybe expect a guy like that to go away eventually.   If he doesn't, that can surprise you.   
   
 Q.   Photography, the noise in the court when you're in action, are you aware of it?   Does it ever distract you?   
ROGER FEDERER:   Like the clicking sound, like that?   (Many photography clicks.)   (Laughter.)   
   
 Q.   And today, like most of it was when you were serving.   
ROGER FEDERER:   Yeah, I have heard it sometimes.   It's extreme, you know, when let's say the shadow creeps across the court like in the Australian Open or French Open, sometimes that can be the case, and the body is half in the shade and half in the sun, because I know the photographers like that light.   
Then you toss the ball and you hear about a hundred clicks.   When it's that extreme, so many together at the same time, I have been aware of it, or when they are at the French Open sort of in the dugout behind you, you can also hear it very well sometimes.   
Disturb me?   I don't think so.   But you ask them politely not to do it, but you know there is no way they are going to stop taking pictures.   Next thing you know, two points later you don't even think about it anymore and you actually don't hear it anymore.   
It's like that guy with the plastic bag who rattles it and you hear it if you focus on that.   But if you don't focus on it, you don't hear it.   
So it's not really disturbed me over the years at all, actually.   You can continue clicking away.
