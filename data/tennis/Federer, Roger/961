Q. Roger, when you're on the kind of run you're on at the moment, does the game feel easy for you? It looks easy. 
 
 ROGER FEDERER: Yeah, of course. The confidence is here. And somehow, for me, I feel where the other guy is serving more on big points, I'm more confident. I don't know, it's just a different situation when you come out of a few bad tournaments. You have to -- it's like when you ski, you stay away from the goals or - how do you say - the gates, your mind falls out of the race. You can take more risk when you have more confidence.  
 
Q. It seems to me as though you have the ability just to raise your game when you need to in both the singles yesterday and the doubles today. 
 
 ROGER FEDERER: Yeah, I think especially in the doubles today when it got important, I really played well. I took some chances, and every time it paid off. I really can't complain about my doubles game today. And also yesterday against Todd, when I had my chances, I pretty much took them. So, yeah, it's always great to be on a run like this. Hope it's gonna last.  
 
Q. Jakob, what's your view of where the tie is at the moment? You must be very happy of the state of affairs at the moment. 
 
 CAPTAIN JAKOB HLASEK: Definitely. It's a very good position to be in, 2-1, for us. But we knew from the start it's going to be a very difficult tie and could go to the last match. I think that we keep that mental approach, and all my guys are playing great. So we gonna prepare as we prepared the last two days for tomorrow.
