THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   After last year you must be pleased with the trouble‑free program for the first week?  
ROGER FEDERER:   I'm pleased, absolutely.   It's been a good first week for me.   I've been playing well, been feeling good.   Didn't drop any sets.   Wasn't really in danger in any of the matches.   
Totally got a lot of info, you know, from the first week, how I need to play moving forward.   
   
 Q.   Some of the younger players who have been trying to attain what you and the other three and the big four have, have spoken about learning a lot from the way you have carried yourselves on court and off.   What would you most like that group to learn from the four of you?  
ROGER FEDERER:   Well, I hope they are themselves and not somebody else.   Just because somebody told them to act a certain way or write certain things on social media, whatever it is, I just want them to be natural.   I think that's most important.   Because if that goes away you're boring, immediately, in my opinion.   
On the court, you know, play tough and fair.   Don't have to be the nicest guy always.   I know we get along well.   In the locker room it's important to get along, all that stuff, because then the tour is going to be more friendly, it's going to be nicer to hang around.   
But on the court you can be tough, you know, and believe in your chances, stretch the rules if you have to.   
But I think there's some guys around, you know, still I think they need a bit more time, but it's definitely interesting times ahead the next couple years.   
   
 Q.   What has your group's longevity at the top shown?  
ROGER FEDERER:   Well, that you can play well every week almost, you know.   Not so many letdowns.   I came through the ranks where it was normal for top guys to have a bad slam, have maybe two bad slams from time to time, some first‑round losses here and there.   It barely ever happens anymore.   It's like such a shock when it does happen.   
So I think I've been surprised how consistent I've been personally.   But even more so by everybody else who is just like normal to get to quarters, get to semis.   Because I know how small the margins are, I know how tough it is to do.   For everybody to follow suit and do it some even almost better than me, has been the most impressive thing about these group of guys.  
   
 Q.   (Question about a double‑handed backhand.)   
ROGER FEDERER:   No.   The racquet was too heavy back in the day.   But never in a match, no.   
   
 Q.   When you were younger, you played two‑handed?  
ROGER FEDERER:   Forehand/backhand, yes, like from three to five.   
   
 Q.   What rituals or superstitions do you have that mean the most to you around your game?  
ROGER FEDERER:   Nothing really.   It's all about having a routine.   It's not something crazy.   
I just try to be on time so I don't miss the match.   I try to eat at the right time so I don't feel dizzy or anything.   It's pretty simple.   I try to put my tapes on my ankles in time so I can have time to warm up.   
It's pretty basic.   Pretty simple.   As time has gone by I try to keep the same routines on that level.   On the court you start having your own sort of little routines, I guess, you know, when you get the towel at certain times.   
Today was a very fast‑paced match.   Giraldo was taking no time, so you've got to adjust to that, like I explained to the Swiss press before.   As a tennis player, you have to be ready for anything.   I didn't know one minute before the match if it was going to be roof opened or roof closed.   It could have a big impact.   I didn't know that.   
They said Robredo might not finish.   You might play on Tuesday.   What does that do?   Same thing.   Just ready for anything as a tennis player.   That's the mindset you've got to have.   It starts at an early age, eight years old, ten years old, playing your matches.   It keeps on changing all the time, everything.   You need to be really flexible in your mind.   
   
 Q.   What will you do with your day off tomorrow?   
ROGER FEDERER:   Yeah, family.   Tomorrow I think we're going to go visit some friends.   I'm going to come practice here at 11:00.   Try to stay in a good rhythm because I have a tendency to go to bed late just because our life very often plays night sessions, late in the day.   I have a tendency to go to bed at 2:00 in the morning, but that's not really what I want to get into now.   I scheduled to have practice tomorrow at 11:00.   
   
 Q.   You mentioned about your new racquet in your previous interview.   Are you still testing the racquet or you are 100% happy with the new racquet?  
ROGER FEDERER:   No, the testing is over.   I finished the testing maybe it was after the Australian Open this year.   I tried some other racquets.   I felt like I found the right one.   I didn't have to change anymore.   
Yeah, so I think it's going to go into production at some point and the color is going to come.   Yeah, it's all happening.   I'm very pleased that I found the racquet I was looking for.   
   
 Q.   Given the weather today, how much of an advantage was it to know you would get your match out of the way?   How much of a disadvantage might it be if you had to wait until Tuesday or Wednesday?  
ROGER FEDERER:   Yeah, I guess Stan's section and Isner's section, they have to play three straight days now.   There could be 15 sets right there, long sets.   You don't know what's going to happen.   It's a bit of the unknown.   
I mean, these guys are all fit enough to handle it, but it can have an impact, no doubt.   
I'm sure everybody would have liked to get their match done today.   So I don't consider myself lucky or anything like that.   But it was definitely good to play today, to finish today, and to stay in a normal sort of schedule now.   
I might be also impacted.   Yeah, so we'll see what's going to happen.   I might not play on Monday now.   I don't know what the situation is.   Yeah, you can't choose always.   It is what it is and you have to adapt to it.
