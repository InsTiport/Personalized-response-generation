THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  It's always best to get a match over as quickly as possible.  Do you get any benefit at all from being taken to an extra set in terms of being able to check that everything is okay in your game?

ROGER FEDERER:  Well, I mean, I thought the match was quite short for a three-setter.  It was not like one of these three-setters where you come off the court and you're totally exhausted.  It felt good out there today, was very nice temperature for both players.  I think I played well.  Even though I lost the second, I still felt like I was hitting the ball well, and good attitude.

Q.  All done in less than 75 minutes.  Quick one?

ROGER FEDERER:  Uh-hmm.

Q.  You're back on again tomorrow afternoon.  A short match tonight, do you feel you'll be adequately rested?

ROGER FEDERER:  Yeah, I don't have much choice, you know, just have to look that I sleep enough tonight and get the stretching done and eat well and look that I have a good preparation for tomorrow.  That's all I can do really.   Looking forward to that match, you know.  I've played him two times last two months and beaten him, so I'm looking forward to that match. 

Q.  You played so well here last year.  Do you feel things are starting to click?  Are you happy with the state of your game?

ROGER FEDERER:  Yeah, was better than the first match definitely.  Played much more aggressive, also serve was working better.  So if my game is, you know, at its best, I don't think so yet.  But hopefully, you know, I can win the next one and then if I can win the next match, I think it's a very good test, the one of tomorrow.  So it's going to be tough. 

Q.  This is a little out of leftfield.  Can you tell me what the mood is with the war, are people talking about it in the lounge?  Do you have the TV on in the locker room?

ROGER FEDERER:  I don't feel there's much talk about this between the players, you know.  I don't think we like to talk about it.  Of course, you know, once in a while, I go check out the TV, what's happening, you know.  I don't think we're  -- we can say much about it because we're not the insiders, so...

Q.  Is there any concern? 

ROGER FEDERER:  I mean, there's concern all over the world, so definitely also in the sports world.
