  3-6, 6-2, 6-3 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Obviously quite frustrated. It was 2-3 in the second seat set, about five breakpoints. You held at 4-2, and then after that it seemed like the wheels came off. Couldn't keep the forehand on the court? Any explanation? Wind? Focus?   
 ROGER FEDERER: No, I mean, I definitely struggled with my timing after that, so it was a tough finish for me, you know. I thought I was playing okay in the first set, but it was always going to be tough in the wind.   
 I already felt it in the warm up. It was coming across the court. Yeah, I struggled heavily today. It was tough.  
  
  Q. When fired your racquet into the court, did that feel good?   
 ROGER FEDERER: Not really. Not really.   
  
  Q. Do you remember the last time you broke a racquet, Roger?   
 ROGER FEDERER: Could have been here against Rafa.  
  
  Q. It was here?  
 ROGER FEDERER: Maybe. I don't know.   
  
  Q. It's obviously very tough for you to come in so soon after a defeat like that. The emotions are obviously very strained. Is it getting tough to just appreciate the matches like this sort of drifting away? We watch them and we can't believe sometimes. I suppose it's even more difficult for you.   
 ROGER FEDERER: You kind of try hard and then it's just not working. Today it is different just because there's so much wind, as well. Once you start feeling bad, it's kind of tough to regroup, you know.   
 On top of that, it made it more difficult as well from the one end because you had the sun in your eyes. It was really tough on the ball toss, you know. Between 1:30 and 2:30 it's really tough.   
 But, I mean, it's the same thing for both players. Once one guy gets the upper hand, the other guy is a bit uncertain. It's tough, but he struggled bigtime in the first set.   
 So, you know, I finished worse than him. He played so bad in the first set, I had a great effort by finishing even worse than him. It was good.  
  
  Q. Do you feel like he managed the win better than you did?  
 ROGER FEDERER: Well, I guess so. The result shows it, yeah.   
  
  Q. Did you find yourself sort of pressing because of that and going for shots that you might have waited a little bit longer on?   
 ROGER FEDERER: Not really. Just trying to keep the ball in the court. So it's not like I was chasing the lines too much.  
  
  Q. How much pressure are you feeling out there?  
 ROGER FEDERER: Not a whole a lot. I haven't been winning twenty tournaments in a row, so nobody expects me to win really.   
 No, look, it's been a tough last year or so, especially in the hardcourts. My game never really clicked, you know, except for the Open where I thought I played great.   
 I think when I was finding my form again, you know, it hit me with the back problem. It was unfortunate, you know, but thank God the hardcourt season is over.  
  
  Q. How do you evaluate your play in the first part of the hardcourt season?  
 ROGER FEDERER: It's the end. It's the end of the hard court season. I don't care anymore. I'm moving over to clay, a new chapter.  
  
  Q. On the clay, you are only entered into two events prior to Roland Garros?  
 ROGER FEDERER: Yes, it's going to stay that way.  
  
  Q. Sorry?  
 ROGER FEDERER: What's the question?   
  
  Q. Is that set in stone, or might you change that?   
 ROGER FEDERER: Nothing is set in stone. You never know. I don't know.   
  
  Q. Did you feel like he almost let you back in at 4-Love where he double faulted twice? Did you feel there was a little opening there?  
 ROGER FEDERER: It was tough to hold serve, and, you know, the wind was swirling. From the one end when you didn't have the sun in your eye, you were playing against the wind, so you always actually had sort of a chance to break.   
 So I knew I wasn't out of it, but I should have held to go 3-1, I think. Maybe. In the third set, I had a game point there. I think I could have actually almost smashed it, but didn't read it quick enough and ended up losing the point there.   
 I think that was my biggest opportunity I had.  
  
  Q. You've had other matches where things aren't going as well and you don't get as upset about that particular moment. What was different about today that you just lost it there for that moment?  
 ROGER FEDERER: I didn't lose it. I was just frustrated. Just because I smashed the racquet doesn't mean I lose it. Didn't feel great. Didn't feel -- it's just a natural thing I did.   
  
  Q. Do you feel you can overcome the problems you have at the moment, or you feel that you may need some help from a coach or from somebody else?  
 ROGER FEDERER: I've had like five coaches in the last two years.   
  
  Q. Did you feel like the crowd got behind you after you smashed the racquet?   
 ROGER FEDERER: That was great. Great, they got behind me after smashing the racquet.
