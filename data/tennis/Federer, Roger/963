Q. Could you talk a little bit about the match?

ROGER FEDERER: I didn't play my best tennis. He played well. He's a tough player.

Q. Why do you feel you didn't play your best?

ROGER FEDERER: My return was not as good as the returns during the whole tournament. I
was negative a little bit during the whole match, I couldn't find my game.

Q. Any particular reason?

ROGER FEDERER: No.

Q. (inaudible.)

ROGER FEDERER: I'm actually happy with the tournament. I would have liked to win it, of
course, but I'm happy for him.

Q. Talk a little bit about his ability.

ROGER FEDERER: He served pretty well today, takes the ball early on the rise. I am
always on the run, I couldn't play my game. I couldn't come to the net, I was always in
defense, he was the more aggressive player so.
