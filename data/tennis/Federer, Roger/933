MODERATOR:  Questions.  
 
 
Q.  We know you've had a couple problems with your groin.  How did that hold up today?
 
ROGER FEDERER:  Well, the leg was fine today.  I'm happy about that.  I really had to run a lot, so it was a tough match.  I'm happy that I went fine.  Good match, I liked it.  
 
Q.  How much do you feel you lost an opportunity to win this tournament last year with the match point against Haas in the quarters?  Is that something you think about?
 
ROGER FEDERER:  Well, the last time I played on center was that match.  It was nice.  If you win the match, when you play at 11, you have still a little bit left of the day.  It's a very nice atmosphere out on that center court.  The Aussie people are really nice.  It's special anyway to go on court in a Grand Slam on center court.  I'm happy I went through.  It's just important now the first few matches of this tournament to get really going because I think I still can play better than I did.  Hopefully I can improve again for the next one.  
 
Q.  Do you feel the lack of preparation could affect your long-range ability to win the tournament?
 
ROGER FEDERER:  I don't know.  I played three matches, four matches coming here, before here.  I don't know how many guys have four matches.  Maybe I wasn't playing  -- maybe I couldn't play as well as I want to because of my injury, but now it seems like it's been okay.  I'm happy I won in three today because it could have easily gone four or five or even lost it.  I'm happy that I sneaked out of this one, really looking forward for the next one.  
 
Q.  Mark Woodforde said today he thought some players on the tour could be using performance-enhancing drugs.  He welcomed the EPO testing. 
 
ROGER FEDERER:  You have to repeat.  About drug testing?  
 
Q.  Yes.  Do you think there are players on the tour who use performance-enhancing drugs? 
 
ROGER FEDERER:  Well, I don't know.  I don't know.  If there are players taking anything, I hope not, because everybody wants clean sport.  This is also why maybe they are checking now.  Obviously, I only prefer about what we did before because just, you know, you're used to it now.  With the blood, you know, it gets a little more personal maybe.  I don't have any problems because I don't have any worries, so...
