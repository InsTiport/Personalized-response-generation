R. FEDERER/J. Isner
  6-3, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Can you talk about your energy level out there today. You looked fresh, running down dropshots, hitting shots between your legs. Did the four weeks off after the Open help get you to this point?
 ROGER FEDERER: Yeah, I mean, I thought I had some good time off before Toronto and those tournaments, as well. So I always make sure I have enough breaks, enough holidays, buildup, tournaments, practice. The whole thing always needs to come together. Maybe they're tricky coming back the first couple of matches, but once you're in, it's a big advantage you had time off. It's not an easy thing to do to sit on the sidelines to see four, eight to 10 guys winning tournaments while you're sitting home working out because working out doesn't give you a whole lot of points. 
 That's why today I thought was a really good match because I knew the danger in John Isner today. He's really a great player, rising, up-and-coming. I think he's going to have a really good career. Today I knew I was in for a tough match with a really difficult draw. I'm really happy I was able to come true and, like you said, play a match with a lot of energy, a lot of variation, a match that was really solid for a first round after not having played for so long. 

 Q. Can you look ahead to the next round. You said you're feeling fairly well. You have to be pretty confident?
 ROGER FEDERER: I play Seppi? Andreas, I've played him multiple occasions. I think I played him many times at the beginning of last year. He plays the ball really flat. He has a good forehand, good backhand. That's his bread and butter. I have to make sure I'm moving around and playing aggressive myself. It's going to be a completely match. I think after tomorrow's match I'll be able to assess much more on how I'm really playing. 
 But the important thing is getting through. The early rounds doesn't matter how. But I think I played really well and I'm excited about tomorrow's match.

 Q. Off topic. It's said you might be learning Mandarin. Is this true? Taking a few Mandarin lessons?
 ROGER FEDERER: Not a few. One so far. We're going slow. Little by little. It's not an easy language. I don't know if you have had any lessons. 

 Q. No. 
 ROGER FEDERER: It's hard, you know, but maybe I'll pick up a few sentences here and there.

 Q. What might be the reason for this?
 ROGER FEDERER: I don't know. I have some time. My wife and kids are not here. I thought it would be fun. We did it together with the team. So I thought to change it up a bit of just having a regular routine. I like languages in general. I speak Swiss German, German, French and English fluently. I thought a bit Mandarin, which I'll never speak anyway, would just be a fun hour for me to learn some.

 Q. This was a private lesson?
 ROGER FEDERER: Yeah, it was a private lesson with the team who is here. They gave up after 10 minutes, and I was the guy who was saying the words and sentences. I was the guy who was really learning, not them. 

 Q. (Indiscernible.) 
 ROGER FEDERER: I would think so, too, but it's not that simple, unfortunately.

 Q. How do you feel about doing it again, the shot between your legs? Also, how do you feel about the reaction from the audience tonight?
 ROGER FEDERER: The reaction was amazing, as it usually is after a shot between the legs. But it's something that happens so rare, you know. Usually happens maybe once a tournament and then you have to play the score. Depends on the opponent you play against. Could have done anything different. But I'm hitting that shot so well now, it's almost the most consistent shot in tennis these days. I've attempted it like four times in the last few years, every time I made it and won the point off it. 
 I played it great again. The ovation from the fans was absolutely amazing again. Like I said, it's a lot of fun playing here in Shanghai. I have some incredible souvenirs from amazing matches, amazing points played. When the crowd reacted, it reminded me of the good times I've had in Shanghai over all those years.

 Q. You went to EXPO. Could you share your experience, your impression. 
 ROGER FEDERER: Yeah, that was also something I wanted to do when I heard the EXPO was here in Shanghai. You never know until you get here and you see the schedule in front of you what you're going to be doing the next few days and week. Obviously with practice it's important, does the rain interrupt any of that, but it didn't, so we were able to organize it. 
 The Swiss pavilion was helpful to us, to organize to see other pavilions at the same time. We went to see America, Australia, South Africa, Switzerland and one more we went to see. I forgot. We went to see five. 
 We had really a good time, you know. We'll do it again. It was interesting to see from the touristy side, even though that's not the focus, what they can show. Me as a traveler, I think that was very, very interesting. And then from all the energy side, wind, all the green stuff they could do is also a different side, you know. 
 I went to see China, of course. I forgot. I saw so little of it, that's why I forgot, you know. But because it's still here, after the EXPO closes, I would want to go back because the part I saw was absolutely amazing already. Probably this trip won't be enough, but maybe next year or so I hope I can go see more. 
 But I had a wonderful time. The team joined me. It reminded me a little bit of the Olympic site with all the stadiums, the way the people were moving around, the way the streets were built. It was a very nice experience. Happy I did it. It took me a while. Took me about five, six hours. Yeah, I would do it again if I could.

 Q. Back to that shot you made. Did you do it intentionally or spontaneously? 
 ROGER FEDERER: Yeah, I mean, I did it because I was down in the score. I was down 30-Love, had nothing to lose anyway. I hoped to win the point, getting a dropshot, up the line. But John was there. He hit the lob. I wasn't sure how far it's going to go, if it's going to go out, if it is going to stay in, if it's going to go towards my backhand, towards my forehand. I think if it goes towards my forehand, I can't do it. Then I would play a proper forehand or a slapshot or something. 
 That way really gave me the opportunity to run back and just time it perfectly with the timing to hit it through the legs. I know I can hit it really well. I tried it out. 
 I knew I wasn't too deep in the court. Even if I would hit it and he would make it, I still had the chance to turn around and get the next shot. He missed the volley because I hit it really well. 
 It was luck a bit, but it all worked out perfect. It was fun. 

 Q. I heard you've been practicing with some Chinese young players. 
 ROGER FEDERER: Yeah. 

 Q. Can you give an assessment of their play? Is there any advice you can give them to make the next progress?
 ROGER FEDERER: Yeah, you never want to give them too much advice because otherwise they come back next year at Wimbledon and they beat you first round. You have to be careful what you tell them. I'm happy giving 12-year-olds advise, but maybe not 18, 20, 22 year olds. 

 Q. How old are they?
 ROGER FEDERER: I don't even know how old they are. I don't want to know. That's why I don't give them any advice. 
 But it was fun, I have to say. I think I played with two guys yesterday. They had great intensity, very excited. Took some pictures afterwards. I thought they were talented, you know. I think we've seen this week a few names pop up with the win over Stepanek and another guy played really well, too. 
 I think they're doing the right things. I just think China has got to be a little bit patient. I have the idea they're getting a little too excited, wanting men's players too quickly. Tennis is a sport that takes time to move forward in the rankings. You know it. There's many, many players working hard in South America, in Europe, in Australia, all around the world, that it's not so simple just to break through. 
 But they're doing the right things with CTA, even Mercedes-Benz helping with Swing for the Stars. I think that's a great initiative. I'm happy to be the ambassador for that. I hope the Chinese players will come up soon. 

 Q. I guess we'll have to congratulate your sister. 
 ROGER FEDERER: Yeah, I guess so. A little bit late, but yes. 

 Q. Looks like your family has a tradition of having twins. I begin to think you and your sister are twins at the beginning. 
 ROGER FEDERER: Me and her, no. Maybe I have a twin brother. He won six slams and I won eight slams. I did half of the things and he did the other half. 
 No, it's great. I'm very happy for her. It's a wonderful thing to have twins. I wish her only all the best. I spoke to her today. She seems she's coping really well with it. She got a boy and a girl. I got two identical girls. We're looking forward to reuniting. I haven't seen them yet. I'm sure when I come back to Basel, I'm sure I'm going to see them.
