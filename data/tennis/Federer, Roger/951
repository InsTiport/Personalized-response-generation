MODERATOR:  Questions, please.  
 
 
Q.  How difficult is this after the match now? 
 
ROGER FEDERER:  Well, I mean, I'm very disappointed, first of all.  I think it's pretty normal after missing so many chances today.  I had actually a good week.  It's very disappointing losing this way like today. 
 
Q.  You're disappointed, but you've had so many compliments.  McEnroe, Cash, players have said probably you're the best thing that came up.  Does that help a little bit?
 
ROGER FEDERER:  Well, it didn't help the result today, did it?  Of course, compliments are always nice.  I mean, I have to perform also.  And today I just couldn't get through the match.  That's why I'm very disappointed, because I had enough chances to go at least five sets.  But next year I'll be back, and hopefully I can go one step further.  Yeah, we'll see.  
 
Q.  You never seemed to be able to dictate the pace of the game.  Why for?  What happened?  Were you nervous?
 
ROGER FEDERER:  No, I was much more nervous playing Pete than playing Tim today.  He played a good game breaking me there in the first, and also again to win the set there.  I mean, if I could make the second set tiebreaker, it's a different story because after that, my leg starts hurting again.  I tried to relax, started playing really well.  Before that, I didn't feel I was especially returning well, like I was against Pete.  I was getting the feeling I was a little bit late, just couldn't get a hit on the ball.  Yeah, it went better in the third.  In the fourth, I fought hard, but it was just too late.  
 
Q.  What is wrong with the leg?
 
ROGER FEDERER:  Well, I think it's groin, I don't know.  I mean, it happened in the first match.  I just couldn't recover till now.  I just hope it's going to be fine till Gstaad on clay there.  I need to rally from the baseline.  I just can't serve and volley.  We'll see.  
 
Q.  Do you think Tim can go on to win this thing now?
 
ROGER FEDERER:  Well, it's going to be very tough I think for him because, I mean, he had some tough matches.  He had a five-setter - four setter now.  He plays Goran now, who is very dangerous right now.  First of all, he has to get through that one.  But then even tougher opponents are waiting for him.  It's going to be very tough.  
 
Q.  What do you think the difference was today?  Was it anything to do with the crowd or his experience?
 
ROGER FEDERER:  I don't think it was experience because he could have closed out that match much earlier than he did.  In the end, my serves were just not as good anymore.  I mean, it's normal that you get nervous in the breaker.  I missed maybe a couple of shots.  But that's what happened.  I'm very disappointed that it happened to me today because I felt actually pretty good going into the breaker, but just couldn't manage somehow to stay calm and win the breaker.  I checked the stats.  I think the difference was two points.  That was the last forehand volley I missed.  That made the difference. 
 
Q.  And you broke him more times than he broke you.  Do you think that's a weakness in his game as he looks ahead to Ivanisevic?
 
ROGER FEDERER:  Yeah, I mean, I think especially second serve is his biggest problem for me.  Anybody can return it without a problem.  His first serve is pretty good, but his second, he doesn't get enough free points off it, he stays back sometimes.  If I would have returned a little bit better, he would have stayed back a little bit more, and I would have gotten probably better rhythm.  I just couldn't get it.  
 
Q.  Was the injury a factor today?
 
ROGER FEDERER:  Well, I was surprised that it only came like in the third set, because against Pete it came already at the end of the first.  Because I don't feel it now when I'm walking around.  But when I have to serve and volley, make quick movements, I just feel it.  That's why I called the trainer, because the trainer helped me a lot against Pete.  Today he did actually again.  Maybe I should have called the trainer earlier because it was already hurting me in the beginning of the third.  
 
Q.  There was some uncertainty from the South African journalists' point of view about your background, your mom, when she moved to Switzerland. 
 
ROGER FEDERER:  I don't know which year and how old she was.  I think she was like around 21 or so.  Because my dad was working there for, I mean, sometimes.  Took her back to Switzerland when she was 21.  Now they just go for holidays there.  But my mom is South African.
