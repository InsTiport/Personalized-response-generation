THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 
 
 
Q.  Can you talk about playing over the course of three days like this, how it affects the game, the mentality about the match?
 
MARY PIERCE:  I think this was the weirdest situation that I've ever experienced in a Grand Slam tournament.  It was really, really weird, to wait four days and play 20 minutes to finish the match.  It was really weird.  
 
Q.  How did you sleep? 
 
MARY PIERCE:  Sorry?  
 
Q.  How did you sleep?
 
MARY PIERCE:  How did I sleep?  I slept fine.  I'm really rested, that's for sure.  I haven't done too much for the last, what, four days I guess.  Rested, that's for sure.  
 
Q.  Could they have done a better job of getting the matches that were already in progress back out on the court as opposed to the matches they did play the last two nights? 
 
MARY PIERCE:  Wow, that's a good question.  I mean, it's definitely a tough situation.  It's a tough situation for, you know, the players.  A tough situation for the fans.  Tough situation for the organization.  You know, I mean, the only thing that I would really have to say would be that, you know, when you're sitting around waiting to play for about three or four hours, then they come and tell you you're gonna play in 15 minutes, then they call you in 10 minutes, it's like, you know...  It's not enough time to prepare and get ready and warm up, you know, before you go out and play a match.  Especially if it's cold out and it's late.  It's a good way to get injured.
