MODERATOR:  Questions for Mary. 


Q.  Where do you think your game is at the moment, Mary? 

MARY PIERCE:  Good question.  I feel like I'm playing pretty well, and at the same time I feel like I'm far from where I want to be.  You know, I am where I am right now.  Just make the best of it.  I think what's missing  -- well, what I need is just to play a lot of matches.  I haven't played a lot, so I feel like I need matches.

Q.  You still have the same hunger?

MARY PIERCE:  Oh, definitely.  I think a lot more now than I had, gosh, I don't know, before my injuries, I guess.  It's hard to say.  Before I had my injuries, I won the French Open, so...  But I think definitely not having played a lot in the last couple years has just made me really just want to play, you know, excited just to be out here and competing.

Q.  A lot of good memories for you coming back here?

MARY PIERCE:  Oh, yeah.  I love playing here.  Just on so many courts, I have so many memories of matches that I've played.  This morning I saw some highlights I was playing.  They show the year I won in '95.  Just a lot of great memories, a lot of great feelings here.  I love being here and playing here.

Q.  Birthday tomorrow.  Any special plans?

MARY PIERCE:  No.

Q.  Just get ready for the next match?

MARY PIERCE:  Yeah.  I haven't made any special plans.
