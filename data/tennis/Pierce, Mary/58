Q. Are you helped by the fact that there's less media interest right now, where more
people are in the spotlight?

MARY PIERCE: I don't know. Maybe unconsciously it has an effect. But it's really hard
to say, but, you know, I think the players that are getting attention obviously deserve
it. We have so many girls that are playing great tennis now. It's so exciting.

Q. You have more time to yourself than you had before.

MARY PIERCE: Well, that's my choice.

Q. Okay.

MARY PIERCE: That's my choice. I've been there, like they say, been there, done that.
And I can choose what I want to do. You know, I know what makes me happy. I know what my
priorities are, what's important to me and what I want. And I think that's where I am able
to balance my life and understand better. Because before, you can only -- you can explain
it to people, or people can explain it to you, but there's nothing like being there, going
through it and having to explain yourself.
