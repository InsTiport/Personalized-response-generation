 Q. What was wrong today, Mary? (Laughter.) 
 
 MARY PIERCE: That was direct. It just wasn't my day today. I think Amelie served really
well. 
 
Q. Did you have any problems or something? No?
 
 MARY PIERCE: No, I just made a mistake before my match. I didn't prepare well enough,
so I learned. I learned my lesson today. Better that it happens in this tournament than
the French Open. 
 
Q. What kind of mistake was it?
 
 MARY PIERCE: Not eating. 
 
Q. Sorry?
 
 MARY PIERCE: Not eating. 
 
Q. Oh, really?
 
 MARY PIERCE: Yes. I've just been tired and not hungry since I've been here, and... So I
just was not feeling very, like, energetic during the match, not moving well, almost a
sleepy feeling. So I just had some Coke during the match and I was down 6-3, 3-Love and I
started to feel much better. So it was a little bit -- not too late, it's never too late
-- but it just made it very difficult for me to win the match. She already had confidence
and was playing well. 
 
Q. So you couldn't do the same as last year when you lost the first set?
 
 MARY PIERCE: No. It's different. 
 
Q. Did you feel any tension or something? Sometimes when two French players play
together it's like this.
 
 MARY PIERCE: No, not today. I mean I used to sometimes or in the past, but not anymore
because I just don't really concentrate on who I'm playing against when I go on the court.
It doesn't matter. So I just focus on myself, my game. Who I play doesn't matter, so... 
 
Q. Did you feel flat from the very beginning of the match?
 
 MARY PIERCE: Yeah. Kind of. 
 
Q. So why didn't you ask anybody to bring you a sandwich or something on the court or a
banana, I don't know?
 
 MARY PIERCE: I wasn't hungry. I didn't -- I thought Coke was better. During a match,
you're not used to digesting and eating foods so... 
 
Q. So what are you going to do now?
 
 MARY PIERCE: I'm just going to rest this evening and think about what I'm going to do
next week. 
 
Q. Are you going to a restaurant? 
 
 MARY PIERCE: I don't know. (Laughing.) I haven't thought about it yet. I'm just going
to probably go back and think about it, talk to my brother and see. 
 
Q. This is the second time you lost to Amelie this year. How do you think her game has
improved since you played here last year?
 
 MARY PIERCE: Since I played her last year here? 
 
Q. Yes.
 
 MARY PIERCE: I think she served really well today basically.
