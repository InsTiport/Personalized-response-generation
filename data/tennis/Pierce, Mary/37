THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Mary, please.  
 

Q.  Would you have expected a slightly better performance than that today?
 
MARY PIERCE: I didn't hear the beginning. 
 

Q.  Would you have expected to perform better than that today?
 
MARY PIERCE: Would I?  Would I, I don't put expectations on myself so I can't say yes I would have expected that.  Definitely would have been nice to have performed better, yeah.  
 

Q.  How frustrating has it been for you with all the injuries this year?  Obviously, you would have liked some bit of form leading into the defense of your French Open title. 
 
MARY PIERCE: It would be easy for me to be negative or get down on myself, get frustrated, all those kind of negative emotions.  You know, it's not a big deal.  It's not the end of the world, and nobody's died.  And I just have a lot of work to put in and I have two weeks before the French Open so I'm going to be working very hard until then. 
 

Q.  What are the areas of your game that you need to improve over the next couple of weeks before Paris?
 
MARY PIERCE: Everything.  Overall form on the court.  
 

Q.  What are your physical conditions at the moment? We could see that you had difficulty breathing. 
 
MARY PIERCE: Uh-huh.  I'm healthy right now, I'm just, you know, recovering.  Always seems like I'm recovering from something.  I'm recovering from my sickness that I had last week.  
 

Q.  It seemed like you were never going for the lateral shots, you were never moving to the sides.  Was it just a physical condition, or was it that you maybe thought you would get back into the match anyway because your opponent was lower ranked than you anyway?
 
MARY PIERCE: No.  She just played really well.  She hit some very good shots.
