THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Mary, please. 


Q.  So how did the match go today? 

MARY PIERCE:  How did it go... well, I won, which is a good thing.  It was okay.  I mean, I just made a lot of unforced errors, but I was just trying to play more aggressive and more relaxed.  So, you know, I'm just in an improvement stage.  I just feel that I have things I need to just keep improving.  And more matches that I can play, the better  I'm getting.  I feel like certain parts of my game are coming back, so...

Q.  How are all the injuries feeling?

MARY PIERCE:  Fine, yeah.  I'm okay. 

Q.  What was the trainer out there for? 

MARY PIERCE:  My eyes were just really dry.  They're just really dry and burning.  So I just needed some drops.
