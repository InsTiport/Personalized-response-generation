Q. Very quick match today. Did you get the kind of work in that you had hoped in
preparation for the next round?

MARY PIERCE: I felt pretty happy with my play today. I didn't think I served as well as
I wanted to. I was missing my first serve -- my first serve percentage wasn't as high as
I'd like it to be. Other than that, today I had a lot of fun out there, trying to do some
different things coming in, hitting some dropshots.

Q. So many seeded players are left, 13 or so going into the second week. Could this be
the most competitive week in a Grand Slam in recent memory?

MARY PIERCE: I have a feeling we're going to see a lot of great matches at the US Open
this year, some exciting matches.

Q. What do you expect of your next match? 

MARY PIERCE: What do I expect of my next match? Well, I played her in San Diego. That's
not too long ago, a few weeks. She's a difficult player to beat. She's very aggressive. It
will be a tough match. It will be a fun match. I'm looking forward to it. I know that I
have to be aggressive. We'll see what happens.

Q. Do you sight any weaknesses in her game you're trying to exploit?

MARY PIERCE: When you get in with the top players, there's not really a lot. There's no
big difference. There's just a few points here and there that can make a difference in a
match. So, you know, Venus has a big serve, big groundstrokes. She might miss a few shots
once in a while, but you can't count on that to win a match. So basically it's just going
to come down to who takes charge the point first.

Q. Would you say you're playing your best tennis in quite awhile right now?

MARY PIERCE: I feel like I'm playing well. There's definitely things I can improve on,
and that's what I'm trying to do every day is just get better and better, keep going out
there, working hard, having fun when I play my matches.
