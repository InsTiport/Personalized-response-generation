 WTA: Questions for Mary.  
 
Q. Was it a concentration thing that you let it slip away and then came back?
 
 MARY PIERCE: I think today was more an intensity thing. Just dropped my intensity a
little bit. You know, against someone like Sabine, you can't do that because she's a
fighter. If you give her any little chances, she always tries to stay in every match and
fight till the end. When I was down 4-Love, I decided not to let it go any further and
wake up, just try to play it point by point, try to win in two sets. I was very happy to
finish it off in two sets. 
 
Q. Do you have any influence on the style of dress you wear? 
 
 MARY PIERCE: I meet with the designers of Nike a few times during the year. You know, I
feel very fortunate to be with such a great company where I'm able to have input and say
in what I wear on the court. I think it's important to be comfortable, to be happy with
what you're wearing. So, yeah, I get to meet with the designers a few times a year. We
talk about different styles, colors, cuts, fits. It's a lot of fun. 
 
Q. How do you like the brand-new one you have here?
 
 MARY PIERCE: I like it. I like everything I've worn because it's always different. They
never cease to surprise and amaze me. They always come up with new outfits and new ideas.
I'm always very happy.
