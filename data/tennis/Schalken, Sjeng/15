THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  What do you know about Jeff Morrison, your next opponent?

SJENG SCHALKEN:  I saw him play, and he was having a big first and second serve.  So he's a good grass court player.  And I'll be ready.  I have to play again 100 percent and it's going to be a completely different match than today.  Because, yeah, today it was lots of, yeah, I can return lots of shots.  And against him, I have to be really pleased if I get my  -- yeah, my racquet behind the ball and try to take every  -- it's gonna be more a real grass court match, the next one.

Q.  At 23, he's a late-blooming player.  Does he remind you at all of any other player? 

SJENG SCHALKEN:  He has a lot of energy, like all the young Americans.  And he reminds me as a typical hard court player.  I think he took some time after college.  That's maybe why he's little bit later.  But I have to be ready, and I was impressed by his game.  But, well, he has to play again the same like he did today, so otherwise he's gonna get a hard time.

Q.  Did he show maturity out on the court, make good decisions? 

SJENG SCHALKEN:  I didn't see that much because I was preparing for my own match.  But what I saw, he's coming in all the time so  -- well, it depends.  If he doesn't serve that good, then he's gonna feel my returns.  But if he serves like he did today, then he has a lot of pressure.
