 JOE LYNCH: Sjeng Schalken has upset Mark Philippoussis in the first round 7-6, 6-3,
head-to-head at 1-All. Mark had won last summer in Toronto. First question for Sjeng. 
 
Q. How does it feel to beat him? I guess you beat Krajicek last year?
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: Yeah, it is always a very good feeling, especially if you don't expect
to win because I traveled yesterday from Europe to here I came from the dirt. Now, there
is still some dirt on my socks. Then you played in the stadium with Mark Philippoussis. It
was really tough. I had a very bad journey yesterday. Everything was against me. I missed
the plane. Then the plane had a delay, so I just go and relax on the court and just see
what it is and how I am playing. Actually, I served good and I could read his serve in
some particular games. I could read his serve a little bit, so I could return sometime,
and then if you are on the rally, I think it was 50/50. At the end, of course, it is not
good preparation, so at the end, it is still a little bit lucky that I feel good. 
 
Q. Where were you playing?
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: I played in Amsterdam, played some club matches and then at the end I
heard, well, I was going to get in and I also had designations, so I came to Cincinnati. 
 
Q. Why did you miss the plane?
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: That is a story. 
 
Q. Let us hear it.
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: I wanted to be really, really quick here, so I took the fast plane. It
was the Concord from London. And, then I arrived 9:30 and in New York and I had like two
hours to go to Newark, from Kennedy to Newark to take the plane there. So I took the taxi
and the taxi didn't know where Newark was. (laughter). 
 
Q. Well, they don't even know where Times Square was.
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: The taxi driver didn't know where Newark was so I lost 45 minutes and
the plane was just five minutes -- left just five minutes ago. So I took another plane
and, well, that, plane had a delay of three hours because somebody got ill when the plane
had to get in and had to stop in Philadelphia. So at the end I could have taken a
helicopter from London.  
 
Q. Let us get this straight you went from Amsterdam, London?
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: Eindhoven, London and then to J.F.K., then I went to Newark. 
 
Q. Then you went to Philly? You stopped in Philly?
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: No, the plane had to get in in Newark that we were waiting for. It had
a delay because somebody got ill in the plane and they had to stop at Philadelphia before
it got to Newark to go to Cincinnati. 
 
Q. You were straight Newark, Cincinnati then? It was a direct flight?
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: Yes. It took so long and I was so angry, oh, it takes a while to get me
angry, but there I was angry. 
 
Q. You probably could have gone Amsterdam, Cincinnati?
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: Yeah. 
 
Q. Expensive trip on the Concord?
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: Yeah, so I spent a lot of money for nothing. 
 
Q. How much was the taxi ride?
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: That was also a lot, yeah. 
 
Q. How did he finally get there? 
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: He had to stop and ask. 
 
Q. Did they laugh at him?
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: No, not really, because a lot of people had troubles with Newark. 
 
Q. These club matches that you were playing, your ranking isn't that--
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: And I still had designation, so I had to play and -- but I also had
agreement with the club so I played both. 
 
Q. A player of your ranking normally is not in club--
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: It is in Germany -- 
 
Q. But most of the players at your point aren't doing that?
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: Yeah, I know. First I played in Amsterdam. Then I was -- 
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: Yes, then I played my club matches in Halle. That is where the grass
court tournament is played before Wimbledon. 
 
Q. What time did you actually get in then yesterday?
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: Yesterday at -- I practiced from 7 'til 8. I was really, really tired. 
 
Q. You got into the airport in the afternoon then?
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: Yeah, like 5:30. 
 
Q. Did you get to sleep any today or not?
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: I woke up at a nice time, at 4 (laughter). In Holland I cannot wake up
before 10. I have always troubles before 10 and now I am waking up at 4. 
 
Q. Well, that was 10.
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: Actually, yeah, it is. Yeah, it is 10. 
 
Q. On your way over here you knew who you had in the first round on your way over here?
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: I called because my flight was delayed then I said okay, well, I can
not stand that I don't know who I am playing. I called transportation and I found out I
was playing Philippoussis. I said, well, just go for it. 
 
Q. What was it, the ankle that --
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: That was the first game. It is still because I played on the clay a lot
last three weeks and still the footwork, it is slightly different, of course, so I
strained a muscle in my ankle. 
 
Q. Is he the kind of guy you really don't want to play under the lights because of the
serve?
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: I like to play everybody, of course. It is always fun to play Mark. But
you never know what is going to happen if he hits bullets all the time, you cannot do
anything. 
 
Q. Doesn't make any difference, night or day, playing him?
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: I think it was a little advantage for me because there was some wind
and he misses, sometimes, his serve. His serve is really big, but he is not unbelievable
-- dependable on the serve. He can also hit unbelievable forehand. Maybe you saw some
shots. It was amazing. 
 
Q. When you got up on him and he came back and you got on him again, some guys would
say, I am done, but you stayed with it.
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: Yeah, but it is -- again the thing is he hits winners, he makes
mistakes. At 5-4, he made some unbelievable shots with his forehand. So, okay, I lost my
serve, can happen. I lose my serve in every match a couple of times. But I have good
returns, so I can always break somebody. So that is my thought behind, okay, I stay cool
in my head and just try again. 5-1 nothing happened. 
 
Q. Is there any jet lag, anything like that kicking in now?
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: Yeah, I am getting tired now. I am not getting tired of you guys, but I
am getting tired from the jet lag. 
 
Q. Where will you play next week?
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: New Haven. 
 
Q. Going to take a regular plane?
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: Yeah. 
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: No, I normally don't do that take the Concord, but -- well, I thought I
have to do it. It was a great experience. 
 
Q. How long did it take to take the Concord?
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: Three hours 20 minutes. 
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: It goes quick, nice. 
 
Q. Can you come out ahead money-wise by doing that? How many matches will you have to
win here to make that --
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: Oh, no, no that is -- I think if I lose first round I should play -- 
 
Q. You have already made it?
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: Yeah.  
 
Q. You bought a round trip or just one way?
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: No, just one way. 
 
Q. More expensive. Cheap per round trip.
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: No, I don't care too much. 
 
Q. You knew before you got on the plane who you were going to play?
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: I called and in Newark because I had to wait and wait and wait. After
that I said, okay, now I have some time to call the tournament and ask who I play. So from
there I knew. 
 
Q. What were you doing in the airport?
 
 SJENG SCHALKEN: Just eating, reading, everybody is doing the same. Reading and eating.
