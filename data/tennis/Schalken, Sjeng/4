THE MODERATOR:  Questions.  
 
 
Q.  What do you know about Vince Spadea?  He was up, fell off the map.  Now he's back.  What do you expect from him?
 
SJENG SCHALKEN:  We played many times.  We play a little bit similar.  He has a fabulous backhand.  But we know each other's game pretty well.  I think it's going to be a physical battle. 
 
Q.  Are you surprised to see him back to the level he's at now?
 
SJENG SCHALKEN:  He's a very talented boy, man.  He's maybe older than me.  Yeah, I think I was surprised when he fell away because that was just a mental case.  Now he's back again.  
 
Q.  When you play someone like him, are you thinking, "This is going to be a match I'm going to have to persevere"?  He's known for dragging on, grinding. 
 
SJENG SCHALKEN:  That's my game also.  So I think everybody who is going to watch the match has to take a picnic bag with them.  
 
Q.  After the fire in Rome, has your relationship with Andy Roddick changed because you experienced that moment together? 
 
SJENG SCHALKEN:  Before the fire I think we were pretty good friends already.  Obviously, he kicked my butt many times on big occasions.  But he's a phenomenal tennis player.  He's a nice guy also.  After the fire I think, of course, you have something special because people both waiting on the roof of that hotel to be rescued by the fire people.  I think we were both very calm, and you could see that you have those moments in the sport and you have those moments in life also.
