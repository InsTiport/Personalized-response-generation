MODERATOR:  Questions. 


Q.  How do you feel having to play Henman?  Is that the best or worst match you could face in the next round?

SJENG SCHALKEN:  It's for sure a very tough match.  I think I'm going to enjoy it.  It's going to be tough because he beat me in the French Open on clay.  That's not his best surface.  He beat me in three straight sets.  I think I'm not going to put any pressure on myself that I would beat him on grass, his best surface.  I'm going to go for it, for every shot.  I'll see what kind of level he puts on the holy grass.

Q.  Do you think this is Henman's home, the pressure is very much on him rather than on you ?

SJENG SCHALKEN:  Sure.  I'm just going to go for it.  He'll have more pressure than me because I have no pressure.  I try to play the same level as I did the last two times in the third round.  I just missed it.  But finally I meet Henman.  Against Courier I lost two years ago.  I had match points.  Last year, against Philippoussis match, a long match.  Both times I should have played Henman.  Now I finally play him
