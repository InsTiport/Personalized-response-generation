 Q. You seemed to have a lot of chances? 
 
 NICOLE PRATT: Definitely. I think, you know, I put myself in a position. Got back 2-All
in the first set. Played a solid game at 2-All. And, I don't know, I just always felt
like, you know, I could win the points and win the right points to win the game. Just
didn't seem to flow the way I wanted it to. 
 
Q. What makes her such a good competitor? Just her ability to change things around?
 
 NICOLE PRATT: Oh, I think you know her biggest asset is she fights every point. She
tries to make every point she can. That's probably my biggest asset, also, which she was,
I think, a little better at doing. And also, she was taking me through the angles of the
court, and I was the one doing all the running today. You know, in the end, I think I just
got a little fatigued. 
 
Q. What were the conditions like out there?
 
 NICOLE PRATT: Quite good. Not as bad as the other day. It wasn't as windy. I think it
was -- the stand was protecting us from the wind. But no, it was quite pleasant out there
today. 
 
Q. She looked okay today, didn't she?
 
 NICOLE PRATT: Yeah, I think -- I don't think she made -- you could look at the
statistics, I don't think she made as many errors as she did against Jelena. But, yeah,
there's certainly chinks in her game, and unfortunately, I just sort of didn't capitalize
when I could. Probably need to you know, get a little more on the ball. 
 
Q. You've reset your goals, getting ranked and stuff like that. How far away do you
think you are from taking that next step?
 
 NICOLE PRATT: I don't think I'm that far at all. I think today was a really good
measuring stick for me. Arantxa is Top 10, but I think I now have a good idea of what I
need to do to step up to the next level, and really compete with those players in the
future.
