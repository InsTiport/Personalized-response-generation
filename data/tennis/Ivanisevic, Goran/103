Q.  Do you feel you were too nervous, maybe?  

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  At the beginning, I think I didn't have any  chance.  He served unbelievable, but I started pretty  badly.  I mean, not a lot of first serves in; couple of  doublefaults.  And then also second set, I didn't know  where -- how to serve, because I was rushing too much.  I didn't know whether to come in or stay back.  Then when I won the second set; then  everything was going good.  And then the game 2-All,  40-15, I tried to play too defensive.  I stayed back,  and then I just play his backhand, and I missed a  couple of easy backhands, and that was it, and he just  played good last couple of games.  


Q.  Did you feel him lose his rhythm towards the  end of the second set?  

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Yeah, he lost the rhythm.  I mean, it is  tough to serve like that all the time.  He was serving  really good, then he lost the rhythm.  He did  doublefault on set point.  I thought now is my chance.  Then in the beginning also I should made me start a  little bit to put few returns more in the third set  because he started to miss a couple of -- he was doing  more doublefaults, but then I was always missing, and  then on my serve, I served really, really bad today.  I  didn't have any rhythm on my serve.  He was guessing.  I mean, he was guessing before I hit the serve, he was  going to the right side and hit -- I was serving a lot  to his backhand.  After a while, he was just going to  there before I hit the serve and he was hitting winners  return.  I didn't serve to his body.  But he played  good.  I mean, he played better than he played before  against me.  


Q. What was wrong with your backhand today?  You  had like several very bad unforced errors on important  points.  

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Yeah, every time -- I want to play safe.  Every time I want to play safe with my backhand, I  miss, instead of hitting -- if I hit, it doesn't matter  if it is going in or out.  I mean, that is better, but  every time I play safe I miss the backhand.  I play too  safe.  And then I miss it.  I mean, like the game when  he broke me, I did maybe three, four mistakes with the  backhand.  I mean, no very easy.  


Q.  Thank you.
