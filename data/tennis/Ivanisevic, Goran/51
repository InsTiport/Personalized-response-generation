Q. Goran, do you ever get worried that your serve is going to abandon you and you'll
have to resort to other things?

GORAN IVANISEVIC: That my serve is going to what?

Q. Abandon you, disappear.

GORAN IVANISEVIC: Is impossible. Can disappear for one or two points, but not for the
whole match.

Q. Goran, besides your serve, how satisfied are you with your game today?

GORAN IVANISEVIC: Oh, not so good. I volleyed pretty badly today. I didn't put one ball
in the court. I hit a couple of good returns, and that was the key point. You know, I
returned when I needed better than him. Okay, he didn't have so many chances to return,
so.

Q. Did it bother you that you two are left-handers?

GORAN IVANISEVIC: I don't usually like to play left-handers. I have a tough time to
return when left-handers serve. Today I was picking his serve pretty good, made a couple
of good returns when I needed.

Q. Goran, you've served more than 1,500 aces this year. What does it mean to you? Are
you proud of it?

GORAN IVANISEVIC: Yeah, it was my goal, to try to serve more than 1,500 aces. Now it's
going to be very tough to break this record, even for me. It's going to be tough to break
my own record. Is going to stay, I think, for a long time. It's nice, two years in a row I
make two records, so I can say that I have best serve in the game for sure.

Q. What about next year? Are you trying to serve more than 1,600?

GORAN IVANISEVIC: I mean, I would like to serve one ace and win a Grand Slam. I don't
care. I don't need to serve so many aces. I mean, it's nice to serve aces, but if I am
playing well, I don't need to serve so many aces.

Q. Did anything change in your game since you are with your new coach, Martic?

GORAN IVANISEVIC: Nothing change. I playing the same game. It's very important if
you're confident or not. Last year when I came here, I was not confident, but still won
the tournament. This year I won a lot of tournaments, I play much better, my best year.
It's only if I'm very confident, then I play best tennis, then I can beat anybody.

Q. What about when Woodforde hit the ball right at you, what was your reaction?

GORAN IVANISEVIC: I mean, he didn't have to hit so hard, you know. He had the whole
court open, and he hit straight. He think he going to hit me, then I going to get pissed
or nervous, hit a couple of double-faults. He made mistake. When he do that, I get more
angry, I hit ace, ace and ace. Next time he should just play on the open side, maybe he
has more chance.

Q. Another little superfluous question. What is the origin of your new hair-doo?

GORAN IVANISEVIC: Nothing. I lost one match when I put my hair. It's just fun, you
know. You have to change sometimes. It's too boring, everybody, they have the same fashion
all the time. I like to change sometimes, shave my head, put this, every time different.
I'm never going to put a different color in my hair, but like this is fine. I think young
people, they like it. Old people, you know, they not so happy with this hair. It's tough
to please old people. They are complaining too much.

Q. Goran, can you pinpoint your highlights for 1996?

GORAN IVANISEVIC: I have the best starting year ever, you know, couple of months I
played every week a final or won a tournament. I proved myself that I can play very
consistently for a couple of months. Then I got injured, and it was very difficult to come
back. I think all the year was pretty good. Also the US Open and before, I proved myself
that I can play in the States. I never believed I could play good on hardcourt, but this
year I proved it that I can do well and one day I could win the US Open. I was very close
this year, so maybe next year I try.
