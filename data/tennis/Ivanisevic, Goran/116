Q. Goran, What was the difference between the Olympics and
today?

GORAN IVANISEVIC: Olympics I played four games in a row; five
sets the day before semi final; I played doubles, five sets, I
was very tired. He played great. Played the best tennis of his
life, so, but today, I mean, last week I beat him very tough match.
Today it was little bit windy. I think it helped me because when
he is playing good, he is hitting only forehands. So today he
couldn't go around and hit a forehand. So I play more on his backhand
and then I hit his forehand and backhand again. So he didn't know
what to do. Then at 5-2 in the third, I was thinking about Wimbledon
because I played him there. I had 2 sets to love 5-2; I lost my
serve and 5-4, I was considering much more. Had a little bit of
luck with one backhand and that was it.

Q. How do you think you served today?

GORAN IVANISEVIC: I serve okay. When I needed, I served okay.
But just two games in the game I was rushing a little bit. You
have 5-2 up, then you think it is over, but it is not over. And
then I was rushing. I was more confident every time like that,
I am rushing more and I cannot put the first serving, that happened
today.

Q. Did you notice the miles per hour, the chart on the serves
at all? Did you pay attention to some of your--

GORAN IVANISEVIC: No, because I can't concentrate if I look. 


Q. Goran, you said at New Haven that you didn't feel very confident.
Are you confident now?

GORAN IVANISEVIC: Not yet. I mean, this week I was practicing
a lot. I feel much better, but not great. I still not playing
like I know I have to play. This match is going to give me a lot
of confidence because I beat a great player. So I am going to
be more confident in the next match.

Q. Who would you choose for winning the U.S. Open this time?

GORAN IVANISEVIC: Sampras, Courier, Edberg, Becker, maybe me.
A lot of guys. Agassi. So, I don't know who is going to win. You
have to pick one.

Q. Goran, you talked before about how important it is for you
to keep your concentration. You called it going crazy sometimes.
After going through that at Wimbledon, do you think it is going
to be easier for you to keep your concentration for two Grand
Slams?

GORAN IVANISEVIC: Sure, because if I can do it in Wimbledon and
Olympics games, I can do it anywhere. I am ready. I mean, because
before I was taking Grand Slam tournament like it was very nervous,
then I couldn't play like two matches in a row good. But now I
try to play like normal tournaments. So I am trying to play. Trying
to fight. I think it is going to be more interesting. I am going
to be much more dangerous than before.

Q. I just want to ask you about going crazy. How do you know
when you start to lose it? You start looking around at the stands?

GORAN IVANISEVIC: Yeah, I start to rush. I walking like crazy
man. Just walk. I don't know where I am going. Like you running
against somebody, somebody chasing you and you are running. So
that is the problem. Then I can't start just running, running.
But one day I say, "This is enough. You have to stop. You
have to try to control this. And now I am good. I am not running
anymore."

Q. Did somebody ever-- obviously English is not your first
language. So I am interested in your use of the word "Crazy,"
because if clearly you are not a crazy man.

GORAN IVANISEVIC: I mean crazy. I don't mean crazy like crazy.
I mean crazy nice way, you know, it is different.

Q. Did somebody call you that?

GORAN IVANISEVIC: No, nobody called me like you are crazy, crazy.
You are a little bit, you know. But I am young I can still come
back.

Q. Thank you.
