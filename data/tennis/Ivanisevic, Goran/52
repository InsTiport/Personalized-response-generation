Q. An easy win to start with? It goes on as it did last year? Is that right, this
tournament?

GORAN IVANISEVIC: I won last year a couple of matches. I won the tournament. I'm
beginning to win this year, but I don't know how long it's going to last this winning
streak.

Q. What happened with your volleys?

GORAN IVANISEVIC: My volleys? Nothing. I missed a couple, I put a couple in.

Q. Volley?

GORAN IVANISEVIC: What do you mean "volley"?

Q. You should be satisfied with your serve, the statistics are great, 200, 204. Every
time you got into the game, into the net to volley, we thought you had problems. Was it
the change to a different surface?

GORAN IVANISEVIC: In the beginning I missed a couple of easy volleys. But, the ball is
coming pretty fast and it's tough to control. It's altitude, the ball is flying a lot.
When I needed to put a volley in, I put it in. Hopefully next match I can volley better.

Q. Krajicek and Rosset being out, you are the best server. Do you start feeling
yourself as a favorite as last year?

GORAN IVANISEVIC: Of course, it's very fast, but I can play from the back court. I play
this year in Hannover pretty good from the back. It's fast court, and if I serve well, I
have a good chance, like last year.

Q. Who would you expect as your next opponent, Agassi or Woodforde? Who do you prefer?

GORAN IVANISEVIC: I don't care. Maybe I prefer Agassi. I didn't play him long time.
Whoever comes, I have to play well. Hopefully I can get rest tomorrow and play Friday,
play good, better than today.
