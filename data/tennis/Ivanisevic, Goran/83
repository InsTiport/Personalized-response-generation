Q.  You and Thomas have been going on dates or something like that?
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Oh, yeah, we are becoming great friends.  Tomorrow after the match we are going to go for a little dinner and then maybe to the cinema.  I think it is a record.  I don't think nobody played four weeks in a row and I tell you, I had enough of him.  But probably likes to play me.  He beat me three times in a row, so hopefully I can -- I don't know what can I change.  I mean, but just hope that I can win. 
 

Q.  How is your game tonight compared to the other times you played?
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  I think I served very good today.  I knew he has a shake little shaky backhand and  hit a lot of serves to his backhand, but I served great on both sides and return was not so great.  I mean, pretty bad returning, but twice when I needed the break I did it and he didn't have any chance, so I think it was okay, but I have to play a little bit better tomorrow if I want to beat Enqvist. 
 

Q.  Seems you are enjoy playing on hard court?
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Yeah, I don't know what happened this year, but I have more fun; having good results this year on hard court and I am happy the way I play and everything is going fine. 
 

Q.  Are you going to think about your next match the whole night?
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  I don't know if I am going to have bad dreams about him tonight -- no, I mean, it is another match.  I mean, we had three every time, you know, three weeks I won the first set.  In Montreal I had match point; served for the match.  In L.A. I was up 4-3, 15-40.  First set in Cincinnati; chance in the second, in the beginning and then I just was gone.  And hopefully tomorrow I am going to lose first set 6-Love then -- and then I might win, I don't know what is -- 
 

Q.  A new tactic?
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Probably in the first set I say okay, I have bad shoulder, I retire.  
 

Q.  How do you feel physically after four tournaments in a row?
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  I feel very good.  I mean, I thought my knee is going to hurt, but my knee is doing very good and everything is fine.  It is pretty hot and taking the heat pretty good and I am happy the way -- my physical. 
 

Q.  Goran, with the heat factor, do you weigh yourself before you go on court and then weigh yourself after, how many kilos or whatever do you think you might have lost after this match tonight?
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Not too much.  But maybe when you play heat -- this is not -- this is pretty cool.  But it was very humid tonight, maybe one, two kilos, it depends, maybe more.  Depends where you play.  And maybe Grand Slam, you lose more.  But sometimes I do it; sometimes, no.  It depends.
