 Q. How satisfying is your performance compared to your whole year?
 
 GORAN IVANISEVIC: I think it was okay the way I played. The last two months it was not
so good. Finally today I started to serve like I usually serve because I was serving and
volleying first and second serve. I was not scared to come in on my serve. That is why I
served very good when I needed. The court is very fast and it is tough to play from the
back, so I hit a lot of mis-hits. But with Petr, it is not easy to play. He hits the ball
very flat. He doesn't give you any rhythm and the ball is going so fast. So, I mean, I am
happy the way I played. 
 
Q. What did you expect from Petr's play because he hasn't played for two months because
of injury?
 
 GORAN IVANISEVIC: With him, he is not a guy like some other players on the Tour, that
he needs five months practice. You know, he is very talented and he doesn't need very much
to get into the rhythm. He hits the ball very easy, everything looks very easy, so he
doesn't need a lot of practice to play good, so he probably didn't practice too much, but
he still hit the ball very good. I have knew he was going to be tough. He is always a very
tough opponent for me.
