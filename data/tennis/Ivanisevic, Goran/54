Q.  Goran, there has been some talk about a letter or petition some players have apparently signed here asking for a slower court for next year.  Did you sign this one too?
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  I don't know.  Why should I sign? The court is okay, I think. 
 

Q.  But do you know about this letter?
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  No. 
 

Q.  Goran, in a long match like that, which is so close, how difficult is it to maintain one's concentration when just an occasionally point will change the match?
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  It is not easy.  I knew I have to keep my cool and -- every time when I was up 30-Love or  15-Love, I never put my first serve in and sometimes I was risking - sometimes went in; sometimes went out.  Two most important points I made two doublefaults matchpoint and, in the tiebreaker in the second set.  So, he doesn't give a lot of free points.  You have to work for every point.  And it is not easy when -- he is serving good and I am serving good.  It is like war between two servers and then somebody has to crack and I did.  I mean, okay, I made two doubles faults last game and he played one good shot and that is it.
