Q.  The fact that you already qualified for the semifinals, did that have any bearing on the way you played today?

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Well, I was a little tired.  Plus I had a very tough mental match last night.  And, it is tough to come up motivated 100%.  I knew that I already qualified.  I didn't play very well and with that game, I was set and break up, matchpoints, a lot of breakpoints.  But, I think if I would lose the match yesterday, I think I would win this match today.  And, then some bad balls.  Footfault in the second set in the tiebreak.  But, I think the schedule, the way they make it here, I don't understand it at all.  Some players they have -- it is like -- we are eight players here, eight best  players in the word, they make favor to some of the players here.  They put us whenever they want.  It is a good idea they didn't put me on the other court to play.  So, it is okay, I am in the semis.  I lost the match.  But, tomorrow I have a day off and hopefully Saturday, if I want to win Saturday, I have to play a little better.  But, I am going to get rested and I am going to be okay.
