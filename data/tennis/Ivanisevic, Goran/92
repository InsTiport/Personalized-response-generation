Q.  You didn't seem to be, in the beginning of  the match, to be on top of your game?  
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  It is tough, you know, I  know I am playing good, but I cannot win.  Then it is  tough inside.  He played good tennis today.  I had only  chance last game when he choked a little bit.  He was a  little tight.  He needed that game to win, and he was  missing a lot of first serves. I had a breakpoint, easy  second serve, but I wanted to hit like an idiot, then I  just missed.   
 

Q.  Can you explain your conversations with the  umpire?  
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Which one?   
 

Q.  All of them.  
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  First of all, I deserved  the volley (sic) because I say a couple of bad things,  but then this line lady -- I mean, okay, I told her  something nice in Croatian and then she came up to the  umpire and she said that I said something  half English/half Croatian, which I didn't say.  I said  only Croatian.  She did not understand what I say.  She  was just guessing.  Then I got penalty point because  she was guessing what I might say to her.  I think that  is not correct.  I mean, if she would understand, it  would be okay, but I don't think she understood because  if she understand, I don't think she would get up on  the chair because she would get heart attack straight  away.   
 

Q.  She guessed the right --  
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Yeah.   
 

Q.  You don't want to tell us what you said.  
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  You don't want to know.  You want to know,  But I don't want to tell  you.   
 

Q.  You have done real well here before in this  tournament.  Is it disappointing a lot not to have done  well this time?  
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  I did twice semis and this  time I had a tough group.  It is not the end of the  world.  I lost against three great players, so it would  be everything if I win this first match, but put me a  little bit down and everything could happen if I win  this first match.  I lost by a couple of points and  then it can be around, but now I lost the first match,  I lost to Stefan; today it is Pete.  I mean, just big  names and it is not -- I played my good tennis.  I had  fun here and it is not so bad.   
 

Q.  Are you worried with your final situation?  
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  I don't know what -- now  they have a meeting, you know, what is going to happen,  you know.  I don't know the rules, if suspended, I am  going to be two months, probably, but I don't know if  they are -- it is only ATP Tour events.  I don't know  if it is also Grand Slam Cup and exhibitions, so they  say it is everything.  But I don't think they have a  right to disqualify me from exhibitions and Grand Slam  Cup.  Good thing in these two months, it is only one  ATP tournament in Sidney.  If I'm not going to play for  two months, I am going to start in Australia.  They  cannot win this ATP; let them have fun; who cares.   
 

Q.  You were saying all through Wimbledon that  you were a lot calmer, you didn't want to get annoyed  like that.  What has changed since then for you to go  back that way?  
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  No, I was calm.  This year  I behave very good.  I had all my fines.  I had like  $6,000 fines only on press conference because I didn't  show up at the press conference.  That what hurt me;  only $2,000 what I when I throw the racket.  That is a  bigger thing, so I was much calmer this year.  I could  control myself, but only bad thing, I couldn't control  my press conference, you know, so that hurt me a lot,  that 6 press conferences cost $1,000 each one, so... I  think the next day I have to improve my press  conference.  I have to come.  I have to show up.   
 

Q.  Why are press conferences hard for you?  
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  No, I mean, sometimes I am  too frustrated; I don't want to come because you guys  ask some difficult questions, you know, so I don't know  what to say; then I rather not to go, you know, just  rather pay; give it to charity, but then I realize when  it was too late whenever I was already $7,000 fines  then I realized I am in big trouble, it was too late  already.  So next year I am going to think, but that  was maybe bad thing this year what I did, I didn't go  to these press conferences, so next year I am going --  you are going to see me every time.   
 

Q.  Who is going to win, Goran?  
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  I don't know.  It can be  Pete, Boris, Andre.  I don't know.  I mean, it is open,  pretty much.
