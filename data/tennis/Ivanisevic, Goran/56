CORINNE MILLIAND:  Congratulations to Goran.  He is the first one to advance into the semifinals.

(APPLAUSE.)


Q.  Goran,, is it your magic tail that you can hit so many second serves or was it Croatian srtan (Croatian word "luck")?

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  I don't call this lucky or srtan. It is -- maybe it is more stupid.  It is Croatian roulette, you know, and not too many guys can do that.  I saw only Boris doing that before when he has trouble; then he goes for the big one.  I did that in most of the third set against Yevgeny, I hit an ace, so I saw today -- I was thinking, "okay, second serve stay back; not good idea; maybe he is going to come in."  "Hit to his backhand, he is waiting there; not good  idea."  So, all these ideas, I picked the craziest one.


Q.  You did it five or six times?

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Yeah, I did it, but third set, the way he was serving, you know, if the ball goes one millimeter longer, it is a break and I am history.  But, when I did that, everything change.


Q.  Richard said he will praise your courage to go for your second serve because it was unbelievable at very crucial moments?

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Yeah, I went and it went in and I knew that he was serving too good in the third set.  And, I didn't have any chance.  And, I knew that always happening to me when I serve very good in the set; then I come to the tiebreaker, always make some stupid things.  So that is what he did.  He gave me nice gift.  He went for the big second serve on the 1-0, and, then another doublefault and you don't -- you take this gift and then after that, 3-0, it is such a big lead, you know, you just going for the -- then I put first serves in and I just played good tiebreaker.


Q.  Also because you feel more confidence after winning Moscow; do you feel you are back again?

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Sure, you don't do ace with the second serve if you don't feel good and if you don't feel confident; especially here it is a big tournament, best eight  players and you have to feel confident.  I was very confident tonight.  I didn't serve very great, but when I needed, just put a big serve, especially with the second serve, but you don't do all the time.


Q.  But Richard said he felt the better player the second and third sets.  Do you agree?

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  He served better, but I mean, not better player, but why? Then he would win today.


Q.  Because he said he created more chances than did you, probably?

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  He had one chance, one chance that breakpoint and that was in the third set.  Maybe he came more times to 30-All and deuce, but that was it.  Better player or not, that is -- maybe he was, but he lost, so, it is okay with me.


Q.  What is your opinion about the withdrawal of Agassi?

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  I don't know, I mean, the way he played today something was wrong definitely with him.  I don't know what or why he withdraws, but I have the feeling that this would happen.


Q.  Do you think it is fair play that the guy comes in and can reach semifinals by playing only two matches? You have to play three.

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  I think it is okay.  I think why not.  If you are alternate, you are No. 9, you stay here - I  know how it is to be No. 9 and hang out in the lockerroom and pray somebody is going to pull out.  So finally you get a chance and why not.  You have a chance to go into the semis if you play good.


Q.  Is this the most close match you had with Richard?

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Yeah, most close match.  Usually finish, quit or he wins or I win, but this one was a little dramatic.
