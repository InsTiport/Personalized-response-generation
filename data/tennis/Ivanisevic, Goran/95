Q. How much are you disappointed? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC: A lot because -- I don't know. I mean, I didn't play tennis today. I
don't know what I do there. Not only today, every year when I come U.S. Open, I don't know
what I am doing here, you know. Sometimes I ask myself why I am coming here because -- I
don't know. I mean, it is really bad because he didn't play anything. He hit some winners,
but that is it. I didn't play. I just stand there, put two balls in the court, ten minutes
long and the serve was terrible. I mean, nothing was good. I mean, nothing. 

Q. Why do you feel so uncomfortable here, Goran? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC: I don't know. Because every year I come hoping that I am going to
play good, but it is only hopes. And I came here, like, okay, now I am going to do good. I
am always hoping, maybe, you know, what is these things, maybe, maybe. I was hitting the
ball okay in the practice, but I don't know, today I just -- and I don't know, I am
putting two negative things when I play. Only tournament I look at the draw, I look only
first round. I don't like second round or third round because I know it is tough to get
there. If I win one round, second round, it is -- so if you come with attitude like this,
then it is no good. 

Q. Are you affected by your injury at all? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC: Maybe brain injury. 

Q. How nervous were you coming onto the court; were you nervous the whole time? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC: I am nervous before every match. I am nervous especially Grand Slam,
first rounds, second seed. I am nervous, but nothing to do the way I play today. It is
really -- I don't know. I was nervous, but I didn't play tennis. 

Q. He said he felt your serve was much stronger in the third and fourth set. Did you
start to get the feeling that you were playing better or that you can pull it out? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC: First two sets I just tried to force it. I mean, I tried to hit every
serve so hard, and everything was going ten meters long. And then I start to serve a
little bit better in the third set, but second set a lot of chances and I had this 15 --
three breakpoints and I was playing too safe. I was waiting for his mistakes and you can't
play like this on this court. I mean, you have to try, at least try to hit it, and if you
miss, you miss. But like this, you can't win. But then the third set I played better and I
hope -- I was hoping I am going to play better, but then, I don't know when was the last
time I won the game at 6-5. And I always lose a game when it is 6-5 and I have to hold. 

Q. He played so consistently week-in and week-out? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC: Yeah, but I play better on clay. Clay I was playing good. It is
different tennis. I don't know. As soon as I come here it is finished. I don't know why.
It is like I am playing -- I don't know. 

Q. Is it New York? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC: New York is a great city. I like it here. I am enjoying to be here.
It is not a problem with New York. It is a problem with me. I am putting too much pressure
on myself that I cannot play, that I am too scared or I play two games here or I play
serve-and-volley ball serves and I stay back, I never come in. That is what happened
today. I mean, I just stayed back, I didn't come in. Maybe two times. In Indianapolis I
serve and volley first and second serve whole match and I lost the match. So it is nothing
in between. I have to find something in between; maybe to serve and volley, sometimes stay
back, come in, but I can't do that. I am playing too defensive or I just coming in, and
then it is also not good. 

Q. You had a great attitude for two weeks at Wimbledon. Has that changed since the
third set against Sampras? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC: It didn't change. I mean, I won the tournament two weeks after and it
didn't change. But I don't know why I am so negative when I come here on these hard
courts. It is not only -- also Indian Wells, Key Biscayne, it is hard court, because in
Australia it is also this. But in Australia, I am playing good and I don't understand it. 

Q. You have also had some problems in that tournament in Indian Wells. Which site do
you dislike the most, this one or Indian Wells? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC: I don't know. I like-- I mean, it is not bad place, but just you have
to say something stupid like I always say. Maybe I should -- I don't, know maybe I should
try to play some women's tournaments next year. But I am not sure if I will win that
because like this, maybe I win a couple of rounds, but something will happen. 

Q. Do you feel that you are beaten when you come in here; is that the kind of feeling
you have? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC: I don't know what to play here when I come here. I don't know what
game to use. I am lost. I look like lost man. 

Q. Are you trying hard? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC: I am trying, but I am lost a little bit. I see these planes and I saw
my place on that flight. 

Q. How long does it take for you to get over your losses at the U.S. Open; do you dwell
on them more than the others? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC: Not easy. I really hoped this year that I can do well and I was ready
and just I come on the court and I play tennis like that, and it is not easy. Now, I'm
really disappointed because, okay, you can lose first round, but at least if you try
something, but I didn't try anything. I didn't do anything good today that I can say,
okay, at least I did that good, so I can work on something, but completely everything was
bad, whatever I did today was wrong. 

Q. Before this match, did you sit down with Bob Brett and talk about the problems you
have coming in here, and if you did, what was his advice to you? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC: It's not going to help if I sit before. We were talking, I mean,
before we came here I lost first two rounds in previous two tournaments and came here, I
was really, I mean, excited to play and I was playing good in practice. But today, I don't
know, I mean, it is -- I can't explain it. I don't know what happened. It is every year
the same. Something happens or it is first round, second round, third round, doesn't
matter what round, one round it happens where I am blocked, completely blocked and I can't
play tennis and then for sure you can't win because even with that tennis, I won one set.
So if I play a little bit better, I think it is no way that he can beat me, because he
didn't do too much. I mean, he just put three balls in the court and then fourth one was
mistake. 

Q. How are you going to solve this problem? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC: I wish I would know. I wish I had answer. I mean, I don't know. I
really -- now, for sure now I don't have answer, but I have to change something. I don't
know what, but... 

Q. Are you saying that when you are on the court, you can't think your way through to
the next movement, next thing you have to do? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC: I can't think. I am not thinking -- I am too scared to think, because
today, I mean, my chances-- every time I had chance I didn't do -- I tried to push the
ball, tried to wait for his mistakes and you can't do that here. Only good point what I
play was on his matchpoint when I hit that forehand winner, only point when I hit
something and it was in. I mean, it is like 50/50. 

Q. You complained about the food in the USA', have you found anything better? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC: No, it is great food.
