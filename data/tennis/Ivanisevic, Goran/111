Q.  Goran, what makes you so strong?  Is it the atmosphere? Is it the surface? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  I just enjoying to play here.  I mean, it is very great atmosphere.  I always play good in Germany.  It is really nice to play here.  I really enjoy to play, playing good at the moment.  I don't know how long I am going to play like this.  Tomorrow is another day, but I am really feeling good. 


Q.  Last time you played Becker, you lost badly.  So do you think this is an advantage for you?  Do you think it is an advantage for him, that now he had a big win against you on his -- 

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  It can be, but he is going to have tough time tomorrow. That is all I know.  I mean, the people they are going to be with him tomorrow, but this is my court.  This is the court I like to play.  I like to play on this court more than Supreme.  If he wants to beat me tomorrow, he has to play more than good.  So he is going to have a tough time.  I am going to be extra pumped tomorrow, especially because I am playing him here.  So I want to beat him bad. 


Q.  Is it a special problem for you both that Mr. Tiriac is your manager and his manager as well? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Nothing to do with that.  I am just going to beat him in Germany.  I am going to feel good. 


Q.  What has happened with your neck? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  It was a little bit stiff, but then there was no problems. 


Q.  What is the difference between this court and Paris? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Paris is Supreme and ball is bouncing much lower and here it is much better for serving, takes the slice much better.  I beat him on this court in Stockholm.  It is the same court.  So it is going to be interesting tomorrow; we will see. 


Q.  What job has Bob Brett done for you to raise your confidence level since two years ago, and, also, what is he going to do to set you up against Boris? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  We are going to talk a little bit tomorrow, going to prepare especially because this is going to be a tough match.  Going to be like Davis Cup.  But I mean, I changed a lot myself because I wanted to change, because last year was not the great year.  I say you have to change, otherwise you can't improve.  So I change a lot because I wanted to change.  Bob, for sure, he talked to me, but I am the one who wanted to change. 


Q.  If you compare your relationship to Boris, is it a friendship or what is it? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  I mean, it is okay.  We can talk.  We are not some great friends, but when we see each other we talk.  We don't hate each other. 


Q.  But you are not often going out with him having a dinner? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  No.  No. 


Q.  Goran, you are playing so well right now.  What is it going to take for you to take that into next year and actually make a challenge to be No. 1 next year and win a couple of Grand Slams? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  It is no problem.  I just have to continue to practice very hard after this tournament; prepare for next year, and just enjoy to play, like I am enjoying now, and everything is going to be okay. 


Q.  Are you enjoying the game more right now than you were a year ago? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Yeah, I am really enjoying the game.  I am really very confident.  I mean, on the court I have fun, and then it is-- tennis is a very nice game you are enjoying to play.  When you are like in a bad mood, then you don't enjoy it; then it is very boring to play. 


Q.  There were a couple of people right after Wimbledon they said maybe it is better for him not to win Wimbledon this time because he is not ready to handle all the problems as a champion.  Do you think now the fire is deep inside to win Wimbledon more than maybe last year? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  There are a lot of people they say when you win Wimbledon you have to change.  I don't know why you to have change.  I am going to be always me; I mean, always can't be serious.  I mean, serious because I was like this when I was young, and I am never going to be change if I win Wimbledon.  I think it is wrong.  And winning Wimbledon I am going to try next year, and I am never going to change even if I win Wimbledon.  I am always going to be Goran Ivanisevic.  I am never going to be some other guy after winning Wimbledon get crazy, finish-- 


Q.  Goran, you have seen other players become successful and change.  Success changes other players sometimes.  Why will it not change you? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Because I don't want to change.  I mean, if I am winning, I am same.  Other people, they start to talk a little bit rubbish, you know, in the press.  They don't know what they are doing, they don't know what they are talking; they just out of control.  So I don't like that.  I mean, I want to be the same because if I change I don't feel good.  I don't feel that it is me; I feel that it is somebody else in my body, so I don't -- can't control that, but like this I am perfect.  I like it. 


Q.  What is the story about the exhibition match against Boris in Croatia?  Wasn't it an idea from you or? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Yeah, because we have foundation, me, Oresar, Prpic and Boris to help kids of Croatia.  So it was one idea to organize exhibition in Zagreb and we ask Boris and he said he go is going to play.  He was happy to play to help kids, so I think it is very nice for him to help kids in Croatia and for me, I mean, that is a big thing for him.  He is a -- I have respect for him because he did that. 


Q.  But not tomorrow? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Not tomorrow. 


Q.  When is that exhibition? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Saturday, next Saturday. 


Q.  Anymore questions in English? 

Q.  Goran, Jim is No. 1 today when Stefan lost.  What are your feelings about that?  Courier is now sure of being year-end No. 1. 

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  I think he deserve it to be No. 1; that is what I said already.  I think he deserved it because he played very well this year. He won two Grand Slam tournaments.  I think he deserve it, so congratulations to him.  He was the best this year.  I mean, the best results, he was very steady, so it is good for him.  It is a nice feeling to be No. 1 at the end of the year.
