 Q.  Goran, first, about yesterday, the incident on the doubles
court.  Can you describe what it feels like to be hit with a serve
from Marc Rosset in the back of the head?

 GORAN IVANISEVIC  Very nice feeling, I tell you.  It's -- you
have to try once.  It doesn't hurt at all.  I mean, it's an unbelievable
pain because you just wait for his big second serve; I mean, it's
coming here right on my neck.

 Q.  How bad was it?

 GORAN IVANISEVIC  I was really swollen, and then I couldn't --
doctor was pointing the finger; I couldn't see the finger.  I
mean, my reflexes was pretty slow.  So then I went to hospital,
took some MRI x-rays to see if anything broken or blood inside,
so everything was okay.

 Q.  What did you say to Marc this morning?

 GORAN IVANISEVIC  What did I say to him?  I mean, we're gonna
play more doubles this year, so I'm going to serve, you know.


 Q.  Was it still bothering you tonight at all?

 GORAN IVANISEVIC  Still sore, not bothering me.

 Q.  What is so difficult to play when you play against Jim,
what makes it so difficult, do you feel it's mentally very strong?

 GORAN IVANISEVIC:  At first, I mean this is when I lose today,
I mean I'm happy the way I play because I lose to him in Australia,
I played pretty badly and didn't do anything, but today at least
I came in and I have some chances, and I play completely different
game than I play in Australia.  I was trying to come in every
chance I had.  But I think he played very good.  I think I hitting
the ball very good, better than in Palm Springs, for sure. He's
tough, you know, he's very good competitor and, I mean, I had
chances, I had these two breakpoints and he doesn't give you so
many breakpoints and you have to take the chance.  But the way
I play, I mean, in five years, yes, I didn't win one match, so
this year I win couple of matches, so it's not bad.

 Q.  Goran, why is it so bad; it seems so bad for you to concentrate
for any length of time out there when you're out there?

 GORAN IVANISEVIC  It's tough.  It's very windy.  It's tough.
 Sometimes you hit the ball and it's not going anywhere.  Sometimes
just push the ball, it's flying with the wind.  It's not easy.
 You have to be really mentally tough to play on this sort of
condition because it's really, really tough to play.
