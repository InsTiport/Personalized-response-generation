Q. What happened the first two sets?
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  I don't know, he played okay, so good. I didn't have a lot of chances.  I was always behind.  I don't know, I think he played much better than me first two sets. 
 

Q. How did you feel your game was?
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  It was not so great.  I served really bad.  When I need, I didn't put one first serve in.  I didn't play great.  I played pretty bad. Actually, I am playing like pretty bad, so it is nothing surprising for me. 
 

Q. Are you lacking in confidence?
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  I don't know what I am lacking.  I don't know.  It is just -- I had a great draw, if I can pick the better draw I couldn't pick it, but just  - I don't know.  If I cannot win a set with 5-0 in the tiebreaker, so then I don't know what can I win anymore. 
 

Q. You really fight in the last two sets, but in the beginning what was it that you were lacking, the first --
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  I mean, he was just better.  I mean, I couldn't put three balls in the court.  Just missed everything.  I didn't look for my chance. I didn't come in.  I didn't do anything.  Just relied on my serve and that was not working, and that is it. 
 

Q. He was taking pace off the ball.  How much of a factor was that for you?
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Sit okay with me, but I just -- I didn't do anything.  I mean, he give me a lot of short balls, and I didn't take any advantage of those balls, even now, last point.  I mean, I could finish the point ten times to come in and I just hit like an idiot from the back.  Sure I am going to miss a -- 
 

Q. Why was that?
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  I don't know why was that.  I have six chances to come in, I didn't come once, so that is the way. 
 

Q. Does the heat affect you in anyway?  
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  It is humid.  It is okay.  I was okay feeling, feeling okay, so I could play another 2, three sets, there was no problem. 
 

Q. It doesn't make you slower?
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  No. 
 

Q. Had you similar trouble in Indy losing that match to Arias you talked about trying to change things around.  Have you thought -- can you think again of how you might change things?
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  This is two different type of players, Arias and Costa.  Costa is a good player and I mean -- I don't know; I mean, he can play good, but I didn't do anything to hurt him.  If I put first serve then, okay, I hit an ace, so something happen.  But, if not, I am in trouble.  Then I have to hit winners, but you cannot hit winners every time. 
 

Q. Thank you.
