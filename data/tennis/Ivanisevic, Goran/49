Q. Goran, is that the best you've ever had Becker play against you?

GORAN IVANISEVIC: I don't know. He played a -- we played a lot of times. I think he
played very good; maybe the best. But, bad thing is he served much better than me today.
That was the key. He returned much better than me. Usually I lost to him before also
sometimes easy, but I at least have breakpoints and chances to break, but today not even.
Closest was 30-All, and that's it. But he was picking my first serve pretty good. He was
guessing and guessing good. I mean, he play too good. I didn't have too many -- any chance
actually - nothing.

Q. Were there any moments in the match where you gave up, just gave up?

GORAN IVANISEVIC: No, I didn't give up. I tried. I was hoping, okay, maybe he's going
to slow down; not serve so well. The problem with him, when he misses the first serve, he
has a second serve, one of the best second serves in the game. He puts it very deep; goes
for it sometimes like me, then it's the same thing. I have to hit perfect return,
otherwise he comes in and hits the volley. Even when I put the return back, he make a
great volley. I never give up. I try. I just couldn't do it.

Q. Goran, is he playing better now than he was, say, three years ago?

GORAN IVANISEVIC: I think so, because tennis -- everybody is playing better. If he
stayed Top 10 and he stay on the top, he realize he has to be better and fitter. I think
he's playing best tennis ever. In my opinion, he's faster, he's moving better, and he's
playing much better. All the top guys, they improve the game. He realize if he wants to
stay there, he has to go a step more, and he did it. He's playing unbelievable tennis.

Q. If you had to rank Boris - he missed a few months the middle part of the year, so
his ranking slipped down - but if you had to rank him amongst the other players, where
would you put him right now?

GORAN IVANISEVIC: I don't know. That's a tough question. He missed the best part of his
tennis. Won the Queen's. He had a great chance in Wimbledon. Then this thing happen. I
don't know. He had a good chance to be No. 1 this year if he didn't have injury. Now, it's
late. If he plays like this next year, he's going to be tough. He's going to be one of the
tough opponents to beat. He has a good chance to be No. 1 because -- except Australia, he
has a lot of free, like, room that he can gain a lot of points. I think he's going to be
dangerous to be No. 1 next year.
