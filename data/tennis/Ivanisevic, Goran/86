Q.  Goran, you looked pretty confident in the  second set.  

GORAN IVANISEVIC: I looked pretty confident  from the beginning.  I felt much better today on the  court from the beginning.  I served very good today,  and I think I returned his serve good.  That was the  key because he is serving unbelievable when you return  some important points when he serves, then we have to  play the point and that was important.  


Q.  How is your level of game and play, actually?  

GORAN IVANISEVIC: I think I played very  good.  I think this couple of matches I play in  Barcelona and today here, I think this is maybe my best  year on the clay.  I improve a lot on clay.  I think  this year I am going to play more tournaments on clay.  I think the game on clay is much improving and I have  more fun to play on clay.  I am much more fitter than  before and I am enjoying to play on clay.  


Q.  You are going to play many more tournaments  this year on clay comparing with other years?  

GORAN IVANISEVIC: Yeah, I am going to play  Hamburg, Rome and the Nation's Cup which I didn't play  before the French Open.  So I don't know if it is good  or bad for French.  It is different clay, but I think I  am fit now.  I didn't play for nine weeks and I am keen  to play more and more matches and I think I am going to  be ready.  


Q.  Goran, how much of a challenge was it to get  your fitness back after the operation?  It was the  biggest challenge maybe that you have had.  

GORAN IVANISEVIC: Yeah, it was tough in the  beginning.  It was nice to be home and I was not a long  time home.  But it is also tough.  You have to do a lot  of rehabilitation every day and you see all the guys  that are playing and you want to go and play and you  can't run; you have to go in the gym for three, four  hours do the same thing for three, four weeks and it is  pretty boring, and -- but, I mean, I had to stay  mentally tough, and just believe if I followed the  rehabilitation program I am going to get back faster so  I was doing and I was very patient with that, and I had  fun doing it and I came back pretty fast.
