 MIKI SINGH: First question for Goran. 
 
Q. How was the view?
 
 GORAN IVANISEVIC: Beautiful. Very nice chair. It is very nice to sit, you know, that is
why he makes so many mistakes. 
 
Q. It is too comfortable up there?
 
 GORAN IVANISEVIC: Very comfortable. They should put him in tougher chairs, that is why
they are going to be concentrated. They have very soft chairs and they are not
concentrate. 
 
Q. What is it going to take to win an American title?
 
 GORAN IVANISEVIC: I don't know what it is going to take. To play better than I played
today. 
 
Q. What made the difference today in your mind?
 
 GORAN IVANISEVIC: I didn't have four shots today. Second serve bad. No forehand
down-the-line. Bad return and backhand was too risky. And I did a lot of running. I hit
only forehand crosscourt, he stand there and made me left right, left right, I was running
like idiot. After I was tired. I hit a lot of forehands because my backhand was like
roulette. I didn't know where it is going. It is like my golf, I never know where the ball
goes. I hit three backhands today. I didn't have a clue where the ball is going. So he was
just standing there and making me run. With that I have to hit some down-the-lines which I
didn't hit. I tried on matchpoints and I miss-hit. My second serve was not there, a lot of
doublefaults. 
 
Q. He is tough to play, isn't he, with the patience, style tough to play?
 
 GORAN IVANISEVIC: No, I have patience. I can play with him all day there. But twice I
lost my serve, first set and third set and twice with the overrules, with the bad calls
and it happens. Instead of 15-All, Love-30, it happened twice and it is a big difference.
Then he hits a good return; then it is Love-40 and it is a big difference 15-30 and
Love-40, so didn't have to come back. It is not easy. I came to 30-40; then I made
doublefault, but those linespeople are terrible. I thought it is going to be better, but
it is always on my side. One point, two bad calls on one point. I hit ace and the guy
said: Okay, replay the point. Then I hit another ace. Then it is long. Bad. I don't know,
but that is two games I lost the match and I lost my serve and that is it. 
 
Q. On that missed call in the 9th game of the first set did you get those thoughts of
Wimbledon again?
 
 GORAN IVANISEVIC: No, I didn't just -- just bad calls, bad calls. But a couple of bad
calls cost me the match. 
 
Q. How did your shoulder feel today?
 
 GORAN IVANISEVIC: In the beginning it was hurting and then not on first serve, like on
second serve, that is why I start to hit some different second serves. I hit a lot of
doublefaults and then I lost my rhythm completely. When I lost my rhythm, I am not there,
it is again roulette. Just going in everywhere. The first serve was working fine, but
second serve I lost my confidence completely. 
 
Q. Shoulder ever loosen up and get better?
 
 GORAN IVANISEVIC: Shoulder was better after, but my serve was not better. 
 
Q. What do you think can be done? I mean, you guys talk about the linesmen and bad
calls, things like that. It happens in tournaments all over the place. What do you think
could be done to alleviate that, that way you guys can concentrate on playing?
 
 GORAN IVANISEVIC: I don't think anything can be done. Also a lot of times the umpire
mistakes, he loses sometimes the complete control of the game and then he starts to
overrule stupidly, starts to make mistakes, and -- but they have to bring more young
people, like I said the other day, there is too many olds linesmen here in the States. I
don't know why. It is tough to react. It is tough for me to see sometimes; especially for
the ladies, 60, 70 years old, what are you going to see. Nothing. Just stand like this and
I don't know if she is alive or dead (laughter) She is there, I have to check her if she
is alive. Move her, it is too heavy. That is the problem. 
 
Q. It is just a problem in the States?
 
 GORAN IVANISEVIC: Indoor is also tough because it is fast, but I never had so much
problems with the linespeople like here in the States. That is only here, anywhere where
you play in the States, it is a question of they just sometimes -- they bring older them
and they are not concentrate -- it is tough to keep concentrated. It is -- you have to to
sit there especially when it is hot. You have to sit or stand for one hour. The balls are
flying, you have to always be there and you lose a couple of times concentration and that
can cost you the match, or set, or -- it is tough. 
 
Q. Are the linespeople younger in Europe?
 
 GORAN IVANISEVIC: In Europe, yes. But it is also mistakes a lot of times of the umpire,
the main guy up there because he has to look more carefully; especially after I went up
and he has a nice view up there and he can see, but he didn't see today good. 
 
Q. What did you like about Karol's game?
 
 GORAN IVANISEVIC: He is playing very simple, nice game. Same like his coach, Mecir,
same game, just he takes the ball very early; makes you run left and right; don't lose too
much energy. He doesn't have big shot, but just makes you run so much and makes you make
mistake. Then you have to try to hit here. I cannot always see the winners. Then I have to
make mistakes. And he was surprisingly serving good today. He served very good and I
thought he might make more doublefaults and more first serves mistakes, but very deep
first serves and I couldn't do too much. 
 
Q. Compared to other years, as far as yourself is concerned going into the US Open, how
do you feel?
 
 GORAN IVANISEVIC: I feel good. I made the final, which is nice, I played good tennis. I
have to feel good; just hope my shoulder is going to be fine because US Open is -- you
have to win three sets and if you lose one of two then you have to win -- it can be five
sets and it is not easy to play. But, my form is fine. I am feeling fine and we will see.
Maybe I take too serious these losses and I just have to -- just have to have fun. See
what happens. 
 
Q. Pat Rafter said the other day he considers you one of the outstanding dark horses
for the title. Where would you place yourself among the other competitors?
 
 GORAN IVANISEVIC: I don't think anybody is favorite. You cannot pick one guy who can
win the US Open. Sampras is playing not so good already all year. Rios is not playing
well. Rafter is in good form, but he has to defend the points and he is going to be very
tight and nervous. So, me, unpredictable. Nobody knows. Nobody knows. It is only -- I go
there and I can play, I can beat anybody. I can lose to some strange guys there, but it is
pretty interesting US Open this year. I cannot pick one guy who can -- that I can say is
going to reach second week easily. 
 
Q. Speaking of unpredictable, when you missed that shot in the third set when you were
down 3-2, does that happen a lot? 
 
 GORAN IVANISEVIC: This backhand miss-hit? 
 
Q. Right.
 
 GORAN IVANISEVIC: Yeah, it is like golf. I didn't know. I wanted to hit and I saw the
ball it is still there. (laughter). The guy said 30-Love so I said: Okay. I don't know --
sometimes I don't know what I am thinking. I wanted to hit the ball and everything was
fine, position was fine, but ball didn't go anywhere. Why? I don't know. It happens. 
 
Q. Your serve has been such a big weapon. You said you lost confidence in your second
serve today. Why?
 
 GORAN IVANISEVIC: Because I had pain in my shoulder in the beginning with the second
serve. When I hit the kick second serve, it is hurting me then I start to try something
else and my serve is not -- I have one motion and always doing the same, as soon as I
start to invent something new, it is finished - for I have less pain -- but after it was
no pain, but then I couldn't find my rhythm for that serve again. Doublefault twice he
broke -- third set, I made doublefault, I came 30-40 from Love-40 and doublefault, those
presents, I rather hit second serve long, doublefaulting in the net that is why -- second
serves in the net that means I am losing my rhythm and I hit a lot of those today. But
anyway, he played a good match. He deserved it probably. 
 
Q. Do you also amuse yourself at times on court and try hard to not to start laughing
with some of the things you do on court?
 
 GORAN IVANISEVIC: I have fun. I start to laugh because I feel like laughing. Better to
laugh than cry. 
 
Q. Have you ripped any shirts before?
 
 GORAN IVANISEVIC: I never. Geez, that was -- I didn't know why I did it. I just was
wide open and -- I didn't know what I was doing, -- 
 
Q. When you ripped your shirt on the changeover I saw a tatoo is that accrues I fix
with sharks and rowss. Can you talk about the tatoo on your right shoulder.
 
 GORAN IVANISEVIC: Yeah. Cross is cross and rose, I have a rose, which means love. And
shark is pretty mean, mean enemy, so altogether, it is me. (laughter). 
 
Q. You said you haven't gotten over Wimbledon yet, but you seem to be getting over this
pretty soon. Do you think the pain from this loss will go over fairly quickly?
 
 GORAN IVANISEVIC: I have two options, you know, to think again or start to laugh and I
mean, I didn't get over it. It is not going to be easy. But I have better things to do
next week and I have US Open coming, so if I just now think about Wimbledon and this, then
I am going to become crazy, so better laugh and have fun. Maybe it is going to help. I try
new strategy from now.
