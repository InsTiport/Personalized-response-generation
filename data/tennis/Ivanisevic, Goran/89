Q.  Goran, would that be the best you ever played  against him?  

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Yeah, I think so. I played  great at Wimbledon, but today I think I returned much  better than at Wimbledon.  And I mean, everything what  I hit basically went in.  


Q.  You seemed to keep your concentration up very  well despite losing your temper in that fourth game.  

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Yeah, but that was -- that  ball was not even close, you know.  That was deuce, and  that ball was 10 centimeters long.  That guy didn't  call it.  But then I lost my temper a little bit, but  then after that, I played better and better after that  point.  


Q.  Do you think that is a case for looking at  those replays on television and then changing your  opinion if it is wrong like that?  That ball was  clearly out.  Everybody could see that.  

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  I think that is one  possibility what they can do.  I think it takes time.  It is a good idea, but it would be too much, I think.  Because calling straight  away and then have a little TV on next to him, maybe,  because that ball was not even close, okay.  If it is a  close ball, but you don't know -- this ball was not  even close.  It was way out.  


Q.  It was a good example of a very bad call.  

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Pretty bad umpires.  There  was a lot of bad calls.  Also this machine -- they have  a machine on the service line which is -- I don't know  what for - just for show.  Because it was ten times the  ball was long and/or in, and they call it long.  It is  very bad calls with this machine.  I don't know why but  a lot of bad calls.  


Q.  Would you be in favor of having television  replays then?  

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Why not?  It is not a bad  idea.  


Q.  It is slightly ironic, Goran, that you are  playing some of your best tennis when you are actually  suspended in a way.  

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Yeah, you know, this is  not ATP, so it is okay with me.  It is good that Grand  Slam Cup allowed me to play this event, this is ITF,  and I can play.  ATP disqualified me for two months and  disqualify from Hopman Cup, I think, is stupid, but you  can't fight that, so I decide to play good here.  


Q.  How can they disqualify you from an event of  which is not part of that Tour?  

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Ask Mark Miles.  He is the  chief.  He can explain.  


Q.  What about your confidence, because after  Frankfurt you lost your confidence; here, you played so  well?  

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  I lost my confidence, but  I was working a little bit and I played very good  tennis.  That maybe one of the best tennis I played  this year.  I don't know how; why - strange, you know,  but I just played unbelievable tennis.  


Q.  Can you illuminate us a little bit as to your  conversation with the umpire when you got the code  violation?  

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  I told him how his mother  is doing and his father.  I said something bad, but I  didn't mean -- I was like in the run, you know, like  you are saying the things and then geez; then he give  you the warning.  I deserve it, okay, I said one bad  word which cost me, but that ball he should call out  because it was a clear mistake, but it is okay.
