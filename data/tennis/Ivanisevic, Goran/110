Q.  It looks like you enjoyed playing today.  Was it really so?  You looked very relaxed on the court, and was smiling. 
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Yeah, it was okay, but the court is I think too fast to enjoy to play here.  I mean, if you play Guy or somebody serving like me, you can't enjoy it.  You just have to wait to -- for the match to finish.  If you win, more happy than the other guy who goes.  So I think I didn't enjoy it a lot today.  
 

Q.  Yesterday, you mentioned that you want to win this tournament and buy some Christmas presents.  Can you specify what presents you would like to buy? 
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  If I win, it is going to be some pretty expensive presents.  I don't know which kinds of presents, but pretty expensive if I win.  
 

Q.  Nothing in particular? 
 
GORAN IVANISEVIC:  No, I don't know yet.
