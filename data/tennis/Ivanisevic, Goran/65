Q. Goran, didn't seem to have any steam on your service first two sets at all.

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  I didn't serve great, especially when I was up, 3-2, break, terrible, 5-4 again, 6-5, again the same thing, always I am losing these first two points; then it is tough to come back.  Then I try to force too much, tiebreak, same story.  No first serves, and it is tough, you know, he is getting everything back and then I have to run with him from the back and I didn't put a lot of forehands in everytime when I try for the big one, forehand I missed it and then I think he got a little bit -- he thought I am going to maybe give up, not give up, but go a little bit down and -- but I think I surprised him.  I hang in there.  I start to serve better; played tiebreaker better than him and then third set, I was playing better again; another mistake on 1-0, doublefault, first point, again easy game I lost, but then I think the key  point was 2-1, 15-30 when I hit ace with the second serve. Then I said, no, it is over now, it will be 6-1, 6-2, that was it.


Q. Is this match a couple years ago you would have had a lot more trouble surviving?

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Sure.  Maybe be 6-2, 6-3, second set.  I just have more fun to play this year.  It doesn't matter I lose or win.  I have more fun; especially when you are tired, you can't do anything, but now it was pretty hot, but I felt okay and I had fun.  I say okay, maybe it is going to turn something, you try to hang in there and you never know, so when I won the second set I knew I had a better chance than him.


Q. The balls were giving you trouble early in the week. You have a better feel for that as the matches have gone on?

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Balls are terrible.  Balls are very bad and they get so heavy, so big.


Q. Fluff up?

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Then I start to force too much my serve, and doesn't go anywhere, plus he is returning very well and it is even worse, I was just serving -- I didn't mix serve - one serve all the time and after I start to mix it and I serve much better.


Q. Is this the deepest you have gone in a tournament this year both singles and doubles?  Is that beginning to wear?

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  No, I won singles and doubles in  Milan indoor.


Q. Before you got your stiff neck you were the No. 1 player in the world.  Maybe not on the computer, but you were the No. 1 player in the world, my view anyway.  Are you coming close to regaining that sort of form?

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  It is getting better.  It is not -- still not the way I played Indian Wells, Key Biscayne, but it is getting better because after that I couldn't find my form. I just struggling and these tight matches, I am not able to win, so it is getting better.  I am starting to win these close matches and starting to play better and hopefully I can at the U.S. Open, I can imagine to play like that.


Q. Because that was what you really wanted to be, was it, just --

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  That was really unbelievable tennis that I play.  I mean, I was like so confident, so relaxed, like believed that no one can beat me at that time and it was really like that.  It was -- I was playing Pete in the semis, losing easy, but I still had fun in the locker room during the rain delay and it was really I was going to win; then I won.  Bad luck.  I didn't play Andre in the final, but hopefully he is -- I am going to get another chance.


Q. Do you feel playing doubles helps your singles game? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Sometimes, yes.  I think on indoor and hard court it helps you, but clay, just makes you more tired.  Here, I think you can hit a lot of volleys; you can hit a lot of practice returns which is -- which helps.


Q. How long after that neck thing were you ready to play?

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  I had to play Friday after Key Biscayne with my neck problem against Ukraine the Davis Cup because we had to win and all the pressure is on me and I was still in pain, but I had to play.  Nobody asked me if I have pain or not.  You have to because you are playing in Croatia so I was playing, but it was not good that I play, but I had to play.  It was a little worse.  Then I got sick and then I was not ready for the clay season and too many Spanish guys there (AUDIENCE LAUGHTER) Too much running too and I was not there, I was not ready even close to do anything and then I hoped Wimbledon came, I hope I can, but I was only good for the quarterfinals, not more.


Q. Do you think it is a little bit of advantage at least you are playing with these balls this week as opposed to going into the Open?

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  It is okay, balls are bad.  It doesn't matter.  I better not complain and try to put in my mind that the balls are great and perfect and I am going to play good with these balls.
