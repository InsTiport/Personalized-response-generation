Q. This was a very exciting match on the court here today.  The fourth match you lost against Karol Kucera.  Is this bad luck?  What do you think?

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  No, he's a good player, so I can lose anytime to him.  I had a lot of chances.  Today was a good match. In the end, he played unbelievable.  Some points was too good.  Especially when it was 6-All and he break me.  It was too good.  I didn't do anything wrong except double-fault. All others he played too good.


Q. You played many times here at Compaq Grand Slam Cup.  You played also here when it was very fast.  What's the difference for you in this year?

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  The court is much slower, but there's still altitude.  Is flying sometimes, you know.  You don't hit straight, ball is flying, you know, is going too far.  But it's okay.  The court was good.  I like this court.  I didn't serve so well in the beginning.  I was missing a lot of first serves.  It doesn't matter, court or not.  It was a good match, and he won.


Q. What do you think makes Karol so dangerous?  He doesn't look like a very spectacular player?

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  He doesn't, but he is.  He doesn't miss a lot.  He plays very deep, you know, gives you these dead balls.  You can't do too much.  You can just hit winners, but you can't hit winners all the time.  When you hit short, he comes in, you know.  He's very fast.  You know, he's very tough to play.  He hit, hit; he gets everything back.  He hit one shot and he's in.  It's not easy, you know.  He gets everything back.
