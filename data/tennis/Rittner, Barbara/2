THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. Can you guys speak a little bit about the draw, the order of play?
COACH RITTNER: Well, the draw it's always a big thing for the media.  Who's playing for us, it's actually not a big deal.  I mean, it's no huge surprises.  No. 1 and No. 2 of the United States are playing, and that's actually what we expected a little bit.
We like that Andrea starts, but even it she doesn't, it's not a big deal.
Q. Andrea, how do you feel about starting?
ANDREA PETKOVIC: Yeah, I like it.  I always prefer that because I like to be 100% there for my teammates, whoever plays after me in this case.  If I play second I can't really be there 100%.  I have to focus on my match.
So I always prefer to start in Fed Cup.  Not generally.  I am more a night person than a morning person, but here with the jet lag everything it's fine.  We wake up very early.
So I think that's how I prefer it as least.
Q. Julia, how do you feel about going second?
JULIA GOERGES: Well, we are kind of used to it because when we always played singles Andrea always started.  I think also in the last tie against U.S.
So I can't complain.  I mean, I don't mind if I start or play second.  In this case we had, yeah, some good memories of it, so can't be wrong.
Q. (No microphone.)
ANDREA PETKOVIC: Our team or the U.S. team?  Our strengths?
COACH RITTNER: Oh, our strength is always that we are a team.  I think that's the main important thing, what we are known for, and what the other teams feel.  I think I can feel it.  As well as we have really good players, like experienced and good players in our row.
