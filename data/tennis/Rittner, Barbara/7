Q. What was the difference between the Barbara Rittner we saw at La Costa last week and
the Barbara Rittner who played here today?

BARBARA RITTNER: It's a week later. I don't know. Actually I didn't play too bad last
week, but I played against Venus Williams. She played pretty good. On the important
points, I played bad. That was the big difference today. On the important points, if there
were a few, I really played well. Brenda struggled a little bit. Didn't have her best day,
obviously. She had weaknesses. I don't know. It's hard to compare one week with another.

Q. About a week now you played two women who were about 6'2". You're going to
start thinking every woman in the world is that tall.

BARBARA RITTNER: No. I'm not that small, so I can live with it.
