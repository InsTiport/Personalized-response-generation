THE MODERATOR:  Questions in English or Chinese, please. 


Q.  Steve, can you explain what the injury is, what the prognosis is, and what it was like trying to play on it. 

STEPHEN HUSS:  Structurally, the knee is solid, which is very good news.  The ligament and the miniscus and everything, the ACL, in there is solid, which is good news.  When I first did it, I thought it was completely gone.  I thought it would be probably six months.  So, you know, coming out of there, I guess it's good news.  I shouldn't be out for -- I mean, I'm not planning on playing for two weeks.  So, you know, after that I'm going to have to be careful, but I don't think it's going to be anything that keeps me out for more than a month.  After I did it, trying to play on it, initially when I first came back out it felt better than I thought it would feel, and that's what encouraged me to keep going a little bit.  And then after a couple more points, after we came off, you know, the change of ends, I could feel it starting, you know.  The pain started coming more.  I felt like I had no stability in the knee.  I knew it was pretty much over.  I was hoping the big fella could roll down a few big serves and we could hold serve there, and I don't know... But I knew it was over after a couple of points on that next game. 

Q.  It's the end of your partnership at least for the time being.  I guess you'd have settled for this at the start of the year? 

WESLEY MOODIE:  Yeah, I mean, it's been a great partnership.  I, unfortunately, am playing with someone else next year.  It's been great fun.  Hopefully, we can maybe team up again at some stage.  Yeah, I mean, well, we won a Grand Slam together, a couple other good results.  I certainly wouldn't have expected that in January when we played together for the first time then so...

Q.  Steve? 

STEPHEN HUSS:  Just echo Wes' thoughts.  In January if you had told me I was going to win Wimbledon this year, I would have laughed at you.  So, no, I mean, very disappointing today.  No fun getting injured.  But, you know, looking at the whole year and winning a Wimbledon title and having a lot of other good results and playing, you know, with a guy, you know, who's got Wes' character and personality has just been a lot of fun.  It's been sensational.  You know, I hope we can play again in the future.
