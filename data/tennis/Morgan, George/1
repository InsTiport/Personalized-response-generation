  4-6, 6-4, 7-5

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. I know it's doubles rather than singles, but best moment in your career or not? 
 GEORGE MORGAN: Definitely the best feeling in my career, playing on Court 1, winning a tight match against two really great players. Probably not my best moment, but my best feeling of winning a match. 

 Q. Does it help make up for the strange situation you had earlier in the week with all your racquets breaking? 
 GEORGE MORGAN: Definitely, yeah. I forgot about it. That helped me a lot.

 Q. Were either of you nervous today or not have any problems with that?
 GEORGE MORGAN: No, at the start I was a little bit nervous. It was a big court and there was a big crowd. 
 As soon as we got into the match, I was fine.

 Q. What did it feel like after the first set? 
 GEORGE MORGAN: We just said to each other, Keep positive; we know we can beat them. We did that and played well.

 Q. Where do you expect yourself to be in a year's time? 
 GEORGE MORGAN: I want to get my ATP ranking up quite a lot, play futures and challengers, yeah. 

 Q. Maybe be here through qualifying or wild card? 
 GEORGE MORGAN: Yeah, yeah, hopefully. I played qualifying this year as a wild card, but I'd like to play again. 

 Q. Your successes in Miami, are they still your greatest achievement? 
 GEORGE MORGAN: Orange Bowl is definitely my best achievement, yeah.

 Q. Have to get a wider mantelpiece to put your trophies on? 
 GEORGE MORGAN: I'd like to think so.

 Q. Anybody down here to support you? 
 GEORGE MORGAN: Yeah. My mom and dad, my brother, my brother's girlfriend, and some of my cousins there. Quite good.

 Q. Did they say anything to you after? 
 GEORGE MORGAN: Really pleased. All came up to me and said, Well done. 

 Q. Must be tough for Oliver. You know how that feels. 
 GEORGE MORGAN: Yeah, I was there last year. I lost in the final. Wasn't a good feeling. 
 But had a good tournament, and I feel bad for him. 

 Q. What's the basis of your partnership? Have you been friends for years? 
 GEORGE MORGAN: Well, we started together this year. At the start of the year, Australia, we won the tournament before the Australian Open. We got good confidence there. We're going to play together the rest of the year.

 Q. Celebrations? 
 GEORGE MORGAN: We're going to the Wimbledon ball later on, which should be good, yeah.
