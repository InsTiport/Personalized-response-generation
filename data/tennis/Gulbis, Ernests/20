E. GULBIS/F. Lopez
  7‑6, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You've had a lot of success in first‑round matches, 13 out of 14 this year now.   Happy with the way you're playing, very consistently?
ERNESTS GULBIS:   Can be always better.   First‑round matches are good, yeah.   I haven't been playing that well for the last month or two on the clay.   Could do better, still better in Wimbledon.   Didn't have a good match there against Verdasco. 

Q.   How did you find the court today?
ERNESTS GULBIS:   Good.   Just first tournament on hard court after a while.   Everybody is miss‑hitting the ball, a little bit struggling.   Also in the practice. 
Nothing new. 

Q.   How is the return to hard court?   Your clay season wasn't all too good.   How is the return to hard courts?   Is it better for you, or... 
ERNESTS GULBIS:   The return of serves or just the return? 

Q.   To the surface. 
ERNESTS GULBIS:   It's good.   You know, I took one week off.   I haven't been practicing much.   I was a little bit out of order when I started to practice one week ago.   I went to Hamptons just to slowly start to move again. 
I came here early.   I came here Thursday evening, started to play points, doing the boring stuff. 
It's okay, you know.   It really was important, today's match.   It gives you extra confidence.   When I started the match, you saw I made four double‑faults in one game, which normally I don't do. 
Just lack of confidence, lack of matches.   It's good.   You get one match going, then it's going to be much easier for sure the next round.

Q.   How do you like here, MontrÃ©al?
ERNESTS GULBIS:   I like the city. 

Q.   Any preferences for the next round?
ERNESTS GULBIS:   Not really.   I don't care.
