 E. GULBIS/A. Murray
  6‑4, 6‑3 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Where would this win rate in your career?  
ERNESTS GULBIS:   I don't like to rate these kinds of wins, honestly.   It's just a really good win, this particular moment right now.   Just enjoying it.   Who cares what I rate it?   
   
 Q.   That was one of the more calmer matches you've played in a while.   Is that because the crowd was flat or was that your intention to remain calm?  
ERNESTS GULBIS:   Flat crowd?   
   
 Q.   Energy‑wise.   
ERNESTS GULBIS:   I didn't feel it was flat.   I felt they were normally behaved crowd.   They didn't walk around during the points.   They didn't clap for stupid points.   I thought that they were very nice.   
I wasn't maybe calm.   I was intense inside.   You know, I just didn't want to show it to Andy because I played against top guys for a couple times already in my career.   With these guys, if you show some kind of weakness, they're going to penetrate it, you know.   
I just tried not to show any weakness, even in the second set when I got broken back.   I was 3‑1 up, then he played a really unbelievable point to break me.   If I would go crazy, as I like to do, then it would be tough second set.   
   
 Q.   What would you say was the biggest difference between this match and the other times you played Murray, other than the fact you won?  
ERNESTS GULBIS:   Honestly, I don't remember all the matches.   I looked on this monitor that I lost to him five times.   Honestly I just remember the last match we played in Cincinnati.   It was a really tough match.   But it was in 2010.   It was a really long time ago.   I haven't been playing him for a while.   
Those matches which were before, you know, I was a different person, he was a different player.   So when I, for example, play against Nadal, honestly I don't care that I lost to him I don't know how many times, six or seven times.   I don't care because every match is like a new thing, you know.   
I think that I'm now maturing as a player.   Let's delete all the past.   Let's start from zero from now on.   So I'm 1‑0 with Murray.   
   
 Q.   What is the difference between you now and your game at the beginning of the season?  
ERNESTS GULBIS:   Beginning of season?   I came here this tournament with very low expectations.   I had really big doubts in my game because still I arrive here Friday, I haven't played any points with nobody.   So basically Saturday was my first day when I start to play points, start to serve and return.   
I played first round against LÃ³pez.   I didn't really like the way I play.   So now with every day, it just gets better.   
But throughout beginning of the year, it's all about matches in tennis.   You can play as well as you want in the practice, but it's a matter of one, two matches, and it changes your year completely.   
I started well because I started in Marseille.   In Rotterdam I had good matches against Del Potro, Berdych.   I lost them, but I had a good contact with the strings of the ball, which I haven't had for all the last year.   So I was confident about it.   
Then I had a great run in Delray Beach.   Later on I lost to Rafa in Indian Wells.   Yeah, these are the matches that if you get over, they change the year drastically.   
Now I hope this match is going to change.   I got a lot of points.   I have a good chance next round.   So it's already quarterfinal and semifinal.   Big steps for me.   
   
 Q.   A lot of the players complain about the balls here in MontrÃ©al.   What do you think about that?  
ERNESTS GULBIS:   Let them complain.   I don't want to complain.   I love everything.   I love everybody.   I'm being positive.   I want the positiveness back (laughter).   
   
 Q.   You said you had lower expectations at the beginning.   Now what are your expectations for the rest of the tournament?  
ERNESTS GULBIS:   Now I have no expectations also because I already over‑fulfilled what I was plan to do.   I was planning to win one match.   
Now I take everything what comes to me.   I'm feeling better.   I'm feeling fitter, faster, more confident with my strokes.   So now if I lose, I lose.   If I win, great.   
I really did well this tournament.   I really did well in the start of this American tour.   So just good.   
   
 Q.   From experience, you've beaten top players before.   A win like this, you can capitalize on the confidence.   Is it something you tend to get a lot from, the confidence in a match like this?  
ERNESTS GULBIS:   You know, tennis, that's why it's a really difficult sport, because you have to compete every week.   Okay, you won a top guy.   Tomorrow I have to win another top guy.   If I lose tomorrow, then the bubble which you built for yourself, it can break anytime.   
So better keep your expectations low, enjoy the moment.   Be okay, be satisfied.   But you have to keep on going.   That's where young players make a lot of mistakes.   That's what I did also.   You have a good result, you build up a living basically for a couple days in your own dream world.   Suddenly it breaks, you're without confidence.   Now what?   There is no need for that.   
Day in, day out, it's like going to a office.   If you win, great.   If you did good work, you can reap the rewards, you know.   
   
 Q.   Would you rather be a seeded player at the US Open or a dangerous unseeded floater in the draw?  
ERNESTS GULBIS:   Seeded.   Seeded because I'm tired of playing the top guys in the first, second round.   I want to play them in the fourth round.
