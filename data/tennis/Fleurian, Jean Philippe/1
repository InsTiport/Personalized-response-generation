Q.  Did he step up a gear in the third set? 

JEAN-PHILIPPE FLEURIAN:  Yes.  I think he did.  In the second, I really did a good game to break him, and then he got a little down, you know.  I knew I had a good chance.  If he gets down, you know, if he's not up -- when he's ahead, he's very good.  When he's down and he's not in front, then I think I had a good chance.  So in the second set, I got ahead; then he broke back, but I was still okay, you know.  Then I broke again.  In the third set, I'm disappointed because I lose the first game.  I kind of lost it myself.  I did a bad mistake to lose the game.  Then he broke me; then it was very difficult for me because once he's ahead, he got confident, and then he started to really, really stab the returns.  Especially when I was hitting really flat serves, you know, he was really good returning, awfully well. 


Q.  This may be hard for you to judge because you don't play him a lot, but he seemed to be just a little off his game; not quite solid as he normally is? 

JEAN-PHILIPPE FLEURIAN:  Yes, I thought so.  But still he was much too strong for me.  He was hitting too fast for me.  Usually in the game he was in the court and I was back.  Then once he's in the court, inside the line, it's very difficult to play him because he just hit the ball very hard, flat, one side; then the other side.  For me, it was not very -- it was very difficult.  Yeah, it seemed to me that he missed a few easy shots, especially his backhand return on the high-bouncing kick serves.  He was not at his best.  He missed, yeah, a few balls, a few easy ones that he doesn't seem to miss usually when I watch him on TV. 


Q.  Can you talk a little bit about your Fort Lauderdale connections, where you live; who you train with; where you train? 

JEAN-PHILIPPE FLEURIAN:  Yes.  When I was younger, when I was 15 or 16 years old, I was not a good junior in France.  I was a very bad junior, so I couldn't get in any of the French Federation facilities, so I had to -- if I wanted to make it, I had to come to the States because in the States you prove yourself on the court and you don't need a ranking to prove yourself.  In France, you need a ranking to prove yourself.  I decided to come here with my parents.  I started to practice a lot.  I came to Florida because in the winter, in the French winter, it's very difficult to practice in France, but in the States, and in Florida especially, it's very easy.  It's warm and it's great weather.  There are a lot of tournaments.  I came here every winter since I'm 15 or 16 years old.  I was living -- I found this tennis club when I played a tournament once.  I found that place, and I thought it was a great place because of the people who live there are tennis fanatics; they're just crazy about tennis.  It's a great atmosphere, tennis atmosphere, only a tennis atmosphere.  Like a club in France, there are a lot of clubs in France that are like that, but in the States I never found quite that atmosphere.  I loved that place and I came there again every year, year and year.  I know all the people who live there.  They all know me since I'm 15 or 16.  That's why I have a lot of support every time I play Key Biscayne. 


Q.  Is it Fort Lauderdale -- 

JEAN-PHILIPPE FLEURIAN:  Between Sunrise Park. 


Q.  West? 

JEAN-PHILIPPE FLEURIAN:  East of 95. 


Q.  How long have you been there now? 

JEAN-PHILIPPE FLEURIAN:  I bought a place four years ago, but I've been coming there for the last 15 years. 


Q.  How many people do you think are here today from the Fort Lauderdale Tennis Club? 

JEAN-PHILIPPE FLEURIAN:  Half of center court. 


Q.  How about Frank Frohling, is he there?  He's a member there. 

JEAN-PHILIPPE FLEURIAN:  You're tricking me. 


Q.  Six foot six.  Do you have a coach now? 

JEAN-PHILIPPE FLEURIAN:  But he's not here. 


Q.  Who is that? 

JEAN-PHILIPPE FLEURIAN:  And my wife is half coaching me also. 


Q.  Your wife? 

JEAN-PHILIPPE FLEURIAN:  Yes, my wife. 


Q.  Who is your coach? 

JEAN-PHILIPPE FLEURIAN:  That's why I'm not playing too well.  (AUDIENCE LAUGHTER). 


Q.  What was her advice on this match? 

JEAN-PHILIPPE FLEURIAN:  Her advice? 


Q.  Yes. 

JEAN-PHILIPPE FLEURIAN:  Just try to win. 


Q.  Good game plan.  Do you maintain a residence in France still? 

JEAN-PHILIPPE FLEURIAN:  No.  I'm a resident in Fort Lauderdale. 


Q.  Have you become very Floridian also?  Do you do a lot of skin diving, for example, scuba diving? 

JEAN-PHILIPPE FLEURIAN:  I don't have enough time actually.  I'm on the road.  I wish I had more time. As I'm almost 31 years old, I think in the next few months I might have a lot of time. 


Q.  If and when you retire from the Tour, do you think you'll stay in Florida or go back to France? 

JEAN-PHILIPPE FLEURIAN:  I will stay in Florida in the winter.  I'm coming from the French islands so I love the sun, the coconut trees, the beach.  I used to love the girls.  That's why I love Florida so much.  It's warm.  The beach.  The sea.  I think when I retire, I will either come back to Florida, to stay in Florida, or go back to one of the French islands, like New Caledonia, French Paradise. 


Q.  Were you inspired by playing on the stadium court? 

JEAN-PHILIPPE FLEURIAN:  When you play Andre Agassi on stadium court in front of the TV, first you think, "My God, I hope he's not going to blow me off the court."  But then once you're on the court and you've won one games or two games, you start to get into it and you start to enjoy it, yes.  Yes, I enjoyed it today.  I was really happy to go three sets against him, run around.  I'm disappointed that I didn't do better, but it was a good game.  I did a few shots that were okay, you know. 


Q.  Was there ever a point where you thought you could win this? 

JEAN-PHILIPPE FLEURIAN:  You know, I don't think about winning, losing.  I don't think about that on the court.  I just think about playing every ball my best, you know.  That's all I'm thinking about.  Winning, losing, it's at the end that you win.  When you win the last ball, that means that you have won.  If you lose the last ball, then you have lost.  I just try to win every next point.  That's all I'm looking for.  Like when I play, I don't look at the draw.  I always look at my next opponent, that's all.  When I beat Gaudenzi, I didn't know I was playing against Andre. If I won today, I don't even know who I'm playing next, doesn't matter. 


Q.  Do you know where you play next? 

JEAN-PHILIPPE FLEURIAN:  Playing, yes.  I'm playing this weekend in France.  No, actually, I'm playing doubles tonight. 


Q.  Your next tournament? 

JEAN-PHILIPPE FLEURIAN:  Next tournament will be in New Delhi in India.  I'm very happy because I'm not going with my wife this time.  She doesn't want to come with me over there, so I'll be there alone with my computer.  I'll be able to type a little, you know. 


Q.  It will make you happy? 

JEAN-PHILIPPE FLEURIAN:  Really happy, yes.  Not to listen to her, you know.  (audience laughter). 


Q.  Are you going to be married tomorrow? 

JEAN-PHILIPPE FLEURIAN:  I'm kidding.  She's not laughing.  All the guys are laughing. 


Q.  What do you write on your computer? 

JEAN-PHILIPPE FLEURIAN:  Oh, I'm learning.  I love it.  I do -- I don't know.  Right now I am connecting on the Internet.  I just love to -- I'm faxing every night to my relatives in France, the islands.  I just love it.
