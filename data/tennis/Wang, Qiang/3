I. SWIATEK/Q. Wang
6-3, 6-0
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. Pretty tough game today for you, yeah?  How will you summarize this one?
QIANG WANG: She played really well.  She play really aggressive.  And, yes, I play a little bit passive, and she can attack my ball.  So it's easy for her, I think.
Q. Her game was a surprise for you or you thought that she could play so good?  So aggressive?
QIANG WANG: My coach told me she play really aggressive.  And her ball is so fast and she can play drop shot also.  So, yeah, she played really well.
Q. During the match you looked pretty upset.  You were upset on you or on the play of Iga?
QIANG WANG: On me, of course.  I don't know what I have to do on court, so I'm really upset on me, yeah.
Q. I wanted to ask about today's performance because you had some chances, of course, but do you think that it was Iga played too powerful today or was there key moments that decided that you unfortunately lost?
QIANG WANG: I don't think I have a chance with her.  She played really aggressive.
Q. In the first set, don't you think that there was some chances?
QIANG WANG: A chance is her mistake, not I win the point.
Q. For example, in Poland she's a big prospect.  So do you think that you could make top 10, for example?
QIANG WANG: Yeah, if she play like that, she can be top 10.
