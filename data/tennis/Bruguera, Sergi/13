Q. Sergi, generally you you've been regarded as a claycourt specialist. US Open
obviously being hardcourt, does that bother you at all, any of that, coming into an event
like this?

SERGI BRUGUERA: If I'm bothered, what?

Q. Generally, the public and media have regarded you as a claycourt player only. That's
where you generally fare well. Here you've come in and played pretty well. Does that at
all bother you that people look at you as just a claycourt player?

SERGI BRUGUERA: I don't know. I don't mind. As long as the people, they see specialist
on hardcourt and I have a thousand more points because I did much better things on
hardcourt than the big specialist, I like to be a claycourt player.

Q. Do you feel you're a better hardcourt player now than you were three, four years
ago?

SERGI BRUGUERA: Yeah. I think people improve. If you want your focus to improve, that's
what I'm trying to do. I think every time I'm playing better. Now I think I'm playing
pretty comfortable on the court, hardcourt.

Q. How do you like playing in the stadium, the atmosphere in New York?

SERGI BRUGUERA: Well, I prefer the public in Europe. A little bit quiet; they are
watching the match. Sometimes, maybe if it's a close match, they are very into it. It is
difficult to concentrate, all the people are moving, talking. I think it's not the place
of concentration to play tennis match. That's the way it is here, so you have to play with
this.
