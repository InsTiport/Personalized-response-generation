Q.  I would just like your general impressions of  the tournament and how you feel about the way you  played, whether it was a good experience or not?  

SERGI BRUGUERA:  Well, I think, of course, good experience to  be in the Masters.  I play the best place in the world  one tournament with 8, I think for me it is difficult,  this surface, but every time I was playing and playing  with these people, every time I was playing better and  better.  Finally when I was playing very good, I have  to go.  


Q.  Today, crazy match, back and forth?  

SERGI BRUGUERA:  Well, I don't know.  I think it was all the  time very tight, and I played not very good game.  He  broke me, and then I start to play very well in the  match better, and I think I suppress him a little bit;  then I won the second and the third, I have 15-30, he  play three aces and maybe could change that one.  Then  he played good game and the last game I have 15-40, I  think I played well.  


Q.  He is usually pretty like that - stone face -  on the court; he was having a lot of fun today,  pointing at you and smiling at you; did that seem  unusual to you that he was so open with his emotions on  the court?  

SERGI BRUGUERA:  I don't know.  I didn't --  


Q.  Couple of times when you had long rallies he  would look over to you and point and smile; did you see  that?  

SERGI BRUGUERA:  No.  


Q.  Thank you.
