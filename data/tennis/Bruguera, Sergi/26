Q.  What was the difference today?  He had won most of your matches in the past.  What was different today?

SERGI BRUGUERA:  Well, I think every match is different.  Doesn't matter if he wins five or six times.  I think every match you have a chance to win.  I went out there playing very relaxed.  I think I served very well, especially in important moments.  He had a lot of breakpoints and didn't break me only one time.  I think I play very good.  He couldn't attack me. I think I play very well.


Q.  Michael is so mentally tough.  Was there ever a  time in the match that you knew you had it or were you still playing till the last point?

SERGI BRUGUERA:  When I was 6-3, 5-2 and 15-40, I thought with 5-2, serving with the new balls, with the wind at my back, it will be done.  4-3, then you have to serve, still the match is one break only.  But then it was very close.


Q.  Did Michael appear less intense to you than in previous matches, not as focused into the match?

SERGI BRUGUERA:  I think I was more focused maybe. I was not watching Michael playing; I was watching my game only.


Q.  A good win certainly helps one's confidence.  What are you taking away from this match, coming into the next coming matches?

SERGI BRUGUERA:  Well, I'm going to leave this victory back, just try to concentrate on my next game.  I mean, every match is difficult, especially here, with the conditions, it's always difficult to play, a lot of distractions, a lot of wind.  It's difficult.  You have to be very, very concentrate every match.  That's why there's so many surprises always here.
