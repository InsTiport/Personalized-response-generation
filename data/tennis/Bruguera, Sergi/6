Q.  Sergi, what was the problem in the first set when the trainer came twice?

SERGI BRUGUERA:  Pain with my ribs.  The first match with Chang.  Yesterday was much painful.  Today also when I played the first game, 30-15, I tried to make one forehand cross-court; I felt like the muscle is going to pull a little bit.  Then I start to play all the time with a lot of pain.  When I was serving, I couldn't hit my forehand, only my backhand.  Then I was trying to play, see if it would get warm or ever feel a little bit better.  But it was the same all the time.  Then I was thinking about retire or not.  I was keep playing.  Finally I said, "We are almost done, so I finish."
  

Q.  It's the first time that happen to you, this kind of injury?

SERGI BRUGUERA:  Yeah, first time. 
  

Q.  And what about the third match?  Do you think you are going to play the third match, or do you think it's too early to say?

SERGI BRUGUERA:  Well, I don't think I'm going to play because I have so much pain, I cannot play.  First of all, I'm going to see the doctor, what is happen, go to the hospital to see.  Then I will decide to play.
  

Q.  You are going to hospital tonight?

SERGI BRUGUERA:  Yeah.
