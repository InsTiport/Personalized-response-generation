Q.  Have you lost interest in tennis? 
 
SERGI BRUGUERA:  No, but I mean, I am not playing very good and my mind is not the same as it used to be.  I lose motivation a little bit and sense of fight, but I want to recover this.  I expect to recover.

Q.  Do you think about retiring at all?
 
SERGI BRUGUERA:  Well, I am 27, no.  26 in a year -- in '96 I was about the same and next year I reached the final in the French and I was -- I finished 8th of the year.
