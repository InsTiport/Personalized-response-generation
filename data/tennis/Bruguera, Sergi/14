Q. Sergi, some general comments about your match?

SERGI BRUGUERA: Well, I think it was, at the beginning, a little bit surprising, no? He
was attacking every single ball and it was kind of difficult to start a match like this. I
have a break, and at 4-All I play a good game. After that, the thing was going much better
for me. I start to play really well. It was two sets to love. Then the third set, his
service game he play pretty well. I couldn't break him the rest of the time.

Q. In your first two service games, you were down 15-30, managed to come back. Did it
surprise you he was coming to the net that often?

SERGI BRUGUERA: Well, it was a little bit surprising. It was coming in, but coming for
a winner every time. It was a little bit strange. I think it's difficult to play like this
all the match. It's really difficult to try to play well all the entire match.
