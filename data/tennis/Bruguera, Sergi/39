It was 2-All and then I sit, was like a little  bit depressed because it start again to be very  painful.  Then I start to play -- because I couldn't  run anymore for my forehand and he start to play like  winners to finish.

Q.  That means do you have to stop playing tennis  for a few days or what?  

SERGI BRUGUERA: I don't know.  I think I  cannot play with this so I have to stop.  


Q.  Do you think it is because you made too much  effort on the other leg because the other one was weak?  

SERGI BRUGUERA: That is what they say.  They  said that I am working too much with this one and you  are afraid from the other one, and they said there is  normal things happen when you are recovering from one  injury, big injury, then you force too much the other  leg.
