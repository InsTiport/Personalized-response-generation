Q.  How different is it when you play him on clay and here?

SERGI BRUGUERA:  I think I have more weapons when I playing on clay here THAN hardcourt.  For hardcourt he play flat.  He can play also a lot of winners.  He served very good.


Q.  Were you surprised by this?

SERGI BRUGUERA:  By what?


Q.  How he improve.

SERGI BRUGUERA:  No.  I play him two years ago.  He was also playing very well.  He's No. 2 in the world.  I think he can play on any surface.  Of course, he's always going to be better on clay, like everybody who grows up on the court.  Sampras is -- his best surface, this one.  He can also play here.


Q.  Does he has a chance against Agassi or Sampras?

SERGI BRUGUERA:  I don't know.  I think maybe best of five.  Maybe with his physical condition, it can help  him.


Q.  Do you approach hardcourt tournaments any differently than claycourt tournaments?

SERGI BRUGUERA:  Well, I think I approach the claycourts thinking I'm better player than the other one. In hardcourt, doesn't happen this.  I don't know how I'm going to play.  I don't have the same confidence in myself when I'm playing on hardcourt.
