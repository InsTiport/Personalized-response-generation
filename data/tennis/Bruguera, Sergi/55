Q.  Sergi, you had two chances to win the second  set at 5-4, and then in the tiebreaker.  What happened?  

SERGI BRUGUERA:  Well, I think I have not enough good serve to  have free points at the important moment, and then I  have to play all the time at 5-4, Goran play three  very, very good winners, and that change the match.  After the tiebreak, I played well.  Sometimes  when he was attacking he was playing very hard for two  points, and that was the key.  When he try for the  winner he made it at the important moment.  


Q.  Did you realize that he was not feeling well?  

SERGI BRUGUERA:  No.  That he was not feeling well on his  serve?  


Q.  He made only four aces today.  

SERGI BRUGUERA:  Yeah.  Because I return very well.  


Q.  Could you compare your first match here in in  Frankfurt and the second one?  I mean, your level of  the game.  

SERGI BRUGUERA:  Well, I think it is difficult to talk about  the game because it is difficult to play here with  Ivanisevic.  Just serving and trying to return and from  baseline, you have to try and don't give easy ball for  his winner and it is difficult to say something about  tennis when you are playing on this surface.  


Q.  Thank you.
