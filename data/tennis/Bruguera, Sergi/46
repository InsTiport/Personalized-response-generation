Q.  Is it a big surprise for you to have beaten  him on a fast court?  

SERGI BRUGUERA:  Big surprise for me?  


Q.  Yeah.  

SERGI BRUGUERA:  No, I don't think it is a  big surprise.  I think I have been playing very well  the last few months and well, I am very happy about the  way I played today and that is the only thing that I am  very happy; it is not big surprise.  


Q.  What do you think made the difference because  there was only a couple of points in each set?  

SERGI BRUGUERA:  Well, I don't know.  I think  I served always well when it was the important  moments.  He had a lot of chances in the first set  like, I think 4-3 and Love-40 and 5-4 set point.  And  then I start to play very well the tiebreak.  I played  really good points and I win the tiebreak.  And the  second set after I get broke, I start to play much  aggressive and much better every time.  


Q.  Do you think there is not enough people  suggesting that you could win this tournament?  

SERGI BRUGUERA:  I don't know.  How many  people you suggest?  


Q.  People are talking about Becker, Agassi and  Sampras.  

SERGI BRUGUERA:  Well, I think these are the  better players in these courts, so it is normal.  I  would bet for Becker and Agassi too.  


Q.  Would you say that you played better here  today than in Paris?  

SERGI BRUGUERA:  I think probably I played a  little more aggressive because with Chang I think I  have to do like this and I think I played very well  there also, but this always sometimes depends on the  player you play or the way you feel the court  sometimes, so that you can risk more or it is better to  wait and to play, you know, that let him attack; then  you make passing shots or control a little bit more the  match.  I don't know.  It is a different matches I  play.
