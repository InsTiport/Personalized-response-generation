THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.  
 
 
Q.  How are you feeling now? 
 
MICHAELLA KRAJICEK:  A little better.  I'm feeling pretty tired, though.  I'm still pretty warm.  But it's much better than I felt on the court, so...  
 
Q.  That was pretty bad, was it?
 
MICHAELLA KRAJICEK:  Yeah, well, from the -- the first few games were okay, Amélie was playing good, so I was a little bit struggling with the first four games.  Then I started to play really well.  But each game and each point I was playing more, I was getting really tired.  And because of the heat, of course.  I'm one of the youngest players here, so I still have to get used to everything.  And I think, yeah, that was very tough to play today.  
 
Q.  How did you actually feel?  Dizzy?  Sick?  All of those?
 
MICHAELLA KRAJICEK:  Well, all the heat illness, I think.  Really, I wasn't feeling my stomach.  I felt like I was going to throw up.  Yeah, I just couldn't even see the ball because my eyes were burning very much.  Yeah, kind of everything.  So it wasn't that good.  
 
Q.  Did it scare you, how you felt? 
 
MICHAELLA KRAJICEK:  Well, I felt once already like this.  It was in Rosmalen two years ago.  Yeah, of course, that's why I think I quit, because I couldn't play any more in Rosmalen.  I fell down.  Then after I was one hour like from the world I would say.  This time I was like, no.  It was a great experience for me, even though played a first set, but I just couldn't continue, so...  
 
Q.  Has this happened to you before?
 
MICHAELLA KRAJICEK:  Yeah, once before in Rosmalen, a tournament in Holland. 
 
Q.  A similar situation with heat?
 
MICHAELLA KRAJICEK:  Yeah, well, there I had pretty much cramping.  Here I wasn't just feeling well at all.  Everything was bad.  And there, the most of there was my stomach.  But now was even worse, I think, so...  
 
Q.  What sort of treatment did you have once you came off court?
 
MICHAELLA KRAJICEK:  Well, I had to cool off a little bit.  I had ice all over my body.  Just relax.  You know, I was lying for one hour.  Now I'm feeling a little bit better.  I had like a little bread with nothing on it so to have something in my stomach that I won't feel that bad.  Yeah, I have to drink a lot, of course.  
 
Q.  Did you drink much before the match?
 
MICHAELLA KRAJICEK:  Yeah, I was trying to, not to get dehydrated.  Maybe I drank too much.  Of course, I was scared because I had this experience already, just not to get dehydrated or anything.  I drank maybe a little bit too much.  But, of course, yeah, hopefully I did the best I could so to avoid this.  Well, it wasn't my day.  
 
Q.  Can I ask you, were they plasters on your shoulder, Band-Aids? 
 
MICHAELLA KRAJICEK:  Well, it's just preventing because I was having a little bit trouble the last few days with my shoulder from serving.  It's nothing serious.  It was just because I was a little bit stiff because I played a lot of matches.  But it's nothing serious.  
 
Q.  Did you think that perhaps they should have started the match today with the roof closed?
 
MICHAELLA KRAJICEK:  Well, the rule is not really like this.  It wasn't that hot when we started yet.  So that was too bad.  I was hoping for it, of course, because now it's much better when the roof is closed.  All the players are pretty cool on the court.  Yeah, of course I was hoping for it.  But, yeah, next time maybe, so...  
 
Q.  Was it dangerous for you to play out there? 
 
MICHAELLA KRAJICEK:  Well, yeah, you saw the result.  I was feeling really bad when I got off the court.  Yeah, for me, of course.  Like I said, I have to get used to everything because I'm still the youngest one here or one of the youngest.  Yeah, it's kind of tough.  I have to get -- to learn all the things, and how to handle those things.  I think, yeah, it wasn't just the weather that I would like to have.  But, yeah, well, my opponent's got the same, you know.  I can't say it's just on one side, the sun.  But, yeah, like I said, I couldn't handle it too good today.  
 
Q.  Did Richard warn you about what it might be like out here?
 
MICHAELLA KRAJICEK:  Yeah, well, of course, he said it's going to be warm and everything.  Well, I was trying, you know, to keep cool and take my time.  But, yeah, wasn't working.  
 
Q.  Did Amélie come to see you afterwards?
 
MICHAELLA KRAJICEK:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, she come to see me, to check on me.  It was very nice of her.  
 
Q.  How emotional was it after for you?  Were there tears or anything like that?
 
MICHAELLA KRAJICEK:  Well, the tears were more from the pain that I had on my stomach and my head and everything.  Of course, I don't like to give up matches, that's for sure.  I never give up.  This was just because I couldn't play any more.  I wouldn't hit a ball in the court.  I was already very struggling the last game with my serve.  I couldn't concentrate.  The sun was shining too much for me.  Yeah, I wasn't just feeling good.  
 
Q.  Did the doctor take your temperature at all when you came off the court?
 
MICHAELLA KRAJICEK:  Yeah.  I had 38.5 degrees, so it was quite high.  Well, after an hour, it was already much better.  It was like 37 something.  Yeah, well, on the court I was just too hot, you know, I couldn't play.  
 
Q.  Apart from today, you must be pretty pleased with the summer. 
 
MICHAELLA KRAJICEK:  Yeah, I'm very pleased with the beginning of the year.  It's, of course, very disappointing to end the Australian Open like this.  But I'm very happy how I played in Perth and how I played in Hobart.  It's a very good start of the year.  Hopefully I will recover fast and have some great tournaments after this.  
 
Q.  What sort of goals have you set for 2006?
 
MICHAELLA KRAJICEK:  Well, my goals were to reach the top 50, which I already have reached.  So that's awesome.  Hopefully I can continue to get my rankings higher and maybe to make some good results, like maybe winning some other tournaments.  Will be nice.  
 
Q.  What's your best surface?
 
MICHAELLA KRAJICEK:  Well, I think hard court is the best.  Looking forward to that.  But, of course, I like to play on clay, too, even though it's not really my surface.  
 
Q.  Will you play in Paris, Gaz de France?
 
MICHAELLA KRAJICEK:  Yes, I will.  
 
Q.  When is your next doubles match?  Are you going to tackle that on an outside court?
 
MICHAELLA KRAJICEK:  I have already asked for a later start maybe, just like when it's a little bit cooler, not like today.  Between 12 and 3, there is the most sun, it's the warmest.  Yeah, well, hopefully they will give me a later start, I would say, like the fourth round or something.  We will see.  Yeah, of course, in a doubles, you're there with your partner, so hopefully Agnes can cheer me up a little bit.  Hopefully we'll have some fun and I will feel better for tomorrow because now I'm still not feeling so well. 
 
Q.  Would you be prepared to play in this kind of heat again if you have to?
 
MICHAELLA KRAJICEK:  Well, it depends, you know.  If I feel bad, I'm not going to play for sure.  I still don't feel very well.  My stomach is still a little bit like up, like bloat.  We will see, of course.  I always want to play, you know.  Like I said, I never want to give up.  If I'm not feeling well at all, then I'm not going to play.  
 
Q.  How about if you came back here next year, you had more experience, and the temperatures were hot again, would you be apprehensive going out on court?
 
MICHAELLA KRAJICEK:  I think in the next year I will try to work a lot on my physics, you know, to get, of course, everything under control, I would say, because my tennis is really good.  I still have to work on my physical part because that's the most important for me because I'm still growing and everything.  I started just last year with doing some - how would I say - with putting some weights and everything like that.  So hopefully for next year I will be more fit.  Yeah, we will see.  Of course, I will try to handle it next year better than this year.  
 
Q.  When you said you had ice all over, did you actually take an ice bath?
 
MICHAELLA KRAJICEK:  Yeah, something like that, yeah.
