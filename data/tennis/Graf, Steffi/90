Q. Steffi, was this pretty much a typical early round match for you, I mean, 54 minutes; that is hardly breaking a sweat?

STEFFI GRAF:  I was humid, so I did sweat some.  Well, the first-- in the first set it was more difficult, I think, than the second.  I started maybe a little bit slower, but it wasn't that much of an easy match in the beginning.  She served well and I just, in the second set, I played a lot better.


Q. How would you rate your opponent today?

STEFFI GRAF:  She had a good serve.  She didn't hold up to it, but she was mixing it up.  She wasn't really solid from the back.  But I was impressed by her serve.


Q. Thank you.
