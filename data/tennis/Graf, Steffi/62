 Q.  You seemed a little bit more emotional on court than usual;
is that correct?

 STEFFI GRAF:  Well, I mean, it's the semifinals; you want to
get into the finals, so I guess you are a little bit more emotional,
I think, was the situation the way the game was going probably
that is why I was emotional.

 Q.  Andre Medvedev complained that the crowd was particularly
noisy.

 STEFFI GRAF:  Yeah, but that was probably because there was a
decision made on the court and the crowd just didn't agree with
it.  That is probably why the crowd really got involved and so
it was quite noisy.

 Q.  Steffi, what about the final now for the fourth time,
comments, thoughts?

 STEFFI GRAF:  Comment, thoughts.  Obviously, I am excited to
be able to play the finals and maybe a little bit of the surprise
playing against Kimiko and -- but I think it should be an interesting
match.

 Q.  A little bit of a "surprise," did you say?

 STEFFI GRAF:  Yeah.

 Q.  Why?

 STEFFI GRAF:  Well, I thought that Gaby was playing pretty well
right now and knowing that Kimiko had problems with her shoulder,
I figured that she had a very good chance of winning.

 Q.  How do you foresee your final match with her shoulder
hurting?

 STEFFI GRAF:  I just take it, you know, I mean, her shoulder
obviously is a problem, but she won today and she played three
long sets, so it can't be that bad.  So you just have to see it
as, you know, taking one point after the other and not really
think about anything, just concentrate on the match.
