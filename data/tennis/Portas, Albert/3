ATP: Questions, please.


Q.  How do you feel for tomorrow for the semifinal? 

ALBERT PORTAS:  I feel very good today and tomorrow I try to do my best again.  I think that I am playing very good and particularly today.  And tomorrow was a tough match as well, doesn't matter who is the winner, and I just do my game again, so, I am very happy to win.
