R. NADAL/P. Gojowczyk
  4‑6, 6‑2, 6‑3

Q.   You must be happy even though you lost today. 
PETER GOJOWCZYK:   Yeah, I'm very happy, because I won in the first three games, it was 3‑0 up, and I lost maybe one point.   Rafa was like, Oh, what's going on, I think. 
I make a good job in the first set.   And I was a little bit tired then in the second and the third set, and Rafa was playing well in the second and third, so it was tough for me, yeah. 

Q.   You came through quallies and played some good matches and pushed Rafa Nadal.   Best week of your career?
PETER GOJOWCZYK:   Yeah, it was my best week of this career. 
I hope I can learn from it and I get a confidence and keep going the next weeks.   I have to fly this night to Melbourne direct.   I have to play quallies there on Wednesday, so it's close but it's tough.   But I give my best there, and I hope to see you again.
