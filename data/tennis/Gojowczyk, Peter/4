An interview with:

PETER GOJOWCZYK

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Congratulations.   How are you and who are you?   Tell us a little bit about yourself. 
PETER GOJOWCZYK:   Yeah.   Hello, everybody.   My name is Peter.   I'm from Germany, from Munich.   Yeah, it's great, you know, in the first year, starting this year, this season, and it's not normal for me if I play semifinals here in Doha on the ATP 250. 
I don't know.   What can I say?   I can't realize this right now.   I'm happy because I play against Dustin who is also a good friend of mine. 

Q.   When he saved that match point at 5‑3, I think, in the final set, what kind of feeling did you have?   Because he saved all the match points the previous day.   Did you think he was going to win again?
PETER GOJOWCZYK:   First of all, I was so nervous in the beginning, too.   I went all the time to the toilet, and I was really nervous.   The 5‑4 ‑‑or 5‑3, on the serve, on the match point, I want to say only put the ball in.   Anyhow, I put the ball in, but maybe I was too tight then.   Yeah. 

Q.   What did you tell yourself to do for the rest of the match?   Just play point by point? 
PETER GOJOWCZYK:   Yeah, it's always like this.   And then you have to play point by point and keep going, do your stuff and follow your game plan.   Yeah. 

Q.   You may play against Nadal maybe. 
PETER GOJOWCZYK:   Maybe.

Q.   Will you be more nervous?
PETER GOJOWCZYK:   Probably no, but if I play against Rafa, he's No. 1, yeah, No. 1 in the world and he's a great guy.   I met him now in the locker room, and he say, Congrats, Peter. 
It's nice, you know.   Now I think he know me now, and it's great (smiling). 

Q.   That was the first time you talked to him?
PETER GOJOWCZYK:   I really ‑‑I don't know.   Maybe my second, because I think I take signature of him in NewYork in US Open.   I met him also in the locker room, and I say, Can I get a signature?   

Q.   When is that?
PETER GOJOWCZYK:   Last year was it.   I played second round there.

Q.   I presume you mostly have been playing challengers? 
PETER GOJOWCZYK:   That's true.

Q.   What keeps you going, hoping for the path, an ATP event like this?
PETER GOJOWCZYK:   The most of the time I was on challenger tour, and you have to mix it, mix it up to play the ATP and maybe you have a good feeling, and then it's like this and I'm very happy.   Yeah.   That's it. 

Q.   It's the best you have done on the ATP World Tour.   Why now do you think that you have done this?
PETER GOJOWCZYK:   Why?   Maybe I do good preseason in Munich with my coach, and I was mentally good I think on this tournament because I'm not defending some points in the beginning of the year and trying to ‑‑or you have to have more matches from outside, yeah. 

Q.   The German players have done really well here.   Why has that happened?
PETER GOJOWCZYK:   This year, yeah.   It's really good for us.

Q.   Do you know why that's happened?
PETER GOJOWCZYK:   Maybe the condition is also good for us, no?   And it's not too far.   It's like two hours' time difference.   Maybe this.   I don't know.   It's really good for us, yeah. 

Q.   Can you just tell us a little bit about how you started playing tennis and, you know, what you were like as a kid and all that stuff we don't know. 
PETER GOJOWCZYK:   I was playing tennis for four years.   I played with my parents, my father, a lot of time.   I take my first lesson was six years, and I play also soccer, so both, until 16. 
Then I have to choose what I have to do with, if I play soccer or tennis, because my father was a good soccer player, too.   And he say, Okay, let's go to play tennis. 
Yeah.   Now I'm here, I think (smiling). 

Q.   Can Nadal be beaten? 
PETER GOJOWCZYK:   For sure, yeah.   He's also a guy, yeah?   (Smiling).   I think to try to enjoy the match tomorrow.
