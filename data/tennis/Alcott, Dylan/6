D. ALCOTT/A. Lapthorne   
6-0, 6-4   
DYLAN ALCOTT: Hey, everyone. Everyone is a bit quiet. How are you?   
THE MODERATOR: First question.   
 Q.  We've been here before, but how does this one feel?  
DYLAN ALCOTT: Mate, it feels awesome. I really stuffed up the US Open. I was pretty devastated, like gutted, hated myself, hated tennis a bit.   
I really worked hard on myself since then. New mindset coach, new strength trainer, just really working on everything. Obviously being a Paralympic year and things.   
That was the best I played. The first set, best tennis I ever played. Big match on TV, big crowd. I was really happy with how I played.   
Also proud of how Lapo played. That was a great match, I thought. It was the best finals we've had here and I really enjoyed it.   
 Q.  At the net, you were prowling that net like a tiger and nothing was getting past you. Andy had to work hard to get those lobs over you.  
DYLAN ALCOTT: Yeah, I'm really quite fast. I like playing on a big court because if I get a lob normally I can get out and get it. I just wanted to take time away. On a big court, you sometimes get lost at the back because our wheels travel so far compared to everyone running. You loop out. I'm like five meters behind the baseline.   
I made a conscious effort to get in the court and work. I was really happy with how I played.   
 Q.  What do you think the crowd does for you?  
DYLAN ALCOTT: I love it. Yeah, that crowd was epic. How loud was it in there? It was so cool with the roof and huge TV audience as well and things like that. I still get goose bumps. It just changed my life. Hopefully change a lot of other people's lives, as well. It's epic.   
When I'm serving for the match, the crowd went bananas. Some people would get nervous. But I felt better. I love that stuff. I think it's maybe because I make a bit extra out of it, I guess.   
It really spurs me on as opposed to, when you can see I'm out there, I'm trying to get myself up all the time because that's when I play my best tennis, compared to other people who might try to be calm in the moment. It's just how it works for me.   
Thank you to everybody that came out there. I would have been nothing without them.   
 Q.  You had some words on court about those affected by the bushfires. Take us through what you're doing.  
DYLAN ALCOTT: That broke my heart, saying that, same as any Australian. To donate 40 grand is pretty epic. We want to specifically help people with a disability. We'll also be launching my music festival, Ability Fest, in a couple weeks, that's to help people with a disability affected by bushfires as well.   
Obviously all Australians losing their houses and things like that, if you magnify that and times that by having a disability where you then have to retrofit your house again and all that, it's pretty gnarly.   
Hopefully some people got to watch it today and put a smile on their face. I can't compare or understand the pain that it caused. So anything we can do to help, that's what we wanted to do.   
 Q.  Tell us about your work with Ben Crowe.  
DYLAN ALCOTT: I actually hit up Ash Barty and her team at the end of last year. I said, Hey, Ash, can I please speak to Crowie? She was like, Yeah, cool. Luckily Ash likes me. She made the introduction.   
I was actually going to catch up with him before the US Open, then never got around to it, which was my mistake because you don't really concentrate on your mindset when you're winning a lot.   
I probably went into the US Open, I hadn't had to use the things I normally used in terms of my mental game because I'd had such a great year. When I needed it, it wasn't there because I hadn't practiced it. You have to practice your mindset every day. It was a real wake-up call.   
I'm really stoked he answered my call. We worked together. I was there today. I think he would have been proud because I came out there with a really good mindset.   
When I'm clear, but also when I really enjoy what I'm doing, whether it's media, the work with the Dylan Alcott Foundation, public speaking, when I'm happy I perform best. I'm happy at the moment, I really am.   
I have a great family, great team. Awesome crowd. On TV. Everything is going so well. I really try to embrace all that as opposed to put it aside. I'm really stoked.   
The expectation, I used to have an expectation to win. I have a goal to win. Now my expectation is to just be the best version of Dylan.   
That first set in particular, that's how I play when I'm training with Francois on Court 26 when no one's there. I played like I do in training, which is the hardest thing to do as a professional athlete. I was really proud of what we could do out there today.   
 Q.  The end of the match, when you and Andy gave each other a hug, you are great on-court rivals but also great friends. That was quite an emotional moment.  
DYLAN ALCOTT: Yeah, for sure. Shout out to Hawk-Eye, whoever invented that. Poor guy. As soon as he did it, he knew what he had done. He was having a laugh at that, which was nice.   
I think we both, win or lose, we both love it when we both play well. I think he appreciated that we both played well. We're the lucky ones on Rod Laver on TV. We don't take that for granted.   
We give each other a kiss and a hug and say well done. It's changing the landscape hopefully. Hopefully it permeates to more Paralympians, more athletes with a disability.   
I appreciate that I am a luck one, but I'm not going to be here forever. We need to see the next names of not just wheelchair tennis players, para athletes, swimmers, basketballers. It is all entertaining. We have to show people it is more and more. I think we'll look back in 10 years and laugh we barely saw it on TV. Hopefully we can pass the torch on to the next people coming up, so...   
 Q.  This is the first year with the Paralympics, there's also the four slams for the quads because Wimbledon was added last year. You were that one match away from the calendar slam last year. How much is that in your mind now that you're step one of five?  
DYLAN ALCOTT: Yeah, for sure. If you asked me that question last year, I would have said on my mind every five seconds. But now it's not. Now it's just about being the best that I can do, enjoying what I'm doing.   
Last year ended up in a 6-Love, 6-1 loss at the US Open because that's all I wanted. Now all I want is to try the best that I can, enjoy what I'm doing, have a great laugh. I love tennis. Love going to the Paralympics. Love playing the slams. That's when I can produce the best that I can.   
I'd be lying if I said I didn't want it. That's the goal, but I can't demand that of myself. All I can demand is me being the best Dylan. If I can do that, mate, I'll be stoked I think. We'll see what happens. A lot of tennis still to go.   
But very happy that I won today because it's still alive.   
 Q.  How massive is it that you even have the opportunity to do as much?  
DYLAN ALCOTT: It's the best thing ever. When I won gold in Rio, it was the same time as US Open. We didn't have a US Open. This is the first time anyone really can get the Golden Slam, anyone, across all divisions, men's, women's quads. Good on us. The dates aligned. Good the US Open delayed it so we can get there, things like that.   
I was in tears when I put on the all-whites at Wimbledon because it was a dream. For all the slams to come aboard, get around wheelchair tennis, thank you from the bottom of my heart.   
We just want equality. Eventually more prize money, more players, everything like that. I think we deserve it. Guess what, eight thousand whatever just bought tickets to come watch wheelchair tennis. They're not doing that because they want to do us a favor. They wanted to come watch because it's cool. Let's continue to keep lifting and keep lifting.   
 Q.  Talk about the Paralympics and the significance, how much motivation that gives you.  
DYLAN ALCOTT: We don't get paid the megabucks that Novak or Dominic Thiem or whoever is going to win the men's or the women's get obviously. Hopefully it gets better in time.   
If you take away money, what's the best thing in sport? I think it's Olympics and Paralympics. I'm pumped for it, I really am. Tennis is a weird one where we also have Grand Slams. They're obviously on par.   
But I'm training really hard right now. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm not going to go out and have a hundred beers tonight like I normally do when I win a Grand Slam. That's because it's a Paralympic year. I've changed, can you believe it (smiling)?   
It means so much for me to be able to do that. It's going to be such an exciting year, especially for athletes in Australia because Japan, Tokyo, is the same time zone. We'll have great audiences, things like that. So it's going to be awesome.   
 Q.  How long does the alcohol ban last?  
DYLAN ALCOTT: It's not an alcohol ban. I'll have a beer, just not a million. I said I might have a beer out tonight if I win a Grand Slam, might have a beer at my best mate's wedding. Apart from that, not lots.   
It's going to last till after Tokyo, then it's as many beers as you can possibly drink hopefully. It's such a big year, so I'm looking after myself.   
 Q.  What did you say to Novak?  
DYLAN ALCOTT: I said, Come and get a bloody photo, mate. And he did. You know what I actually said to him? He's won seven, correct? I always say to him, Mate, I'm only one behind you. But then guess what he does? He then wins. We'll see what happens coming up in the next night.   
How good is he on Rod Laver Arena? I think it's both of our favorite slams. You can definitely tell that.   
But I tell you who's a great bloke, Dominic Thiem, as well. I'm really hoping it's a great final out there, and for the women tonight.   
I'm not going to lie, I was proud, so proud of how Ash played. I was so gutted for Ash, as well, because she's such a legend. For her to handle the pressure so well, to make it to the semifinal of the Australian Open, like, no one understands the pressure. I understand the pressure, but probably 25% of the pressure she had on her. You know what I mean?   
Shout out to Ash for doing so well and to Nick and to Millman and to the boys in the doubles. Australian tennis is doing so well at the moment. Cannot wait. I've got to do a wee so bad, but I got to wait till drug testing. Let's get into it.   
Everyone from the media, I love you guys so much. Thank you for changing, as I said, my life but hopefully the lives of other people. I get the big room at the pressers now. Thanks, guys.
