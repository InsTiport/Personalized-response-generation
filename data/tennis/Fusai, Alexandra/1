Q.  Despite the loss just now you've beat two seeded teams here, are you fairly happy?

NATHALIE TAUZIAT: Yes, we are pleased to be in the final, for sure.  Yes, we played good this week, and I think we deserve to be in the final.  We played good before we arrived here and continued here.


Q.  What was the difference tonight?

NATHALIE TAUZIAT: It's a tough team.  They play pretty well, and I think the difference was maybe I was a little -- we were so tired.  But today I did my best.

ALEXANDRA FUSAI:   You are always under pressure, and it's tough to play good.  And if you miss, it's going so fast.
