   THE MODERATOR:  Questions in English.   
  
  Q.  Michael, 2005 you were here.  You won the championship.  You lost today.  Any confidence of winning the title this year here?   
 MICHAEL LLODRA:  If you remember, in 2005 we lost the first match in three sets or so.  So it's not finished.   
 We lost the first match, but there's still two matches.  We're going to fight and we'll see.   
  
  Q.  In Paris you were accused of being involved in the match betting.   
 ARNAUD CLEMENT:  Only questions about the doubles, okay?
