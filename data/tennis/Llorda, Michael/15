  6‑4, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   It's been a long time since the French men won an Olympic medal.   How does it feel to have won a silver? 
MICHAEL LLODRA:   Yeah, it's fabulous.   Even if we lose today, we were very proud of us.   We knew before coming there it's going to be difficult.   But at the end, you know, we are very proud to win one medal for the French. 
Yeah, it's tough, you know, to find the good words or describe the emotion, especially on the podium.   But, no, it's huge. 

Q.   You were on the podium with Richard and Julien, as well.   Two French flags going up. 
MICHAEL LLODRA:   Yeah, it's amazing, you know.   It been a while, no medal in doubles since 1924, I think.   So it's nice to bring two more medal for France.
