Q. Given everything that's been going on about the doubles, can you talk, both of you, a little bit about how you think the crowd have reacted to doubles and how exciting the matches have been for the public. 
 
 FABRICE SANTORO: I think most of the matches I saw on TV or I play on the court were good quality of tennis. Very spectacular points, and good atmosphere in the stand. The crowd was enjoying it. I think it's good for the game, it's good for doubles. And one more time you can see that when the doubles is at the good level, people like it a lot. Many good points today again. Many good points in the first doubles semifinal earlier today. I mean, you should ask the crowd, but I think they enjoy it a lot.  
 MICHAEL LLODRA: Yeah, we come out, you know, they are waiting for the good points. It's always good for the player when we see the crowd, they like to react. So, no, it's good for us.  
 
Q. (Question translated from Chinese). The second-set tiebreak, 7-7, Mr. Santoro stopped a little bit. What did you think at that point? 
 
 MICHAEL LLODRA: (Answering in Chinese).  
 FABRICE SANTORO: Well, for sure it was a key point. It was a very important one. At this point of the match I think anything can happen. If we lose the second set, they are back in the match and probably they can play better in the third set and beat us. So we are a little bit lucky at two, three points in the breaker, and finally we made it.  
 
Q. What do you think about the final tomorrow, Paes and Zimonjic? You've played with Paes many times. What do you think about the final tomorrow? 
 
 MICHAEL LLODRA: It's gonna be an interesting match. Always the final is always tough to win. We are very happy to be in the final, and now we're gonna try to win. They are good players. We'll see tomorrow what's happening on the court.  
 
Q. As we all know, Mr. Llodra, you've done some crazy things in the locker room. So if you win the title tomorrow, do you plan to do some crazy things to celebrate? 
 
 MICHAEL LLODRA: You will see. You will see. Maybe for the next match together, it can be interesting.  
 FABRICE SANTORO: Stay tuned tomorrow.  
 MICHAEL LLODRA: Some kind of..?  
 
Q. Naked? 
 
 FABRICE SANTORO: Ah, naked, huh (smiling)?  
 MICHAEL LLODRA: Oh, naked (smiling). Maybe. Maybe. It depends on Fabrice, you know. He's the first one to -- he help me sometimes to do that.  
 FABRICE SANTORO: No. What do you want exactly? Ask him. Anything you want, he can do it (laughing).  
 
Q. Both of you to take off clothes or something. 
 
 FABRICE SANTORO: Yes, yes, for sure. And then (laughter)?  
 MICHAEL LLODRA: It's in the program. That's the program. And after that, you want more (laughing)?  
 
Q. If you can... 
 
 MICHAEL LLODRA: Yes? If you can..?  
 
Q. If you are willing to do some crazy things. 
 
 MICHAEL LLODRA: Oh, many things. We have a good repertoire. No, don't worry about that. We are enough crazy to do something. We have to think about it during the night (smiling).
