   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.   
  
  Q.  Michael, the question is for you.  On your way here you probably saw the picture of you lifting the trophy of 2005 when you won here with your former partner.  Where you are now, what do you make of it?   
 MICHAEL LLODRA:  It's not finish.  We lose twice, but we're in the group, so everything can happen.   
 We see tonight the result of Knowles/Nestor and see if we going to have a good party tonight or stay focus.  We see.
