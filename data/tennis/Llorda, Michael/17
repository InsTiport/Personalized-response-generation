A. MURRAY/M. Llodra
  6‑4, 6‑2, 6‑0

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You played an exceptionally good match for a couple of sets, but came back with that scoreline.   How well does somebody have to play to take on Murray?
MICHAEL LLODRA:   Difficult, you know, because to play in the night match was much difficult for me.   It's much slower.   He play so well from the return.   The passing shot today was amazing.   I couldn't do anything. 
I try my best.   The first set was close.   I have many chances three times on his serve.   I mean, he can change a lot.   Again, this kind of player, you have to be aggressive and to play, you know, at the top level. 
Today was good but not enough. 

Q.   Do you think it might have helped if you had head‑butted him?
MICHAEL LLODRA:   Yeah, probably can happen. 

Q.   Is there a sense you took part in something special?   There were enough rallies in that game to do a highlights package on its own.   Some fantastic points. 
MICHAEL LLODRA:   Yeah, it's always good when you have different styles on the court.   He is pretty good from the baseline.   He has a huge passing shot.   And me, I do serve and volley.   So usually it can happen to see some great points.   Today it happened. 
Unfortunately I prefer to play badly but win the match, but it was not the case today.

Q.   Do you see any difference in him now that Lendl's influence has been around him in terms of his focus on the court that maybe he's keeping his head in the match?
MICHAEL LLODRA:   It's difficult to say, you know, just to see one match.   I know Andy pretty well.   He's still moving good.   He's still serving and get unbelievable shot from the baseline. 
After, it's difficult to say if Lendl for three matches he can be helping.   For sure, he helps a lot.   But we cannot see on this match. 

Q.   You play a lot of doubles.   At the Olympics there are mixed doubles.   There are not likely any women from France to qualify. 
MICHAEL LLODRA:   Good question.   There is no woman actually at the moment qualify for Olympic Games.   So we'll see, you know, in couple weeks, months what's happening.   But for the moment nothing happen. 

Q.   I know you tried to enter mixed doubles once with AmÃ©lie.   Would you think about trying to get her to come back for the Olympics?
MICHAEL LLODRA:   Never.   No, no, it was ideal for me to play with her last year in French Open.   But, you know, if she has to play with me, she has to do all the Anti‑Doping Program, which is too difficult. 
No, I love to play with her, but it's not possible. 

Q.   Jo‑Wilfried is playing without a coach possibly.   There is a possibility he could play Murray in the quarters.   Will you two speak?   Will he come to you, in other words?
MICHAEL LLODRA:   Yeah, but we don't have the same game.   I'm lefty.   He's righty.   He already beat him.   So, I mean, it's totally different.   Is going to be a quarterfinal match. 
But they have to win, both of them, before first.   Anything can happen with Jo.   You know, it depends how fit is he. 
But it's tough.   With Andy, if he's playing like that, it's going to be a big fight. 

Q.   He's doing some damage to the French. 
MICHAEL LLODRA:   Yeah, yeah.   Like always.   Fuck. 

Q.   You know that word in English?
MICHAEL LLODRA:   Yeah (smiling).
