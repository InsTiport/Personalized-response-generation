THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   When did you start to feel that you had some difficulties and where was it?  
MICHAEL LLODRA:   I got a tear in Wimbledon.   So I stopped tennis during four weeks.   I came back last week in Washington, tried to play.   Was getting better, but still sore on my elbow.   
Every day was better, much better.   Since yesterday I feel, you know, bad, especially the serve.   So as you can see I serve like a girl maybe, I don't know.   But was bad.   Sorry for that (smiling).   
I try my best today, try to fight.   But it was tough.  
   
 Q.   Did your elbow bother you the entire match?  
MICHAEL LLODRA:   No, no, because I think I can play the match, but with the pain, especially when I serving...   Otherwise I can play from the baseline.   But when you start the point first with the small serve, it's difficult after.   Especially for me, I cannot do serve and volley.   
No, but I try my best.
