Q. Can you talk about the tiebreak, the emotions and the drama and what was going through your mind, both of you. 
 
 MICHAEL LLODRA: (Pointing to Fabrice).  
 FABRICE SANTORO: As you said, it's both. When we start the breaker, we said, "We have to do it to be qualified for sure. And if we lose a tiebreak and go for the third set, then we are not under control anymore, you know." Then it depends of this or this or this. So we start the tiebreak under pressure, but very well. Michael hit a couple of very good shots and was one, two, three, four, five, six. At 6-0, we said, "Now we are qualified. There is no way we can lose six points in a row." But the first one was on my serve. Martin Damm is a great server, so it was 6-2. 6-3. Then second serve, I miss a volley. It was 6-4. 6-4, you have only one more serve to go. They played a great point on 6-4. Very good defense. 6-5. Then 6-5, you know, you feel very, very small, you know (smiling). He hit an unbelievable last return.  
 
Q. What were you feeling as the pressure was on? After the first five matchpoints, to make that return, what was running through your mind at that point? 
 
 MICHAEL LLODRA: No, you know, I try to do not my best but, you know, I was knowing if I miss the return, I know at 6-4 we are not happy. So at 6-5, I know he's gonna serve on my backhand. I said, "Come on, go and hit and try to do your best." I tried very good, so...  
 
Q. Just what are your thoughts on being in the final four, in the semifinals? 
 
 MICHAEL LLODRA: For sure we are in the last four?  
 
Q. Yes. 
 
 FABRICE SANTORO: Well, the first goal of the year was to qualify for the Masters Cup after winning the Australian Open. Then when we knew we are qualified, we said, "Okay, now it's good to go to Houston. But we have to go all of the Round Robin." We went all of the Round Robin. As you know, now the next step is to play the final for sure.
