 MICHAEL LLODRA: Is going to be tough to beat them, you know. They are playing good on clay, especially on clay. So it's going to be tough for us. We're not some clay court specialists, so, yeah, I think it's 80-20. So we'll see.  
 
Q. Are you expecting to play? 
 
 MICHAEL LLODRA: No, I don't know. I have no answer from Guy, so we'll see in the next few days if I play or not, or if I'm on the team or not.
