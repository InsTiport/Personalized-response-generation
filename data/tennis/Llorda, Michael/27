 THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.   
  
  Q. Same question as for Serra. Yesterday you talked about having fun on the court. Today you seemed nervous and not having much fun.   
 MICHAEL LLODRA: Yes. It was tougher than yesterday. In fact, each match is different. It was tougher today. This morning I felt a bit tired. I have not played much on the surface yet. So I tried to do with what I had today. I was a bit slow.   
 However, I didn't want to lose 6-3, 6-1. So in the second set, I really tried to get those points, but it was not enough. I knew I had the weapons to be able to beat him, but I was not lucid enough today and I was too negative. There were too many ups and downs in that match.   
  
  Q. What about the overhead you missed?   
 MICHAEL LLODRA: As an excuse, I might say I had the sun in my eyes. But, generally speaking, the court is not so great. We can't slide. We might get injured easily. There is not enough clay on it. Very often I lost my balance.   
 But, anyway, if I had been more calm and lucid, I would have done better. That match is good for the rest of the season, though, because for the time being I didn't play much on clay, and I didn't do so badly. I need to work more, mainly on my serve and my returns.   
 Today I tried to make him play. I didn't play serve and volley. It's a pity. I would have liked to have done better today.   
  
  Q. For Remy, it's the first loss?  
 MICHAEL LLODRA: I warned him it would happen one day. But that loss will just help me to have a new start and do better next time.   
  
  Q. What next?   
 MICHAEL LLODRA: I'm playing the quallies in Rome in 10 days.   
  
  Q. Are you going to play doubles with Mathieu?  
 MICHAEL LLODRA: Yes. But both of us are not in the draw. We'll try to get in once we are in Rome.   
  
  Q. Aren't you playing in Tunis? Many French players are going.   
 MICHAEL LLODRA: It's not for me.
