 L. ROSOL/M. Llodra
  6‑4, 6‑4 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French, please.   
   
 Q.   Of course Rosol played a very good match today, but what was lacking in your game?  
MICHAEL LLODRA:   Today the conditions were different.   They were not favorable for me.   We played at 10:30.   It was cold, very windy.   The court was a lot slower.   
He's a very powerful player from the baseline.   He hits harder than the average player.   That was his advantage.   
For example, I couldn't really play dropshots, and I had to be extremely good with my serve and volley.   I believe I didn't serve well enough.   There were a few things that were missing.   
   
 Q.   After the Davis Cup, have you now recovered and are you full of energy now?  
MICHAEL LLODRA:   It was tough.   The first three days after the tie, we experienced very strong emotions.   We had this beautiful party.   I felt really good.   It was good for me because I was able to see my friends.   
I prepared well.   I can see it is paying off today and it will keep paying off into the next weeks.   
   
 Q.   Talking about this, what is your schedule now?   
MICHAEL LLODRA:   I will spend two weeks working on my physical conditioning so that I will be able to play Madrid, the quallies, and I hope I'm going to make it to the main draw; Bordeaux, my club, a challenger; the French Open; then grass.   
I will take 15 days to work on my physical fitness.
