 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. You started off really well, and then he seemed to take over. Do you think that was more him changing his game or something that you did? 
 MICHAEL LLODRA: I don't know. I have chances in the beginning of the second set with two breakpoints. It's not easy, but, you know, I think I can break him. 
 After it change all -- not all the match, but his confidence was totally down after losing the first set. And beginning of the first set, the first game two breakpoints. So it's tough, because I think I made it, you know, after it change a lot.
 After I have couple also breakpoints in the beginning of the third, and finally he break me. After, it was tough for me to come back. 
 In the fourth, you know, I have not so many chances. But I miss a couple points at Love-15 and 15-All. Can make the difference in this set. After the tiebreak, you know, you never know. 
 No, it was a good match. But I think I miss a couple points, you know, to make the difference.

 Q. How is a grass playing on Centre Court? Is it fairly slow or quick? 
 MICHAEL LLODRA: No, it's slow. It's not quick like usual. But, you know, it's not the question today, you know, if it's fast or slow. 
 I mean, couple years ago it was faster for sure. 

 Q. Is there a big difference between grass on Centre and the grass on the outside courts?
 MICHAEL LLODRA: No.

 Q. About the same? They're all kind of slow?
 MICHAEL LLODRA: Yeah, around the same.
