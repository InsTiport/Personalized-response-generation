F. FOGNINI/M. Llodra
  7‑5, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French, please. 

Q.   It was not bad until 4‑All and 5‑All, but you seemed to lacked drive today. 
MICHAEL LLODRA:   No, not at all.   But I didn't play enough on clay yet, in spite of the Davis Cup.   In Davis Cup, I practiced doubles only, playing cross‑courts and short rallies.   Singles on clay is tougher.   Also, last week I was sick.   I was in bed with tonsillitis.   I had a high fever for three days and I couldn't talk. 
I hit a little on Sunday, but I lacked stamina and I didn't serve well.   I was not playing bad during the rallies, but I'm just missing the little nuances that made the difference. 
I need to serve well if I want to win a match, and this didn't happen today. 

Q.   What did you think of Fognini?
MICHAEL LLODRA:   Well, he played well.   He never panicked.   I played him two years ago, and he was nervous then.   But today he was calm, although he complained a little.   But he played a solid game. 

Q.   You had no breakpoints during the whole first set.   How do you explain that?
MICHAEL LLODRA:   Well, I did have several opportunities at Love‑30, but then he passed well or I missed a volley for Love‑40.   Generally speaking, he has good passing shots.   Also, it was my first match on clay, so I'm not going to dwell on this loss and I will keep practicing. 
I'm happy to be here and happy to be able to practice on clay. 

Q.   Also were you affected by the Davis Cup, by the loss, the fact that it was Guy's last tie as a captain? 
MICHAEL LLODRA:   Well, the week after the Davis Cup is always tough.   As you say, we lost, and it was Guy's last tie as a captain.   I told you I had this tonsillitis, lost my voice. 
So, yes, last week was very bad, and I couldn't do any preparation.   So today I didn't have the necessary stamina, especially at the net or serving.   If I don't take the opportunities, there's no way I will win. 

Q.   What are your goals for this clay court season?   Are you going to focus on doubles?
MICHAEL LLODRA:   I will play doubles, but singles also.   I'm going to finish the doubles here and have two weeks off, then there will be the clay court season, the grass, then the Olympics.   I will play Madrid and Rome in singles and doubles.   I did well last year in both tournaments. 
At my age, I believe I should not worry too much about things and enjoy myself more on the court.   I know that playing on clay is tough, but I'm not worried for the rest of the season.   I have time to practice. 

Q.   Can we officially say now that Stephane Simian is your coach? 
MICHAEL LLODRA:   He will be there in Madrid and Rome with me.   Well, yes, you officially can say he's my coach.   He's going to be with me for this part of the year. 
He's doing well because he makes me do things I wouldn't do without him.   Like this afternoon I would have liked to have gone to the swimming pool with my kids, and instead I will have to practice. 
I trust him for many things.   He, of course, was a tennis player.   He comes from the world of tennis.   But during the past two years he's been away from the game.   He knows many tactics that are helpful. 

Q.   Do you only talk about tennis or do you talk about other things with him?
MICHAEL LLODRA:   We talk about everything.   He played Davis Cup.   He was top 40.   He's a lefty.   He has many things to say about tennis.   But also he has a fresh approach to the game and a certain detachment, which is useful. 
It's like with AmÃ©lie:   we can talk about any kind of subject.   Same kind of thing. 

Q.   So you needed to have a boost somehow?
MICHAEL LLODRA:   Yes.   I never really had a consistent season.   I always have ups and downs.   It's not easy playing singles and doubles at the same time.   But fortunately I'm not injured for the time being. 

Q.   What is the reason you get up in the morning and go and practice?   What encourages you?
MICHAEL LLODRA:   Well, I know I'm rather towards the end of my career instead of being at the start.   What I need is to enjoy myself.   Before I would have been really upset that I lost this match, that I could have won.   But now I know that I need to do these little things that make a difference. 
So I just try to enjoy my life.   My family is here this week, so that is nice.   After all, I might go to the swimming pool, but after practice. 

Q.   So you also need the emotional side of things?
MICHAEL LLODRA:   I totally believe that this is extremely important and that's how I work.   That's what makes me click.   Sometimes it can be tough.   But, on the other hand, it's good having someone you can trust and with whom you can talk about any kind of thing, and you know what you say will never be repeated. 
With Stephane, we share many passions.   We have things in common. 

Q.   Did you play against him once?
MICHAEL LLODRA:   Yes, I played him once.   I lost.   He beat me 7‑6 in the third.   The match was kind of 7‑6, 6‑7, 7‑6.   We missed all our returns (smiling). 

Q.   This year is an Olympic year.   Does this change your preparation?
MICHAEL LLODRA:   Well, what I need is to keep fresh because I've been playing a lot lately, especially with the U.S. tour.   After Wimbledon, it's going to be a very tough period.   There will be a transition with maybe the third kid being born.   I know it's going to be tough.   It's going to be grass, a third pregnancy, I don't know how it's going to be.   The birth is scheduled for the second week of Wimbledon, but if the baby comes before, we'll see... 

Q.   When you talk about who's going to be the next Davis Cup captain, are you also talking about the staff?   It might be a good idea to have Lionel because he knows a lot about Davis Cup and the players, or do you believe the captain will have to choose his own staff?
MICHAEL LLODRA:   Well, we had a meeting about all this, to talk about what happened this year.   But Richard and GaÃ«l are not here right now, so we'll have to meet again. 
I think it's good to talk now and then and see where we stand. 

Q.   Apparently there was an article saying that the French Tennis Federation wants to take over this Davis Cup team.   What do you think about that?
MICHAEL LLODRA:   I didn't read the article, so I have nothing to say.   It's normal that the Federation has something to say about the choice of a captain because we represent the French Tennis Federation when we play, and I have nothing to complain about.   The important thing is to communicate and talk. 

Q.   It was even mentioned that maybe financial compensation would be given to the players because of all the tournaments that take place just before Davis Cup. 
MICHAEL LLODRA:   Well, we'll talk about that when the time comes.   Many things can happen. 

Q.   What happened in Montpellier should be avoided?
MICHAEL LLODRA:   Sure.   The only thing we need is really to take advantage of our main assets:   the best tennis players should be fit and free at the right moment.   We know the calendar is quite tough.   If we want to win Davis Cup, we will have to find a solution. 
In Monte‑Carlo the four Davis Cup players had a meeting and mentioned the same name for the Davis Cup captain. 

Q.   Is there unanimity?
MICHAEL LLODRA:   I will give you no names.   You'll hear nothing from me.   It was an excellent meeting.   The moment is not right to talk about any names now. 
The opinion of everyone is important, even the players like Richard and GaÃ«l, who are not here yet.   The Federation, too. 
The situation is new for us because he's been the captain for the past 14 years.   I know only him for the time being.   We are discovering a new situation and it's only through communication that things will be solved.
