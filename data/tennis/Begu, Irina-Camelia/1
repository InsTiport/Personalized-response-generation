THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Congratulations.  Into the second week.  Can you talk about your first week in general.  You've had to fight a lot to get here.  
IRINA-CAMELIA BEGU: Well, I think I will have to play on Sunday, if I'm not wrong.  Yeah, I'm really happy about my win.  Yeah, it was a tough match, but I was prepared for that.   
So I'm just happy that I got through.   
 Q.  How are you doing physically with two back-to-back very tough matches?  
IRINA-CAMELIA BEGU: Yeah, of course it's a bit tough because I've played all the matches three sets and was longer than two hours.   
In the second set I was feeling a little bit down physically, but then I said that I just have to play my game, to be more aggressive, because otherwise I will have no chance.   
I think I did great in the third set.   
 Q.  Conditions today were very different than when you played CoCo.  A lot hotter.  Did you notice a difference on the court?  
IRINA-CAMELIA BEGU: Actually wasn't a big different.  It was more different between the match with Mattek than CoCo.  In the first match it was more -- the court, it was really -- yeah, it was too much clay on it and it was really difficult to play.  It was really heavy.   
Then with CoCo and today I think that the balls were like jumping more.  Yeah, the weather, it wasn't really a problem for me.   
 Q.  Your aunt played on tour.  What advice has she given you about being a WTA tennis player?  Has she told you something very important?  
IRINA-CAMELIA BEGU: Well, she always told me that I have to enjoy every moment, so that's what I remember now.  I'm just trying to keep this in my mind.
