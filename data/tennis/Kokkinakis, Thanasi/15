T. KOKKINAKIS/J. Chardy
  6‑7, 6‑2, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   As a wildcard, is it a bit of a surprise for you to be in the draw?   But what was your attitude going into today's game?
THANASI KOKKINAKIS:   Yeah, definitely I was planning to play quallies and I got the call that I got a wildcard.   So big thanks to Stephen and the guys for giving me that wildcard.   I watched this tournament all the time growing up, so it's good to be a part of it.
Yeah, I have been training well on the grass around Hampton leading into it.   Yeah, I was just ready to go and looking forward to my first match.

Q.   When did you find out you were playing in singles?   Was it when you were en route to Australia?
THANASI KOKKINAKIS:   Yeah, it was actually on the way back.   When I was there I kind of made the decision.   Because if I didn't get a wildcard I wouldn't have played the event at all.   Obviously it worked out and I'm really happy.

Q.   Can I ask how your grandma is?
THANASI KOKKINAKIS:   Yeah.   Struggling.   But she's all right.   She's old.   It happens.

Q.   How do you feel with the dash back home and rush and comeback?   Are you feeling a little tired, jet lagged?
THANASI KOKKINAKIS:   Yeah, definitely.   I got back yesterday at 12:00, did something like 48 hours in three days.   I felt like, yeah, I was traveling a lot more than I was home, which is weird.
Spent 30 hours home and back off.   But, yeah, a little bit tired, but as soon as I got here I had kind of a hit last night to get the cobwebs out a little bit.   Slept long enough.   I was ready to go tomorrow ‑‑ or, well, today.

Q.   Was it nice to get back home?   Obviously sounds like it meant quite a lot to you to be able to get back home?
THANASI KOKKINAKIS:   Yeah, I'm definitely happy with the decision I made.   It was good to be home, a bit of a change of ‑‑ well, I'm used to going home.   It was definitely good to go home and seeing family.   Kind of good that I could kind of play the match and try and put it to the side.

Q.   You're on the centre court tomorrow.   Is that the first time you have played on a centre court in a major tournament?
THANASI KOKKINAKIS:   No. 

Q.   When was the last time?
THANASI KOKKINAKIS:   Australian Open, Rod Laver; last tournament I played, French Open, I played Chatrier, as well.   Yeah, it's obviously why you play to play on the big courts at these nice events.   I have two tomorrow, singles and doubles.   I'm very fortunate for that. 
Just go out and enjoy it.   The crowds are good here every day, I see.   Hopefully I can come out again tomorrow and they'll support me. 

Q.   Today's match, up 3‑Love, got back into it, he won that first set, and then you pretty much took over after that.   Comment on how you felt things went today and how you played. 
THANASI KOKKINAKIS:   I started off pretty well in the first set.   Relaxed.   Then probably a little bit too relaxed.   That kind of bit me a little bit. 
Yeah, I wasn't focusing great towards the end of the first set.   I was a bit lazy.   Good players take advantage of that.   That's what he did. 
Second set I felt like if I switched my intensity up a little bit I could have jumped in like I did in the first set and I did.   
I played a really good second set, and I served well throughout the whole match, and that really helped me get the win.

Q.   You mentioned the doubles.   What's it like to be able to play doubles tennis with one of Australia's greatest?
THANASI KOKKINAKIS:   Yeah, it's going to be a good experience.   Usually at Davis Cup I'm always with the younger guy playing against, because he's always in the doubles, so I'm always playing against him and someone else.   I have never actually played a point with him on the same side.   It's going to be interesting tomorrow. 
But, yeah, obviously he's done so many great things for tennis and tennis in Australia as well.   It's going to be huge for me to go out there and play with him in his last Queen's and last Wimbledon I will play with him as well.   I'm just going to enjoy it.

Q.   A lot of us don't know very much about you.   Can you just tell us what your interests are outside of tennis, you know, football teams you support? 
THANASI KOKKINAKIS:   I'm 19, from Adelaide, Australia.   I'm like a big basketball fan, NBA fan, support the Clippers.   I support Adelaide in AFL Football.   I like to catch up with my mates when I'm back home. 
I don't know.   What are you looking for?   What else can I give you? 
Yeah, just like to catch up with my mates and friends and family when I'm back home.   Pretty easygoing.   That's about it. 

Q.   Have you got anyone traveling with you at the moment, your family or friends?
THANASI KOKKINAKIS:   No one from my family.   They are back home obviously with their situation.
Yeah, I don't know if any will come over for Wimbledon.   Yeah, I got my coaches, agent.   The usual, yeah. 

Q.   Any thoughts on playing Gilles? 
THANASI KOKKINAKIS:   Yeah, it's going to be a tough match.   He's a great player, former top 10, and he's nearly there or around the mark now.   Doesn't give you much.   Going to make a lot of balls.   I'm just going to try to play aggressive and play my game, and hopefully I can dictate and do well.
