  6‑4, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Nice way to start the year.   Feeling like your performance was sort of brewing?
THANASI KOKKINAKIS:   Yeah, I was feeling good with my game.   I had a good training block.   Yeah, I thought a good result like this was just around the corner. 
Had a few tight ones last year where I was up a set on really good players but wasn't able to finish it, so I was happy to keep my compusure in the second set.

Q.   Did the Feliciano Lopez game come into your mind today?
THANASI KOKKINAKIS:   A little bit.   Physically I felt a lot better.   Felt like I was keeping my focus as well.   That's half the battle of closing out those matches.   I felt like my game was there, and if I kept focusing I would've been able to hold on. 
Luckily I started coming up with big serves when I needed them, because I couldn't find them really in the first set.
But, yeah, I'm happy that I landed a few.

Q.   Are you through all your back problems and stuff?   Through the injuries?   You're fit?
THANASI KOKKINAKIS:   Yeah, I'm fine.   Haven't really thought about it at all.   Done a lot of core work and strength work and I'm feeling really good.

Q.   What's the main thing you took a which from a Dubai when you were there?
THANASI KOKKINAKIS:   Yeah, just with Roger, he was work on his game all the time.   He was working on specifics nonstop, trying to do little things other players don't do that often just to make them feel uncomfortable.
He just told me to keep moving forward with my game.   I've got a big game.   Just keep being aggressive, come to net and use it, make it fun.   Yeah.

Q.   How different it your perspective on the game from 12 months ago?   Came into the Lleyton Hewitt match and you were still the new kid on the block.   Are there different expectations now when you go out? 
THANASI KOKKINAKIS:   Yeah, for sure.   I don't think I've established myself just yet.   Few wins haven't really solidified me there, but I feel really good with my game.   First top‑25 win.   I lost to him at Davis Cup, but as I said for all the questions, I feel like a completely different player than I was back then. 
I feel really good, strong, and fit, so I feel ready to go for my next one.

Q.   You wear the pressure on you that you get when you're mentioned with Nick, you wear that pressure and embrace it?
THANASI KOKKINAKIS:   Yeah, definitely.   It just comes.   Everyone talked about it.   You just got to try your best to block it out.   Trying to play my game I thought I came out a little bit tentative, but when I started finding my rhythm I thought I was good. 

Q.   You mentioned Davis Cup, and James Duckworth won before you.   Seems to be a bit of a (indiscernible) around men's tennis in Australia at the moment. 
THANASI KOKKINAKIS:   Yeah, no, it's good.   That's what you want.   Obviously Nick sparked it a little bit last year.   I think Bernie is on his way back as well.   He's going to have a good year. 
Yeah, couple good results this morning and Lleyton and Grothy tomorrow night.   Should be good.   I am looking forward to it.   Everyone is playing well at the moment.   They love it in Australia as well.

Q.   If you do play Bernie, what's your relationship like with him and what are your expectations for that match?
THANASI KOKKINAKIS:   Pretty good.   I practice with him a little bit.   We get a along well.   We play FIFA together. 

Q.   Who wins?
THANASI KOKKINAKIS:   I beat him, but he claims he's beaten me once and he doesn't let me live it down.   No, he's a good guy and should be a good match whoever I play. 
I feel like I'm hitting the ball well, so just worry about my game more than who I am playing, and hopefully I do all right.
