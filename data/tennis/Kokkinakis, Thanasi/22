  7‑6, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   What was the hardest thing to deal with about Bernard's game tonight?
THANASI KOKKINAKIS:   The serve, I would say.   Felt like he was getting so many free points just by‑‑ he was serving pretty big but hitting his targets really good on his serve.
I had a couple half chances, and when someone is serving so well, so accurately, those are the chances I need to take.

Q.   Did you feel like you worked your way on top in the second half of the first set getting to the tiebreak?
THANASI KOKKINAKIS:   Yeah, yeah, for sure.   I didn't have a break point all match, but there were so many 30‑All points and deuce points where if I just ‑‑   like points I just missed.   It was 5‑4, 30‑All.   I remember it pretty clearly.   I ran around a forehand and went for it and I think I just missed it by a couple centimeters.   Things like that can change a match.   That brings up set point. 
Also second point of the tiebreak.   I won the first point and thought I had the point won with a backhand down the line and he surprised me and got it back deep under my toes. 
Just little things like that if you can get a point here or there if you can get a point can really change the match.

Q.   Is that one of the big things you learned, that little things like that can change the match?
THANASI KOKKINAKIS:   I knew that before, but it just happened.   Couple things I need to get better which he showed, he just hit his spot really well on his serve.
My percentage wasn't great.   When I am playing well I make a lot of first serves and I look for my forehand, so that wasn't working.   I think that stopped me getting a lot of free points.

Q.   You played a lot of sort of top 20, top 30 players in the past few months.   How was his level tonight compared to them?
THANASI KOKKINAKIS:   Yeah, it was pretty high.   Obviously he's playing pretty well right now.   I can't put a difference on it, but I think he's got a real good game.   Obviously he showed that in the past playing quarters of Wimby a long time ago.   So it's no secret that he's a really good player. 
But, yeah, again, I just thought I had my chances and I didn't take 'em.   Yeah, didn't serve great in the second set.   He got a few early points on my serve in the second early in games, and then he was able to dictate. 

Q.   You seemed very self‑assured in the tight moments in the first set.   Could you feel that from your side of the court, that he was challenged?
THANASI KOKKINAKIS:   He was?   Yeah, he doesn't show much emotion ever.   I think that's one of the things that makes him pretty good.   I'm trying to get like that, but I obviously show a bit more than he does.
Yeah, I get a bit frustrated when I have chances and half chances that I don't take.   I know against a good server those can make the difference in a match.

Q.   Two good matches for you.   Where to for now?
THANASI KOKKINAKIS:   I'll go to Sydney.   I don't know if I am in qualifying or I have got a wild card for main draw.   Haven't been told anything.   They leave it pretty late. 
I have doubles tomorrow actually, so focus on that first.   Had good fun playing the first round.   We had a good win there.   Hopefully we can keep it going.   Tough one up next, though. 

Q.   Andy Murray tweeted before that he was coming back from Hopman Cup and he was putting it on to watch you tonight.   He said, quote, "Watching the future stars of tennis."   What do you make of that?
THANASI KOKKINAKIS:   Yeah, he actually followed me on Twitter the other day, which was pretty cool.   Saw Murray come up.   Yeah, I watched his match today a little bit.   Yeah, he's obviously playing some good tennis as well.
It's good to have the big guys watch you.   Obviously training with Roger as well, so it's good to get around the big dogs little bit also.   I'm focusing on myself and just trying to put the wins on the board.
