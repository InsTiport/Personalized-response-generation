THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. I wanted to ask you about flying.  You were in America in March, I assume then you must have flown back somewhere and then you had a long period where you didn't fly.  So you know a lot of us these days aren't flying at all.  How are you coping with the whole sort of flight side of your --
BARBARA HAAS:   Sorry, I can't hear you.
Q. I'm interested about flying.  You're still flying around the world when the rest of us aren't.  In March you were in the United States and then I assume you must have flown back to Europe after that.  And then it seems like you had a long period where you didn't fly at all.  How has it changed the whole sort of flying experience and players are taking such care to stay healthy and everything is flying becoming something that you're worried about?
BARBARA HAAS:   I mean, I completely hate flying so I think the best thing during the lockdown was that I didn't have to go on the plane (laughing.)  So, yeah, I hope that answers your question.  No?  Not at all?  (Laughing.)
