G. MUGURUZA/C. Giorgi
  6‑2, 5‑7, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please. 

Q. That was a very difficult run to have at the beginning, very difficult match. If you had a chance now, what do you think you might have done differently, looking back on it?
CAMILA GIORGI: What I will change? Nothing, because it's already past. 

Q. Are you going to the Olympics?
CAMILA GIORGI: I don't know if I'm going to go.

Q. You haven't decided yet?
CAMILA GIORGI: Yes.

Q. What goals do you have this year? Any particular goals you have this year?
CAMILA GIORGI: Yes, to climb my ranking again. That's all. 

Q. How did you feel? You were happy with how you played?
CAMILA GIORGI: Happy, no. But I play a good match, and some points were really important and I didn't take these points.

Q. Muguruza has been playing grass court, practicing grass court tennis. Have you had much chance to play grass court?
CAMILA GIORGI: Yes, I have chance to practice. 

Q. Were you impressed by Garbiñe's form? I wanted to ask you about the No. 1 ranking. Serena has held it now for almost 300 weeks. Garbiñe has a chance here to pass her and some other players do. When you play against Garbiñe, do you think she can be that type of player that earns the No. 1 ranking?
CAMILA GIORGI: I don't know. 
In tennis women, everything's possible. 

Q. Did you have a particular plan today?
CAMILA GIORGI: Today? No, no. Just play my game. That's all. 

Q. Did you like the conditions on Centre Court? Were they how you expected them to be? Fast, slow? 
CAMILA GIORGI: No, I like ‑‑the courts were the same than the practice courts. That's okay. Doesn't change too much.

Q. Would you like to play there more?
CAMILA GIORGI: Yes, of course. Centre Court, of course. 

Q. I just wondered if you're learning anything about grass. The more you play on grass, the more you learn about your game?
CAMILA GIORGI: I know my game very well. If it's on top, it's great. But just still working on and it's gonna be okay.
