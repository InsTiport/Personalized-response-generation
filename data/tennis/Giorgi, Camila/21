C. GIORGI/S. Murray
  6‑3, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How did it feel to beat a British girl on her own patch, so to speak, at Wimbledon? 
CAMILIA GIORGI:   Was feeling really good.   I mean, at first it wasn't good.   I was a little bit nervous.   But then I play good. 
I think it was great match.

Q.   Did you feel the crowd in anyway willing the other girl at all, or were you just focused?
CAMILIA GIORGI:   No, the crowd was either way for both I think, so...

Q.   That's good.   How are you feeling playing on grass?
CAMILIA GIORGI:   I'm feeling good.   I'm improving, so it's good. 

Q.   The next round, have you played before, or you don't know who you're going to play next? 
CAMILIA GIORGI:   Yes, I know, but I never play with her.   I will play the same, my game, and we'll see.

Q.   What did you learn from this match? 
CAMILIA GIORGI:   I think everything was good.   The serve was feeling good, so must be the same thing for the next match.

Q.   So you feel confident?
CAMILIA GIORGI:   Yes, exactly.
