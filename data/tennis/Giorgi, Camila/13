      7‑6, 6‑3

    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please. 

Q.   Camila, how you feel after today's match?   I think you played very well, but how do you think? 
    CAMILA GIORGI:   90% times I didn't play really good, so this was the difference.

Q.   She played much better than you? 
    CAMILA GIORGI:   No, it's not she play better.   I did more mistakes so she have more chances. 
    If I miss more, gives more chances to her.
