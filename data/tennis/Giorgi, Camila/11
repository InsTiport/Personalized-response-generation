  7/5, 6/2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   What experience did you get from this year's Wimbledon?   How did you feel about today and your experience? 
CAMILA GIORGI:   Today wasn't good day for me, but doesn't helping to me a lot of time, these days that I don't have reaction on the court like physical. 
But, yeah, it happens. 

Q.   Will you come back next year to Wimbledon with any new ideas of how to play, or just it was a bad day?
CAMILA GIORGI:   Yes, it was a bad day.
