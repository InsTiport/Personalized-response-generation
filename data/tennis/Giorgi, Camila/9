THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Can you put some words on the match today?  
CAMILA GIORGI:   Everything was going really bad today.   I think I didn't have the rhythm from the start.   I just miss a lot.   
And even in, especially in the important points, I wasn't solid today.  
   
 Q.   Is it because of she surprised you or something?   How did she play, Caroline?  
CAMILA GIORGI:   No, is not about her.   It's about me.   I did a lot of mistakes.  
   
 Q.   What positive things did you take from Wimbledon now and what negative things?   Do you understand?   
CAMILA GIORGI:   Yeah, I understand.   
The positive is that I have many, many things to improve on my game.   
The negative is, of course, I lost today, but it's okay.   I mean, I go home and I'm going to take some days off and then start again.  
   
 Q.   The other thing is your dress.   Your dress, your clothes with the lace was much spoken about.   Somebody said it was from a wedding dress?  
CAMILA GIORGI:   Yes.   The design, it's much different.   I mean, yeah, it can be like wedding, but shorter than a wedding (smiling).   
   
 Q.   There's nothing special?   The lace is not from something?  
CAMILA GIORGI:   No, no, yeah, it's different, much different, the material it's different.   Yeah, the lace is Senaka, so it's different.  
   
 Q.   In my opinion, it's the most beautiful tennis dress I have ever seen.   It's so beautiful.   This is a new dress for this year for Wimbledon?   
CAMILA GIORGI:   Yeah.   Yeah.   I love it.   This dress is really ‑‑I don't know how you say in English.   Lace.   Yes, lace, yeah.   
   
 Q.   You hope to come back again here next year?  
CAMILA GIORGI:   Yeah, for sure.   
   
 Q.   Did she raise her play at all from the matches where you succeeded against her?  
CAMILA GIORGI:   What?   
   
 Q.   Did she raise her play at all from the matches where you succeeded against her?  
CAMILA GIORGI:   I think it's like I said, it's about me.   And today I was not solid.   I was missing a lot.   I wasn't reactive with the legs.   I was low.   
So it's me.   I played really bad today.   
   
 Q.   So was her game very much the same as when you had beaten her?  
CAMILA GIORGI:   No, is just when you miss after two balls, you can't say if she play better or not.   It's that I wasn't solid.   I was missing a lot, the serve.   The same from behind, it was the same.   When I was going the net, I didn't close the points.  
So how you can say that?   I can't, you know.
