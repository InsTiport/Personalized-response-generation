THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You must be very pleased the way you played so long for so long. 
CAMILA GIORGI:   Yeah, yeah, it was a good match, I think.

Q.   What were you most pleased about with your performance today?
CAMILA GIORGI:   I was consistence of the match.   Even I was doing some mistakes, but all the match I think was consistence.   This was the point.

Q.   You were struggling with your serve a little bit.   When you lost your serve serving for the match, how nervous were you?
CAMILA GIORGI:   I lost my serve in the first and the second set, too.   This wasn't the point, the serve. 
I mean, it's normal.   Sometimes you do some mistakes, but it's not about the serve.

Q.   How big a win is this for you in your career?
CAMILA GIORGI:   I think it's a good match.   Now I must think about the second round.

Q.   What are you going to take from today moving forward?
CAMILA GIORGI:   The level.   I'm playing better, so hope to still play like this.

Q.   Do you like grass as a surface?
CAMILA GIORGI:   Yeah, yeah.   I like a lot.

Q.   Why?
CAMILA GIORGI:   Because it's for my game.   I play fast, and I like to come forward.   So for this.

Q.   Do you know anything about your next opponent, Johanna Konta?
CAMILA GIORGI:   Yes.   I mean, but I need to play my game like today.

Q.   Have you played her before?
CAMILA GIORGI:   I don't know.   Yes, I play once.

Q.   You were returning very close to the service line today.   Was it a choice you did before the match?
CAMILA GIORGI:   Yeah, I'm working on this, I mean, to come forward even in the return, so to take the time away from the others, to the other girl.

Q.   The crowd seemed to get behind you today.   How did that feel?
CAMILA GIORGI:   Yeah, yeah.   It was really nice atmosphere out there.

Q.   Is that the longest match you have ever been involved in?   Have you had a longer match?
CAMILA GIORGI:   Yeah, I play a longer match long time ago (smiling).
