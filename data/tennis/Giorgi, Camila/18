R. VINCI/C. Giorgi
      6‑4, 6‑2

    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How did you feel about the match today in general?
    CAMILA GIORGI:   I think it wasn't my day.   I didn't play good.   I think so.   So that's all.

Q.   Were you surprised about how many people came to watch you and were cheering for you this whole time?   The stadium was totally full almost. 
    CAMILA GIORGI:   Yes, it was really nice, the stadium. 
    But it wasn't my day, so that's all.

Q.   Obviously disappointed today, but when you look back, how do you assess your overall performance?   You had the big win against Caroline.   Overall in the tournament. 
    CAMILA GIORGI:   Yes, I think so.   Was two great weeks coming back from two months without playing, so I'm happy I came back to play. 
    And I played really good level.   Now I will still keep going and play more tournaments.

Q.   What was the coolest thing that's happened to you in the two days since you beat Caroline?
    CAMILA GIORGI:   I mean, that changed because I pass in the next round.   I'm doing the same things as before, practicing, and I was preparing the next match.
