THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Was it kind of a frustrating day for you today with the weather and all that kind of stuff? 
CAMILA GIORGI:   Yeah, was not nice day, I think so.   On the court I didn't play my best, and that's all.

Q.   The moment of the rain stopped it was a very vital point.   Do you think that changed the outcome of the game? 
CAMILA GIORGI:   Maybe change, but I don't think this is an excuse.   I mean, in general I didn't play good the match.   I was starting to coming back in the second one.   I don't think it's‑‑

Q.   Because the rain delay was 30‑40, wasn't it?
CAMILA GIORGI:   Yes.   Yeah, I was down.   But, no, I think so this is not the excuse. 

Q.   Do you or have you lived in Miami? 
CAMILA GIORGI:   Yeah, I'm living in Miami.

Q.   You live there now?
CAMILA GIORGI:   Yes. 

Q.   Why in Miami?   Any particular reason?
CAMILA GIORGI:   Yeah, because they did me a contract three years ago, so I moved there. 

Q.   Who did? 
CAMILA GIORGI:   One family, some private one. 

Q.   A private person?
CAMILA GIORGI:   Yes.

Q.   Where do you train there?

Q.   Yeah, I'm from Boca.   How long have you been there?
CAMILA GIORGI:   Two years.

Q.   Was there a point at all where you thought or you were talking about going Israel? 
CAMILA GIORGI:   Not for the moment, no.

Q.   In the past was there? 
CAMILA GIORGI:   No.   I mean, we didn't say that. 

Q.   Who your coach in Miami? 
CAMILA GIORGI:   I'm practicing with my dad, but with many sparring and hitting partners and players. 

Q.   Anyone from the tour?   There are a lot of players down there. 
CAMILA GIORGI:   Yes.   Some girls from the tour or boys. 

Q.   Okay.   Are you going to go into the doubles or the mixed now?   Where will you go now?
CAMILA GIORGI:   No, now I will stop for one month until my shoulder is okay.

Q.   You have a problem with your shoulder? 
CAMILA GIORGI:   Yes.   It's eight months I'm like this.   I'm playing, but never go away.
So now I will stop and see a doctor and start from there.

CAMILA GIORGI:   Yes. 

Q.   What do they say?
CAMILA GIORGI:   I have tendonitis and bursitis. 

Q.   The reason we asked you if you were going to Israel is there was a rumor that you had been approached to play for them.   Was that a rumor?
CAMILA GIORGI:   No, this wasn't‑‑

Q.   It wasn't true? 
CAMILA GIORGI:   No. 

Q.   You'll be back next year?
