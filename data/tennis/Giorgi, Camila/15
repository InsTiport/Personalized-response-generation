KEYS‑DAVIS/Burnett‑Matteucci
  6‑2, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Talk about the tie.   Yesterday you said you were not happy yet. 
CAPTAIN BARAZZUTTI:   Today we are very, very happy.   It is a great victory for Italy.   The girls play unbelievably well.   Really great results. 
I think it's very difficult to beat the United States at home.   Such a great achievement.   We are very, very happy and will go to celebrate tonight this victory. 

Q.   How will you celebrate? 
CAPTAIN BARAZZUTTI:   Italian restaurant, drink wine, then we go to sleep.   Tomorrow we go.   Some go home, some have to play tournament. 

Q.   I heard some rumors you were going to play in the snow. 
CAPTAIN BARAZZUTTI:   Oh, play with the snow.   Still like Christmastime for us (laughter). 
But we are very, very happy.   I'm very proud to be captain of this great team. 

Q.   When did you find out that they were going to put in Alison Riske instead of Madison Keys? 
CAPTAIN BARAZZUTTI:   They told me one hour before maybe.   That's their choice.   We respect.   I don't want to go into motivation, why they change.   I don't know.   Maybe it was the right choice for the United States. 

Q.   What was it like playing Fed Cup for you?   I assume it's the first match for both of you.   What was that experience like? 
NASTASSJA BURNETT:   Of course, was the first match in the Fed Cup.   Even if we won 3‑0, it was very emotional to play in the stadium with Italy on our back of the T‑shirts. 
With Alice, we go on court to enjoy.   Of course, at the beginning a bit of tension was there, but then it was much better and we enjoy the doubles. 

Q.   Camila, what was it like being part of a winning Fed Cup team for you? 
CAMILA GIORGI:   Oh, was really, really good.   Was new experience.   It's always good.   Was a fun week, different week.   I mean, everything you do with the team, so was fun.
