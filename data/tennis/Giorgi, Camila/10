C. GIORGI/G. Muguruza
  6‑4, 6‑7, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.

Q.   Another good win for you today.   How do you feel after that victory?
CAMILA GIORGI:   Yeah, it was really good.   Feeling good.   Was a good match. 

Q.   What was the key, especially in the third set?
CAMILA GIORGI:   I did everything faster.   This was the key. 
I was doing more aggressive, and I was just trying to accelerate maximum the ball. 

Q.   Against Rybarikova in the semifinals, she plays sort of a tough game.   She mixes the pace.   What will your approach be against her?
CAMILA GIORGI:   I don't know her.   I mean, I just think about me, my game.   I will concentrate like always.   I don't think about the game of the other opponent. 

Q.   It seems for you when the serve is working, everything is working, and when it's not working, you struggle.   Is that accurate?   How do you approach your service game?
CAMILA GIORGI:   No, I don't think this is the point.   Of course, the serve helps a lot for me.   My type of game, it's more secure when my serve goes in, and it's easier. 
But is not a problem.   Doesn't work, I mean, I have the return.   It was working a lot today.   I was breaking the serve.   So this was the key, I think so. 

Q.   You've had a lot of big wins in your career over higher‑ranked players.   How important was it for you to follow up today after beating Caro yesterday? 
CAMILA GIORGI:   I think I'm happy because I'm playing matches before the US Open.   Just trying to play my game. 

Q.   As the tournament moves on, do you feel more pressure?   Do you feel more expectation?   Do you ignore that?
CAMILA GIORGI:   No, I don't think about that.   I mean, I think to play, that's all. 

Q.   Is your priority here more to get ready for the US Open or get a result?   Has that changed at all as you get further into the tournament?
CAMILA GIORGI:   I think, I mean, the point is to be ready for US Open.   But I'm here, so I'm concentrating, of course, on this tournament.   The ‑ how you say ‑ expectation is always to go until the end.
