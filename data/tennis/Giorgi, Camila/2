THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  It seems like this week with all the attention on Coco Gauff, you slipped aside winning round by round.  Has it bothered you that you're not the focus of attention?  
CAMILA GIORGI: Yes, it's about practice.  I think it's very nice weather here.  I like very much the city.   
 Q.  You've had a tough year, missed a lot of time this year with injury.  How are you feeling now?  How has your year been overall?  
CAMILA GIORGI: Yeah, I mean, it was three months, but it's okay.  Now I play, I mean, some matches, so is good.   
 Q.  What was keeping you out?  What was the problem?  
CAMILA GIORGI: Wrist problem.   
 Q.  Which wrist?  
CAMILA GIORGI: The right one.   
 Q.  How is it feeling now?  
CAMILA GIORGI: Yeah, good.   
 Q.  Obviously you're dealing with the wrist.  Before this I think it was Australia that you won a match on tour this year.  How tough is that mentally?  How were you able to stay motivated through all that?  
CAMILA GIORGI: If you don't play, you don't win for sure.  Just was about to start again the rhythm.  Is not easy after three months.  But it's okay.  Now I'm playing good.  This is the important.   
 Q.  You said you liked this city.  What is it about the city that you like, this tournament?  
CAMILA GIORGI: I mean, I like hot weather, so it's great.   
 Q.  I think you play Caty Mcnally next.  I don't know if you know much about her.  She's a young American.  Do you know much about her?  
CAMILA GIORGI: Yes, tomorrow I'm going to be second match, so is going to be a good time.  I just focus on myself.
