A. SEVASTOVA/B. Strycova   
6-3, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  How does it feel to advance after two matches and after just two days of play?  You're in the semis.  It seems like double revenge over Sloane Stephens after US Open because you won over her and already eliminated her?  
ANASTASIJA SEVASTOVA: I thought about this tournament actually differently, because I think it's like a normal tournament, because you have to win, like, two matches to advance.   
So I just thought about it like a normal tournament, and, yeah, for sure, it's a good feeling to be finished now and to be out of the group in the semifinals.  Now I have a day off.   
But I have never thought about revenge, like double revenge and Sloane, no (smiling).   
 Q.  Do you consider the tournament as a part of a way towards Top 10?  
ANASTASIJA SEVASTOVA: I don't know.  For sure, but I don't know how many points are there between me and Top 10.  I think it's a lot of points at stake here, so it's an important tournament.   
I think that everybody's playing good here.  So many nice matches.  I watched some of them.  Yeah, and just good to end the year on a high.  It's always good.   
 Q.  When you made one day a decision to come back, did you expect it would go that way, that you would achieve so big things and that you would experience such great moments?  
ANASTASIJA SEVASTOVA: No, you don't think about that.  I mean, before the first tournament, like, I was practicing, before the first tournament future, I was telling my coach, I think it's not enough to win tournaments, you know.  I was not so confident by playing.   
But then again, you start with a smaller tournament, you gain confidence, and it's enough when you play these girls.  Then you get better and better.  So I think it was a good progress just to start from the beginning from the smallest tournament.   
 Q.  This year is your first time playing in Zhuhai, and you play very well and playing to the semifinals.  How about the feeling in Zhuhai?  Play here for some games?  
ANASTASIJA SEVASTOVA: I feel it's my best Asian tournament in this year, so I feel great in Zhuhai.  Yeah, I'm very happy playing semifinals here.  I haven't been playing so well in China, in Asia, particularly, but here somehow it suits my game, I think, the court, the balls.  Yeah, I'm very happy.  I love Zhuhai now (smiling).   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in Chinese.   
 Q.  So there is going to be another round of drawing for the semifinal.  Who is your favorite?  Who do you want to play the most?  
ANASTASIJA SEVASTOVA: Nobody (smiling).  No, I don't know.  I don't know how you do the draw?  I have no idea.   
 Q.  You're going to be mixed up and into the drawing again.  
ANASTASIJA SEVASTOVA: So we'll see.  It's like, lucky (smiling).
