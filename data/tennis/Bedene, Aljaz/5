THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Obviously disappointed to withdraw.  Can you talk about the injury.  
ALJAZ BEDENE: Yeah, so I had problems in the French Open.  It didn't get any better, so yesterday I had an MRI, which shows an injury on the right wrist.  I'm trying to skip that tournament and see if it improves in the next week or so.  Play again and see if I'm going to be ready for Wimbledon.   
 Q.  You were here yesterday practicing.  Did you feel any pain at all?  
ALJAZ BEDENE: Yeah, pain is always there.  Luckily I'm not taking any pills, so we'll see if I have to take some pills for Wimbledon.  I really want to play Wimbledon.  Obviously I wanted to play Queen's, but yeah, unfortunately I wasn't able to.   
 Q.  Is the pain similar to pain you felt early on, or is it a different kind of pain?  
ALJAZ BEDENE: You mean early on like in the previous years?   
 Q.  Earlier in the year.  
ALJAZ BEDENE: Well, it's a new one, but it's the same as at the French.  It didn't go away.  If anything, it got worse.  And, yeah, unfortunately that's the way it goes.  I think one of the reasons is because the balls are really heavy, and my wrists are not very strong.  So I have to work on it a lot.   
 Q.  Going back to Wimbledon, do you think it's 50/50 at the moment or are you confident you'll be able to play?  
ALJAZ BEDENE: I'm still confident I will be able to play.  Maybe I won't be 100%, but yeah.
