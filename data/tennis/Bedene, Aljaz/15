A. BEDENE/L. Rosol   
6-2, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How is the wrist now?  Last time we saw you, you were a bit worried about your wrist.  
ALJAZ BEDENE: It's improving, thank you.  I've been at home for 10 days or so.  Haven't played at all, which was I guess good, yeah.   
 Q.  When was the first time you hit the ball again?  
ALJAZ BEDENE: Day before I came here at Gosling.  I just wanted to see how is the wrist.  It's improving, so that's good.   
 Q.  Just needed rest?  
ALJAZ BEDENE: Yes.   
 Q.  When did you come here?  
ALJAZ BEDENE: On Friday.  Yeah, had a good time at home.  It was relaxing, you know, staying away from tennis.  It was helping, I guess.   
When I came here, it was tennis only, which is good.  I needed that.   
 Q.  Looked like you were very comfortable today.  
ALJAZ BEDENE: Yeah.   
 Q.  Your favorite environment.  
ALJAZ BEDENE: Yes, back on clay, which is good.  Felt from the first day that I can play well here.  Yeah, delivered it today, which is good.   
Having a few days off, my focus wasn't on tennis, you know, it was on my fiancÃ©e's release of the song, which is totally different.  I was excited for her.  That was helping my tennis, which is to stay away.  Obviously the ITF thing wasn't as nice for me.   
Yeah, just stayed away.  It was good.   
 Q.  When was her song released and what has been the reaction to it?  
ALJAZ BEDENE: Yesterday.  I don't know, 'cause we released it independently.  Yeah, so, it's growing on YouTube slower.   
 Q.  What is it called?  
ALJAZ BEDENE: 'You're Not Sorry'.   
Yeah, it's out there right now finally.  I know she's been working hard.  I'm happy for her.  It was good to stay away from tennis.   
 Q.  Looking back, as you said in Miami, do you think maybe the wrist thing was a bit psychosomatic?  
ALJAZ BEDENE: It definitely was.  I mean, I wasn't sleeping much from Indian Wells, in the whole tournament in Dallas, and in Miami.  So it wasn't easy.   
Yeah, those 10 days were really needed.  Although I didn't go anywhere, I was just at home.  And, yeah, it felt good.   
 Q.  When we spoke to you in Miami, you said when you got home, you were going to look into it and speak to the lawyers.  Have you gotten any further with it?  
ALJAZ BEDENE: They're still checking.  I think the best thing to do now is to see where is the chance.  Maybe there's a chance to change, I don't know.  But I know the CAS thing, to go on the court, costs a lot of money.  They're still looking into everything.  So we'll see what are the next steps.   
But I really hope there is a next step.  I don't want to give up.   
 Q.  But do you think the arguments that you have made, the reasons you have given that you think you should play for Britain, that that is dead now, that that won't work now, arguing the same case again?  
ALJAZ BEDENE: They haven't really considered the human aspect in this.  Basically all the points the ITF made, The rules are here.   
I understand the rules, but I don't understand that I've been waiting for so long.  Yeah, I can't play.   
I haven't received any apology from them.  You know, it's just not right.  I actually accept the new rule, the way it is now, because I think it's fair.  But I was waiting from 2012.  Yeah, I really wanted this.   
The way they treated me wasn't the best because I could have done it earlier, and it could be the same case Dustin Brown.  They didn't let us know before November, you know, it was too late.   
 Q.  Just to clarify.  Do you want an apology about Prague or everything before that?  
ALJAZ BEDENE: Everything.  It's been taking for a year and a half.  Even I had to wake up during the night in Dallas before the final.  I lost 1-1.  You know, all these things.   
I understand the new rules came in in 2015, but no one really spoke directly to me.   
I mean, it's as I said:  human aspect.  There is no human aspect in this.  It's just, Rules are here.   
I really want to go forward with this.   
 Q.  From what you're being told, it's going to cost you a lot of money?  
ALJAZ BEDENE: Yes.   
 Q.  CAS?  
ALJAZ BEDENE: Yes.   
 Q.  I was told that CAS was a thousand Swiss francs to lodge an appeal.  
ALJAZ BEDENE: I would go there if it's a thousand francs, but I heard a different figure.  I heard  £100,000.  I would pay if it's affordable, but  £100,000, not affordable.   
I don't want to ask the LTA when it's not likely to go through.  It's a lot of money.   
 Q.  Who told you CAS would cost that massive amount of money?  
ALJAZ BEDENE: It says on Twitter.  I guess some people checked into it.  But I don't want to go somewhere where I know there's no chance to win.  I want to go there where I know I can win.  So, yeah.   
 Q.  Can I ask you about your next match here.  An exciting prospect.  Presumably you would be on the main court here.  
ALJAZ BEDENE: Yeah, I mean, I'm playing well.  At the moment I'm enjoying playing tennis.  Yeah, it's going to be against Rafa, who I respect.  He's one of the best clay-courters.   
Yeah, it's going to be fun.  I mean, definitely if I bring my best tennis, I'm not the favorite, but I can stand a chance.   
 Q.  Do you think it's a good time to play him?  
ALJAZ BEDENE: I mean, it's never a good time to play someone like him.  But if I can pick any, this is the time, yeah.   
 Q.  In Barcelona, you're going to be training with Andy Murray, is that right?  
ALJAZ BEDENE: Yes.   
 Q.  And you're playing in the tournament, as well?  
ALJAZ BEDENE: And I'm playing in the tournament, as well.   
I wanted to take this week as a practice week more or less, although you never know what you can do in a tournament when you're fully relaxed.  I'm still focused on playing the tournament.  But beside, the focus is on the practice with Andy.   
 Q.  Is that something that Andy asked you to do, the training?  
ALJAZ BEDENE: Yes.  I think it's going to be really good.   
 Q.  He's not playing?  
ALJAZ BEDENE: I don't think so.   
 Q.  Nothing to do with any of this.  But if you could play one match again in your career, if you could go back and play it, which match would it be?  The match in Chennai?  
ALJAZ BEDENE: No.  It would probably be my first Grand Slam in Australia because I didn't play my best.  After I lost it, I lost a few matches at Grand Slams where I could win.  But I lost so many in a row, so this would probably change a lot.   
 Q.  Who was that against?  
ALJAZ BEDENE: Benjamin Becker.   
 Q.  Straight sets?  
ALJAZ BEDENE: It was four sets, yeah.   
 Q.  But you felt you could have played better?  
ALJAZ BEDENE: Much better, yeah.   
 Q.  Have the LTA indicated to you that they would help you a bit?  
ALJAZ BEDENE: Yes.  They're still working on it, still trying to figure out what's the best move forward.   
 Q.  Is that Stephen?  
ALJAZ BEDENE: Stephen, yeah.   
 Q.  Have you spoken to Downey about it?  
ALJAZ BEDENE: No, no, just Stephen.  And I know he's been working hard for the last year and a half to do something.  But the ITF stuck with the decision.   
But, yeah, he's still fighting.  I really appreciate that.  He's been good.
