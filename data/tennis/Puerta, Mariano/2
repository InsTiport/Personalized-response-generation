THE MODERATOR:  Questions in English or Chinese, please.  
 
 
Q.  Mariano, why was the third set so one-sided in your opinion? 
 
MARIANO PUERTA:  I still don't know.  I think right now at this moment that it was only five minutes ago that I was playing the second set.  So it was very strange.  It was very quick.  I still don't know.  I just finished.  I have to think about it a little bit more.  
 
Q.  What do you think about Gonzalez' performance? 
 
MARIANO PUERTA:  I really think he's much better than me on this surface.  I think he's better on this surface.  This is actually his best surface.  His shots are very strong.  I really think he's a better player than me on this surface.  
 
Q.  You've lost two matches.  Is it because you didn't prepare well because you are an alternate, not a qualified player from the beginning? 
 
MARIANO PUERTA:  No.  Frankly, I think this is a very difficult surface for me.  I have to keep on improving on this surface.  The level of this tournament is very high.  This is a Masters event and the level here is very high, so that may be the reason why I didn't win a match yet.
