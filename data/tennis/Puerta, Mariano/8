 MODERATOR: Questions for Mariano.  
 
Q. Have you been to see the doctor? We heard you've been to see the doctor. 
 
 MARIANO PUERTA: I see the doctor after the match because five weeks ago I feel a little
pain here (indicating wrist). I retired in Palermo five or six weeks ago. I stop to play
two weeks, then practice without pain. But today in the second set, I feel a little bit
again. I mean, 10 or 15 minutes later today in hospital, I see what I can do. But the
doctor say it's not a big problem. I think I play the next week in Lyon and then in Paris
Bercy also.  
 
Q. Did you have an x-ray on your wrist?
 
 MARIANO PUERTA: Yeah, on the forehand.  
 
Q. Did you have an x-ray at the hospital? 
 
 MARIANO PUERTA: No.  
 
Q. You're going to go?
 
 MARIANO PUERTA: Yes. 
 
Q. You've not been yet?
 
 MARIANO PUERTA: No.  
 
Q. What is it, tendonitis, the problem with your wrist?
 
 MARIANO PUERTA: Yeah, tendonitis, this, or periarthritis. 
 
Q. It was clearly affecting your forehand more and more. 
 
 MARIANO PUERTA: Yeah. 
 
Q. Did you feel that today?
 
 MARIANO PUERTA: Yes. I feel I see he serve very good. I don't hit the ball when he
serve, and then I go to serve a little bit cold. I mean, I play better when I hit the ball
more time, yes. But here is my first time here indoors, the first tournament. Maybe next
week I play better. 
 
Q. This is the first time you played Rusedski, yes?
 
 MARIANO PUERTA: Yes. 
 
Q. What do you think of the serve?
 
 MARIANO PUERTA: Great. He serve very good, very fast. 
 
Q. Is it difficult to pick up where he's putting the ball?
 
 MARIANO PUERTA: Because he serve with topspin and with slice both. You never know
(laughter).  
 
Q. How many times have you played indoors this year? Have you played many times
indoors?
 
 MARIANO PUERTA: No, this is the first tournament. 
 
Q. All year?
 
 MARIANO PUERTA: Yeah. Because I start this year 130 the ranking, so when I start like
this, I concentrate more in -- my best tennis is in clay. I play, I don't know, maybe 25,
24 tournament in clay, and this the first tournament indoors.  
 
Q. Do you think the climate, the temperature, will that affect the tendonitis?
 
 MARIANO PUERTA: No. I don't know. I want to see the doctor first and he tell. I don't
know.  
 
Q. Your first tournament on this indoor surface, people are saying it is a little
slower than it used to be indoors. What is your impression of the speed of the court? 
 
 MARIANO PUERTA: The court is a little bit slow, but here is, I don't know, maybe 300
meters in the altitude. I think the court is slow, but the ball is fast. It's a good
combination. But the court is a little bit slow.  
 
Q. Do you feel that now you've made great progress this year, you've reached the
semifinal of several tournaments. 
 
 MARIANO PUERTA: Five.  
 
Q. Do you feel you've got to play more on indoor courts if you're to take your career
one stage further?
 
 MARIANO PUERTA: Yes. But I think I have to play more tournament for play good here, no?
Is different than clay. So I have to practice a lot, and I play five or six tournament,
then I think I play better.  
 
Q. Apart from the problem with the wrist, what was the most difficult thing you found?
 
 MARIANO PUERTA: Here indoors?  
 
Q. Yes. 
 
 MARIANO PUERTA: I think is the return. The return is the more difficult because with my
forehand and backhand after the serve or after the return, I can play with no problem. But
I think is the return. 
 
Q. You have less time?
 
 MARIANO PUERTA: Yeah. 
 
Q. Is it difficult to see those big serves coming towards you indoors?
 
 MARIANO PUERTA: With Rusedski, is difficult. I don't know with another player, but with
him is difficult. He serve too fast.  
 
Q. And he's had a terrible time with his serve actually. He said earlier this year it
was almost as if somebody cut his left arm off. You didn't experience that he had any
problem with his serve today?
 
 MARIANO PUERTA: No. He serve very good. He not play very good this year, but here is
the court of him play very better, no? Maybe playing clay, different history.  
 
Q. You think you could beat him on clay?
 
 MARIANO PUERTA: Yeah (smiling).  
 
Q. You also moved very well today, didn't he?
 
 MARIANO PUERTA: Yeah, yeah, move very good. He hit the ball very good.
