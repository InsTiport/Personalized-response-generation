 Q. Were you nervous in the first set? She seemed to win that one quite easily.
 
 NAOKO SAWAMATSU: Yeah, before the match I was a little bit nervous, but when I come to
the Stadium I was just excited to play on Stadium and, you know, lots of fun is there, so
I was just excited, but I was too much. 
 
Q. What did you tell yourself after the first set, you go to the chair after losing
6-1, what did you tell yourself prior to the second set?
 
 NAOKO SAWAMATSU: Yeah, I think she was very worried her first set. So I was thinking,
you know, I just need to try to do my best and, you know, I didn't want to think about her
tennis, I just wanted to play my tennis. So I think it was a very good thinking after
losing the first set. 
 
Q. If you were to give some thought to her tennis, she's been playing very well it
seems, you look at her record, what is she doing well? 
 
 NAOKO SAWAMATSU: I think she has a very heavy top spin backhand and my backhand is
double-handed, so I really hate to hit the high one. So I think she knows that and she
tried to hit in the backhand top spin a lot, so that is it. 
 
Q. There were so many close games in that second set, what do you think it ultimately
came down to while she was able to win six of the eight, you certainly had your chance --
 
 NAOKO SAWAMATSU: Yeah. After it was like 2-All or 1-All in the second or -- yeah, very
close in the second set and then she was starting to made a little bit mistake, so that's
why I was thinking, you know, I had -- if I can play worried, I had chance to win this
game. So I didn't think about win the game or win the match, but I just wanted to win this
point and next point and next point, so...
