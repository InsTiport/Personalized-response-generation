 DELGADO‑SKUPSKI/Elgin‑Istomin
  6‑3, 6‑4 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   First ATP final together?  
KEN SKUPSKI:   Yeah, we started playing after Australia this year, so we had to play on the challenger circuit for a little while, but we actually made a semi in‑‑  
JAMIE DELGADO:   Marseilles.  
KEN SKUPSKI:   ‑‑ Marseilles.   It was a good week, but we unfortunately didn't get to the final there.   Played great this week.  
   
 Q.   This is a great week for you, really is a big week.   
JAMIE DELGADO:   Yeah, we're thankful to get a wildcard, really, because on Saturday we were at London not knowing whether we were in or not.   Got the last minute call, and it turned out to be a good week for us, yeah.   
   
 Q.   How does it happen?   
JAMIE DELGADO:   I mean, we've been playing well.   Last week we lost a really close match at Queen's from a set and 3‑1 up.   We felt we were playing well.   We just didn't close it out.   
You know, we got through the first one and had confidence since then.  
KEN SKUPSKI:   Yeah, I mean, coming back to playing Great Britain on the grass, it's what we both enjoy we have looked forward to this period since basically the start of our partnership.  
It's shown with the way we're playing.   We're both playing great and very confident right now.  
   
 Q.   How did you come together then?  
JAMIE DELGADO:   I mean, I played a lot with Jonny Marray last year, and we decided to take a break.   We had done well, but we decided to have a break.   
I spoke to Ken, and Ken was up for it.   We decided to give it a go.   That's how it started.   
KEN SKUPSKI:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   And fairly quickly?   You seem to blend together.   
KEN SKUPSKI:   Yeah, I mean, the good thing is we've got a coach who coaches both of us and a lot of the British doubles guys, so we all have the same type of idea of how to play doubles in the same way, which has really helped us bond on and off the court, as well.   So it's been a good match, really.  
   
 Q.   What's happening with the Olympic ideal?  
KEN SKUPSKI:   Well...  
JAMIE DELGADO:   Well, we're not in, basically.   That's about it.   
   
 Q.   Have they decided?  
KEN SKUPSKI:   Well, I don't know exactly.   At the moment we're not in.   At the moment we're not in.  
I think a lot of things have to happen for us to get that opportunity, which would be fantastic.   But I think at the moment we are the third‑ranked British team.   From what I know, I think there is only two potential spots of British pairs.   
So at the moment we don't know exactly, but we're definitely not in at the moment.  
   
 Q.   It wasn't part of your thinking when you got together, though?   
JAMIE DELGADO:   Well, we'd love to play, wouldn't we, obviously?   
KEN SKUPSKI:   As Brits playing together, it was one of our goals to set ourselves to be at that level.  
We have tried our hardest, we've aimed for it, and unfortunately we have fallen a bit short.   But it was a big ask.  
   
 Q.   Your first season?  
KEN SKUPSKI:   Yeah.   I mean, we're both ranked around about 80 or 90, but to get enough points to be top 30, which I think we needed to be to get above the other British players, it was going to be a big ask.   
   
 Q.   So where do your ambitions lie now?  
KEN SKUPSKI:   Win tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Win tomorrow?  
KEN SKUPSKI:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Or Saturday?  
KEN SKUPSKI:   No, it's tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Definitely tomorrow?  
KEN SKUPSKI:   From what we've heard, yeah.   
JAMIE DELGADO:   Have to do well tomorrow.   Quite a large tournament next week, isn't there?   
KEN SKUPSKI:   I mean, it's great prep playing in Great Britain on good grass here.   We've enjoyed this week.   
Next week is obviously the big one, but it's another week, you know.   We've got loads more the rest of the year, and we've got a good chance of really progressing.  
   
 Q.   There is a chance that you might play a British pair tomorrow?  
KEN SKUPSKI:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   They're losing at the moment.   
KEN SKUPSKI:   Yeah.  
JAMIE DELGADO:   Still 50/50 match, though, isn't it?   Yeah, it would be great, wouldn't it, if it was four British doubles guys in the final.   That would be great for everyone, I think.   
   
 Q.   We're trying to find out if it's ever happened before.   
KEN SKUPSKI:   It has I think in Nottingham.  
JAMIE DELGADO:   In any final or in a British final?   
KEN SKUPSKI:   In a British ATP final in Nottingham, I have a feeling, was there a British final there?   Jamie Murray?   
JAMIE DELGADO:   No, he played with Butorac.  
   
 Q.   We've gone through...   
KEN SKUPSKI:   Goodall and Hutchins were playing together.   Could be the first time.  
   
 Q.   We have gone back to Bunny Austin.   
JAMIE DELGADO:   Fred Perry.  
KEN SKUPSKI:   I think it would be a great and a big reward for Louie, I think, who we've worked with.   He's really helped all of us.   
I've played them before, and obviously I have played with Colin for a long period, so it would be good to see how things go.  
   
 Q.   Fascinated by the draw tomorrow?  
JAMIE DELGADO:   I haven't thought about it, to be honest.   
   
 Q.   Get this one over first?  
JAMIE DELGADO:   Just focusing on trying to play as well as we can here.   Nothing will change really.   We will just try and play as well as we can next week as well.  
KEN SKUPSKI:   Just change of venue.  
   
 Q.   Still on grass.   
KEN SKUPSKI:   Yeah.  
JAMIE DELGADO:   Exactly.  
KEN SKUPSKI:   Some great support hopefully as well again.  
   
 Q.   Confidence now?  
JAMIE DELGADO:   Yeah.   Like I say, we have been playing well, but obviously winning matches gives you a bit of extra confidence in tight moments.   It can sometimes can get you over the line, so it's been great for that.  
   
 Q.   Doubles, really anything can happen, can't it?   Not like playing singles.   
JAMIE DELGADO:   And today, you know, we sort of dominated the whole match and were a couple of break points down.   Thankfully Ken served great, but, you know, we lose that game, it's 50/50 again.   
But I think that's the exciting part of doubles.   It can change so quick.   You know, sometimes you win; sometimes you lose.  
   
 Q.   Good for the public?  
JAMIE DELGADO:   Yeah, I think so.  
KEN SKUPSKI:   Can be heartbreaking.  
   
 Q.   For you?  
KEN SKUPSKI:   Yeah.   It's also a big reward, as well.   Coming through them tight matches, you get a lot of confidence from that.  
   
 Q.   Tell me how many Davis Cup matches did you play?  
JAMIE DELGADO:   I played one here ‑‑ actually played?   I don't know.   Three or four, maybe.  
   
 Q.   I've seen three.   I have looked up three.   
JAMIE DELGADO:   I have been on the team a few more ‑‑I didn't play, but I think I actually played maybe three, yeah.
