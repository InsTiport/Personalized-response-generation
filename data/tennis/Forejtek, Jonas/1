THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Congratulations. Seemed like a hard-fought win.  
JONAS FOREJTEK: Yeah, thanks.   
 Q.  Talk about the match.  
JONAS FOREJTEK: Yeah, it was really tough for me. I was a bit nervous from the beginning. So I was, I think, too passive. But he played really well first set.   
Then it was really good for me that I got first break straight first game, and then I think I played good two sets. I'm happy how I played. It's good. I'm really happy that I won this.   
 Q.  How does it feel to be a Grand Slam champion?  
JONAS FOREJTEK: It's really great. Yeah, I won the Grand Slams only in doubles, and in singles it's just unreal. It's so good. It's big motivation also for the future.   
I think it's a lot of experience from this. So I'm happy that I won this one.   
 Q.  Can you talk a little bit about the level of the match? Your level in the first set and his level I thought was excellent. Then did his drop and yours stay the same?  
JONAS FOREJTEK: Yes, I think first set he played really well. He was serving. I didn't have chances any for breaks, maybe one breakpoint. His level was really good.   
I was playing I think wrong, so maybe my level was not so bad but I was playing bad tactically. I was too passive.   
But then I started playing more aggressive, which was better against him, and he started making more mistakes after. But his level maybe a bit dropped but my level got higher.   
 Q.  You were up 40-Love in the game, third set, 4-2?  
JONAS FOREJTEK: Yes, and then he had breakpoint for 4-3. And he hit a forehand. He missed it.   
 Q.  Were you relieved then? Did you say...  
JONAS FOREJTEK: Of course. And then I don't know. Then I had straight two fast points. Then I went up to 4-2, it was 4-2, 5-2?   
 Q.  5-2.  
JONAS FOREJTEK: Yeah, for sure, it was a bit relieving for me.   
 Q.  How will you celebrate this win tonight?  
JONAS FOREJTEK: I'm not sure. We go tomorrow to -- we go to Bosnia to play Davis Cup for Czech. So I will not celebrate so much.   
 Q.  You're on the team?  
JONAS FOREJTEK: Yes.   
 Q.  All the young guys...  
JONAS FOREJTEK: All of us, yeah.   
 Q.  Other great junior US Open winners: Andy Murray, Dimitrov, Tsonga. How does it feel to be ranked among them? How do you feel that this can propel you in the future?  
JONAS FOREJTEK: Yes, it's really good, like, motivation, also, because, I mean, they won it but I have to work hard to get at least close to them.   
So I think it's motivation and I got a lot of confidence from this. So let's see how it will be in the men's.   
 Q.  Have you been on the Davis Cup team before?  
JONAS FOREJTEK: No, first time for me.   
 Q.  Today you're winning the juniors and then you're going into the big time and everything, playing Davis Cup for your country. Talk a little bit about that.  
JONAS FOREJTEK: Yes, I mean, I'm happy because I don't know who will play. I'm happy I played on the big court because it's a bit different from other ones. I was always playing on the small courts this tournament. Always. I didn't play on this big court yet.   
So I'm really, really looking forward to it, and let's see how it will go.   
 Q.  Do you feel that's a big responsibility?  
JONAS FOREJTEK: Let's see. Maybe I will start feeling it after this, but let's see. Let's see what will be the, I mean, who will play.   
 Q.  What's your schedule after Davis Cup?  
JONAS FOREJTEK: After Davis Cup? I will start playing more men's. I'm not sure -- I think I will go to Chengdu for the Masters, and then I will just play futures, challengers, and start playing men's.
