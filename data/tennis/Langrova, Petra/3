IVETA BENESOVA: It was a strange feeling, but for the first time it wasn't that bad. I had a great match, especially the first set. So, yeah, I'm pretty glad the way I played. 

IVETA BENESOVA: Oh, yeah, of course. I had a set point, but she made a great serve again. So it was a little disappointing. But if I would win the first set, it would be in different match I guess. 

IVETA BENESOVA: I had nothing to lose, so I just came out there and played my game. I think she just didn't know me, so she didn't know what to expect so... 

IVETA BENESOVA: Both. She played better and my level go down a little. Especially I served a little worse, and it's pretty important against Serena. 

IVETA BENESOVA: Oh, yeah, that's right, she has a big serve. That's her - I don't know... 
CAPTAIN PETRA LANGROVA: Big weapon. 
IVETA BENESOVA: It's her big weapon, yeah. 

IVETA BENESOVA: Definitely. Well, I played against some guys (laughter). But it's almost the same, so... 

IVETA BENESOVA: Yeah. 

IVETA BENESOVA: Yeah, it's nice city. It's little bit small, but it's calm and we like it. 

CAPTAIN PETRA LANGROVA: First of all, let me say that I'm very proud of Iveta, because I think it was an excellent match for her to play first time against No. 1 player, Serena. She, I think, had a great performance. The match was very close. I think the first set Iveta was even better than Serena. She had bad luck on the end. I can't tell her anything because Serena just -- I understand she is the No. 1, and she show it because she served great - three first serves almost aces. So I had nothing to tell Iveta because she was right, she did everything right. Well, even after 5-all, she had chances still to win a set. After that, I think Serena was more confident. And Iveta, as she said, she starts to serve worse than in the first set. First match, I think Daja was a little nervous, but I think Venus play very good. That's about it (smiling). 

CAPTAIN PETRA LANGROVA: Well, we will see Daja. I think she didn't have that well results this season, but she was No. 16 in the world so I think she still can play great tennis. It's just she needs to get some confidence. I think against Serena, she just saw Iveta, she had nothing to lose. She just can go there and play her best tennis without any nerves. Maybe it will help her. 

CAPTAIN PETRA LANGROVA: I don't think so. I mean, both of the sisters were 100 percent favorites. I don't think so it was anything special for us or affect Iveta's game. 

IVETA BENESOVA: Where? 

IVETA BENESOVA: You mean like... Most. 

IVETA BENESOVA: Yeah, it's M-o-s-t. 

IVETA BENESOVA: Well, I'm practicing in Prague like five years. 

IVETA BENESOVA: Yeah, small city. 

IVETA BENESOVA: 100,000 around. 

IVETA BENESOVA: Not much. Just me (laughter). 

IVETA BENESOVA: Twelve courts. 

IVETA BENESOVA: Yep. 

IVETA BENESOVA: Thanks. 

CAPTAIN PETRA LANGROVA: Well, I think also Iveta served very well first set. She just go for it. She didn't play like steady, you know, from the baseline. She's very fast and she try to put a lot of pressure of Serena, which I think she went very well. 

CAPTAIN PETRA LANGROVA: I would say almost everything, but especially the power is unbelievable. As Iveta said, Serena serves as a guy. It's unbelievable. It's very strong serve. 

IVETA BENESOVA: No, it's my third. 

IVETA BENESOVA: Yeah. 

IVETA BENESOVA: Pardon? 

IVETA BENESOVA: Yeah. 

IVETA BENESOVA: Of course (laughing).
