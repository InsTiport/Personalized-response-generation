MODERATOR: Questions for Marc. 

Q. Nice win, straight sets. How do you feel on the English grass?

MARC ROSSET: Not very good, to be honest. I mean, it was a really, really ugly match. I
won in straight sets, but I really need to increase my level of my game for the future of
the tournament. 

Q. Any special prospects here? 

MARC ROSSET: Nothing. I was just like sleeping on the court today. I need to be awake
for the next match.

Q. You've never liked grass, and it hasn't changed?

MARC ROSSET: It's not that I don't like. I mean, it's not my best surface so far by the
results. With my size, it's tough to run. I can't move as well as I do indoors. I don't
play as well as I can play indoors. It's not that I hate grass; it's just like it's
different tennis. Maybe I'm a little bit too tall to do well here. I don't know. 

Q. What do you think of the tradition? They've modernized the locker rooms. Is that a
plus?

MARC ROSSET: Yeah, definitely they did a terrific job by doing new locker rooms, new
restaurant, new everything for the players because I had the feeling the past years when
you were coming in Wimbledon, you were still playing in 1950. Now with the new facilities,
I think it's better for the player obviously. We have more space, we have better
condition. I mean, is really great. I really love it. 

Q. Do you still reflect on the situation where you didn't get on the flight?

MARC ROSSET: If you ask me, yes, I'm going to remember of that. I had a car accident
early on, beginning of my career, I destroy a car. You know, it's kind of things that you
remember, but is nothing, didn't change my life, didn't change my way to see life. Maybe
change it for like two weeks, but when I lose a first round match, it's still the end of
the world for me. I guess it didn't change so much.
