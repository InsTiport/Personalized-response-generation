 Q. Was this a more difficult match than you thought it was going to be at the outset?
 
 MARC ROSSET: No, I knew it would be a tough match because I play him last year in Long
Island; I lost three sets and I beat him this year on clay in three sets. I knew it was
going to be really tough. Nothing like a hard court specialist, but he plays well. He runs
fast; has good passing shots and make you play a lot of points. I was very lucky today. 
 
Q. What about playing Boris next rounds?
 
 MARC ROSSET: It is okay. I mean, nothing special to say. I beat him a couple of times.
He beat me couple of times, so I mean, I am not really afraid because it's going to be
like serve and volley match and just have to serve pretty well, keep my serve and I mean,
I have nothing to lose on that match.
