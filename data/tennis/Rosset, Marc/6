Q. What happened to you, Marc?
 
MARC ROSSET: I don't know.  I have no idea.  Just feel like -- I don't know what has happened today, but I cannot stand up, and I feel really like -- I lost my balance when I have to serve, and I feel like really no power in my legs and everything is going wrong. 
 

Q. Have you seen a doctor?
 
MARC ROSSET: Yeah, I seen the doctor, and I probably going to have to make some tests, physical tests, to see if everything is all right, and some blood tests to check everything because since like a couple of days I have feeling, you know, no legs and no power, and it is not -- I don't know what to do exactly. 
 

Q. Have you ever had this before, anything like this?
 
MARC ROSSET: Yeah, it happened in Gstaad a couple weeks ago.  I was feeling almost the same, but today was even worse.  That is why it is -- I don't know what to tell you exactly. 
 

Q. You are obviously very worried, are you?
 
MARC ROSSET:  I mean, it is nothing to be worried when you don't know what you have.
