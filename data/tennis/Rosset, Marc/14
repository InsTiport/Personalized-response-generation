START_OF_INTERVIEW_TEXT








Q.  Nice and Monte Carlo was a bad start for the season.

MARC ROSSET:  Why do you think Nice was bad?


Q.  But it didn't work out well.

MARC ROSSET:  Well, if you think a semifinal for the first tournament on clay in the season is a bad result, then my season is going to be very difficult.


Q.  But we thought you would be able to go to the finals.

MARC ROSSET:  Well, I am sorry that I disappointed you.


Q.  The conditions today were quite difficult with the clay, the balls?

MARC ROSSET:  Yes, it is more complicated for me.  It is better on fast surfaces where the rallies are shorter, but with heavy balls and slow clay like here, it is more complicated for me, and also I can't rely on my forehand and serve to make so many points.


Q.  But you know you should win that kind of match to improve your ranking?

MARC ROSSET:  I think I know what I have to do; I have been for many years on the circuit so I think I know what I have to do.


Q.  But you are not happy that you didn't improve your ranking better?

MARC ROSSET:  Of course I would like to go further.


Q.  Are you happy that you lost?

MARC ROSSET:  Happy?  Delighted.
