Q. Did you have to work harder than you thought before the match?
 
MARC ROSSET:  Yeah, but I think the main problem today was me.  I don't think that -- he is playing good, but to be honest with you, I have a couple of problems for my motivation today. 
 

Q. Why?
 
MARC ROSSET:  Because -- I don't know why.  It is just that maybe it is not -- I am not that motivated.  Maybe I need to win a couple of matches and to see maybe the goal of winning the medals, maybe, especially when you play like -- I don't think my two matches that I have in the first two rounds were really exciting and really great, so I don't think that it bring me a lot.  But I think that I hope that in two days by playing Furlan and another guy, it is going to be pretty tough and I think the motivation will come back. 
 

Q. I am not sure I understood that.  Is that something to do with the Olympic tournament or --
 
MARC ROSSET:  Yeah, I think that -- it is not to do with the Olympics.  It is just a question of motivation, you know, sometimes you wake up in the morning and you feel a  little bit tired and mentally like you are not 100%, but you have to deal with it during the day, so it is nothing that I could really do today, you know? 
 

Q. Just one more question.  The last game of the first set there was a net ball that everybody could see and hear it. Do you remember?
 
MARC ROSSET:  I don't remember.
