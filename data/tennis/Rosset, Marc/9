Q. Is Becker a guy that you see has a very strong chance to win this tournament now?

MARC ROSSET: I don't know. I mean, he is playing well, okay, but I think he has to play
better if he wants to win.

Q. He is not playing well enough to beat Sampras or Agassi, would you say?

MARC ROSSET: I mean, he is playing the same game that he usually is playing, but I
think that if he play a guy like Agassi who is playing very well, it is going to be tough
for him. I think he play well, but don't return so well as Andre, so...

Q. Marc, is there a difference in these courts at all?

MARC ROSSET: Some people believe they are a little slower the last couple of three
years. 

Q. Would you say that is true.

MARC ROSSET: No, I mean, I am -- I didn't play so really often on that court, so I
cannot tell you so -- but, no, the court is all right. I mean, some courts are different.
16 is a little bit faster than maybe the other courts, but I mean, it is like small
difference. It is not really big.

Q. Do you like playing on hard court compared to other surfaces? I am wondering because
some people find it very punishing that they are hard on the body?

MARC ROSSET: Yeah, I mean, I prefer to play like indoors, but I mean, hard court, I
think it is the best surface because you can stay back. You can play serve and volley. I
mean, you can see like a different kind of game and everybody has his chance. The guy can
stay back can win the tournament and the guy that is serve and volleying can win also, so
I think it is the best surface for everybody.

Q. The most favorite for everybody?

MARC ROSSET: Yes.
