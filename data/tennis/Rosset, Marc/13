 Q. Have you ever been down two sets to Love before and come back? 
 
 MARC ROSSET: Yes, I think in all the Grand Slams I was down 6-Love and comeback.  
 
Q. When was the last? 
 
 MARC ROSSET: The last one was, I think it was in French once I was two set to Love down
against Chuck Adams and I came back, yeah, I think that was the last time.  
 
Q. Do you feel that much better for winning? 
 
 MARC ROSSET: Sorry.  
 
Q. Do you feel that much better about your victory because you're so far down? 
 
 MARC ROSSET: No, I mean, I knew it's going to be a first tough round for me against
Mark Woodforde because he's playing very well and-- he's serve and volley and it was tough
for me to play from the baseline and maybe I was too nervous and I want to make me -- I
wanted the point too fast from the baseline and then I start maybe to relax a little bit
more after breaking a racket, I feel more relaxed and I play better.  
 
Q. When did you break your racket? 
 
 MARC ROSSET: After two set to Love I break the racket and then I start to play well.  
 
Q. Do you think you loosened up maybe after -- 
 
 MARC ROSSET: Sorry.  
 
Q. When you got that far down do you think you loosened up a little? 
 
 MARC ROSSET: When you play best of five it's always different than when you play a
normal circuit ATP tour and I play also Davis Cup best of five, so I'm more experience
maybe and even when I'm two set to Love down, I'm not worried because I knew that you have
to concentrate on the next set. It is not over, the guy to win that set to beat you, you
always have a chance to come back and win that set in the match and that's what I did
today.
