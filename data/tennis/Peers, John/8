 Q.  Well, John, Henri, congratulations.  2017 champions here two years ago.  Great first set of doubles.  Really challenged in the second.  You came through.  
JOHN PEERS: It was great to get through that one today.  Everything went our way in the first set.  Didn't quite get through my service game to hold it for the match, but we battled through and played a good tiebreaker.   
 Q.  Henri, nice to get back to the decider here again.  Tougher year for you last year.  Great memories here.  You achieved some magnificent things as a pair, winning Tour Finals and Masters Series events.  What was the conversation end of last year to reignite 2019?  
HENRI KONTINEN: Let's try to win a match.  (Laughter.)   
We had a bad run there.  Managed to win the first one here and then the ball's been rolling.   
 Q.  It was pretty crispy out there today.  Was that as good as you have felt for a while, this tournament, and particularly today in that first set?  
JOHN PEERS: First set and a half, yes, and got myself a scare.  But besides that, it was a lot of fun.   
 Q.  Great to have you back in the decider.  John, on home soil, I know it means a lot.  Henri, flying the flag for Finland beautifully.  Look forward to seeing you back here on Saturday.  
JOHN PEERS: Thanks, guys.  Thanks for coming out.
