  6‑4, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Can you put that into perspective in terms of victories that you've had in your career. 
STEVE DARCIS:   I think is one of the best.   You know, I played against good guys, but I think is my first top 10. 
So, yeah, I think is maybe the best victory of my career. 

Q.   I know that was your first experience playing on Centre Court.   Can you describe your feelings playing there. 
STEVE DARCIS:   It was amazing, you know.   When you are young, you watch the Wimbledon final, you watch all the billing matches here, and you say, Maybe it will be one day my turn. 
It was amazing, you know, to step on the court, to see all the crowd.   Of course, it was different.   It was the Olympics.   It's also another atmosphere, you know.   It was great.   You play tennis to play those matches, to play on those courts. 
Today, it was one of best moment in my life, I have to say.
