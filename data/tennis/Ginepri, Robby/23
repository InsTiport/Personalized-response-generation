MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 
 
 
Q.  That must give you a lot of confidence for the rest of the tournament? 
 
ROBBY GINEPRI:  It does.  It's such a long, grinding two weeks, to get through in straight sets is really helpful in the beginning of the rounds.  I played well, felt great out there.  It's thrilling to play here at Flushing Meadows again.  
 
Q.  The third-set tiebreaker, it looked like you were in some trouble there.  You just held it together and came through.  In the past when you were struggling, you tended to panic a bit in the tiebreaks.  Didn't seem to do that today.  You hung tough and got through.  Does that give you a lot of confidence for the rest of the tournament?
 
ROBBY GINEPRI:  Always.  Any time you win tiebreaks, it gives you confidence.  It's one or two points here in the breaker I got a little lucky when he missed the easy forehand on top of the net.  That's the way it goes sometimes.  It's good to get through.  
 
Q.  Looks like you're not going to play Roddick.  You've played Muller before, haven't you?
 
ROBBY GINEPRI:  Played in LA.  Tough match.  He took me out.  Also playing doubles here with him.  We got a match tomorrow, we got to team up and get through that, have a good one on Thursday.  
 
Q.  Would it be you're the guy that took Andy's mojo?  There's something going on there?
 
ROBBY GINEPRI:  I don't know.  Ask Mardy.  He's the one in the commercial.
