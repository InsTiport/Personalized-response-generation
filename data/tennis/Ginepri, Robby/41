THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  What were your general impressions today?  How did you go?

ROBBY GINEPRI:  It was, you know, a slow start.  I got broke first game of the match and luckily broke back.  But, you know, I didn't hit the ball as clean as I would have liked to but I got the job done.  For a first-round match, you know, I'm excited.  Move into the second round, I play an Australian, Guccione.  It's going to be tough.  He's got a big serve.  I'm looking forward to it.

Q.  He beat Juan Carlos Ferrero last week.  Do you think that adds to his confidence against you, or do you think it's better for you he's got a big win, a scalp out of the way?

ROBBY GINEPRI:  I definitely think it helps his confidence out, especially beating a Top 5 player.  I know when I beat somebody that high, it always gave me confidence and I was more fired up to play the next match. 

Q.  So you know a little bit more about him now, I suppose?

ROBBY GINEPRI:  That was the first time I kind of saw him.  I saw him in Adelaide play a little bit of doubles, but not too much.

Q.  What are you shooting for this year?

ROBBY GINEPRI:  I hope I can, you know, crack the top 15, maybe slide into the Top 10.  Just keep working hard and stay at it.
