THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Robby. 


Q.  Just talk to me a little bit about your match today.  What was the key? 

ROBBY GINEPRI:  I came out playing extremely well.  I served well, got to a good start.  I know David wasn't playing on top of his game at the beginning.  He kind of picked it up at the end of the first, and the second set could have gone either way.  I just won the big points at the right time. 

Q.  Now you're here in the semifinals of this tournament.  What does it mean to you?

ROBBY GINEPRI:  You know, I never played too well overseas before.  This is a good result to get to the semifinals of a Masters Series, especially in Europe.  You know, I've been working hard on my game, and it's paying off right. 

Q.  You're playing Radek Stepanek or Nadal.  Just talk to me a little bit about the two opponents. 

ROBBY GINEPRI:  Yeah, Radek is a tough opponent.  He throws a lot of different angles at you with the serve and volley, staying back, coming in off the second serve.  So it's going to be tough to play him.  You know, Nadal's one of the best players right now in the game.  He scraps a lot, makes you hit a lot of balls.  So I have to be patient and wait for my right shots.

Q.  Physically overall, how are you feeling? 

ROBBY GINEPRI:  Physically, I feel fine.  I haven't been too tired out here.  Got here early enough to adapt to the courts, the atmosphere here.  So it's been a great week so far.
