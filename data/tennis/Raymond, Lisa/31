THE MODERATOR:  Lisa Raymond. 


LISA RAYMOND:  Obviously, I'm very disappointed.  But Tina played very well.  You know, hopefully I have total faith in Venus that she's going to go out there and give us a win this afternoon. 

Q.  Was there anything that Tina did out there that surprised you particularly in how she played?

LISA RAYMOND:  No.  I mean, I've played Tina before.  I've never played her on a clay court.  That definitely favors her game.  She's much more of a loopy player, just kind of waits for, you know, to frustrate her opponent.  You know, she played well.  I can't take anything away from her.  She hit her forehand well.  She hit her slice extremely well.  You know, there was a couple points here and there that maybe could have changed the match.  I just didn't capitalize on those. 

Q.  Do you think she played that well or you played that bad? 

LISA RAYMOND:  You know, again, she played well.  I'll leave it at that. 

Q.  Were you bothered with the rain? 

LISA RAYMOND:  Bothered with the rain?  Obviously, it's not the perfect conditions to play in.  But she has to deal with it, as well. 

Q.  Was the surface a big factor? 

LISA RAYMOND:  Again, I think my game matching up against Tina's on clay, it definitely -- it would probably favor her a little bit.  Anyone against Venus, I'm going to put my money on Venus - I don't care what surface they're playing on.  You know, hopefully Venus will come away with a win and go out against Katerina tomorrow and play well. 

Q.  Were you bothered by the rain?

LISA RAYMOND:  The conditions were extremely heavy at the beginning.  It just got worse as far as the balls were very heavy.  But, again, you just got to deal with it.
