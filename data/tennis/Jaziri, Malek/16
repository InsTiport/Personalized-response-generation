THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You played so well tonight.   It was your first match against Tsonga, world No. 6.   How is that experience?
MALEK JAZIRI: Yeah, it's good experience, first time I played Jo.   It was the first match of the year, so first tournament.   I think I played good.
It was ‑‑I don't know.   I think I played a good level today.   Is good for me for the start, and I hope I will be better all the year.

Q.   Last year was also very good for you.   You jumped from 300‑something. 
MALEK JAZIRI:   Yeah, I start last year 347 in the world.   I finished 117 in the world.   I make good results, and then US Open I make second round men's draw.   Then I won challenger in Geneva.   I played very well.   I beat a lot of guys top 50.
I have to work a lot.   You can see that.   I have a level to play in this level.   I have a lot of work to do.   The next will be better.

Q.   This year, what are your targets?   Which ranking you'd like to finish at the year end?
MALEK JAZIRI:   To finish top 100, and then if something comes better, it will be better.
