 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. How does it feel to finally take down Rome?  
 MIKE BRYAN: Feels great to win Rome, especially after being in the finals three times. I think it's maybe our tenth time here, so it's finally nice to knock that one down, especially against a good team: Nestor and Zimo.   
 I mean, it came down to the wire today.  
  
  Q. Can you talk about some of the things that you guys went through this week to take it down?  
 MIKE BRYAN: We played Mirnyi and Murray first round who had beaten us twice earlier in the year, so that was a tough match right from the beginning of the tournament.   
 Coming off Barcelona I thought we were really confident, and carried that confidence into this tournament and played three really good matches come into the finals. You know, played well again in the finals. Feels really good.   
  
  Q. You won eight out of the nine Masters Series; just Indian Wells is remaining. Does this give you extra motivation to try to win Indian Wells?  
 BOB BRYAN: Yeah, it would be very cool to have all those nine shields on our plate, or in our trophy case back home.   
 It's very tough, each one of these Masters Series is very different and different conditions, different food, different balls, different courts.   
 You know, to finish our career having all of them would be something special.
