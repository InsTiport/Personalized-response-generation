   THE MODERATOR: Just so you know, Victoria had to withdraw with a right hand strain. She'll be replaced in the draw by lucky loser Pauline Parmentier.   
 Questions for Victoria.  
  
  Q. When did you decide?   
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: About 45 minutes ago.   
  
  Q. Is it more to be prepared for the US Open or just you can't go right now?  
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: No, I mean, it's both ways. It's impossible to play for me. I was waiting until the last moment to be 100% sure that I cannot compete.   
 I mean, yeah, it's important also prior to the US Open. It just doesn't make any sense to make it worse.   
  
  Q. Was it hurting when you were practicing before?   
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Yeah.  
  
  Q. Obviously.   
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Yeah, exactly. Seriously, guys, you made me walk up here all the way to just ask me one question?   
  
  Q. Has this been hurting you before for the last few weeks or anything?  
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Started in Toronto in my match against Serena. Not weeks, but recently.   
  
  Q. What kind of rehab will you do over the next couple days preparing for the Open?  
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: I cannot really tell you in terms of medical because I have no idea. I trust my physio on that.   
 That's it. We will definitely do all the things possible, you know, for me to be ready for the Open.   
  
  Q. Isn't a hamstring usually a six-week recovery or anything?  
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Hamstring?  
 THE MODERATOR: Hand.  
  
  Q. Oh, I thought you said hamstring. What is it exactly that's hurting you?  
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: My right hand.  
  
  Q. Something that's bothered you before?   
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: It bothered me before Toronto a little bit. It went away, and unfortunately in the match, as I said, it came back.
