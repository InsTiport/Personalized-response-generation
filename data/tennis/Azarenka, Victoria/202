  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Can you tell us why you're pulling out?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, there are a few reasons.   The last week took so much energy out of me that I absolutely had no time to recover, and my body is feeling it.   It was a little bit too quick of a transition for me to come and start the training, so I just felt my knee was not in good shape, you know.  
It's very unfortunate, because I was really looking forward, you know, to play.   I really enjoyed being here and playing this tournament, but I tried yesterday and today it just got worse.   
I don't see the point of, you know, kind of not giving even 50% of my game.  
   
 Q.   It's obviously been an ongoing issue.   Is it something that likely will affect you through the rest of the month?   
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   No, no.   It actually just happened like when I came here.   You know, when I started to train, the first time I hit was a little bit of a compensation from the other part.   It just happened.  
   
 Q.   Is it a short‑term thing, or are we talking...   
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I hope it is a short‑term thing.   I don't know.   I have to kind of stop and just, you know, take a little bit of time off because I absolutely had no rest for a long period of time just to settle it down and to go from there.   
Hopefully there is nothing serious.  
   
 Q.   Are you going to Cincinnati now?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   No, I'm not playing anything.   Yeah, well, if I cannot play here, there is no chance for me to play anywhere else.  
   
 Q.   I suppose that your goal will be to be ready for the US Open?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah.   I mean, the first is to get healthy to make sure I'm 100% ready to play at the Open.
