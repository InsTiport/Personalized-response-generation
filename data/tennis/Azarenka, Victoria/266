 V. AZARENKA/A. Radwanska
  6-3, 6-4 
   
  Q. Well done.   
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Thank you.   
  
  Q. How do you feel?   
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: I feel great.   
  
  Q. Quite a match.   
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Yeah, I'm very excited about it. I'm still a little bit, you know, in the semifinals for now, but definitely very excited for the finals.   
  
  Q. How did you turn it around from 3-1 down in the second?  
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Well, Agnieszka started to play much better. Started to be more aggressive and taking balls at the net. She was really playing well. And I was just trying to, you know, to play with her, stay with her, and just to take my chance when I have it. So I had the chance at 4-3 to break her and step it up, and that's what I did.   
  
  Q. Was that your best performance of the week?  
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: I don't know. It was pretty good match yesterday. So it's hard to judge if it was the best performance because it was different matches, you know.   
 But definitely some good tennis here.  
  
  Q. Have you ever hit so many baselines? So many balls on the baseline?  
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Well, lucky me (smiling).  
  
  Q. Do you have to do something special tomorrow?   
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Special? Well, special is that you have to, you know -- against Venus, you have to play your best tennis to really show a great fight because she's a great champion, and she knows how to play well in big matches.   
 So, for me, the most important thing is to play my game and try to do my best.   
  
  Q. Have you seen much of Venus this week? Seen her matches?   
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Um, actually, not really. Just a little bit. I don't really watch tennis much.  
  
  Q. And you said your game, are you up to your game or do you think you can still sort of peak?   
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: I think there's always room to improve and I'm happy about it. It's just different day tomorrow. We'll see.   
 You cannot play every day your best tennis. You just have to manage how to go through sometimes. Thank you very much.
