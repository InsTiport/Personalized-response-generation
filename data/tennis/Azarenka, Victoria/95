  V. AZARENKA/L. Hradecka  6-2, 6-3    THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   Q.  Were you a little bit surprised how easy it was at the end after that tough match in Rome?  VICTORIA AZARENKA: I think playing is never easy.  I think the score was easier, but I felt that I was a little bit more present today, a little bit more focused, and better executing my game than probably in Rome. It's sometimes difficult to compare matches, but I'm pretty satisfied with the way I played today.   Q.  Obviously a big match coming next against Serena.  What are your thoughts on that?  Obviously having played pretty recently in Madrid, what do you take from that match going into this one?  VICTORIA AZARENKA: I haven't thought about it too much, to be honest.  I actually just, you know, found out when I saw Serena in the locker room.  She's like, I didn't know we played each other.  I said, Well, yeah (smiling). But, you know, it's not too much surprises there, I think for both of us, who played each other so many times, and always have tough matches. Facing somebody who is, you know, No. 1 in the world is never easy.  But I just want to try to focus, you know, on my game, on my energy, and try to play the best as possible.  But there is no question you have to come up with your A game and play well.   Q.  Overall, that match in Madrid, having match points, do you take mostly positive from that or more frustration that you weren't able to get that one more point?  VICTORIA AZARENKA: I don't really think about it, so...  I mean, it's in the past, and to look at it, it doesn't make much sense because tomorrow doesn't matter if you win or lose, it's always a new story.  You have to be able to adapt in that match and be focused and present in that match.  I never live in the past.   Q.  What about in that matchup in terms of on the clay?  Is there anything that sort of changes from your perspective, or it's just what you're saying, you're worrying about yourself and what's going on on your side of the court?  VICTORIA AZARENKA: I think it's important, you know, to not think about what the opponent is really going to do, because it's the best way for me to execute my game in terms of clay or other, you know.  I know we will have a lot of big serves, we have a lot of big hitting. So as I said, there is not much about surprising each other.  It's going to be tough no matter what.   Q.  Do you think Sascha will give you a few tips perhaps going into that match, having worked with Serena for so long?  VICTORIA AZARENKA: How do I answer that in a politically correct way (smiling)? As I said, there is not that much to surprise each other.  You know, I know that she's a tough opponent.  I know what she's gonna do. It's a matter of me to really, as I said, focus on my game, you know, and really try to be in control, because that's what she loves to do.  She likes to take control.  She likes to be aggressive. I just would like to make sure that I do everything that I can and also not to forget to enjoy it, you know, to have fun on the court and enjoy the battle, that makes me always play better.   Q.  How have things been in these few months now with Wim and Sascha together, having both those people on your side?  VICTORIA AZARENKA: It's been really good.  I think we are getting to know each other better.  And, you know, communication and trust there, it grows and it's easier to understand each other a little bit.  I think it always takes time to adapt. But, yeah, I actually pulled a really big prank on Sascha two days ago, and he was a little bit upset (smiling).  But it's all good.   Q.  What was that?  VICTORIA AZARENKA: Oh, he just didn't want to tell me something about a text message, so I made it look like I was really, really upset and had like a serious talk with him and I had him hanging for a couple of hours.  He was really nervous. But my acting skills were, you know, Oscar nominee, for sure (smiling).
