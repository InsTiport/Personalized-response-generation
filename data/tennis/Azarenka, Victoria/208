V. AZARENKA/A. Kerber
  6‑4, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How did that compare to the way you've been playing in previous rounds tonight, would you say?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, I'm really‑‑ I really was impressed by the way Angelique was playing.   I think she showed some excellent tennis.   It was the first time we played on the pro tour, so it was a little bit new for me.
So I think she's a great player, and she really pushed me, you know, to raise my level and really dig to win that match.

Q.   Why do you guys think you had so much trouble holding serve, both of you?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I think it's a little bit difficult, you know, with the wind, it was, especially from one side, you know.   She was really playing, putting a lot of pressure, you know, and it was difficult to control the ball a little bit.
But, I mean, overall I played pretty good on the return, so I think that was, you know, a little bit of a first‑shot situation, you know, who would take control of that ball. 
Sometimes I wasn't taking, so she was really, you know, taking advantage of that.

Q.   Sometimes when you hit a winner, you shout allez. 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah.

Q.   Sometimes it's, Come on. 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah, it's really unconscious, you know.   Because I have French team, and, you know, also in English; sometimes I say in Russian. 
So it's really unconscious, you know.   My coach says allez on the sidelines.   My team says allez.   Somebody says come on.   It's kind of like back and forth.

Q.   Mix it up?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah.

Q.   If Sharapova wins this match, any thoughts on who might be the loudest in the finals? 
THE MODERATOR:   We've addressed that many times before.
