S. WILLIAMS/V. Azarenka
  6-3, 6-3

 Q. You've been so dominant this week in your wins. What was Serena able to do to kind of throw off your game?
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Well, I wasn't playing my best tennis today. I was doing a little bit too many unforced errors and didn't take my chances. 
 She played really well and served really well. That was one of the biggest differences, I think.

 Q. How would you summarize your week here in Toronto?
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Well, it's not bad. I mean, semifinals is a pretty good tournament. So obviously not happy with today's result, but I need to improve and keep working hard.

 Q. You have played Serena in the past when she was at her peak. Based on what you saw tonight, how close do you think she is to that form?
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Well, definitely I think she's the best I have seen her play so far. I have seen her play, so she's getting there.

 Q. When she's on her game, is there any player in the world that you think is more intimidating or more difficult than Serena?
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: No comment on this question.
