S. WILLIAMS/V. Azarenka
  4-6, 7-6, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Was that the one match that got away? How would you assess your game?
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Um, I think I played good tennis today. It was very high level of tennis from both of us. 
 But, you know, what can you do? I had chances. I had opportunities. It wasn't many, but I didn't take it. So...

 Q. Were you physically okay in the third set? You were doing some stretches. 
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Yeah, yeah, I was fine.

 Q. Serena said she thought she was gone at 4-Love. Did you think you had her as well? 
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: 4-Love. Not really. I know she's gonna fight until the last point. She started playing unbelievable, I think, from 4-Love. I don't know. I don't know if she really felt that way, because she started playing really good.

 Q. She has such a history of these comebacks. What's your thought process when you see a lead start to evaporate? What's going through your head then?
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Well, what was going through my head was I just had to hang in there and try to be more aggressive. The only thing I did is I probably backed up a little bit. I gave her more time to go for her shots. 
 I mean, she was really in the zone at that point. She knows how to handle herself, more experience, and I just have to learn from it. 

 Q. Is her presence a bit intimidating? She's strong and experienced as you say. Does that kind of get a little bit scary sometimes? 
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: No, not really. It's not scary. I think it's impressive the way she does it. As I said, I had to take my chances, and of course she's a strong girl. She has very powerful shots. You don't see many girls serving 200 in the third set.

 Q. At 4-Love, who started doing things differently, Serena or yourself? 
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Have you watched the match? 

 Q. Yes. That's why I asked you the question. 
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Yeah, well...

 Q. Did you change your game or were you just reacting to her? Did you mentally collapse?
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: No, I didn't change my game. She really went for her shots, and she made them in. I don't think I did many unforced errors. As I said, it was her controlling some of the points. I didn't take my opportunity to be more aggressive and to stay with her.

 Q. Were you strong enough mentally?
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Yeah, I am, I think.

 Q. Is that first match at all distracting to you, not only that it went on two hours longer than at least looked like it was going to, but also it was the sister of the opponent you were facing?
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Doesn't matter for me.

 Q. Didn't change your preparation?
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: No.

 Q. Serena seemed to really crank up her serve as well. By the end of the third set she wasn't missing one. 
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Yeah, well, it was kind of hard for me to serve in the first set, too. But, you know, I don't know. It's what she feels. I can't really say anything. 

 Q. What are your next tournaments? Fed Cup next week?
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Yes, so far I am. 

 Q. Are you at the stage in your career where you're happy to get deep in the second week, or are you gonna leave here thinking this one got away a little bit? 
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Um, well, I'm happy with the quarterfinals. It's my first quarterfinal here. I think it's pretty good start of the season I had. 
 Of course it's always can be better. But, you know, it's only a bigger motivation for me to go out and practice more and work hard to improve my game. Because I know I can improve a lot. You know, I'm gonna work hard to get it so next time I can finish the matches.
