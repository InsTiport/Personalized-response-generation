E. MAKAROVA/V. Azarenka
  1‑6, 6‑2, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Each tournament presumably has a different feel and different aspects.   What factors here in Madrid do you think affect play, yourself and other players? 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Sorry, I don't understand the question.

Q.   Each tournament has different features.   What factors here in Madrid, or unique features of the tournament, affect your play and other players?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I don't know if it affects really.   You just kind of adjust to every week there is. 
I mean, the players don't really change.   The draw changes, but you pretty much have the same players every week with just different matches.
But I don't think anything affects me or any other players.

Q.   And the courts?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, of course anywhere you go courts are going to be different.   Even though it's clay everywhere, the center court and Court 2 is going to be different, too. 
Just a matter about the adjustment you do. 

Q.   That was a pretty tough loss.   What would you say you're most disappointed with?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   With the loss.   That's the most disappointing thing.   I mean, I have to give Ekaterina credit.   She played well.   I felt like I had a lot of chances; I just didn't take them.
I put myself a little bit down.   Hey, I didn't play for a long time.   You know, these things happen.   Haven't lost a match since a long time.   It should have happened sooner or later.
In one way I'm relieved that I didn't really play that well, so I can do better next tournament and just kind of pick it up. 

Q.   You came back from an injury.   Did you feel a lack of rhythm in the game? 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   For sure a little bit.   I think it was really noticeable.   I have been doing mistakes that I don't do.   But that's what comes after not playing for a long time. 
So I still have another tournament before the French Open to compete in, and I'm going to go back on the practice court as I always do and work hard to improve. 

Q.   Seemed to me today that it could be you were playing more than one opponent.   Seemed as though you were having an internal battle as well.   You began incredibly well like you did your last match and looked like you were heading for total destruction of your opponent, and then it was almost as if you got involved with yourself and you were beating yourself up as well as the opponent.   Was that frustration or was that...
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah, that definitely happened today.   I played more against myself, trying to prove myself certain things more than I was focusing on my opponent.
But I think it's the matter of really playing matches, being in competition, and to work from here.   It was a lot of mentally today.   You know, it was not at the right moment taking the right opportunities, right options.
But it's a definitely a good learning lesson for me to step forward and improve from here. 

Q.   The incident at the end of the first set, and then another one when it was 3‑3 I think in the third set, were they significant factors in the defeat today?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   You know, first incident I didn't even hear it.   I didn't understand what happened, what did I do.   I was very sure that I didn't have a code violation.   That's why I broke my racquet.   Definitely took me out of shock. 
But, I mean, it happened.   It didn't help, for sure, but it's okay.   It's my own fault. 

Q.   You said in the third set to the umpire something about she has a history.   After all you've done, how are you still in the game?   Do you feel she shouldn't be umpiring?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Oh, no, I will never make that judgment.   It's emotions when you say some things. 
No, I just felt it was a weird call for me because I had no idea I had a code violation.   So definitely took me by surprise.
But it's emotions.   I can never judge what a person should or should not do.
