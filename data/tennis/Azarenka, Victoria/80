An interview with:
VICTORIA AZARENKA
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How do you feel about the match, how you played?
VICTORIA AZARENKA: I think, you know, first matches are never easy.  So I was really going out there trying to focus on just one point at a time, try to execute my game as much as possible.
I had an opponent who is a little bit unpredictable.  She doesn't give that much rhythm.  For me it was real important to stay in the moment and try to put a lot of pressure, not to let her play her game.
Q. How do you feel about the way you've been playing coming up to the tournament?  Do you feel like you're ready to have a good, long run?
VICTORIA AZARENKA: I actually take it day by day really, not even match by match, but really day by day and in the match point by point.  It can sound cheesy and stuff, but that's the best possible way for me right now.
I kind of put myself in this mindset where time doesn't really exist that much.  There is no past or future.  I just try to stay really in the present and find the way to enjoy that and improve in that particular moment.
So not looking ahead.  But I feel that I've done a good job preparing myself.  I gave myself the best opportunity to play here.  You know, I give 100% every day, so that's all I can ask from myself.
Q. How much do you enjoy coming back here and playing?
VICTORIA AZARENKA: I mean, I couldn't wait to get out there and play my match.  New York is always going to be a very special place for me regarding the history that I had in the past.
I just feel that it's such an exciting stage.  You know, it's the last Grand Slam of the year.  It's so exciting.  It's one of the biggest events in tennis.  So there's a lot of attention.  But also there is a great energy and great atmosphere, you know, with the night and day matches.
There is a different flavor and different feeling to this tournament.  But definitely a lot of energy coming into.
