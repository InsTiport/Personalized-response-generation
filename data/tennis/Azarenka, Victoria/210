V. AZARENKA/J. Goerges
  6‑3, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Do you think you can carry this winning record forward this year like Djokovic did last year on the men's side?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Right away attacking me on the first question, huh? 
Well, you know, I take it day by day, and after we will see what happens.   There is no point to think ahead how somebody else did, because, I mean, I have to keep my focus on every moment, every day, so that's pretty much it.
But definitely gonna try (smiling).

Q.   Have there been any words on your side about the illness, because Petra had to pull out yesterday?   What kind of precautions have you taken?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I actually had that illness before the tournament.

Q.   So you're the one who brought it here, Victoria?   (Laughter.)
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Probably.   No, it just‑‑ I heard like few players right before the tournament had it, and me, the same thing.   It was just so awful.
I guess I'm the lucky one that I had only before the tournament.

Q.   Did you get it in Dubai or when you came to the States?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I don't know.   I just got it on the way here.

Q.   So mainly the women had it then?   The women had it before the tournament as opposed to the men then?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I don't know.   I didn't really keep track who had.   But I heard‑‑ I just heard that there is a lot of players that had problems. 
It's very unfortunate, you know.   You don't wish anybody that.

Q.   Looking back, do you think that had any effect on you, your first match in the tournament?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   No, not really.   I mean, I don't really ever like to find any excuses or something to blame on.   Whatever happens happens for a reason, I guess.
But, I mean, obviously I wouldn't prefer, you know, to have that.   Wasn't able to practice for two days, but it's okay.   I was ready for my first match.   I did everything I could, so there is nothing I could add to it.

Q.   What are your thoughts on playing Agnieszka again for the fourth time already this year?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I think it's gonna be tough match, as usual.   You know, we have really tough battles.   I'm really looking forward to play her again.
She's a great player and a very good challenge for anybody to play, so, you know, I expect to be again a tough match.

Q.   When you're playing this well and you get on the practice court, are you working on any new things or are you just trying to keep your game, you know, maintain the level that you have?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Ah, I always try to work on different things, you know, because I think there is never really a limit that you can achieve.   You can always try to do better.   It may not work right away, but at least you can start the process.
You know, for me, always the most important is about adaptation.   For example, here, you don't play maybe like you would play in Miami or in Doha or in Australia, anywhere else.
It's all about adaptation and preparing myself to be able to play my best game in particular conditions and on particular day. 

Q.   Why would you try to do things better when you're undefeated?   Seems to me like you're tampering with perfection. 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, that's what I'm trying to do to stay that way, you know.   If I relax my butt a little bit, somebody's gonna come and kick it.   (Laughter.)

Q.   Have you got a chance to talk with Agnieszka about what happened in Doha?   Are you guys still friends?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I actually never had a problem with her.   So for me, she's ‑‑ as I said before, she's the same player.   She's a great player, you know, great girl, so nothing there is to discuss.

Q.   A lot of players, when they're really young, like 16, 17, 18, will say, I just want to play aggressive.   If I play aggressive, I'm going to win.   But now at your stage of your career do you see the value in playing great defense, too?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I think without defense you can't really play offensive game, you know.
I think that any kids especially or somebody who's trying to come on tour or trying to progress, they have to really work on every aspect of their game, because these days there is no really one way to win the match, you know. 
There is different opponents with different game styles.   So maybe against somebody you can hit every ball as fast as you can and you might win, against somebody it just won't work.   So you have to try to adapt and work your way. 
You always have to have Plan B or Plan C or Plan D, whatever, you know.   So I don't think there is really one way to win matches.

Q.   Agnieszka is considered one of the smartest players out there.   It seems like you've kind of figured her out.   Is that because you're a better‑thinking player?   I don't mean better‑thinking player I'm just wondering, are there things you have a figured out yourself about her game that you can exploit and then win?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   You know, it's difficult to say, because she's someone who always comes up with something different.   You can never really predict what she's gonna do.   All you can do is try to play your game yourself, you know, and not really worry what she's gonna do.
So I think that's the best way to approach the match, you know.   I'm always try to focus more on my game than somebody else.   Of course I take into consideration, but I just try to focus on my game.
But she's‑‑ yes, I agree, she's a little magician, if you can call it that.

Q.   How many of these different T‑shirts do you have?   Seems like every time I see you you have a different message on your T‑shirt.   "I got this"?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I love these T‑shirts.   I think they're kinda funny.   Everybody stops you and say, Oh, what you got there?   It brings a little bit of attention.   It's a silly way. 
I don't know.   Nike always makes some funny T‑shirts.   Actually, I was thinking about doing a T‑shirt myself.   You know, it's an idea that might soon come up.   We'll see.

Q.   Which is? 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, I cannot say it before it's done, but it definitely can be done really soon and it's going to be exciting.

Q.   Do you have a T‑shirt for each match or each day?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Oh, for practice, you mean? 

Q.   Yeah, because it's been a different one every time you have been in the media room. 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Oh, yeah, I try to change it up.   But, I mean, I wish I could travel with more stuff, you know, to change it every, every day, but I'm sick and tired to pay for overweight.

Q.   Does the "I got this" mean you pay the bill at every restaurant?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   No.   I mean, ladies don't have to pay every time.   Come on.   (Laughter.)

Q.   What does your T‑shirt say?   We can't see it. 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   "I got this."   I don't know what "this" means, really, but I guess I got something.   (Laughter.)

Q.   With your perfect record this year, is there one part of your game which has improved more than any other, do you think?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, it's difficult to say because I always try to improve everything, you know.   But I think the really thing that stands out is my physical condition that I improved, and I'm pleased with that.
But I feel like there is so much more room to improve that, you know, I'm trying to keep pushing and pushing myself towards that area.

Q.   With all your success in the shorts era, are you ever going to wear a skirt on court again, do you think?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   You're worried about that, really?   (Laughter.)   I mean, of course I will.   It's just for a little bit longer period of time.   I don't know.   I enjoy.   I think it's a little bit different from any other girls, but definitely, of course. 

Q.   Even if you had won 30 straight matches in the shorts you would stop wearing them?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I'm not that superstitious.   I don't think the shorts really make me win matches.   But if it is, well, I guess I'll play the rest of my life with them.
