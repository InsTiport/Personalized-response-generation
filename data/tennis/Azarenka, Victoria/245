 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Can you use a few words to describe your game today.   
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: I think it was not a good match today, but I'm happy that I won. You know, I went through it, so just happy to be through.   
  
  Q. There were a lot of distractions in your singles match today. Can you talk about how you deal with those, and also whether there were more distractions here today than there normally are?  
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Well, I try not to focus on the distractions but I think definitely -- I would love to have people a bit more respectful and turn off their cell phones and just come and watch tennis and respect that players are doing their job.  
 It's the same for both, so you have to really deal with it and don't pay attention, be focused on yourself.   
  
  Q. You had two matches this afternoon, singles and doubles. How do you feel now? Very good? A little tired?   
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: No, I'm fine. Just need to get some rest and prepare for tomorrow. But, yeah, that's it, I played two matches. It's not the first time, so it's okay.   
  
  Q. (Through translation.) You're partnered with Maria Kirilenko in the doubles and have had a very good record. What's the reason for your partnership with Kirilenko in the doubles? What particular aspect do you wish to improve when you're playing doubles?   
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Well, we never really practice doubles, so it's not like we are, you know, trying to improve as a doubles player. We're both are singles players, and when we play doubles, we just try to adjust.  
 But Maria is a very good partner. We both have a very good game. I enjoy playing doubles myself a lot. It's important, that communication, so I think that's what makes us a good team.
