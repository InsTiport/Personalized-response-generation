V. AZARENKA/S. Errani
  6‑2, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   The scoreline looks easy, but you definitely had to work a lot today against Sara. 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah, for sure.   I think the score never tells the whole story, really.   We had a lot of really long rallies.   I was expecting that.
I know Sara's game a little bit, you know.   She's a very good fighter, and she brings always a lot of balls in.   So you have to be ready that even your best shot will come back.
So I was ready for that, and I really felt like I took big advantage of the important moments, stayed aggressive, and really dictated my game, which was, you know, the key for me to go ahead.

Q.   Would you say that you keep improving during this tournament?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I think so.   I mean, it's difficult to compare the matches because they are different opponents, different conditions, but I felt pretty good out there today and gonna try to keep up, you know, for tomorrow and stay focused.
For me it's important to enjoy what I do on the court, and it looked like I enjoyed it today.

Q.   Just wondering if you have any thoughts on the Oscar Pistorius story. 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I heard a little bit.   I'm not very familiar with the whole story, because I feel like it's still kind of unrattling ‑‑I don't know the word.

Q.   Unraveling?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah. 
So I don't really have any comments.   It's definitely not good news.   It's a sad story. 
But until everything is finalized, it's hard to comment, really.

Q.   Do you think that a lot of times people and fans or whatever don't really know the people that they idolize?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Maybe.   I mean, I don't know.   I cannot speak ‑‑I never want to speak and can't speak for other people.   I try to be as honest as possible always so people get to know me when I'm on the court, when I'm off the court, and whatever I do.
But it's definitely ‑‑it's like in the movies sometimes, you know.   I actually had the story that I was very attracted to one character in a show.   But when I met him, it totally changed for me.
It can happen to an athlete, as well.   It's difficult to judge somebody.

Q.   We saw a YouTube video.   Any thoughts on it?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah.   I think it was ‑‑it was definitely special, that's for sure.   It's something unexpected, you know.   It can never get boring.   That's for sure. 
But it was amazing to see something so different and so creative, for sure.

Q.   Are there four Redfoos?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   That's the four I don't know.   I only know one.

Q.   It seemed like today you were moving really well and the net play was really spot on.   What were you most happy with in terms of today's match?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I think the overall picture, you know.   We had a lot of long rallies, and I did move well, as well as she did.   You know, she likes to make opponent travel all over Doha, really.   (Smiling.)
I was ready for that.   So I knew it's gonna be a tough battle, and I had to keep fighting and from those tough moments to make sure I'm still in the rally, still getting back. 
And I know she's gonna bring a lot of balls in.   I had to do the same but tried to be more aggressive and step up and come to the net to disturb her, you know, defensive game, because she can stay there forever.   I don't want to stay there forever.   (Smiling.)

Q.   You face either tomorrow Wozniacki or Radwanska.   What approach would you take if you play either of them tomorrow?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I think they're similar and different kind of players.   They have one similarity and difference.   Agnieszka is a great hand ‑‑ you know, she really reads the game well.   She can do anything on the court.   She, you know, she can attack, she can slice, she can dropshot.   So very patient player.   We played so many times already.   We know each other really well.
With Caroline, I haven't played in a while, and it seems like she, you know, she's also very good from the baseline.   She change it up.   She can be aggressive.   I feel like she improved over the last couple of months, for sure. 
So it's gonna be good to play either one of them.   Semifinal of such a tournament is never easy, and the girls work really hard to be there, so they must be in good form.

Q.   You like Paris Saint‑Germain.   You have a French coach.   I would like to know where is your learning French now?   Can you speak some?   Did you improve in the last couple of years?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I know je t'aime.   That's important. 
No, I haven't improved my French speaking.   I'm a little bit shy, because sometimes even though I live in Monaco, is difficult to speak.   I understand a lot of French speaking, but it's hard because every time I try, French people can be a little bit tough on you if they don't understand.   They say, Eh, eh?   I'm shy and I start to speak English.
But actually, I would love to improve that.   I just don't have much time to learn.
