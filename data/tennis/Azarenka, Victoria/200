V. AZARENKA/M. Kirilenko
  6‑3, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   What does this mean to you? 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Oh, it means everything, you know.   It was incredible feeling, you know, to just go out there today after tough day yesterday and, you know, to fight hard and just give it all. 
It was incredibly difficult physically, but I'm so proud of what I did.   Emotions are overwhelming, overtaking me. 

Q.   The second set was a bit of a seesaw battle.   You really had to focus on that one. 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   She kind of took a little bit of a break.   I think it threw me off balance a little bit.   After that she start to play really incredible, really taking her chances.   I wasn't really prepared for it.   I started to be a little bit too passive. 
I'm glad I could turn it around, step it up and play again.

Q.   Before this all started, did you think it would be as emotional an experience as it's been?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I didn't know what it was going to feel like.   You can't think in the future how it's going to feel.   You think you're going to react one way or another way.   It's something that comes out of your heart and never expect what's going to happen. 

Q.   You're the first in your Federation to win a tennis medal. 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, I'm really proud of that.   Hope we can continue in mixed and try to get another one. 

Q.   Where will you place this trophy, this medal?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Something really special.   The other trophies is just different from what this is going to mean to me for the rest of my life.
