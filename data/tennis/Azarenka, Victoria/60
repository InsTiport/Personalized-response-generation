V. AZARENKA/G. Muguruza   
7-6, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Muguruza is a great player and was a tough match.  
VICTORIA AZARENKA: Yeah.   
 Q.  What can you say about the match?  It was so tough.  You had the chances to close at 5-3 in the second set, and then you close it out in another tiebreak.  How do you analyze the match?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA: I think it was a high-quality match for both of us.  It was a lot of good striking, a lot of winners, and both of us taking opportunities.   
I think today I served really well, and I played to win in important moments.  Momentum shifting, I think I was a little better today.   
 Q.  Talking about your situation right now, you were already No. 1 in the world and you are playing so well right now.  You won Indian Wells and now a good win over Muguruza.  
VICTORIA AZARENKA: Uh-huh.   
 Q.  How do you feel about your actual situation, about your game?  Do you feel it's as good as?  Can you compare about the level of tennis?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA: Compared to what?   
 Q.  To what you played when you were No. 1, before the injuries?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA: I think I'm a better player right now just the way I handle myself on the court.  I improved a lot my serve and just stronger in the tougher moments.  I feel happier on the court, so that's very important, to be able to go out there and perform in a difficult fight.   
I think my game is developing with pretty big progress right now, and that's what I'm most happy about, is being able to add a little bit more every time I play.   
That's for me the main goal of this season, to keep improving.  As I said from the beginning of the year, I want to see this process moving forward and not really be stuck on the rankings or the tournaments as well.   
Just to be able to give myself opportunities to grow.   
 Q.  No dog today?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA: Sorry?   
 Q.  There is no dog?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA: No, no dog.   
 Q.  Just a question about your next opponent, Konta.  
VICTORIA AZARENKA: Yeah.   
 Q.  Do you know her?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA: Uh-huh.   
 Q.  What do you expect?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA: We have played in Wuhan last year, but it was difficult to consider that a full match since I didn't really feel physically well or wasn't good on the court.   
But it's really impressive to see how much she improved over the last couple months.  Obviously had some great results; playing with a lot of confidence.  She has a very solid game; big serve.   
I'm just looking forward to that challenge.  I think for me it's going to be our first meeting, but I'm looking forward to that.   
 Q.  I don't know if you saw Serena's result or had the chances to check a little bit of her match, but were you surprised about her loss for Svetlana, or do you see Serena just as a bad day for her on the court?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA: I think it's important to give the winner in this match credit, because from what I've seen, Serena doesn't just lose matches.  She always fights.  I haven't seen the third set.  I saw a little bit of the second set.   
I think that it's unfortunate for the tournament, but she has won here so many times and we are going to see her back playing and competing as well as the champion she is.
