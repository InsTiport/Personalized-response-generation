 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. That match go about as you expected it would?   
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Yeah, pretty much. I mean, I was expecting a tough match. She's a good player, had good results recently, so I was expecting a tough match.   
  
  Q. Coming off of Los Angeles, how important is this tournament to you?  
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: For me, ever tournament is very important. I take every tournament seriously, doesn't matter which one it is. So it's important.  
  
  Q. There's been a lot of talk about whether or not you could maybe rise up to No. 1 and challenge the Williams sisters for the top of the game. What do you think you still need to do to move up the charts?  
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Well, I think I have to do a lot of work still, and I'm happy about that I have a lot of room to improve.   
 It's nice that people talk about me maybe being No. 1 at sometime, but I'm not really focused on that. I'm focused on improving my game and taking it step by step.   
  
  Q. You got a lot of attention when the photos came out in June in FHM. You plan anything like that for the US Open?  
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: I actually don't know. I haven't talked to my agent about that, but maybe I will have something, but not like FHM.  
  
  Q. Do you enjoy that side of women's tennis, being able to do stuff like that? How much of it is a distraction and how much do you enjoy it?  
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Well, for me it's not much of a distraction. If you can really separate it it's great to do something like that. Because to be focused every day on tennis, it's tough. Your mind is gonna go crazy.  
 For me it's really good because outside of tennis court I liked to fun stuff, and I enjoy that photo shoot I did and the other ones.   
  
  Q. And you said you don't have any others planned right now?  
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Not right now. Right now, no.
