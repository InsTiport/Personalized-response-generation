  6‑2, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Maybe you could talk a little bit about just the match and, you know, what happened out there and how you got through it. 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, I think before my fall I was really playing very good tennis, you know, in control and was really putting a lot of pressure on her and the way I wanted to play today.
After the fall, I mean, I had to adjust.   And it was a little bit unfortunate, but I just tried to stay, you know, mentally tough and just tried to play one at a time.
I mean, it was difficult but I just didn't want to panic too much in the situation.   I had to adjust.   That's what I did. 
But, I mean, I'm really glad I could pull it through.

Q.   It looked like you were in a lot of pain out there.   You were still able to move, but it definitely had a big impact. 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, it is, but, you know, when you are in the match, adrenaline is going and you try not to think about it and just try to give your best, whatever it is.
Sometimes the pain eases out, especially when you're winning and you are in that mode that, you know, you kinda try to forget about the pain at least.   It doesn't happen always. 
But as I said, I was just trying to have a clear mind, you know, and just fight through, whatever happened happened, but in my mind I had to adjust and just, you know, be okay with it that I'm not at my best.   I just have to try as hard as I can.

Q.   Winning the match despite your ankle problems, does it mean something more that you were able to win the way you did, even though a lot of people may have pulled out or stopped?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, for me personally it means a lot, you know, because maybe before I would just maybe not retire, maybe I would still try to play because I don't like to do that, but I would definitely probably handle the situation differently than I did today. 
It's a great, for me, learning experience, as well, and, you know, I'm proud that I could manage to adjust in a very, very difficult situation.

Q.   So you twisted the ankle, or what exactly is the injury?   Going into tomorrow, do you think you'll be 100% or what can you say?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, I don't want to ‑‑ you know, I cannot predict.   I'm not a psychic, or how you say, but we'll see.   I have 24 hours, you know, to get better.   We're gonna definitely do the best job as possible to be ready for tomorrow.
But the way it happened, I was just, you know, trying to reach for the ball, and I slipped and kinda twisted my ankle.   Other second I know, I was on the floor, you know.   So it's shocking a little bit.
