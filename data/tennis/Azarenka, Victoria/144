    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   That was quite an easy‑looking score, but a lot of games were tight.   
    VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, I'm proud of the commitment that I've done in those games.   You know, as you said, there were a lot of close games, a lot of advantage.   I was few games down 40‑Love.   So for me was important to kind of stay in that moment even though I made couple of unforced errors, just to raise the level when I needed to.   
    That's what happened.   But there are things, you know, I feel like should be better.   But overall it's a good start.   I couldn't wait to go out there and play because was a long kind of wait for me.   
    You know, the first match is out of my way.   Now I can focus on the next one and tomorrow to work a little bit on my game and come back for the next round.  
   
 Q.   Any flashback entering Arthur Ashe from last year?  
    VICTORIA AZARENKA:   No, not really flashback from last year.   But overall that great feeling that you feel to go out there.   I couldn't wait.   I was warming up, all pumped up.   You know, night session is always special in New York.   Just playing in New York is always special for me.   
    So definitely excited.   I was a little bit anxious actually, couldn't wait to go out there.   
   
 Q.   Difficult to assess your play after an easy match like this?  
    VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Not for me.   I always find things that I want to do better.   
   
 Q.   Anything you wanted to do better in this match?  
    VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Everything.   You know, I think my game should be a little bit sharper.   You know, a few mistakes there and there.   The execution should be a little bit more the way I want it, you know, direct the game a little bit better.   
    But it's a good start.   Definitely a good start.   Mentally, you know, it was important to stay tough, to stay focused.   That's most important.   The game is there; just need to shape it up a little bit.   
   
 Q.   Wozniak next round.   
    VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I haven't played her in a while.   She's a great player.   She had a lot of big wins before.   We know each other so well since juniors.   Not too many surprises out there.   But, you know, I know what she's capable of.   I have to try to be better than I was today for me personally and really execute my game.
