L. SAFAROVA/V. Azarenka
  6‑4, 6‑3

Q.   How are you feeling?   You looked as if you weren't moving quite as well as you could?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I think it was quite obvious, you know, so it's been a long week for me.   It's been a lot of tough matches.   It's been a while since I had that many matches in a row.   Sometimes the body needs to get back into that rhythm and that's it.   It wasn't my best, but I tried my best.

Q.   I mean, was it just stiffness and tiredness?   It wasn't an injury? 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   No.   It was just a lot of tightness and not enough range of motion, definitely. 
Today she really played something that was really uncomfortable for me in my situation.   I tried to change.   I tried to do something different, but she was playing really well and really taking opportunities.

Q.   But generally you feel that you're obviously on the way back up?   It must be satisfying from that point of view.
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Definitely.   There's a lot of progress this week, a lot of good things happened, a lot of great matches, you know, especially that's what I was looking as many matches in a row to try to get used to that.   And I had a lot of great things actually this week that I can take and still keep working.   I'm still really motivated. 
Obviously disappointed for today, but I just have to move on quick.   There is going to be another tournament in a week, so I have to prepare for that.   But I can be satisfied with the progress that I made from, you know, a tournament before that.

Q.   This is the first time that Lucie has ever beaten you.   Can you talk a little more about her game and have you noticed a big improvement? 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   You know, it's a little bit difficult for me to judge her game.   I don't feel that I played the way I maybe usually would have played against her.   But I have to give her all the credit because she really stepped up and she found a way to win that match.   She's obviously been improving over the year before.   And she just served really well today, so that definitely was a big key that I couldn't turn around today.
