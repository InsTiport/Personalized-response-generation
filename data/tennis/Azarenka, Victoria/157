THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   That was a tough match.   How was it?   
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, yeah, it was a tough match.   Honestly, I don't think I could have asked for a better match to start after a break.   There was everything there.   A lot of up and downs and a lot of fighting.  
Obviously she's playing really good now.   She won a tournament.   It's a great test for me for the first match.  
I'm really happy the way I pulled it off.   It's a great platform to start improving and getting the preparation, more and more preparation for the next tournaments as well.  
   
 Q.   So what's going through your head?   You're up 5‑2 and you lost I think four games in a row or something.   What goes through your head?   
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I was just playing a little bit stupid, I think, and she definitely got loose, nothing to lose, and I kind of got lost in what I was doing and just made some easy mistakes and didn't really do much with it.  
But, you know, it happens after a long break.   You just need to feel competition.   That's what I was trying to feel today.   I'm glad I could stay tough in the end.   
   
 Q.   There was a moment there I went in to watch and it looked as if you were really heading for a really very forceful victory in the first set, and then suddenly it all seemed to go a bit wayward; then there was a very tense sort of tiebreak.   How did you feel at that point?   What were your impressions?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, I felt‑‑ as I said, there was a lot of up and downs.   You know, when don't play so much, you kind of lose that momentum of how to feel that momentum in the match.  
So I got a little bit relaxed, lost a little bit of focus, and in the tiebreak I just tried to find my game to find the solution to make things happen for me.  
Because I was just sometimes waiting too much for her mistake, and she obviously is not going to do that.   So I really had to take opportunities in my hands and try to make it.  
It worked out well for me when I tried to play my game.  
   
 Q.   There were a couple of moments when it looked as if you were really getting stuck in there, and then suddenly there would be a mishit.   Do you find that the conditions here are something you need to get used to, the altitude or the way the ball bounces?   Because you were going into the shot, and then suddenly you saw it going somewhere else and there was a little scream from you, like, Ah.   
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah, I don't know what it was.   Sometimes it's movement; sometimes it's a bad bounce.   There is nothing you can control.   It's the same conditions for everybody.  
I came here a little bit early and tried to get the feel, but there is nothing‑‑ you can practice a year or whatever.   It's not going to make a difference until you play a real match.  
That's what's good for me, to feel that environment in the match.   So we'll see how it goes.   I can only pick it up from here.   
   
 Q.   Recently there has been a bit of controversy with Sloane and Serena.   Don't know if you heard.   
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Uh‑uh.  
   
 Q.   Have you ever had any bad experiences around the locker room with players?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   With bad players?   
   
 Q.   With any players.   
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   No, not really.   I'm trying to be friendly and respectful with everybody.   We're all big family who travel all together.   You see all the girls pretty much every week, so, no, never had any problem really.
