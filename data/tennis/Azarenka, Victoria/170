      6‑1, 6‑1

    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   When you choose to receive, do you always do that or does is depend on the opponent and the situation?   Why do you do it?   At the start of a match when you win the toss, you choose to receive. 
    VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Oh, receive. 
    I don't know.   I just always been doing that.   It's not particular.   It's just how I feel.   I prefer to return.   If I get to choose to serve, it's not a big deal for me either. 
    Feels more comfortable for me. 

Q.   You said after the third round that you had to improve everything.   Did you improve everything or she didn't put up as much of a fight as Hampton?
    VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I don't know.   I mean, it's a different kind of match.   It's a different opponent.   So I don't really try to compare, you know, the outcome of what comes at me from another player. 
    But I felt like I was playing pretty good today.   You know, I was focused and in control from the beginning.   That was important for me.   I feel like I'm improving from match to match.   I just want to keep going the same way. 

Q.   Svetlana said in her interview she thinks you're calmer and more stable playing now. 
    VICTORIA AZARENKA:   That's good (smiling). 

Q.   Is that something you agree with?   If so, is it something you've been working on?
    VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah.   I mean, I grow, I mature a little bit.   I get a lot more experience over the years.   I tend to be, you know, a little bit more emotional before.   I just try to control my emotions much better. 
    It takes time to learn.   I've been doing it over last couple years.   But I'm always going to be an emotional player.   It's just the matter of how well you can control your bad emotions.

Q.   Is there anything in particular you found works keeping it in control when you're playing?
    VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I think you always adapt to a situation.   Sometimes you need to be more aggressive, more, you know, kind of pissed off a little bit, you know, to kind of pump yourself up.   Sometimes you just need to relax and breathe. 
    It's just a matter of adaptation and what situation you're in and try to figure out and find a way for you to feel the best way to be prepared for the next point.

Q.   How important is music in your prematch preparation?
    VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Very important.   If it's bad music, it's going to be a bad match.   So I really choose it very carefully.

Q.   What were you listening to today?
    VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I got the new mix, actually new song.   It didn't come out yet.   So I have a first hearing of it.   It's really good, called Sweet Baby, something like that.   I came up with the name.   I don't think it has a title yet.   It's just an amazing mix.   It's a remix of an old song.

Q.   Who is it by?
    VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Goon Rock.

Q.   Where are they from?
    VICTORIA AZARENKA:   They're a part of a LMFAO group, Party Rock Crew.   Yeah, he's a D.J.   He made this mix. 

Q.   Specifically for you?
    VICTORIA AZARENKA:   No.   I wish I would be that special. 

Q.   What else do you have on your iPod?
    VICTORIA AZARENKA:   A lot of different music.   I have a lot of Rihanna.   Every song, every album.   I'm a huge fan.   Some Russian music, some rock music.   I'm really interested in different kind of styles.   Depends on how I feel.   I also relate music to memories, to situations.   So it is very special for me.

Q.   What does it do for you before the match?   Is it something that helps you to focus or psych you up?
    VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Both.   Focus, pump you up, get your feet a little bit moving, kind of get excited.   So I kind of get in the zone, and that's it.   It just makes me feel good.   When I feel good inside, I love to go out there and do the best job as I can. 

Q.   I think you said you don't have a good singing voice, but your voice is in a Redfoo song, right?
    VICTORIA AZARENKA:   It's my grunt.   It's not my vocals.   I don't take high key or low key there.   It's just natural.

Q.   He laid that into a song?
    VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah.   I was a little bit shy and quiet, so you can only hear his voice there. 

Q.   Is it out yet, the song?
    VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Not yet.   It will be soon. 

Q.   Can you speak about your quarterfinal?
    VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I think it's going to be very tough match.   I can see Sveta came back much fresher, much stronger.   She knows how to handle big stages, big tournaments.   She's a Grand Slam champion, as well. 
    It's definitely an exciting match for me to be in.   I'm sure it's going to be really tough.   But, you know, I have to get ready and give my best. 

Q.   In what way are you a different player since you won here last year? 
    VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I don't think there's much, you know, difference.   It's all about, you know, just improving those little details.   You know, you try to get strong, faster, as always.   There's kind of improvement, and that's pretty much it. 
    But I think I've done pretty well.   I just need to keep up the same level and try to achieve a new one.
