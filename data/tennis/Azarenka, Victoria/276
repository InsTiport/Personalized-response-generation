 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. What's happen? What's happening second set, 2-0, breakpoint?   
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: I lost that game, and then I lost the set. That's what happened.   
  
  Q. You seemed to be frustrated at the umpire's call. How much does that distract you afterwards, and how important was that?  
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Well, you know, when you don't play your best and then you finally have a chance and you're up a break and you have another chance to break again and umpire comes and just shows you to a spot where is no mark or nothing at all and tells you that this is the mark, I think that's pretty bad ball.   
 I just don't know -- when I was already playing much better and everything, this thing happens and it takes me right from where I started.   
  
  Q. You've reached the semis here. How do you assess your overall clay court preparation ahead of the French?  
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Well, based on this tournament, I just played one of the good matches so far.   
 But I'm happy I went to the semifinals here. It's pretty big tournament. I hope I can be better to the French Open.
