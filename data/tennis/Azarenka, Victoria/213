THE MODERATOR:   Victoria is withdrawing from the tournament due to an injury in her left ankle. 
Any questions? 

Q.   Must be very disappointing for you. 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah.   Obviously very disappointing.   But, I mean, it's life.   It's sport.   I mean, I just have to take care of it and that's it.

Q.   Were you worried that you might cause more damage by playing here?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah, I mean, you know, last week it was already hurt in the semifinal, and in the final I tried to do everything, you know, to be able to play.   It took a lot of sacrifice by taking a lot painkillers, but apparently didn't get better. 
I had to adjust my movement, compromise in other parts of my body which started it hurt, and it's just too much of a risk.

Q.   Have you been told you need to rest for a period of time. 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah, I've been told that since Australian Open.

Q.   How long will you take a break now? 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, I take couple of days off just to see, and hopefully it will settled down for as long that I don't need to take a scan or anything.
But just need to have my peace of mind, and probably will still do the same just to make sure there is nothing really serious.   But it has to be taken care of right away. 

Q.   Have you been practicing?   Was the deciding point when you were practicing when it hurt too much here?   Did you speak to a doctor?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, I have my physio who travels with me all the time he obviously wasn't really positive after the final ‑ actually even before that about it ‑   but we never tried to think too much ahead.
Just taking it day by day and doing absolutely everything possible to be ready today.   I tried to hit yesterday, and I mean, it's just ‑‑ it was really clear that, you know, it's not really possible. 
But I still wanted to wait and maybe to get a chance, because I wanted to play until the last minute.   But, you know, there comes the point that you just have to make up your mind. 
That was the best solution and the best decision for me today.

Q.   What is it hardest to do:   run backwards and forwards, side to side, or any movement?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   It's kind of a movement, but more of the forward movement.   I have a bone bruise, so every time I put pressure on it's just painful. 
I don't know, I mean, I guess it's like any other part.   It just has to get a rest and heal.   By treatment maybe, you know, I also caused a little bit more pain because we tried to work on it.
But, I mean, it's just very difficult in day and a half to do a miracle.

Q.   Is there a prognosis as to when I it might clear up or what tournament down the line you might be able to play again?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Obviously next one is Indian Wells.   As I said, I will try to take few days to just let it settle.   Hopefully it'll get better, you know, to rest, because obviously it's needed.
As I said, I'm definitely going to try to do the ultrasound or scan just have to peace of mind.   Or if there is something that is worse, I have to take action.   I just take it first two days, three days to let it settle.

Q.   How many days you stay in Dubai here, or you just go?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I don't know.   I haven't decided yet.

Q.   You're not deciding to follow up the tournament?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, I'm a big tennis fan, but I think I need a little bit of time off tennis.   (Smiling.)

Q.   There are a few women players who have been injured at the moment:   Kvitova is not here; Li Na; one or two players.   Is that just coincidence, do you think, or is it because it's a difficult time of year? 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Um, I don't know what kind of injuries the other girls have.   For me, obviously I played so much, and it was an unfortunate situation what happened in Doha.
But maybe if I wouldn't have fell there I would be fine to play physically.   It's just something that really bothered me actually. 
I got a little bit of a cold, so sorry. 
But, I mean, it's just the game became so physical.   Sometimes it's really tough on the body week after week to play.   For example, these tournaments back to back with such a tough field, it takes a lot out of you physically.   It's just tough. 
With the Fed Cup, I mean, both of the girls played Fed Cup.   I couldn't play because I was really hurt after Australia. 
So it's a really tough schedule.

Q.   I think after Australia, Rafa said that he wasn't going to play for the whole of February.   Obviously Novak last year looked after his body very well.   Is that something that you would consider?   You've won 17 matches in sort of mid‑February.   Do you think perhaps in this year you need to be more, you know, more careful with your schedule, as it were, and take breaks when needed? 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, definitely I don't want to repeat the mistakes that I've done before when I was not 100%, not even 50%, and I went on the court and still tried and didn't do no good to the tournament or to myself. 
First of all to myself, to my health, just aggravate it all the time.   I think the health is the most important.   If I'm healthy I can produce good tennis.   For people it's good to watch.   When you go and you cannot play, I mean, I don't think the crowd can enjoy the match or something.
I mean, the health is the most important.   Tennis is my life, but I mean, after tennis there is still hopefully a long life to live.   I cannot jeopardize that. 

Q.   Last time we spoke to you you were talking about your mental improvements.   When you work on your physical injury, do you also work, you know, on your mind how to get through it?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah, I mean, you have to be patient, you know, because as I said, with health there is no really miracles.   You try to stay positive, because in the positive mode, I mean, the healing process always, I think, becomes better and faster.
But, I mean, there is not much you can do unless just be prepared and take care of.   I definitely need some time to get my mind off tennis a little bit and relax and spend some time with my family.   Just to at least go home.   I haven't been home since forever.
