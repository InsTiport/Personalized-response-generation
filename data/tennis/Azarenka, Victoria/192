 V. AZARENKA/S. Lisicki
  6‑4, 6‑2 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions in Chinese, please.   
   
 Q.   Actually, Lisicki is a very tough opponent.   Based on your performance today, it's very much easy to beat her.   So can you share your thoughts on your performance here today?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah, she's a very dangerous opponent.   I knew that, and so that was important to try to be focused right from the beginning to take control, not to let her into the game to start, you know, going for her shots, because she's kind of player that doesn't give much of a rhythm.   She likes to take control right from the very beginning.   
I felt like I played really well in the beginning and took all of my opportunities.   You know, I was maintaining from then a very high level.  
   
 Q.   I know the opponent is very much‑‑ it's end of the season.   Compared with what she performed before, what's the big difference before between her and the other opponents?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Was the question about Lisicki?   I didn't understand.   
   
 Q.   (Off microphone.)  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   The difference between the generations?   
   
 Q.   You entered...   
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   You mean when I started to play professional?   Yeah, yeah, yeah.   
I started to play full time on the tour when I was 16 years old, and I felt like I did a pretty good transition.   While I was playing junior tournament, I was already playing few challengers and like 50,000s and 25,000s, 75,000s to get my ranking up to try to get into qualifying of the Grand Slams, so that's where I started.  
The transition was not easy, you know.   I had to go through very tough losses, because in the juniors I was No. 1, I was winning pretty much, you know, all the tournament, especially that year, so it was a little bit tougher, you know, mentally to accept that.   
But I felt like I did a pretty good transition and got on the tour, on the roll pretty quick.  
   
 Q.   It's very much possible for WTA to control the screaming made by the opponents on the court.   There was an interview of Sharapova by Reuters, to see if she was going to agree to this control.   What's your opinion on this regulation posed by WTA?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, honestly I mentioned it before already, and I don't really know how it's going to happen, but it's going to be in the future.   It's not going to be concerning our generation.  
So it's a little bit difficult for me to judge, but I guess we'll see what happens.   I don't really feel there is something to comment before it actually happens.   You know, we can see the results from there.   
I understand there are few concerns about it, but in the near future, I don't see that changing too much.   
   
 Q.   You got the gold medal with Olympics doubles.   How did you keep that?   Did you carry the gold medal with you or probably keep it at home?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   You know, I actually always read about where all the athletes keep their medals.   They say somebody keeps it in a drawer, somebody keeps it, I don't know, in the safe or somewhere.  
I think I'll just keep it, you know, to myself where I keep it so nobody is going to steal it ever from me.   (Laughter.)  
I didn't carry it right after the Olympics.   My mom took it away to bring it back home because I went to travel to another tournament, and, you know, only few players started doing the tour with a gold medal, so it wasn't something we knew.   So I'll do it maybe later.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please.   
   
 Q.   Any thoughts on the press money for the Australian Open next year?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah, I actually just read the news today.   Any comments, we just have to be really happy about it, you know, and thank, you know, the players who helped make it happen in the tournament of course to increase the prize money.  
I mean, we are really lucky, and I'm really happy about it.   
   
 Q.   Novak said earlier that they're not satisfied with the results, wanting more reactions from other three Grand Slams.   So is there anything similar ongoing in the women's tour right now, you know, they want more money as well as men's tour?   
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I think everybody in general wants more money, not only in tennis.   (Laughter.)  
It's fair enough, but I feel like there has been already, you know, a step forward.   We can only make it better, and I think that's the plan from all the players to do that.   We have to be more united to make that, you know, bigger statement.   
I feel like the Grand Slams, the other ones, have to take a good example from what the Australian Open did.
