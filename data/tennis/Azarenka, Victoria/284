Q.  It was a good match.  Were you expecting such an easy victory?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  It wasn't easy that the score was.  It was pretty tough mentally.  But I felt very confidence.  I did the best I could. 

Q.  You were seeded No. 1 in the draw, so you were the favorite of the tournament. 

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  Yeah. 

Q.  Is it more difficult to win a tournament when you are the favorite?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  Maybe not because some player, they feel like pressure when you first seed.  But I didn't feel it, so I was confident because of the last week.  I won the tournament and I did pretty well.  I played good.  I played all my best shots.  I was confidence and comfortable on the court. 

Q.  Where do you live and where do you practice now?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  Originally I'm from Belarus.  I practice there.  Just after US Open, I started to practice in Spain, in Marbella.  Hofsas Tennis Academy. 

Q.  You have a Spanish coach?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  There is a German -- people from Germany there in this academy.  Also my coach who is with me here, he is German. 

Q.  And before going to Marbella, you were a little bit in Germany?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  No, no.  I wasn't.  I was practicing in Belarus and was living.  Now I living in Spain.

Q.  Like Safin, like Kuznetsova. 

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  Yeah. 

Q.  Conditions are much better, of course, to practice. 

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  Yeah, for sure. 

Q.  So you like clay courts?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  I was practicing on hard court because I was practicing for Australia, and I played only on hard court.  So I didn't try the clay courts yet. 

Q.  What are your strengths, your best shots?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  Really, I don't know.  I'm trying to approaching all the time, to attack, to come to the net.  This is I think my best game.

Q.  This is your best victory so far, your best success, winning this tournament?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  Yeah.

Q.  Because you are very young. 

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  Yeah, I was dreaming about it because before I played already two semifinals in Grand Slams.  I lost both of them when I had a match points.  This time when I played semifinals, I wasn't shaking, but I was thinking about not to this time.  And final, I was just relaxed, trying to do all my best. 

Q.  Where were those two semifinals?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  First one was Wimbledon and second one was US Open.

Q.  Were they both last year?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  Yeah.

Q.  Was the player you lost to in each of those here this year?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  Wimbledon I lost against Ana Ivanovic.  You probably know.  She played here.  US Open I lost against Michaella Krajicek.  She also played here and made one round.  They improved a lot.  I'm trying to do this, too. 

Q.  What is your goal for this year, playing only junior tournaments?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  No.  This year I think I will try to play more woman's tournaments and we'll see how it goes. 

Q.  How many are you allowed to play on the women's?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  It's a limit.  I have maybe 10 tournaments.  I'm not sure.  I don't know yet.  I play just once since my birthday, so I have like eight or nine tournaments more.

Q.  Which ones have you played so far?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  I played in Israel, 25,000.  It was in December.  I did pretty well there.  I made quarterfinals singles and semifinals doubles.  It was okay. 

Q.  How many junior Grand Slams have you played in?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  I played three.

Q.  This is the third?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  This is the fourth.

Q.  Have you talked about what it means to be No. 1 now?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  I was dreaming about this so much because I wanted to be No. 1 so much because two times I had these chances and I missed them.  Now when I did this, it's feeling, I can't explain it now. 

Q.  Is it as special as winning the title or they're both amazing?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  Sorry? 

Q.  Is it as good as winning the title?  Was it more than winning the title here?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  Yeah, it's prestige, I think, and it's much more points.  It's give a lot of confidence.

Q.  So it's a wonderful start for the year and the next step towards the pros. 

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  Yeah, it's a very good step.

Q.  Do you think it changes the way people see you, as well?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  Yeah, I think so.  But I think that so many people saw me because it's like I didn't play a lot of tournaments since US Open.  It was the first tournament.  And I think everybody was surprised because I improved my game a lot and I more tough now.  I think I'll try to do it better and better.
