  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Welcome back.   How are you feeling after so long off?   
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Feel good.   I'm really glad to be back playing, and can't wait to start the tournament and see where my game is at.  
You know, it's a very good place to start.   It's a very competitive field right away, so I'm glad to be a part of it.   It's a great preparation for the French Open.  
   
 Q.   Obviously there was a lot talk about the clay last year.   What are your thoughts on it now?   Is it better now that it's red?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, it's red, yeah, and it seems different.   I came a little bit early to get ready, to feel the surface, and I think it's in a great condition.   
Time to play some tennis out there.   
   
 Q.   I would like to know if you are happy about the way you're practicing these days?   
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I don't think I'm ever happy with the way I practice because I always try to do better.   But, I mean, I'm pretty happy overall, but it's good to have the mentality to try to improve every day.  
Then we'll see.   Practice is one thing.   For me, it's important how I feel during the matches.   So that's important to start, and kind of build up from there.   
   
 Q.   Is there something you are working on specifically in your practicing?   
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, I always work on all of my aspects of the game.   But clay definitely requires some special movement with the sliding, with the longer rallies, build up the point a little bit, try to be patient and work the court.  
So those little details, little adjustments, you always have to take into consideration.   
   
 Q.   Can I ask if you've got any special goals this year, or are you just taking each month bit by bit?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   The goals are always wherever you go try to win the most you can.   The big push is always the Grand Slams, but we have so many highâ€‘level tournaments, so many great tournaments to p.  
Clay is always a little bit more challenging for me as in the past, so it's my main priority right now.   
That's what I'm looking forward to.   
   
 Q.   How do you face your play with the new courts?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   New courts?   
   
 Q.   Yeah.   
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Oh, I think I prefer them better than last year.   I think they're adjusted really well.   The clay is red, so we'll see how it goes during the matches.  
During the practice, as I said, I came a little bit early to make sure I feel the surface, and it's pretty good.   
   
 Q.   The other day I saw an ad of you and it said something like the aim is just to hit the ball hard.   Does that annoy you because that's obviously not your game?   You have much more to your game than that.   
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   What?   
   
 Q.   There was an ad with you in it and it said, The goal is just to hit the ball as hard as possible.   
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I think it was a joke.   (Laughter.)  
   
 Q.   Just in general people tend to rag on women's tennis saying they just hit the ball hard.   Does that in general annoy you?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I don't think so.   We do try to hit it hard, but that's not all we do.   But there are just the style of few girls who have been showing some consistent result is the style of play, trying to be aggressive, so in one way you can see that, but I think there is so much more to women's game than just hitting hard.   
   
 Q.   If it's possible, this is a question nothing to do with tennis.   
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Okay.   
   
 Q.   Don't worry.   Which is your greatest fear?   Spiders?   The dark?   
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Oh, dark.   I hate spiders; I don't like dark, and I don't like snakes, any of those creatures.   
Heights.   Thank you.   Heights, yeah.   So, yeah, I'm a regular person.   I have some fears.  
   
 Q.   The worst?   
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   The worst?   Yeah, probably spiders and snakes.   One time I saw a spider on my wall and I just started to freak out.   (Laughter.)
