  THE MODERATOR:   Unfortunately Victoria had to pull out of the tournament with a right toe injury. 
We'll have some brief questions.

Q.   What exactly is the injury?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   It's the right toe infection.   It's been there for about ten days.   It's just been getting worse a little bit.
I had to take action on it, which I did yesterday.   Unfortunately I don't have enough time to recover to be able to play today. 

Q.   What action was that?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   It was a minor surgery.   I had to take something out of my toe. 

Q.   Which toe exactly?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Right toe.

Q.   Yes, but which toe?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Right big toe.

Q.   What kind of surgery was it?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I don't know in medical terms, but I had to get a piece out of my toe because it was jamming into me and got infected.

Q.   On the nail somewhere?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah.

Q.   So did they take the nail out?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   A piece of it. 

Q.   Ouch. 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah, it's something that's very just really unfortunate, but I had to do that. 

Q.   So was it something that was growing or something that just went into the toe?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   It was underneath.   You know, it was just jamming underneath into the skin.   I was trying to minimize the pain with taping and everything. 
Yesterday it got worse.   The day before I thought it was better, but yesterday got really infected and got really red, so we had to go and see the doctor.   He had to open it.   That's what I had to do. 

Q.   So did he call it an ingrown toenail? 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I don't know what it was.   It just got infected from a bad pedicure experience.   I had somebody who gave me infection.   Actually the doctor said it happens a lot.   Never happened to me, so it's something that I am definitely going to prevent for the next time.

Q.   Did you try and warmup with it today on the back courts? 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Oh, yeah.   I tried everything.   We tried medication with taping, and I was playing through the pain for quite a while. 
You know, it's just something that I had to do to make sure that I can be fully recovered and ready for Australian Open.   It's something that kind of compromise I had to take.
It's just very unfortunate timing, because I was really looking forward to playing and excited.   But I'm also quite happy I had two matches in already, which was kind of the point to come here and get some matches.
But, you know, the health is definitely something that's more important.

Q.   So the doctor told you it'll take three or four days to heal?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   He told me I won't be able to play three, four days.   Today I went to see him in the morning and he expected worse outcome.   It actually was much better than he thought. 
So maybe two days and I can start slowly, because it needs it heal.   Just hasn't been enough time for me to recover.

Q.   What does it mean for your Australian Open preparation then.   Will you be concerned? 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Wow, should I do that again so you can take a second shot?   What did I do?   (Laughter.)
Well, the preparation, you know, I have few days before that, and that was one of the things that I took my decision to make to yesterday it so I could have a longer time to recover.
Could be maybe waited for one or two days, but it would affect my preparation for the Australian Open.   So one or two days and I should be more likely ready to start my training.   It's just the wound needs to heal right now.

Q.   So you're not concerned that you might not be as prepared as you would like to be for Melbourne?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   No, I'm not concerned about that.   For me it's important that the procedure has been done and the worst already passed by.   Just needs some time to get it better. 

Q.   Are you taking antibiotics?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I have.

Q.   He prescribed that starting yesterday?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah, I think two days ago.   Yeah.   I'm not a fan of taking anything or any medicine.   I also tried that, but just to make sure that I have all the options and all the possibilities for me to perform.

Q.   So did he say when you were getting the pedicure that the person that was doing it cut you or something like that?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   They cut a little bit too much and it got infected.   And then from as much as we do, as much exercise, it's just been jamming into it and it's created an infection inside, created a little piece of nail to go in and always be hurting me.

Q.   First time you've had any kind of toe issue?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   First time, yeah.

Q.   You been able to speak to Serena at all?   Was she there when you withdrew? 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I haven't seen her yet because we have been trying figure out if there is anything we could do.   But I haven't.

Q.   You won the tournament here a few years ago.   Do you feel disappointed that there are 5,000 fans up there waiting the see the match of the tournament?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah very, very disappointed about that because I was really looking forward to it.   I tried really everything I could to make it happen.   I couldn't compromise my health. 
You know, we been talking to tournament director if there is anything I could do for the fans, just to talk to them.   I'm going to go on court and try to interact a little bit as much as possible.
But we have Australian Open, and hopefully maybe some of the fans that are here will be able to catch action in Melbourne.
