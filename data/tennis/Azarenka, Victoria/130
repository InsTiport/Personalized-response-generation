J. JANKOVIC/V. Azarenka
  6‑4, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   It seemed like you couldn't quite find your range out there.   Was that how it felt?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   There is a lot of things that didn't go well today, I think.   So to find one in particular would make it really difficult.

Q.   What's your assessment of the match?   Was it all coming off of your racquet, or was there something she was doing that was particularly effective?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, of course she was playing well.   I mean, I think she's playing her best tennis right now.   Really improved a lot throughout the year.
But I cannot sit and say that I played well and, you know, she was better today.   Of course she was better today, but, you know, I let a lot of balls go.   There was a lot of mistakes, small mistakes, a little bit bigger mistakes. 
But it was just so inconsistent, you know, the targets, that it's just doesn't work against top players.

Q.   Lack of match play since the US Open?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I don't know.   Lack of a lot of things.

Q.   Practice?   Well, you have been practicing, I would assume, the last ten days or so?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah.   It's hard, you know, sometimes to just keep it up, you know.   I think I have been pretty much the most consistent player the last two years, and, you know, sometimes things like this happen. 
It's just, you know, the bad road, and it's‑‑ you know, I have to go through that, because it didn't happen to me in a long, long time.

Q.   How do you get yourself out of that other than just ball striking?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, I have one more match, so, you know, for me, it's just going to be about that.   Then there is a break, and 2013 will be over for me.   So that's what I kind of have to deal with at this particular moment is just one more match.

Q.   So you sound a little mentally tired at this point of the season.   Is that fair to say?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Oh, yeah.   I think it's pretty obvious. 

Q.   Is it hard to sort of gather yourself for the last tournament here when also there is a break coming up that you really need?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah.   As I said, you know, it's been a long year.   It's been a tough year.   It's been tough two years, so that consistency I have been playing with, it's sometimes difficult to keep all the time. 
You know, everybody goes through tough moments in their career, and the important thing is how you come out of it.   You know, I just need to battle right now as much as I can. 

Q.   Is that sometimes one of the toughest things to play, the year‑end Championships?   Li Na earlier was saying it's hard, because she has her mind on vacation, to focus in on one of the biggest tournaments of the year, that there's nothing for you to play for here in terms of like ranking or things like that.   Is that one of the mental challenges of playing this tournament?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah, definitely it's tough, you know, in the end of the year to play against the best players, because every match you have to go and dig deep, and that's‑‑ you know, sometimes your motivation is not there enough to know the capacity how deep, how deep can you dig.

Q.   How are you physically?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I mean, it's tough for everybody.   I'm not going to sit here and say that I feel perfectly, but, you know, it's ‑‑you play back‑to‑back matches.   It's a little bit tiring, and, you know, all the things put together, it makes your body tired.

Q.   But what I mean is the injuries, you had to fight so hard to come back after Wimbledon, and then you got sick in Asia.   Is your body feeling well, or is it just a struggle to get yourself out there to play?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   It's, you know, just mentally tough right now.   Just, you know, tough to get things started a little bit.
