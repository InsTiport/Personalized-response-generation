 V. WILLIAMS/V. Azarenka
  6-3, 7-5 
   
  Q. What is the difference at the end of the match, because you led from 3-1 down?  
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Yeah, I led, but it was no break, you know. It was hard. Venus came off with some big shots, and, you know, I think overall the game was really good. Very high quality of tennis from both of us.   
 Just, you know, a little bit of bad luck on a few balls. But I'm proud of what I did today.  
  
  Q. Shame on that last point?  
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Yeah, there is nothing else you can do. You just have to accept that.  
  
  Q. She hits the ball hard, doesn't she?   
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Yes, she does.  
  
  Q. Was that the difference today? She's just got that extra bit of power in her serve and in her ground stroke?   
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: No, I don't think so. She was just, you know, making -- it's not about power. It's more about precision that she was making it on the lines close to the lines. There was more about that. I don't know.   
 I felt pretty comfortable there. You know but she played too good today.   
  
  Q. Do you feel you're closing up more and more on these Top-5 players?   
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Definitely. I think I changed my game a little bit. I became a better player, a more aggressive player, more tougher player to beat.   
 You know, I'm very proud with the work I'm doing, and just for me it's just extra motivation to go back and try a little harder. Because I'm enjoying tennis so much like I never did in my life before.   
  
  Q. You said you didn't think it was a question of power today, but is there anyone who hits the ball harder than Venus in the women's game?   
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Well, serve, probably not. I mean, Serena also gave me a 200 in Australia. It's actually pretty painful if you don't hit it right (laughing). But, you know, that's their big strength, you know, the serve. What can you do? You just try to work and get the same. Thank you.
