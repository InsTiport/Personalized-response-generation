THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Was that more of a workout than you wanted in your first match back?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   No, that's exactly what I wanted.   I wanted to have a competitive match.   I wanted to test myself, you know, to play for a long time, see how my body is going to react.  
So, you know, I didn't expect an easy walk‑through.   That would be silly to do that.   But, yeah, I'm pretty pleased with what happened.   
Obviously, you know, the result is a result, but that's a beginning.   It's a starting point.   I think there is a lot of positive things that I can take from what happened today.  
   
 Q.   You're happy with the way you competed, obviously?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah.   I mean, I don't think you kind of lose that competitiveness.   I think you can lose a little bit of desire or something, but I definitely don't lack any of that.  
So, you know, it is what it is.   It was, as I said, it was important to see where I'm at and what things you can work on is the best thing to get from the match.  
   
 Q.   So what do you think you need to work on now?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   A little bit of timing, reaction, you know.   That's what you miss a little bit when you don't compete is to get that ‑‑not even movement.   It's just, you know, the reaction of the ball and where to go, quick decision‑making.   I think that's important, especially on grass.  
The rest is just a routine, you know, to go through that, to go through some mistakes, some, I don't know, some things, you know, that you just have to go through to learn how to play better, how to feel better.  
   
 Q.   Because grass is such a specialized surface, is it the most tricky, you think, to come back to having been out of the game for as long as you have?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   It could be, but it's not so many long rallies, so I don't know (smiling).   
It is tricky.   I think it's tricky, anyway, if you come back or you don't come back.   It depends how you adjust and how you accept that challenge.  
But for me it was the most important thing from today that I was there playing and I was healthy, so that's great news.   I can only get better from here, because, you know, that's it.  
   
 Q.   You've got one of the biggest tournaments of the year up next.   Would it be good to have another slightly smaller tournament to work your way back, or are you happy to go into the Grand Slam?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   You know, I think that's a very silly question because you don't have any more tournaments, so you've just got to go with it.   That's what I have.  
So the important thing is that I got one match, at least one match under my belt.   I tested myself in competition, and that's what I came here for.   So we'll see how it goes.   
I have a few days to work on things that, you know, I took out from today.   We'll see how it goes.  
   
 Q.   Is feeling confident a big part of recovering from an injury?   Your foot is okay now?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah, that feels great, you know, to know that I'm able to move how I want and not have my face like this (flinching) every time I step.   So it's good.  
   
 Q.   What were you particularly happy about in terms of like specific things in your game today that maybe exceeded your expectations or surprised you that you were able to do?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I was really happy that I was there, you know, for every single moment, for every single ball.   I felt that my level of concentration was really high.   You know, as the timing as mistakes, it all I think was expected.   I just have to get into that rhythm.  
But I felt I was handling myself really well today.   That gives me good confidence going, you know, moving forward, that that's where I'm starting from and that's how I need to work really hard.   
I'm up for that challenge.   I love working hard.   I love to accept challenges.   It's all good for me.  
   
 Q.   What are your expectations now going to Wimbledon?   Are you looking forward to just getting the match play done and as far as you go that's great, or do you still have that desire to pull off an amazing run and win Wimbledon?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I always want to win.   You know, it doesn't matter.   I'm always gonna believe that I can win.  
I'm just being very realistic in the way that I need to work every day and give my best every day, so the result is the outcome of the hard work and what I put into it.  
So what I can ask from myself and expect from myself is giving my 100% every day.  
   
 Q.   You had a horrible fall last year.   Does that play into your mind going into Wimbledon this year?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   No.  
   
 Q.   What will you do between here and Wimbledon?   Will you go straight up there today?   
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah, I'm going to go straight to London and practice.   What else?   Hopefully not sit under the rain.
