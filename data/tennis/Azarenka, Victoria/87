S. WILLIAMS/V. Azarenka
  3‑6, 6‑2, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.

Q.   How did you feel about that?   It was obviously a high‑quality match. 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I can't lie and say that I'm not disappointed because that's I think a normal reaction of having to lose just a match right now.   But, you know, it is what it is.   It was a high‑quality match. 
I can't say I went out there and didn't play well.   We just saw today why Serena is No.1.   I haven't seen her play like this, honestly, even the last matches before that.

Q.   What did you feel was the difference?   You mentioned that's why Serena has done what she's done in the game.   What is that kind of quality?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Did you see the 24 aces?   That's pretty good.   That's pretty good.   It's almost a set of aces.   So that was a big difference.   There was only one break in the third set, and it made a difference. 

Q.   How do you feel about your own form?   You seem back to nearly where you were when you won the Australian Open twice.   Do you feel a little bit more to get to Serena's level?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I feel much better than I was ever before.   I don't think I've ever played that high quality of tennis with my game still coming together.   That's what is promising.   That's something that still keeps me excited, you know, and motivated to go work harder. 
You know, something like this, what happened today, is just a great lesson that I'm going to take and going to go back to work harder because, you know, it's inspiring.   It really is inspiring.   I love to be pushed that way.   I love that challenge. 

Q.   You know when you're playing her, she's probably going to lift her level.   Did she surprise you at all today at her highest points or not?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I think we put on a great show together really.   I think it's been a while since there was that high quality of women's tennis. 
I wasn't surprised because I know she's going to do everything to win there, and I was just trying to stay focused and apply my game.   But, you know, she really stepped it up at really key moments.   I just had to go, I just had to fight through. 
You know, as I said, I'm going to learn from it.   Always every match, it's not in my favor, but there's something I can take out of.   I'm the type of player that will never give up on that, and I will find a way. 

Q.   Can you say it even a little bit further.   There were breathless points out there, athletic, corner to corner.   What went through your mind as you saw the level get so high?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I think once you're in it, you don't really think about how great of a level it is.   You don't try to get surprised by that, you're just trying to stay in the moment and really focus on your executions. 
But when everything I see is the ball.   I don't even really see my opponent.   I just try to see the ball.   That's what's important. 
You know, some serves went right past me.   I was like, Wow.   That was pretty quick. 

Q.   You said you're the type of player that's not going to give up, try to find a way to beat Serena Williams.   What do you do now?   Do you go back and look at the video, take lessons from that?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I will do anything I can, anything, to be able to not just beat Serena, but to win Wimbledon.   I will do anything to win Grand Slams. 
I'm going to work hard.   This just gives me extra motivation.   Something that I look and I see that somebody's raising the level, and that's where I want to get to.   To be able to raise my level even higher against top opponents. 

Q.   We saw in the final set, even when you were 3‑Love down, you were pumping yourself up.   Did you sort of still believe there was a way back?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah, of course.   And I almost had it.   I had chances to get that break back. 
I'm going to fight until last point, until I have a chance, until they call it game, set, match, I'm going to try.   I think that's been kind of my trademark. 

Q.   The problem you were worried about before the tournament, did that pose any problem to you during the tournament?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, it's something I have to monitor.   I just can't use something like this as an excuse, and I won't.   But I'm feeling much better than I would say I was feeling couple months ago.
What's great for me is that I'm able to be consistent more and more with my level, and I'm getting back into a better shape than I ever was. 
You know, it's a good step forward here.   It's a good step forward. 

Q.   The crowd was reacting to both your sounds and Serena's sounds.   I don't know if you noticed that.   When Serena raises her volume on big points like that, are you aware of that or you don't even hear her?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   You know, I'm so tired of these questions all the time.   It's so in a way annoying because guys grunt.   I was practicing next to Nadal, and he grunts louder than me, and nobody notice that.   Why?   I don't understand why.   Because the women on the court both trying their hardest and giving everything they have, and they make a noise.   Is that a problem of tennis? 
It happens in every sport.   So I think maybe it's time to just put it aside and not talk about it all the time because this is not what is important when there are two players playing on the Centre Court.   We got to look a little bit past that and see, Oh, my God, Serena played 24 aces.   Did any of the guys do maybe in that match? 
Look at the good stuff.   Stop bringing this ridiculous stuff.   Let's put aside the noise and how she looks, and look at the game.   The game proved itself today. 

Q.   I appreciate what you're saying, but did you find it distracting from the crowd?   They were actually laughing during points.   I think it was directed at both you and Serena.   They're laughing while the point is being played.   Did you find that distracting?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I think they might have had a little too many of Pimm's or whatever.   When people are drinking, every time the announcer say, Make sure you hydrate yourself, I think he means with water, not with alcohol. 
So if they were laughing, that means in a way we put on a good show.   For me, it doesn't matter.   I'm there to play my best and try my hardest, and that's what I'm going to do.   That's what Serena does.   That's what every other woman out there is doing. 

Q.   The hug that you shared with Serena at the end of the match, was that in part recognition for the high standard of the match?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I have a lot of respect for Serena.   We have a great friendship off the court.   You know, once the match is over, we put it out a long time ago.   We're going to put it out all on the court.   She played a great match and I respect that. 

Q.   How does it work in terms of that set‑point call in Paris which you were not happy with?   Are you upset about that for a few hours?   Does it still piss you off?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   When I looked on the video, yeah, it does piss me off.   But I had to let it go and I did once I left Paris.   I'm not going to think about it because it's the past.   I never look what happened yesterday really. 
I probably going to think about the match today for a few more, learn from it, and let it go, 'cause I got to move on.

Q.   Serena doesn't like to talk about the Grand Slam she's going for, a chance to win all four.   From your perspective, what do you make of what she's trying to do, what it would be like if you were to play her at the US Open trying to stop her from getting all four?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, if I'm on the other side of the net, it will not bother me that she's going for history, I'm going to try to win. 
You cannot deny the incredible achievement that she has.   I always wish her luck.   But I'm not going to wish her luck when I'm on the opposite side of the court. 

Q.   If you had to give one tip to Maria Sharapova facing Serena Williams in the next round, what would it be?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   If I had one, I would have used it today, trust me.
