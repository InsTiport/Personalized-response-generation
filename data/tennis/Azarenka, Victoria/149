  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Since the injury, can you just describe what happened the past couple of days?   What's going on?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, I mean, it was pretty obvious it was a very bad fall.   I tried to stay optimistic as possible.   Went to get an MRI, and I thought there was hope for some good news because MRI didn't show something really torn, something extreme.   So that was a small positive note on that. 
But in the other way, didn't show very promising near future for me.   So we tried to do everything as possible, but it was just very significant fall.   To recover in two days after that seems impossible with the compensation on the entire body by finishing that match.
The injury maybe takes 48 hours gap, and 48 hours just made it worse.

Q.   It's torn?   It's a strain?   Do you know exactly what it is?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I forget the medical term.   It's something with a bone bruise.   It's kind of a bone bruise. 
I'm sorry, I'm just not sure of the medical term.   The tendon and the ligament was not hurt, which as I said was a positive news. 
But the rest, no. 

Q.   How long will you be out now? 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I don't know.   I'm going to do more examination right now.   It was very difficult to kind of accept that.   Just a bad luck.   Really bad luck.

Q.   When did you decide to give up?   When did you know that you were not going to play today? 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, before I tried to practice today a little bit to see if it's going to warmup or with the treatment get better.
It just didn't; just got worse.   So today, I mean.

Q.   We keep seeing pictures of people falling.   Is there anything different with the courts this year?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   You know, I'm wondering the same question, because the court was not in a very good condition that day.   I mean, my opponent fell twice; I fell badly; there were some other people who fell after.
So I don't know if it's the court or the weather.   I can't figure it out it.   Would be great if the club or somebody who takes care of the court just would examine or try to find an issue so that wouldn't happen.
Because on something like this, there is nothing I could have done, you know, to make that better.   There is nothing I've done wrong that cost me to just withdraw from Wimbledon. 

Q.   Did the ball bounce any differently? 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I don't think so.   Not really sure. 

Q.   What was bad about the condition of the court?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Slippery.   It was slippery.   Obviously I slipped. 

Q.   The foot injury earlier this season, now this.   Mentally I guess it's frustrating and tough at the moment. 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Very tough.   I mean, I couldn't be any more disappointed.   Wimbledon is just a tournament I was looking so forward to.   I love playing here. 
To not be able to kind of play just because of something with such a bad luck is very, very frustrating.   I couldn't be more disappointed.

Q.   Did you feel in shape to be winning the tournament as well? 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I think so.   I was playing well.   I started my first match well.   I mean, the game, I wasn't so worried about that.   I think I did very good preparation.   I was in shape and everything. 
But as I said, I couldn't prevent something that happened.

Q.   Now where are you going?   Are you staying here?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   As I said, I need to do furthermore examination, because my body had to compensate a whole lot after that fall.
From there I will see where is the best place for me to recover.   That's going to be the main priority right now.

Q.   You said you were frustrated with the condition of the court.   Did you speak to the club and let your concerns be known? 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I mean, I didn't say that, frustrated with the court.   I think there might be a cause ‑‑ as I said, there's something that could be looked into.
I cannot take out my frustration on the court or something because it's out of my hands.   It's something that maybe can be looked in the future. 

Q.   How do you get past this mentally?   How do you get over the disappointment?   How do you regroup and come back from this?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   You know, right now I don't see anything positive as of today because I'm disappointed extremely. 
But there is positive news.   I'm pretty lucky that what happened to me is not critical.   Could be, because after the fall the doctors saw and they are surprised that I'm even able to get up.
So I guess that's one of the positive things that I can look up to. 

Q.   Did they tell you how long before you could be back out? 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   No.   I don't know yet.

Q.   Grass court is your biggest fear now? 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   My biggest fear is heights, not grass court or anything else. 
And spiders.   So...

Q.   Your hip too, or just the knee?   I heard your hip was maybe injured at the same time. 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   As I said, there has been compensation, because when I fell I had tremendous pain in my knee, and from stopping and loading I had to use my hip and my back.
So with that it's just the whole body has been compensating. 

Q.   Have you seen the video yourself?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I have.   Couldn't miss that.   It was on TV about hundred times.
