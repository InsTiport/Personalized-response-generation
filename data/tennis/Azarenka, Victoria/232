V. AZARENKA/A. Radwanska
  1‑6, 6‑3, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Good way to start the new season.   How do you feel? 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Feel very good.   I mean, I'm glad I have a lot matches, you know, in this tournament.   It seems like my work during off‑season is paying off, so I'm glad with that.
I'm still looking for improvement, as always, but it's a good start definitely.

Q.   Coming back from a set down make the win feel more special? 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah, definitely.   I mean, the way I started to play, I was a little bit off, I think.   You know, I was missing my shots. 
But she started really well.   As I said, it was completely different game from yesterday, so I didn't really adjust too well in the beginning. 
But I'm glad I could fight through my mistakes today and through the slow start and finish really strong.

Q.   Li Na played a great match, as you did today.   You guys played three times last year and you split those.   What do you think of her going into the final?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I think she showed some excellent fighting spirit as well today really coming back.   They had tough match also with tough wind conditions, as we did.
But, I don't know.   She's very tough opponent always.   She's obviously playing great in Australia for last couple of years. 
I'm looking forward to a final.   It's a great opportunity to get the last challenge before the tournament.   It's a final.   Anything can happen.

Q.   Do you have any memory of playing her at the Australian Open last year?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Oh, no.   That was terrible memories.   You want to forget that.   (Laughter.)

Q.   Would it have been nice to have a rematch with Petra?   Do you ever prepare for someone else? 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I didn't think about it when they were playing, because I still had to win my first match.   And by the I played the first set, I could have been catching the flight to Melbourne today.   So I was really trying to focus on my game. 
I mean, Li Na played a better match, so she deserves to be in the final, I guess.   For me, doesn't matter who to play, as long as I'm out there in the final myself. 

Q.   You won Brisbane in 2009; you've got a good relationship with Australia.   Where do you think you made your improvements? 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, Australia is just a beautiful country and a very nice atmosphere to play here.   I love coming here every time. 
I don't know.   I been trying to improve every aspect of my game really.   I'm a perfectionist, so I really try to get better with everything.
I think I improved my fitness a lot.   I improved my game.   You know, I tried to add a few new things.   You know, I don't know.   Just always try to get better. 

Q.   What's the one thing about Li Na that sets her apart from other players?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, she's a great ball striker, really clean.   She has that heavy shot, so you really have to try to hang in there and try to apply pressure, because she does it really well. 

Q.   Do you think the way you played her last year in Istanbul and the week you had will help your confidence coming to this match tomorrow? 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Um, I don't think it's really related much.   I always take every match as a new match.   Doesn't really matter what happened in the past, because everybody tries to get better, you know, and tries to make adjustments, especially when they lost the last match.
So I don't know.   I think Li Na is very strong.   She's very tough opponent always.   So we'll see.   I'm just going to have to try my best.
