  6-4, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. I wasn't out on court, but just looking at the speed of your match, looked like it went pretty easy for you. 
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Well, it was over one and a half hours, so it wasn't really fast. It was a tough match. It was a lot of long points, so, I mean, for me, I felt it was a pretty tough match.
 I like the way I handled the score. 

 Q. Thoughts on tomorrow's match in terms of how big it is for you. 
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: For me, just a normal match as today. Third round, so I'm just gonna get ready the same as I got ready today.

 Q. Have you gotten more comfortable playing against highly-ranked players? You've had quite a bit of success against players in the top 10 this year. 
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: I mean, if you go far in the tournament you're obviously gonna play somebody from the top 10. This year I've been doing some good results in the tournaments and had to play a lot of top 10 players. 
 I had good and bad results against almost all of them this year. 

 Q. Say compared to earlier in your career, did you get maybe less nervous in those types of the matches than you might have before? 
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Well, I don't really get nervous much in the matches. For me, it was just -- all the other years it was kind of first on tour and I was getting a lot of experience.
 Now I know how to play better in these matches, how to handle myself better in these situations.

 Q. Is there anything you're learning about the courts here as far as how they play? 
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Well, normal hard courts. Just have to adjust your game with the humidity and everything.
