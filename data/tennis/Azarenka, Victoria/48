THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How did you feel out there today?  What were you not pleased with or pleased with?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA: Out there, I mean, depends when I was feeling what.  I think I started off pretty well.  You know, the first set I had way too many opportunities to miss, you know.  Unfortunately was not doing the right things in the important moments.   
It was too many wrong decisions, a little bit too many unforced errors, especially in the tiebreak.  It was a little bit of a giveaway, I think, which not happy with.  I mean, who would be?   
The losses are never pleasant, but the important thing for me is to learn from that and build from here.  But, you know, if I was satisfied with that, might as well not play.   
 Q.  How do you think you'll look back on your first major with Leo?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA: I'm not happy with my play.  If I'm going to look back in whatever years being here for the first time with Leo, I probably won't think about what happened today and just I remember the experience of what I had here.   
 Q.  How would you describe that experience?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA: It's fun.  I mean, it's much more fun than being by yourself.  With my family, you know, it's whole other soul, soul feeling than you just come here and I don't go to empty house after my loss and just cry there.  I go home and spend time with my son.  Regardless if I won or lose, he's still gonna smile when he sees me.   
 Q.  On the match today, were there adjustments that she made that kind of frustrated you towards the end, or was this kind of on your racquet and you just felt like you didn't execute the way you wanted to do?  That it wasn't as much about her but it was about what you were doing?  How do you gauge that?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA: Well, Simona is a player that she's not gonna give anything away.  She's gonna bring the ball back.   
But I felt that in the moments that counted, that I did things wrong today, really.  You know, unforced errors, that is not something that another player did.  It's more on your racquet.  I think that I just did a lot of wrong decisions.   
But, you know, I'm not gonna sit here and not give her any credit, because she's the type of player that makes you do all those things.  I felt that I was in control, and I honestly felt that I let it go.   
 Q.  Do you feel she's a different kind of player from the last time you played her?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA: No.   
 Q.  Do you feel you're still not match tough to get through?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA: Match tough enough?  That's a tough one to swallow right here.   
 Q.  It's only one tournament.  
VICTORIA AZARENKA: Yeah, but no, it's more about just making sure that you -- I felt very indecisive in the important moments.  Match tough, I think, is a different word.   
 Q.  I was meaning like the more matches you get to play, the more experience of those big points, picking the right decision on the big moments?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA: Yeah, definitely.  That's something that I need to work on.  I have all the shots there.  Sometimes too many options.  I just need to make it a little more simple for myself.   
 Q.  After 10 days like this, do you feel your body, how is it feeling?  How did it react to the whole tournament?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA: It feels great.  I played more matches than in the last 15 months or so, and I'm ready.  Physically I'm ready.  I just need to bring all my things together, and today they were not there.   
 Q.  What do you take back with you to the practice courts after Mallorca and now here in terms of, like, seeing your game in competition as opposed to on the practice court?  What do you take now back to the practice court?  Like this is pretty good, I'm happy with where this is at and this is where we kind of need to hone things?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA: Just make right decisions.  All my shots are there.  I can make a shot from anywhere on the court.  I just need to make the right decisions when it's time.   
And I think this will help me today.  This painful loss will help me.   
 Q.  What doubts, if any, did you have about how you would be playing when you returned after having Leo?  And what answers have you given yourself?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA: I don't really have doubts in myself and how I'm going to play.  I think the only thing I was wondering is, am I going to play the way I know I can play this moment or I still need time?  You know, a match like today just gave me a good understanding that I still need a lot of work.  I mean, a lot.  I need work to do.  Yeah.   
 Q.  In light of that, is it a good thing there is now kind of a bit of a break before the North American hard courts or would you rather turn around more quickly and get back to competition?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA: I don't really care.  Obviously I would rather still be playing here.  But whatever happens, I'm just going to try to live in the moment.  I don't think if it's better or worse.  I'm just going to prepare myself for what's next.
