  V. AZARENKA/C. McHale  6-3, 6-2   THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   Q.  Got off to a bit of a slow start, but found your rhythm and steamrolled from there.  Talk about your match, how you were able to turn things around.  VICTORIA AZARENKA: I think she started really well.  I felt like I was a little bit, you know, watching too much and not aggressive enough.  But she really picked her targets and went for her shots. It took me a little bit of time to get into the rhythm.  And, you know, conditions weren't really easy.  I think also I needed a little bit of a moment to adjust. But in the next match I've got to be able to do that earlier.  But I'm glad I was able to turn things around and I stayed in the moment and really was working my way through and trying to find the rhythm and trying to find the game that I was playing. When things turned around, I really felt like I stepped it up and kept my composure.   Q.  Sometimes early, particularly in a Grand Slam, a two week tournament, is it you're struggling and find your way to do what needs to be done as the tournament goes on?  VICTORIA AZARENKA: I think you never know what's better.  I think it's a matter of trying to make the best out of every day and try to improve.  You know, in the end of the day is just try to give your 100% every day, your best. To play easier or tougher match, what's easier, I think it all comes in the end of what you want to achieve, you know.  Sometimes it works for you; sometimes it doesn't. In terms of physical condition, I feel fine.  I don't care how long I need to play.  I'll be ready for the next match.   Q.  Because of the injuries you had this year it was difficult to build any momentum, I assume.  Do you feel like you're building something here?  Does it feel like last year, for instance?  VICTORIA AZARENKA: It never will feel like last year.  It doesn't even feel like yesterday to me (smiling).  You know, it's as simple as that. I never look back at what happened.  I think that's the right attitude, because that's what keeps me looking forward toward my goal. I think the momentum is not just from here just because I win two matches in a row or whatever.  It started from when I actually started to play, you know, back in Eastbourne. So it's all the progression.  It's always going to take time to rebuild, you know.  I feel like I'm improving from day to day.  I play much better than I played a month ago. So that's important.  And I'm trying to pick it up and work hard, you know.  I'll go practice after my match.  I'm really in the process right now. As many matches as I can play, I'll play.  Whatever it takes.   Q.  McHale seemed aggressive the first three games and then was back behind the baseline.  Did you see that and take advantage of it?  VICTORIA AZARENKA: What?   Q.  She seemed to be playing especially aggressive and then was forced back.  Did you notice that?  You were 24 and 24 on net points.  VICTORIA AZARENKA: Well, that could be two reasons for that.  It could be that I was too far back at the beginning and then I started to play better and I pushed her back, or just because she thought, Hey, let me just back up. I'm not sure what she's done.  I just want to speak about myself. I felt like at the beginning I was just not executing with the same conviction as I should have, and then I just started to be more aggressive and more taking my chances, more putting pressure on her. I think that's what made her back up a little bit.   Q.  How do you assess your kind of feeling, your outlook going into this tournament?  Everybody says you want to play one match at a time.  VICTORIA AZARENKA: That's what it is.  I don't favor.  I don't expect.  I just play.  That's what's important.  I want to fight and I want to fight my hardest and I want to play, because I enjoy playing.  The rest is not important to me.   Q.  Roger Federer going for his 18th major; Serena Williams going for her 18th major.  They seem so different.  What similarities are there, if any, that you can determine from having played Serena and having watched Roger in their games and the way they conduct themselves on the court?  VICTORIA AZARENKA: I think what's similar is the numbers only, really.  You know, they have completely different careers, completely different personalities, I would say, completely different game style.  There's nothing to compare. I think they are both such amazing players, and just to talk about that they are both going for 18 Grand Slams is really remarkable.
