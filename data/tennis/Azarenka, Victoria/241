   THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
  Q. Looked like you were struggling with maybe energy level or something towards the end of the match. Can you talk about that a little bit?  
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: No, I just wanted to finish as quick as possible and get ready for tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Are you concerned about your energy level right now like in terms of going into tomorrow's semifinal?  
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: No, I'm not concerned. Tomorrow is another day. I'm going to be prepared completely different than I was for today's match.   
 Today was more practice. I wasn't playing against Marion Bartoli. I was just trying to do my thing.  
  
  Q. So you're playing Vera tomorrow. Do you want to talk about that matchup a little bit?  
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Yeah, it's gonna be tough match, for sure. You know, she's been showing some great tennis here.   
 Well, it's down to last two matches, so just have to, you know, really step it up and play the same way I played my first two matches.  
  
  Q. You have a chance to pick up the No. 2 ranking over the weekend.   
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: I don't care about that right now.
