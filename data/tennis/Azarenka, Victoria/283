Q.  Congratulations.

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  Thank you.


Q.  Did you think you had her you broke at 2-All?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  No, I knew she would be fighting to the last point.  And then she was serving very good that games.  And I was still in the game, and I didn't think it was match.  I was just trying to hold my serve and try to break her again.  But she was serving really good.


Q.  You won the Australian Open earlier this year.  How different is this from winning in Melbourne?  Is it a different feeling?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  In Melbourne it was first time and it was like, I don't know, I didn't know what I was feeling.  I can't tell you.  It was long time ago (laughing). But this time is also I'm really, really happy because I wanted so much to win this Grand Slam.  Because last year I had opportunity to win it also.  I had matchpoints in semifinals and I missed it.  And this year I did it, and I'm really, really happy about it.


Q.  Today in the New York Times there was an article about the role of the parents, the six players here in the finals the at the US Open.  What is your relation with your father and mother and those behind you?  Are they very close to you?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  My parents?


Q.  Yes.

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  Here's only my mother.


Q.  Yeah.  Your mother is always --

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  Yeah, she doesn't travel with me so much.  But she came here, and I'm really glad to see her here.  She always supporting me mentally, and she always calling me. And my friends, too.  (Inaudible), the wife of him.  He was here also.  They were also supporting me here.  I really appreciate it.


Q.  How do you pronounce your name?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  Az-aren-ka.


Q.  You always stay in Marbella?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  No, I don't practice there anymore.  I changed to practice with new coach.  I was practicing before in Saddlebrook, just before, like two weeks before US Open.  And before I was in a resort or two practicing with the same coach.


Q.  What is the name of the coach?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  Adam Alcschuler and I can't tell you the name.  Antonio "VonGosen" or something (laughing).  I can't tell you the name.  It's too difficult name. There is two coaches, and another one I can't tell you (laughing).


Q.  I see that your favorite player is Guillermo Coria, is that right?  It is written on the ITF notes.

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  No, I don't know.  Maybe my mom did this (laughter).  My mom said this.


Q.  It's strange to say your favorite player would be an Argentinian player.

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  My favorite player from womans, been from when I was a kid, it's been Steffi Graf.  It's always been my favorite player. And now I know it's Federer.  I don't know no one who doesn't like him so... And I really like the people like who's playing my style and like attacking everything.  Is like Williams sisters and Sharapova and a lot of other players like who's playing the attack game.


Q.  Describe to us the feeling when you had that dropshot in the last point and you ran.

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  I was running for it to hit it as fast as I can and to win this, like to make the winner.  That's what I was running for. And then I was like, I just -- I didn't know what to do.  I was thinking about a lot how to make -- what to do after I win, if I will win.  And then I just forgot what I wanted to do.


Q.  You've already played some professional tournaments.  Can you compare pro tournaments with the junior tournaments.

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  It's a little bit -- always a little bit different because pros, they are always more tough mentally.  They playing every point, never give up. So, I mean, it was very good experience.  I had a lot of good matches and I beat a few Top 100 players.  Was great experience.  And come back to Juniors, it was very nice. Now I will try to play all pro tournaments, and we'll see how I do in it.


Q.  Is this your last junior tournament then?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  Not actually.  Actually, I will play one more tournament in Japan.  Osaka, this one I will play.  I got invited there, and just I will go and play there because I will play a tournament before there, before the pro tour, pro tournament.  And then I'll go and play junior tournament.


Q.  You played Alexa last year.  You said yesterday that she is a much better player now.  Did you see evidence of that on the court today?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  Yeah, she started to serve much harder, more placement and everything.  She was serving very good.  And she use the slices unbelievable.  She goes for deep and very low. She's more fit now, I think.  And she's got a lot of experience, I mean.  Because doesn't compare, final of US Open and third round of Canadian Open.  So it's different.  Different, I think, different thinking and preparing for the match.  This is how it was, I think.


Q.  How did you counteract the slice?  How did you try and make sure that that wasn't a difference in the match?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  Yeah, I was working on it in the warm-up.  I was doing it and I was just trying to attack every ball, you know, to let her play her game, not to let her play like very deep slice and come into the net.  I was just trying to attack every ball.


Q.  What is your record against Polish girl Radwanska, who won Wimbledon, or another Polish from Denmark, Caroline Wozniacki?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  What is my what?


Q.  What is your record against them?  Did you play with them?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  No, I didn't -- I never.  No, I never played them, I guess. No.  I only played doubles against Radwanska.  Maybe future Williams sisters (smiling).


Q.  You won here and in Australia.  What is your favorite surface?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  The tournament in Australia was different because was Rebound Ace. Yeah, I like hard court.  I mean, I'm trying to get used to every surface.  Just working, preparing to every surface.  So the hard court I really like.  I mean, yeah, I like.


Q.  How will you celebrate?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  I think I'll go shopping.


Q.  In Manhattan?

VICTORIA AZARENKA:  Everywhere (smiling).
