THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How does it feel to lift your second trophy here in Doha?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   It feels incredible.   You know, this tournament is really great.   I mentioned this so many times.   It had such a strong field going into it, and I'm really glad that in the end of the week I'm the one who's holding the trophy.  
I played really well this entire week.   It's never easy to play five matches, you know, every day with, you know, the best players in the world.  
I'm glad I was really consistent, achieved my goal.  
   
 Q.   She saved the first match point at 5‑2.   Tell us about the pressure you felt serving for the match at 5‑3.   
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I won't say I didn't feel pressure.   I was just really into the match and really focused on what I had to do.  
I mean, she saved the match point with a good serve.   That's what you normally expect to get, a bullet, when Serena is in trouble.  
It wasn't a big deal, really.   I just have to ‑‑I had to keep my composure and make another opportunity and create another match point, and that's what I did.  
   
 Q.   What do you feel in this match you did differently than the last nine or ten against her?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I just did everything better today.   
   
 Q.   Did it help ‑‑I mean, she was obviously struggling early on with unforced errors and some double faults which you end up having, but how does that affect you when you see another player not probably playing at her best?   Do you kind of try and take advantage of that, or do you justnot even notice it or what?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   No, I don't really think about it.   I just make sure that I make her feel that way.   I make her miss those shots.   And it's not because she doesn't feel something or it's so easy that she's gonna miss the ball.   You have to create those opportunities.   You have to force those mistakes.   So that was what I was really focused on.   
You know, I felt it was a good match overall.   I played good tennis.   She stepped it up.   I stepped it up when I needed.   So it was really close and with a lot of everything in this battle.  
   
 Q.   Did you at any stage think of the US Open final?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   No.   
   
 Q.   During the trophy presentation you guys seemed to be a good, sincerely a good rapport between the two of you, having a chat.   Is this a budding rivalry?   Is this something that tennis fans can look forward to?   I mean, Djokovic/Murray?   Are we seeing the beginning of something good here?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I think we had that for a while already, you know.   I mean, we chat about something completely that had nothing to do with tennis.  
   
 Q.   What was that?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   About Oscar parties.   (Laughter.)   And that's it.   I mean, we always had a good relationship off court.  
So, you know, the US Open final had not the same conversations but the same chemistry there.   I just ‑‑I feel like we are big competitors on the court.   Once the game is over, we are respectful and, you know, normal people.  
   
 Q.   What about the rivalry, moving ahead?   I mean, is this something ‑‑ I think she was saying that she kind of feels like you make her a better player.   I mean, do you relish the chance in the coming months in the majors and stuff to come up against her in those big moments?  
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Any tournament I'm happy to play against Serena.   She's absolutely right.   I feel like we're pushing each other to go to the limit every time, to step up, to improve, and that's tremendous motivation to have.  
You know, you always know that somebody's out there wants to push you.   For me, it's incredible privilege to be in that position.
