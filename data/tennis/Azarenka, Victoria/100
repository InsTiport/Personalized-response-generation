V. AZARENKA/C. Wozniacki
  6-3, 6-1

Q.   Inevitable question:   The match was stopped for five minutes.   The referee came out.   I don't think I've ever seen both players unhappy, and so what was your version of what happened?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, I had a big reason to be unhappy.   First of all, I think that could go into a hall of fame of the worst calls I've ever seen in my life, because ‑‑ I mean, in defense of‑‑ everybody does make mistakes and everything, but that was so slow to make a mistake that it was pretty difficult. 
And the rule of first serve or second serve, what happens, I don't even know that rule because that never happened to me.   And no challenge.   So it was a big mess.   But, you know, we had to get over that.

Q.   I don't quite understand what happened.   It was a first serve, is that correct?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   No.   It was a second serve, which was let, and it was like that wide out.   And when I'm talking wide, on the sideline that's a pretty big margin.   It was a let, so it just dropped.   So I don't understand how you cannot see the ball.   And then there was no challenge.   I couldn't get a challenge for some reason.   And as I believe, Cara was arguing that it was supposed to be a first serve.   As I say, I don't think there should be a first serve, but I also don't know the rule about that because that never happened, the situation, to me.   So it was pretty messed up.

Q.   What reason were you given for not being able to challenge?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   What? 

Q.   What reason were you given for not being able to challenge? 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, they just said it's not happening.   Sometimes this happens and I said, That's a good reason, yeah.   That's okay.   Well, if that's the reason, yeah, then.   But there's no ‑‑ I don't know why it wasn't.   So I mean, I wasn't happy about it.   I don't think I should have been happy about that.   It happens, so it will make it to the history, for sure. 

Q.   How far are you off your best form? 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Hopefully far because I never want to feel like I'm at my best because I look forward to improve.   I think that with every match, there's always an opportunity to do that, and that's what I'm looking forward to just try to keep improving, try to keep developing my game.   I don't really rate my best or not my best.   I just try to be better than my opponent on that particular day.
