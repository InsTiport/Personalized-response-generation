V. AZARENKA/S. Voegele
  6‑2, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   What pleased you most about that performance?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, you know, it's difficult.   The first match you really want to get the feel of competition, and I'm pleased with the way I finished the match.   I think it was really solid from the couple games after the second set, so I'm happy about that.

Q.   2011 was an amazing year for you.   What's the focus for this year?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, the focus is always to be better, you know, to achieve better results, to definitely try to win a Grand Slam. 
Of course the Olympic Games is one of the main goals for 2012.   We'll see how it goes.   2011 was great, but I'm trying to take the positive and leave it behind, because everybody starts kind of from zero.

Q.   The world No. 1 ranking is within reach.   Are you thinking about that or are you aware of it?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Not really.   Before you actually get the title or get ‑‑ are winning matches, you're never going to get the ranking, so that really comes first.

Q.   You had a slow start today.   It was just kind of a tough day for you on the court. 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah.   Well, 5‑O, I wouldn't call it a slow start.   Maybe a little bit slow during. 
But I think it was a good first experience I would say on the court.   She really pushed me to raise my game, so that was also good.
I'm glad that I could manage and play better after.   That's important.   So, you know, it's the first match.   I take positive, I take things that I have to work on‑ definitely there is a lot‑ so we'll see tomorrow. 

Q.   Where does Australia rank for you? 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, it's very nice.   I mean, the people are great here.   The fans are amazing.   I mean, it's the first tournament after a big break, so everybody is kind of excited to see still each other.
So it's fun.   But I don't know.   I think the atmosphere of the fans and how warm they welcome you here, it's amazing.

Q.   You said everyone is pleased to see each other.   Do you miss being on tour?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Sometimes I do.   Actually, this off‑season went by so quick that I haven't missed that much. 
But I'm excited to be back, you know, to really have that momentum going.   I don't know, I mean, we play tennis.   I love tennis.   The competition is what we work hard for.
