 6-4, 7-5
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Has this week been sort of a dream week for you?  Been a long time since you played.  Earlier this week when you beat Vekic, it represented your first win in about a year.  You would imagine it's a big accomplishment to get back on the winning track.
 VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Yeah, it's been great.  I don't know about a 'dream week'.  That's a little overexciting to put in a statement, that it's been my dream week.
 First of all, the week still keeps going.  I don't overanalyze anything while I'm still in the play.  I think I take it day by day.  I've always been this way.  Now more than ever I try to take it one moment at a time.
 Obviously it's been really good to have an opportunity to play matches back-to-back.  I had two matches yesterday, two matches today, to keep going, trying to find my rhythm.
 I'm enjoying myself on the courts, actually playing and competing again.
 Q. Your opponent tomorrow, do you have any history with her, any competition?
 VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I don't believe so.  Sometimes my memory sucks, so I'm not sure.
 Q. We know you paint your nails blue and white some years ago.  Messi is saying he will quit Barcelona.  Do you think it's good for him?  Do you prefer another team for him?  Which one you prefer?
 VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I think whatever I prefer makes absolutely no difference whatsoever, as long as he's happy.  I think it's going to be sad for Barcelona, having him for such a long time.  It's been monumental to have Messi in Barcelona.  When you think about Messi, you think about Barcelona.  I'm sure a lot of fans are going to miss him.
 It's player's choice sometimes.  You do what's best for you, what's best for your career.  I don't know, I'm still going to support Barcelona, I'm still going to love Messi.  It's all good for me.
