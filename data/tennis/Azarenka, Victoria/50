6-3, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Did you think of not playing today?  Or was it always clear that you were going to try to do your best out there?
VICTORIA AZARENKA: Yeah, I was trying but it didn't work.
Q. How is the back doing?
VICTORIA AZARENKA: Not good right now.  We'll see what happens.  I don't know what to tell you.  I'm very disappointed obviously with that.  I thought I was okay and was ready to play and came back, so I'm just disappointed.
Q. How did the days between Madrid when you had to pull out in the third round go towards...
VICTORIA AZARENKA: I don't know.  I don't know.  We'll see.  Right now I have not much of things to say, to be honest with you guys.
Q. Are you ready for the French, or is that just trying to get better as soon as possible?
VICTORIA AZARENKA: We'll see what happens.  I'm not going to think about future.
Q. You looked a little bit nervous today.  There was something before the match that create any problems or not?

VICTORIA AZARENKA: I'm sorry.  I just can't look at the big picture right now.  I'm sorry.  I have to be here, guys, but I don't want to be here answering these questions because right now I'm disappointed of what happened today.  That's what it is.
Q. Is it tougher for you because it's one more injury and you're fed up with that?
VICTORIA AZARENKA: Yeah.  It's just unfortunate that I can't play my best tennis.  That's it.
Q. Besides your injury, what do you think about Irina's game?  You beat her five times till now.  Do you think that she improved her game somehow?
VICTORIA AZARENKA: Yeah, she's a good player.  Obviously the clay court suits her really well.  The conditions work well for her.
Yeah, I don't think there is anything changed much, but she's always been a very solid player and, you know, playing well.
