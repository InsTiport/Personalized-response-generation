   THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Great week last week.   
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Thanks.  
  
  Q. Of course you had the added being invited to play here at the last minute. How have your emotions been the last ten days or so?  
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Well, they were really different. First couple of days were really nervous because I didn't know if I'm going to be first or second alternate.   
 Right before my first match in Moscow, they told me in the interview if I win this match I'm going to be in. Right before the match it's kind of big news. I got nervous. It was tough.  
 But later on when I knew I qualified, it was a little bit easier. But I still was ready to play in Moscow and trying to get ready to play here.   
  
  Q. How difficult is it to come from the winter in Moscow and arrive in the summer in Doha?  
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Well, I haven't been out much yet, but the weather is really hot here. It's very good that I have a day tomorrow to prepare more and hopefully be fine.   
 It's not the first I'm I do it, but definitely need some adjustments.   
  
  Q. What kind of special precautions do you have to take to play in conditions that are so hot? I think it's a little bit hotter this year than last year.   
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Well, definitely the most important is to hydrate yourself. Here it's very humid. To drink plenty and stay out of the sun as much as possible before the matches.  
 It's good news we're playing in evening, which makes it a little bit easier.   
  
  Q. Last year you were a rookie, and this year you have experience. Is there a different mindset?  
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Yeah, you come with a little bit different mindset and a little bit maybe different preparation.   
 For me, definitely different mindset. I'm really looking forward to play. I'm very, very excited and ready to play.  
  
  Q. The last 24 hours must have been a whirlwind of planes, trains, and automobiles. Tell us what it took to get here.   
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: It's tough. Right after the match yesterday I had to go pretty much straight -- I had to do all the media work and the photographs and stuff, but I had to go right to the hotel, pack my clothes, and leave straight to the airport.   
 I was lucky I could catch the earliest flight and come here and, you know, get here in midnight and have some sleep.  
  
  Q. Looking at your group, how do you rate your chances?   
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: I think it's good. You know, there are seven best players in the world, including me. I'm just really looking forward to play against each one of them. They're all great players, great champions, so it's a privilege to be here and play against them.   
  
  Q. What's was up in the Moscow airport? You say that some people can be rude.   
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Oh, yeah. It was just for the first time they said that I cannot carry my racquets. I just ask, Really? Why is that? They say, Yeah, it's been the rules forever. And I said, Really? Because it's not my first time flying.   
 It was a little bit of discussion there. (Smiling.)
