 K. CLIJSTERS/V. Azarenka
  6-4, 5-7, 6-1 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. What was wrong in that third set?   
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: That's a good question. You know, I was a little bit physically tired. I played two first sets on the very high level, and, you know, right now I'm just not strong enough physically, I think.  
 But that's the way I can improve. You know, I have all the shots, I have the game, but physically sometimes I'm just not there right now.   
 But, you know, it's work, and I know I'm going to improve. I just need a little bit more time and I'll be there.  
  
  Q. Was it a matter of not having eaten enough or dizziness? Because the downfall was rather spectacular, the difference?  
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: No, I ate enough. Don't worry about it. I'm actually still growing, so sometimes it takes me a little bit a while and injury, and takes me a little bit more energy out of me.  
 But as I said, it's a matter of time. I'm going to work harder, and next year I'm going to be stronger.
