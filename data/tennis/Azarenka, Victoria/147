S. STOSUR/V. Azarenka
  6‑2, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.

Q.   You were 1 of 12 on break points and your return is usually so reliable.   What was she doing with her serve that made it that difficult to get the service breaks?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I think the statistics of that really said that I didn't take my chances.   But on the other hand, she was serving really well today.
I just felt like I was fighting and trying to do the same thing that wasn't working for me today.   I kept doing the same kind of thing, you know, the same idea, so that wasn't very smart for me to do. 
I have to give her credit.   She played a great match today for sure.   There is no doubt about that.

Q.   Did you feel a little flat after the whole week?   Played semis yesterday and then quarters, and coming in here you looked‑ for you‑ a little bit slow.   Is the body completely there?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I didn't feel that slow.   I just felt like the rhythm for me wasn't there.   I didn't try to adjust with the resources that today I had.
Because I can play so much better than I did today.   No question about that.   But on this day I just didn't use my arsenal the right way.
That just cost me to make a lot of mistakes.   It wasn't bad mistakes, it was just a little bit there.   They were minor mistakes, but still a mistake.   Doesn't matter how big the out is, it's still out.

Q.   (No microphone.)
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I don't think I have to change much.   I just have to be a little bit more aware of what I'm doing on the court, what I can do on that particular day, and not find something that's not working.
That's something that can easily be handled once you can take action on that.   Today didn't happen, but I know how to get out of that. 

Q.   Can you be specific in terms what part of your arsenal that you didn't use on return of serve and your game in general?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Well, I didn't really commit to my return and it wasn't there.   It's hard to be technical about it right now.   To be honest, I don't even want to think about it right now.
It's just things that your mind‑‑ my right mind of right execution had to be there, and it wasn't there on the important moments. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   It's not something that it's my ultimate goal.   My ultimate goal is to be No. 1.
To be No. 2, it's great.   It's definitely one step closer to that.   I am never going to take it for granted.
But ranking is the last thing I really think about. 

Q.   Even outside of the return did you find yourself fighting yourself of the ground even today a little bit groundstroke‑wise? 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I think I was taking too many wrong kind of decisions or too risky decisions when there was no need to be risky.   I didn't try to sometimes stay in the rally.   I just wanted to make whatsometimes I can make with eyes closed.   Today I didn't do it with open eyes. 
It's gist that a little bit of stubbornness that worked a little bit against me today.

Q.   So fair to say then maybe you just need more matches given that you've only played a couple in the last six weeks?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I just need to be more aware about what I've done, and I'm fully aware of what I did today. 
Didn't really click for me on the court, but that's what's good about tennis.   There is always next match.   It's important what you can learn from what happened today. 

Q.   When you talked to your coach, did he piss you off again?   You remember you said that yesterday. 
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   Oh, no.   I mean, I was just joking about that.   He doesn't really piss me off.   It's just emotions on the court.
He's a great person and a great coach and I love him, so there is always fighting sometimes in that kind of relationship.
But we get along great. 

Q.   I take it you're playing in Toronto.   I should ask, are you playing in Toronto?
VICTORIA AZARENKA:   I'm thinking about it.
