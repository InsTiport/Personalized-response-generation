  6-3, 6-3 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Can you tell me a little bit about your experience out there today and what it was like? I know that you're upset.   
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: It was not much of an experience. It was just a wasted match.   
  
  Q. Why do you say that?  
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Well, because I didn't play -- any game that I had to play, it was only unforced errors for me.   
 Vera played good. I didn't do even 10% of my game today.  
  
  Q. Do you have any insight as to why that happened for you?  
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Well, if I would know that I'd probably change that on the match.   
  
  Q. What did you and your coach talk about when you called him out?  
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: Well, he just told me I had to be more patient and try to put more balls in and be positive, but I didn't do any of that.   
  
  Q. What was it like facing your doubles partner? Did you have anything mentally going on about that?  
 VICTORIA AZARENKA: No, nothing. It was just normal player. Good friend of mine, but a normal player, opponent for me. It wasn't anything special.
