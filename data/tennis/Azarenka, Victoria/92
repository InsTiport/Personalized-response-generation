  V. AZARENKA/M. Torro-Flor6-2, 6-1THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.Q. Can you say anything very profound about that match?VICTORIA AZARENKA: What does it mean?Q. Profound, very deep, very meaningful.VICTORIA AZARENKA: If it was meaningful?Q. I'm joking.  Just a big deep thought about the match.VICTORIA AZARENKA: Well, I think it's not -- it's never easy to play the first round of a Grand Slam no matter what your ranking is or your position.  But it's important to start the tournament well.  I had an opponent who I didn't know about and never played against her. For me it was important to just really try to get into the rhythm, get into the tournament, and try to stay focused during the whole match.Q. Yesterday Ana Ivanovic spoke about fans coming up and asking for selfies and it gets overwhelming at times, especially at events like Grand Slams where there are so many people.  Do you agree with that or are you happy to pose for it?VICTORIA AZARENKA: Well, it is, yes, overwhelming, but it also comes with the job.  Just to show a little bit of appreciation for the fans, I think it's important.  I obviously cannot do it with everybody, but as much as you're comfortable with, I think it's important to do that, because we are here and playing in front of those fans who pay for their tickets to come watch us. I do appreciate my fans a lot.  They give me motivation and they support you.  I think it's just the matter of how well you manage it.Q. How much better are you feeling this time this year as you were compared to how you were a year ago, roughly a year ago?VICTORIA AZARENKA: I wasn't here a year ago.  That really explains a lot.Q. That time last year and this time, sort of how things...VICTORIA AZARENKA: That's exactly what I'm trying to say.  I haven't -- I wasn't here last year, and I wasn't sure when I'm going to be able to play again. Playing and enjoying myself, being on the court is already a very big improvement.  So I'm happy to be here and playing.  I just hope to keep improving myself, you know, and keep getting better.Q. Nick Kyrgios was just in a press conference.  He might play Murray in the third round.  He said, I can't avoid it, it's all over social media.  I try not to see it.  Obviously there is a possible third round with you.  Have you ever tried to avoid sort of being aware of it?VICTORIA AZARENKA: Yeah.  I don't know what you are really talking about.Q. You wouldn't know who you are playing in the third round?  You don't look ahead in the draw, fourth round or whatever?VICTORIA AZARENKA: No, never do.
