THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
 Q.  Could you just describe your game?  How do you feel for the first round here in Paris?  
VIKTORIJA GOLUBIC: Well, actually, I think it was very strange match, because at the beginning we were both like we had high intensity.  Then it kind of switched on my side, so I was a little bit better.   
Then from 2-2 was very fast 6-2.  Then it was a long toilet break afterwards and she came back and kind of played very aggressive and very confident.  So it was very fast on her side, which also wasn't easy for me because I couldn't find anymore the game in the second set.  So it was completely on her side.   
In the third set started kind of even, so I was also a little bit lucky to get the 4-2, I think.  Then was very strong there, and I really wanted to win like very much, so I played well at the end.   
 Q.  Your opponent shouted on each point.  How did you feel it?  How did you cope with this?  
VIKTORIJA GOLUBIC: Well, actually wasn't something new.  I have lots of opponents which were making different kind of noises.   
But it wasn't disturbing me at all this match.  Yeah.   
 Q.  Did you notice that the crowd was on your side because of your game.  
VIKTORIJA GOLUBIC: Yes.  Maybe.  I also had family and friends here, so I could feel the support, which helped me a lot definitely.   
I mean, it was just great with the crowd too.  I think I felt the support from everyone, and that, yeah, was advantage kind of for me.
