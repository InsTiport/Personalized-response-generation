THE MODERATOR:  Questions.  
 
 
Q.  Were you surprised by how well he played?
 
RADEK STEPANEK:  You know, I knew what his game is and I was getting on about my game, not in his game.  Today wasn't my day today.  
 
Q.  What happened? 
 
RADEK STEPANEK:  You saw what happened.  But, you know, in the game I didn't felt comfortable today and I didn't felt that I have my rhythm on the court, and that was the reason why I made so many unforced errors.  And I didn't serve that well as I'm used to.  As I said, it wasn't my day, and I will forget about this day very quickly.  Life goes on.  
 
Q.  He did an interview straight afterwards on TV.  He referred to you as stupid, some of your antics at the end, gamesmanship.  What do you have to say about that? 
 
RADEK STEPANEK:  Me?  I have to laugh.  I had already nothing to lose.  He was the one to close out the match.  On his match point, I played one let cord which I was lucky.  So I just said "thank you" to the tape which helped me at the time.  That was it.  He played today too good.  He beat me.  I wish him good luck for rest of the tournament and today won the better player.  I have absolutely no problem.  I just have to applaud for his performance today.  
 
Q.  Do you think he can go much further?  With Henman going out, all the pressure is on him. 
 
RADEK STEPANEK:  You know what, every match is different.  He's going to have another tough opponent here because in this tournament there is no -- I think there is no good draw because all of the players which are in the main draw are very good prepared.  I don't know if he can go.  I don't know what the expectations of the people are on him.  If he's going to play the way he's playing now, he's returning well, he's getting a good first serve, so if it's going to work everything for him, we will see what he's going to show here.
