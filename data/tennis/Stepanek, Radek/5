R. STEPANEK/B. Tomic
  7‑6, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How did you find that match?
RADEK STEPANEK:   You know, difficult obviously, two tiebreakers.   It always can turn, you know, very quickly. 
But I feel like I'm the one who is more creative, more aggressive.   I had my chances already to close out the match at 5‑3.   He came, you know, with incredible shots.   He felt already the match is over.   So he relaxed a lot and played incredible shots, and we went to a tiebreaker when I quickly jumped to 5‑2, 6‑2.   Got a little complicated to 6‑5, but been able to close the match.
I was playing quite all right today.

Q.   Two tiebreaks looks like it could be tight, but you're pleased with how you played?
RADEK STEPANEK:   Yeah, I felt like I'm always a little bit in front having chance on his service games.   Break points, you know, didn't use them, but that's grass court tennis. 
It's all about, you know, using your chances and executing.   You know, I have been happy that I executed in the tiebreaks.

Q.   How are you feeling on the grass?
RADEK STEPANEK:   Yeah, I'm enjoying, you know, every year my game, you know.   Grass suits my game.   It's always a pleasure to play on the grass.
I'm always looking forward to it.   I'm happy that the grass court season is here.

Q.   Obviously Andy Murray is playing now, but there is potential that he'll be the guy you face in the next round.   What are your thoughts about potentially facing him?
RADEK STEPANEK:   He is a great, you know, grass court player.   Playing him here at Queen's Club Tournament which has incredible history on centre court will definitely be a great challenge for me.
No, I will get ready as I did for the previous matches.   I know that it's a tough task, and I will come out and, you know, perform as best I can. 

Q.   Do you think that the crowd will have any part to play in that?   Obviously they'd like to see... 
RADEK STEPANEK:   Yeah, definitely.   They will support their home darling.   That's normal everywhere in the world.   It's nothing special.

Q.   One of the things everyone has been talking about this week is the fact that Andy has appointed AmÃ©lie Mauresmo as his coach.   What's your view on that?
RADEK STEPANEK:   I think that the view from the others has no sense because it's his choice.   He has to believe what he's doing, and, you know, I believe that all his team and the people around him are supporting him, which is the most important thing.   I think we have, you know, nothing to say to that.
Nobody's asking different guys when somebody is taking a different coach.   Obviously it's a special thing coming to top men's tennis with a woman coach.   It's his choice.

Q.   Is one of the important things about changing coaches looking for any kind of edge you can?   Is it the small things that make the big differences?
RADEK STEPANEK:   Yeah, definitely, and especially on that level, you know, in the highest parts of the rankings.   The small things are making the difference.
You know, you have to feel the trust with your coach and the belief that the work you're doing has some, that you have some goals that you're going for them.   You know, if you have that chemistry and everything, then, you know, it's easier.

Q.   With the win today, are you happy with your form going into Wimbledon?
RADEK STEPANEK:   Yeah.   You know, it's beginning of the grass court season.   Definitely helps a lot when you start with two wins so far, and, you know, playing as many matches as I can before Wimbledon definitely helps.
Yeah, I'm feeling good on grass every year.

Q.   Do you feel you could be one of the underdog big surprises this year?
RADEK STEPANEK:   You know, that's what I'm trying every year (smiling).   It will be no different this year.

Q.   Heroes at Wimbledon, who did you used to look up to here at Wimbledon?
RADEK STEPANEK:   Wimbledon, I think two, three heroes.   I think definitely Roger Federer, the last one; and then Pete Sampras before him; Borg obviously winning there so many times. 
But I'm more of a fan of the guys who win it, you know, with the stories like Goran did.   That was very emotional Wimbledon win, which I remember like it was today, and I was‑‑ you know, I had nearly tears when I saw him the last point just praying, Please, you know, serve something on match point.
It was very emotional and something which was different compared to the other titles you can see.

Q.   Obviously the World Cup starts tomorrow.   There is a lot of rivalry in the locker room at the moment?
RADEK STEPANEK:   No, I'm not part of that, because Czech Republic is not there.   I'm just laughing about the other rivalries.
