  N. DJOKOVIC/R. Stepanek
6-0, 1-0 (ret)

 RADEK STEPANEK: I am very sorry, especially for the fans, but I just could not finish the match today. I started feeling bad for the first time after practice this morning, and then I ate lunch and was feeling a bit better. 
 Once the match started, however, I started feeling worse and worse. I was dizzy and weak and couldn't play. I just need to rest now and recover for my next event.
