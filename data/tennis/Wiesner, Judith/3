Q. Were you surprised by the fact that Rita didn't attack you, especially at the
beginning, she waited a little bit?

JUDITH WIESNER: I never played her in a match, so I didn't know quite what to expect.
We practiced, but practice is different. I think maybe in the beginning she was a little
nervous. She made some mistakes. We were both nervous, but of course I'm more experienced.
In the first set, I played very solid. She made a few more mistakes. In the second, I just
didn't serve as well. I think I could have dominated the second more if I served better.
The most problem I had is when she was playing aggressive. I expected her to do that a lot
more.
