 Q. You had a lopsided loss to Pierce in Canada; how do you explain -- you played much
better against her today; what was the difference? 
 
 JUDITH WIESNER: I thought in Montreal she played really good. I didn't play really bad
here, and she just, you know, hit every ball and everything went in, so, I mean, I thought
if she plays like that, it's really impossible to play her. And today, I think she didn't
play that good, and-- I mean, I had so many game points and breakpoints and I just
couldn't convert and -- you know, against a top player like that, you have to take your
chances, because usually you cannot get that many. I got a lot of them today and I didn't
take my chances. I mean, that made the difference. If I stayed with her and she didn't go
ahead quickly, then I think I had a good chance to beat her. Because I felt she wasn't
play that well and playing that confident in the first two rounds as well.  
 
Q. And the failure to convert the break points, do you feel that was because you were
off at those times or did she pick those times to play better? 
 
 JUDITH WIESNER: I think it was a combination of both. I made a couple of easy mistakes
with the returns. She was mixing up the serves quite well. Sometimes she would hit the
first serve hard, sometimes she would spin it, so I had a hard time picking it. Also, she
played good shorts on the game points, so I think it was sort of a combination.
