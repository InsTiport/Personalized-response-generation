P. KOHLSCHREIBER/M. Safwat   
4-6, 6-4, 6-0   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How are you feeling? You started really well, then it feels like something was bothering you.  
MOHAMED SAFWAT: Yeah, towards in the middle of the second set, I don't know, I just start to feel little bit pain in my quadriceps. It just was on the serve. The points were okay.   
But was tough because I think I dropped my percentage on the first serve. I had to play every point. He was pretty comfortable with that. Yeah, it was not nice to do that, but it was good (smiling).   
 Q.  You must have been very pleased the way you were playing up until that point?  
MOHAMED SAFWAT: I mean, I think in general overall was good match. Yeah, he's also tough opponent. He has more experience than me. He plays on such a conditions more than I did I think in my whole career.   
There are positive and negative in the match. I just have to look again on the match, see what I could do better.
