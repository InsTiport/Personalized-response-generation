Q.  When that first serve came in and it wasn't 130 miles an hour, were you thinking, "This is going to be a good day for me"?

JUAN BALCELLS: You never know because you always have on your mind that you are playing with one of the better players in the world right now.  He's Top 5 in the world, and any way he's not serving great, but he has a great kick serve and it's very difficult, as this score shows, that you are playing well with big player.  And the match, I think, was very difficult for me because he hits so hard from the back side, you know, and it was very difficult match.


Q.  But you knew his back was injured?

JUAN BALCELLS: I heard something about that, but I was not sure when we were playing on the court.


Q.  Were you pleased to see he wasn't able to hit his serve as hard as he normally does?

JUAN BALCELLS: Of course.  It's better for me that he is serving like that.  But anyway, I tell you again it was a very good match.
