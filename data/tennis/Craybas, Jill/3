 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Jill, you said yesterday you had a few nerves; took a few games to get into the match. Was it the same case today?   
 JILL CRAYBAS: Yeah, she played really well. I didn't feel that nervous. Actually I just didn't really play that well today. I didn't feel like I was hitting the ball that well today.   
  
  Q. Talk about her kind of dominating with her power game, how you tried to counteract that.   
 JILL CRAYBAS: I didn't really feel overpowered today. I just felt like I wasn't moving my feet that great. I just was struggling getting to the ball and actually hitting out. I was miss-hitting a lot of balls.   
 I didn't necessarily feel like I was getting overpowered.   
  
  Q. You played four times before. How would you say this match compared to some of the others? Was her level, in comparison to yours, higher or lower?   
 JILL CRAYBAS: She played what I expected her to play like. You know, she was pretty solid, played well, ran around and hit more forehands. I mean, she played what I expected.   
 I just made a lot of errors. I feel like I didn't really make the points as long as I would have liked to.   
  
  Q. At the risk of sounding negative here, just what are your feelings right now after a match like this?   
 JILL CRAYBAS: Disappointed. I mean, of course I would have liked to have won. But mainly disappointed in the way I played today. I felt like I did compete hard, but I didn't move into the court like I did yesterday and didn't really hit out on the ball like I've done in the past.   
  
  Q. I heard you yelling in frustration a few times on your serves. Was it just one of those days?  
 JILL CRAYBAS: I just wasn't feeling it quite today, yeah. Yeah, I was struggling.
