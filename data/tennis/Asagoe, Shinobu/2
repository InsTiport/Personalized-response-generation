Q.  Did you feel that the pace of the match, she it was going too fast for your comfort level?  It just went really fast, quick changeovers, that kind of thing, where she was trying to get off the court fast?  Did you feel it was just going too fast? 
 
SHINOBU ASAGOE:  Yes, I think so.  It wasn't so much the pace, but, well, the pace of the stroke was not so bad.  But her getting consecutive points, which kind of went with the flow of the match, that kind of made it difficult.  But she's that type of a player.  
 
Q.  What time did you get here today, and what did you do today with all of the rain impacting the schedule? 
 
SHINOBU ASAGOE:  I waited for 10 hours.  I really don't remember what I did (smiling). I ate, I had a meal, and we basically talked a lot and went out a few times.
