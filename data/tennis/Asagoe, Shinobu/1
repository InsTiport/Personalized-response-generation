  Q.  Japan has a long tradition of tennis, or longer than most Asian countries.  When you see a lot of players from China, Taipei, these other Asian countries getting good results, what do you think about that?  What's the reason we're seeing this in Asia?   
 SHINOBU ASAGOE:  (Through translation.)  In China, so the one person, player, leads every other player.  So others follow the one person.   
 For example, in Japan Ai Sugiyama leads others.  Something like that.  She says so.   
  
  Q.  Is there any other reason for the growth of tennis in Asia?   
 SHINOBU ASAGOE:  (Through translation.)  You mean on grass court?   
  
  Q.  No, no, in general.   
 SHINOBU ASAGOE:  (Through translation.)  I don't know.  Even myself want to know.
