THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Quite a difficult start for you, and then you kind of ran away with it, didn't you?   
MARIA KIRILENKO:   Well, I can't say it was a difficult start.   It was just some‑‑ it was close games which I lost, you know.   I think I did everything right.   Came to the net, and she was better in that point.   
Just continued to play the same way, and then was easy.   (Smiling.)  
   
 Q.   It took 16 minutes to finish the first three games.   Were you feeling her out, the court, the conditions?  
MARIA KIRILENKO:   Yeah, you know, it was very windy today.   I think I found the way to play today.   I think everything was working for me well, and that's why it was kind of easy match for me.  
   
 Q.   What was the best part of your game today?  
MARIA KIRILENKO:   I like my forehand a lot.   I played my forehand from each position of the court I think.   
I was just enjoying to play such a good forehand.   Just having a lot of fun on court today.   
   
 Q.   Talk about your first serve percentage.   
MARIA KIRILENKO:   Yeah, I didn't see my percentage of my serve.   
Yeah, I mean, especially with this kind of weather, it's important have to a good percentage on the serve.   I didn't really focus on it, you know, I just went for the big one, and it worked, so...  
   
 Q.   I don't know if someone already asked you this, but the past four years you've come here, first round out.   
MARIA KIRILENKO:   Yeah, last two years was out first round.   Actually, you remember one year I played against Niculescu here on center court and I won 6‑3, 6‑Love, the same.   (Smiling.)  
   
 Q.   What's going to be different this time?  
MARIA KIRILENKO:   Well, I just played better than last years when I come here, so...   
Maybe I have confidence because I played so many matches in last couple of weeks.   That's why the different results.   
   
 Q.   You got to the third round in Australia and lost to Kvitova.   
MARIA KIRILENKO:   I didn't finish that match.  
   
 Q.   You retired.   You then got to the final in Pattaya.   How do you feel about the season so far?  
MARIA KIRILENKO:   Actually, I'm quite happy, because normally I start the season not really good.   I mean, it's depends.   Sometimes, yeah, like if you remember two years ago I did the quarter in Australian Open, and then after till French Open maybe I didn't do anything.  
So now I feel that I'm playing consistent, and all matches what I have to win I'm winning, so that's good thing.   
   
 Q.   You called for the trainer I believe quite early on.   Was there a problem there?   
MARIA KIRILENKO:   Yeah, because they did a tape before my match and it started coming off.   I wanted them to make a new one, but they said, Okay, we just cut it and you can play with this one.   
So I'm like, Okay.   Whatever.   
   
 Q.   When did you arrive in Dubai?   
MARIA KIRILENKO:   I arrive Saturday, I think.  
   
 Q.   You manage to get out and about at all?   
MARIA KIRILENKO:   Yeah, to be honest, I got sick in Doha when I lost this match against Kuznetsova, so I really felt not really well.   
After that I was few days just lying in the bed because I had a bad‑‑ very painful in my throat, sore throat, and then the runny nose.  
So even I came here I was taking also Sunday almost day off.   So I went to the court just 40 minutes play, and all that time I was lying in my bed.   
   
 Q.   Next match will be a tough match.   How do you expect it?   
MARIA KIRILENKO:   Well, the girls, I think, are going to play tomorrow, yeah?   
   
 Q.   Ana Ivanovic or Schiavone.   
MARIA KIRILENKO:   Yeah, no idea if I'm going to win.   
   
 Q.   Both players are very tough players on hard.   
MARIA KIRILENKO:   I know.   Everybody tough here in the draw.   
   
 Q.   You have a better record against Ivanovic, I believe, compared to your record against Schiavone.   Would you prefer to see Ana win in a way?  
MARIA KIRILENKO:   I mean, I don't really care against whom I'm going to play.   The better player going to win, so I'm going to play with that one.
