    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Obviously Serena has been playing well for the last year.   Even for her, that was a good performance.   Did you feel there was anything you could do out there tonight?  
    MARIA KIRILENKO:   Well, I think I try to do something special tonight.   That's why was so many mistakes.   I just maybe had to play little bit more simple.   
    So that's it.   We didn't even have long points.   It was really difficult to get the rhythm, you know.   
    But it's okay.   It's happens.  
   
 Q.   You felt like playing against her you had to do more?  
    MARIA KIRILENKO:   Yeah, I played like I want to play something unbelievable, every shot I want to do the good shot.   But sometimes you just have to play just simple, maybe just through the middle.   
    But actually when I played through the middle, then she started to make winners.   That's why maybe I was trying too much.   
    It wasn't my day today.  
   
 Q.   She made 87% of her first serves.   
    MARIA KIRILENKO:   Exactly, yeah.   I remember only once I returned on the second serve.   
   
 Q.   Have you ever played anyone who served as well as she did?  
    MARIA KIRILENKO:   Actually, I think she has like one of the best serves on tour.   That's why it's difficult to return, so...   
   
 Q.   How surprised would you be if Serena didn't win the tournament?  
    MARIA KIRILENKO:   Well, I don't care now, to be honest.
