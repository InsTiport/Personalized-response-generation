V. WILLIAMS/M. Kirilenko
  6‑3, 6‑7, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Talk about your match today, how you felt out there. 
MARIA KIRILENKO:   Well, I'm still under the jet lag.   I just arrived couple days ago from Moscow.   It's my first match on hard court after this long grass season.
Still, it wasn't too bad for me, I think.   I felt that I was moving not so good, but still I was trying my best today.   I think we had some good rallies. 

Q.   Is it tough to transition, Wimbledon then the Olympics and now come to the hard court season here in Cincinnati and going to the US Open? 
MARIA KIRILENKO:   Yeah, I mean, it's difficult because, you know, like it was long season on the grass.   It was long Olympics week for me as well.
I was so excited to get the Olympic medal, and I had just couple days for recovery and I had to fly back here.   So it's a little bit tough physically and mentally.   I had a tough round for the first match, you know, and so...
But still I'm happy.   At least I'm healthy now.

Q.   How did you celebrate after the Olympics, winning is the bronze with Petrova?
MARIA KIRILENKO:   Yeah, actually she went to MontrÃ©al and I went the same day back to Moscow.   Next days I went out couple times and we celebrated.   It was a lot of people, you know, trying my medal.   It was pretty exciting.

Q.   Where are you keeping the medal?   Is it with the rest of your trophies or is it in a special place? 
MARIA KIRILENKO:   Well, it's in the house, so it's lying with my all trophies.   (Laughter.)

Q.   With this result today and New York coming up, are you going to look to play next week to get some more match play in?
MARIA KIRILENKO:   Yeah.   Yeah, I'm going New Haven.   It's my next tournament.   Everything going fine, so.   I still have one week before the US Open.

Q.   Do you plan on playing doubles with Petrova in the US Open?
MARIA KIRILENKO:   Yes. 

Q.   Talk a little bit about your camaraderie with Petrova.   You've done really well this year.   How did the partnership begin?   Did you approach her or did she approach you? 
MARIA KIRILENKO:   Yeah, I mean, it works well.   We're playing good, and we did the final in the Grand Slam, in the French Open; we won Miami, a big tournament. 
Yeah, we just keep going.   We have fun.   We have a good relationship with each other.   We're both Russians, so it's good as well.
Yeah, we just practicing together so we just trying to do our best just to play doubles as well.   I mean, to play good doubles as well as singles players, so it's a good sign.

Q.   Speaking about your singles, what's changed with your game?   You had a good run, and a couple years kind of dipped a little bit.   Talk about what you worked on or what's changed in your game?   Is it mental? 
MARIA KIRILENKO:   Yeah, I just won couple good matches and I got some confidence and start a little bit understand more like how to play out there, you know, in the important moments.
So start to think more maybe.   Because I work a lot before and I knew that one day it has to come, you know.   It has to help me. 

Q.   Talk a little bit about Venus and how she looked out there.   You fought back very well in the second set.   You actually had two games where you came back from Love‑40. 
MARIA KIRILENKO:   Yeah, that's right.   She's serving well.   When she's serving well then it's difficult to do something. 
Yeah, sometimes she has just, you know, quick returns.   Like even you serve good and she just make a first one very quickly, so you have to be very concentrate out there.
I think my concentration went a little bit down in the third set.   I don't know.   It happens.   You have to be always focus with this kind of players.   You don't have to let them go and to give like a lot of opportunities for them.   Then they feel more relaxed out there.
You have to play every game.   So the game is finished right now.   It's in the past.
