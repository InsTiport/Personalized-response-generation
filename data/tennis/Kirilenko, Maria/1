THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Just your thoughts about how the match played out.   Seemed like Maria's serve was pretty good tonight.   
MARIA KIRILENKO:   Yeah, I mean, she hold all her service games.   Still she had some double faults, like few in a row, and still I wasn't able to break her.   
Well, I think the game was quite solid today, you know, from both of us.   Just, you know, she was maybe get a little bit more lucky today somewhere.  
   
 Q.   How do you feel about your tournament?   You have had a very nice run to get to the semifinals.   How do you review your stay at Indian Wells?  
MARIA KIRILENKO:   I can say only the positive stuff for this tournament.   I'm happy the way I'm playing, and so it's mean that I'm moving to the right direction.  
   
 Q.   So why is it so tough to play, so difficult to play against Maria?  
MARIA KIRILENKO:   Why it's so difficult?   It's difficult to play with everybody, I can tell you.   
There are no players who are playing, you know, bad right now.   So everybody at good level.   Just, you know, you have to be there every match.  
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts about the finals, Maria versus Caroline?   What are your thoughts about that match?
