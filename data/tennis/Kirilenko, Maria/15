 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Dubai doesn't seem to be doing you any good.   
 MARIA KIRILENKO: Yeah, I mean, last year I lost here first round as well. -- last year was quite easy and this year, so just continue.  
  
  Q. What's happening? Is it the evolution of the game? Are you trying out something new?   
 MARIA KIRILENKO: I don't know. Like I had so many mistakes today. You know, every ball is just a mistake and couldn't find the feelings.   
 Yeah, just was very bad day for me.  
  
  Q. What about your game? Do you find you're playing better than you were?  
 MARIA KIRILENKO: Yeah, like in the beginning of the year, like when played the exhibition in Hong Kong before Sydney, I played there quite well.   
 I had some team matches as well in the end of the year where I played not bad. Then just, yeah, I lost in Australian Open second round also playing not really well.   
 Yeah, just, you know, trying to find my game again, you know, because I feel that there's a little bit too many mistakes. I don't feel what to do.  
  
  Q. What will you do to correct that?  
 MARIA KIRILENKO: I just need to practice. Practice, practice, practice, that's how you can find the game back and how you can just...  
  
  Q. So you're not getting enough practice?  
  
  
 MARIA KIRILENKO: Yeah, I was practicing in Pattaya a lot, and maybe it wasn't enough. (Smiling.) Maybe I need a little bit more.  
  
  Q. Does hold good memories for you because you won here before?  
 MARIA KIRILENKO: Yeah, I mean, I have very good memories from Dubai, because a lot of time I come here just for practice. Especially like three, four years ago even I was young. So I was came here just for two weeks' preparation.  
 Yeah, it's nice city here. I like to come back here.  
  
  Q. Physically are you feeling okay? At one point you were working on your wrist in the second set.   
 MARIA KIRILENKO: Yeah, physically I feel fine.   
  
  Q. Nothing wrong with the wrist?  
 MARIA KIRILENKO: No, it's everything fine.   
  
  Q. Is it windy outside?  
 MARIA KIRILENKO: Yeah, it's quite windy. Maybe that's why it was difficult to find the game. But still, it's not because of the wind. It's just a bad day.   
  
  Q. Would you think about doing something else besides tennis?   
 MARIA KIRILENKO: Well, for now I'm just in my mind still tennis.   
  
  Q. You've not thought about anything for the future?   
 MARIA KIRILENKO: No. When it will be time, then I will think. When the time comes, then I will think about.   
 I'm still not very old yet. I still have a few years to play for sure.  
  
  Q. Any plans for today?  
 MARIA KIRILENKO: I go now run for 30 minutes to make stress away.   
  
  Q. Anything for Valentine's Day or anything?  
 MARIA KIRILENKO: Ah, today is Valentine's Day? I didn't know actually. Yeah, I go and then maybe I practice. What else can I do? Just I need to have more work maybe.
