P. KVITOVA/M. Kirilenko
  6-2, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Maria. 
 (The following through translation.)

 Q. Two questions: Why did it take you so long to come here to the press conference, why the delay? And then the second question is: Did you feel that in some spots of the courts there were some empty spots like some people, some players complained?
 MARIA KIRILENKO: Answer to the first question: First, I was sitting in the locker room, and people told me that Kvitova would be the first to come to the press conference. That's why I had more time to recuperate after the match.
 And the second question, I didn't feel any empty spots on the court. It was fine.

 Q. It was the opening rubber. How tough was it for you to play, especially after such a long break with the national team?
 MARIA KIRILENKO: Well, yes, I would say that there is a big difference between divisional tournaments, even Grand Slams, and this team competition, because you hear the fans cheering up for every ball and you're overwhelmed with emotions. 
 Right now Petra Kvitova is on top of her game. She played quite a match today. I tried my best; it just didn't work. 

 Q. Did you make any conclusions after playing Petra? Can you give any tips to Svetlana Kuznetsova for tomorrow's match against Petra?
 MARIA KIRILENKO: For me, at the beginning I was feeling like I can outplay her on the baseline, but she had a very consistent serve, and it was tough for me to return.
 So if Svetlana can manage to make at least one break per set and then hold on to her own serve, then I think she may win the match. 

 Q. What are the odds for you to play the decisive doubles? Because you are known to be good doubles player. You're in the top 10 in the world as a doubles player. 
 MARIA KIRILENKO: Definitely, if there is such an opportunity, I'd love to play the doubles match.
