 P. PETZSCHNER/G. Simon
  7-5, 6-2 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.   
  
  Q. There was wind up in the stands. How did it feel down on the court?   
 GILLES SIMON: There was no wind.   
  
  Q. At 1-All you talked with the umpire. What was it about?   
 GILLES SIMON: I don't know. I don't remember.   
  
  Q. He sliced all the time. Did it have something to do with the loss?   
 GILLES SIMON: More than his game, the problem today was me. I wasn't able to practice as I wanted before the match, so when I stepped on the court, I was not ready, I was not confident, and it was difficult for me to hit the ball.   
 I did the best I could, which was not much today. In fact, my neck got stiff during practice and I was not able to play as I wanted to today. I was afraid to hit. I was afraid that the pain would come.   
 In fact, his slice helped me because it gave me more time. If he had played faster, it would have been more difficult for me.   
  
  Q. When was the last time you hurt your neck?   
 GILLES SIMON: It was in Madrid. In Miami it was my back, not the neck.   
  
  Q. And there's nothing to do about all these pains?   
 GILLES SIMON: Not much. I try to practice, practice stronger if I can. But at the end of that practice I had my neck when I was serving. I thought, Well, I'm here, let's give it a chance.   
 Before that I was feeling a bit better. That happened. I didn't do too badly because I only lost the first set 7-5. The second was a bit faster.   
 As I said, I did my best and I couldn't do much today.   
  
  Q. Are you going to stay a bit longer here or are you going to Cincinnati immediately?   
 GILLES SIMON: I have to play doubles with Richard today, so I'll try to build up some confidence during that match. It's tougher during a match than during practice, though. I will try to get ready for Cincinnati.   
 If the pain goes away, it will be fine, otherwise I'll have to wait for the US Open.   
  
  Q. Was it real pain or was it fear of feeling pain?  
 GILLES SIMON: Well, the muscle was stiff. It was there. Also, because of that, I was not able to run during the past two weeks. If you don't keep practicing right and left, you lose your rhythm.   
  
  Q. You usually play doubles with GaÃ«l. Why are you playing with Richard here?   
 GILLES SIMON: Well, I don't know. It just happened that way. But in Cincinnati I'll be playing with GaÃ«l.
