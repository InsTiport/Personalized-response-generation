G. SIMON/V. Troicki   
6-3, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French, please.   
 Q.  What do you like today in his game?  You played six matches without losing a set against him.  
GILLES SIMON: I don't want to give you all the details, but his game suits me.  He's a player that I know I can beat if I play well.   
But even if I beat him 10 times, in a given match things can go wrong.  Also when I step onto the court, I don't always feel well.  Sometimes I feel things will go well, but not today.   
 Q.  How many hours did you play on clay?  
GILLES SIMON: Not many.  Six.   
 Q.  When did you start playing on clay?  
GILLES SIMON: I played Wednesday, Thursday.  Friday I traveled.  And yesterday I heard I was going to play today, so I practiced in the evening.   
I had a long streak with the American tour, the Davis Cup.  That was almost two weeks.  You need to rest at some point.   
It was not very good news that I had to play today.   
 Q.  Can you talk about your experience in Guadeloupe for Davis Cup.  
GILLES SIMON: For us it was a beautiful tie.  Many things happened outside of the tie itself.  But as far as we were concerned, this didn't pollute the atmosphere in the team.   
We spent 10 days practicing well.  It is one of the most wonderful ties I've ever played.  I have very good memories of it.   
 Q.  Did you look on the map where you're going to play the next tie?  
GILLES SIMON: I know it's going to be a little place.  It's a stadium with 15,000 people.  Well, we expected something like that.   
As long as it is not Ostrava, it's okay with me.   
 Q.  Why?  Ostrava is such a bad memory?  
GILLES SIMON: Well, it's not a good memory, but it's okay.  You know, if I didn't want to play in those places where I lost first round, there would be many places I wouldn't play anymore.
