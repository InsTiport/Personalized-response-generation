 Q.  What happened? 
 GILLES SIMON:  I was not able to practice on clay.  I only played one week since I came back from the States. 
 Last year I was able to practice for ten days on clay before the beginning of the tournaments. 
 Today I didn't play my usual game on clay.  I did everything upside down.  I was constantly off balance when I was sliding.  Against Ferrer you have to be at you're best level, otherwise you have to chance. 

 Q.  What was the disease or the illness you had recently? 
 GILLES SIMON:  Yes, indeed I was very sick.  I believe it's a mushroom that I didn't digest.  It was a food poisoning.  It happened during a practice week. 
 Last week I didn't have time to find my reference points on the court.  I didn't have the same level as last year when I was difficult to out-run. 
 In this match I was not even able to start running when he made a dropshot, and I didn't feel comfortable on the court. 

 Q.  What do you intended to?  It's becoming urgent, isn't it? 
 GILLES SIMON:  For the Casablanca tournament that's going to be difficult.  But after that I will have ten days on clay before the other two Masters Series.  I will play the best I can in Casa, and after that there will be one week without a tournament and I'm going to practice. 

 Q.  Do you realize you have many points to defend? 
 GILLES SIMON:  I know that.  It's for everyone the same.  If I don't win any match until the French Open, I'll go down Top 70. 
 But you can consider things from the other point of view.  I am 70 or Top 70, and every match I win makes me go up.  This is the period of the year where I'm supposed to play my best tennis.  If I won so many points last year, it is not a coincidence.
