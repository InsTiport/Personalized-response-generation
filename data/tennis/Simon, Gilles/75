THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Gilles in French.   
   
 Q.   In the first set you had a point for a double break against you.   How can you explain that?   
GILLES SIMON:   Well, I was ready to play here.   I had played a good match against Harrison in Davis Cup, although it was a dead rubber.   But in the beginning of that match, I made three unforced errors with my forehand.   That's why it was not a very good start.   
But I really was eager to play.   I was feeling in good shape after my last matches here.   The conditions today were a lot tougher because it was cold and physically it took me some time before I could get started.   
In the end, I believe this was a good match.   
   
 Q.   It was a better match than when you played him as a junior?  
GILLES SIMON:   Yes.   We both have progressed since that time.   He has a solid game and he has a very good first serve, so I knew I would have to be careful.   Maybe I tried to do too much in the beginning.   After that, I was playing better.   
As I said, it was cold and it took me some time before I could find my rhythm.   
   
 Q.   What did you do after Davis Cup here?   
GILLES SIMON:   I spent three days in Nice and then I came over here to practice.   I really felt I was ready, although yesterday we couldn't play because of the rain.   
   
 Q.   Was Davis Cup a good preparation for this tournament in spite of the disappointment?  
GILLES SIMON:   Well, after Davis Cup I usually play well.   It helps me.   Like I played well in Stuttgart after Hamburg.   I also won the tournament in Metz after playing Davis Cup in Lyon.   It's because when we play Davis Cup, we have a full 10 days of practice.   It's always a good thing to start the clay court season because we're always struggling to be ready on time.
