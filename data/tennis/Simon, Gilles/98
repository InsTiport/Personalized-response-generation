 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Was this match, like you said yesterday, you had no reference points to be able to play on clay?  
 GILLES SIMON: Yes. I didn't have reference points. And on top of this, this match was completely rotten from the first to the last point. So it's not only the lack of reference points.   
  
  Q. What is it then?  
 GILLES SIMON: I don't know. I'm surprised myself. I felt at ease on this surface. I was moving well. But I don't remember ever playing so badly. Nothing was right. Nothing was working. My forehand, my backhand, my serve, nothing.   
  
  Q. Do you believe playing a qualifier first round coming back from the United States was a tricky match?  
 GILLES SIMON: No. On the contrary, I believe this was a good draw. It is always better to play a qualifier, although he won matches just before and he has his bearings.   
  
  Q. But you didn't know this one?  
 GILLES SIMON: Yes, I did. I played him a long time ago. I also saw several matches from him so I knew what he can do well. But I played so bad today that I couldn't have beaten anyone. In the beginning he made a couple of mistakes, but then he understood very soon that I would play a very short point or I would hit the ball out.   
  
  Q. When was the last time you played as badly as this?  
 GILLES SIMON: I believe this match is a record.   
  
  Q. Are you worried?  
 GILLES SIMON: I'm certainly not pleased with that match. But I'm not even worried. If I had lost playing sometimes good, sometimes bad, I would have thought it's strange.   
 But in this case, I didn't even have good moments. It went so bad that I think the result is normal.   
  
  Q. What bothered you in his game? He's a left-hander? He was hitting the lines too often?  
 GILLES SIMON: Nothing special. I was concentrating on what I had to do, and he was putting some rhythm into the ball, which is good. He was serving well, but I was able to return. But I felt lost on the court. The third backhand I was hitting went into the net. The third forehand I was hitting, I was hitting the frame. I think I made 40 unforced errors and just 1 winner. What could I do?   
  
  Q. Four winners.   
 GILLES SIMON: But two aces (smiling).   
  
  Q. What is your schedule now?  
 GILLES SIMON: I need to take two or three days for treatment, then there is no secret: I need 10 days of intensive practice on clay in order to be able to slide better and to work on my fitness, because when the rally is very long, I lose my breath, so I need to get used to that type of effort again.
