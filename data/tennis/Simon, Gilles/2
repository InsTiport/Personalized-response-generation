 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. How difficult has it been for you this week, especially with today's match, playing without the benefit of fans?  Normally this is a pretty well-attended tournament in Paris, and now of course you're just playing in front of your team and tournament officials.  So how was it for you?
 GILLES SIMON:   Well, it's not the first week, and unfortunately we can't enjoy as much as usual, especially to have the crowd with you home.  But one more time we played several weeks in a row like this in these conditions, so we are used to it.
 Today was difficult just because my game was not at the right place, so it was, yeah, a really tough day for me.
