G. SIMON/T. Alves
  5-7, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4

 Q. I was just wondering, first of all, are you enjoying your time in London? And secondly, what do you do to relax when you're not playing and you're not practicing? 
 GILLES SIMON: It's a beautiful tournament, so it's always nice to come here. We're lucky with the sun. That's why I'm burned today, right now. But it's a very, very nice tournament. I think it's the favorite one of many players. So that's it, just a pleasure to play. 
 And what I'm doing when I'm not playing is nothing (laughter).

 Q. Do you go to any particular restaurant or...
 GILLES SIMON: No, I just like to wake up around 11:00 and just practice one hour and then I rest.

 Q. Watch movies or...
 GILLES SIMON: Yeah.
