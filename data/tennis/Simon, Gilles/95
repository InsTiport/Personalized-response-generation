G. SIMON/I. Andreev
  7-6, 6-7, 6-1

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Is your knee a 100%? I noticed tape on it. Is it fine? 
 GILLES SIMON: 100%, no, but just trying my best anyway. I have to play these tournaments, so I feel like I'm able to play. I don't know, I just try to do my best on the court. And when I feel that I have a chance to win, like today, I just give the maximum.

 Q. How do you feel about Davydenko or Kunitsyn?
 GILLES SIMON: Well, it's two different players. Nikolay is playing really fast, as usual. I will need all my legs if I want to win against him. We played three times each other. Every time it was really hard match. I won twice and I lost one. But it was a good fight, so for sure I will have to be 100% if I want to defeat him. 
 Igor Kunitsyn is different. I played him only a single time in Nottingham on grass, so it's really different. I know he's playing from the baseline also, so anyway I expect a hard match. But I don't know against who. 

 Q. You've got a reputation as being one of the more mentally tough players on the tour. Did that help at all at the end of the second set? You had a match point, and he pulled the set out. Didn't seem to bother you. How were you able to move on?
 GILLES SIMON: Well, the thing is, when you're a tennis player, each match is really hard to win. Sometimes you lose. You just do the maximum on the court and your opponent is just better than you and then you lose. So when I feel that I have the chance to win, I just want to play this chance 100% every time. 
 So today, even if I lost the second set, it was hard because I was not moving very good. I had the match point, so it's always hard. But I had the impression that I was still about to win the match, so I tried to forget everything and just to focus on that. 

 Q. How do you feel about the way you're playing in general? I think last summer you were one of the best players on the tour going into the US Open. Has it been more of a struggle this summer?
 GILLES SIMON: The thing is, I think I'm -- actually, I'm playing good. I practiced a lot this times, but I have also some frustration on the court because I just can't do what I want. Just can't run as usual. It's not easy for me, because I like to fight. I like to feel that it's gonna be hard for my opponent to win every point. That's not the way I'm playing, actually.
 So I'm playing good. I play sometimes beautiful shots. I feel like today I did a good match, because every time I had a chance to do something good in the first to break him, I did it. 
 But still, I think it could be a little bit easier.
