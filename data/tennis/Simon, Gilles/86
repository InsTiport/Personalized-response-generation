 G. SIMON/E. Gulbis
  7-6, 6-0 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. So that was quite a firey match from your opponent. Is that what you expected with him?   
 GILLES SIMON: Well, I know him. He can play a very good tennis. It's not a surprise. I saw him play this kind of match before, so I know it can happen.  
  
  Q. It clearly didn't affect your concentration when he was upset.   
 GILLES SIMON: No, he was playing a very good tennis at the beginning. The condition were faster than the other day with the sun and everything, so it was hard for me to return. He was playing also very good from the baseline. He was hitting the ball hard and not missing a lot. So it was hard. I think he deserved to serve for the set.   
 Then, I don't know. I know that it's always the hardest game to win when you are 5-4 and serve. He didn't serve any first serve on this game, and then he started to miss. I think that he takes a lot of risk.   
 And when physically -- I mean, when he's not moving as good as the beginning, it's harder for him.   
  
  Q. So you could tell that he was fading, he physically wasn't quite as sharp as he had been at the beginning?  
 GILLES SIMON: Well, the thing is that I know on the court I can play three hours even if it's 40 degrees outside. I know that if the match is difficult, if we have to run, fight on every point, at the end it's good for me.   
 That's what I planned in the first set. Even if he broke me the first game, he had to move, he had to run. He was defending well also. He had some chances to have two breaks in the first set. I was happy just to stay, 3-2, 4-3, 5-4. I know he had to fight.   
 Finally, as I said, he was moving, I mean, not much at the end. But he drop down a little bit during the one match.  
  
  Q. Were you surprised just how badly he faltered in that last set? I think it was three points in total he won.   
 GILLES SIMON: The thing is, in tennis when it start to be hard, it can be really hard. I was returning far from the baseline for the return, because the first set I couldn't return. It was too fast. So I was one or two meters, and back and I was returning every time the first serve even.   
 So we had to play the points and everything. He wanted to make the points easy, I mean, trying to finish on the second shot or third shot.   
 It's difficult.  
  
  Q. You're drawn to meet Roger Federer in the early rounds next week. Do you have confidence after your performance this week?  
 GILLES SIMON: I didn't know.  
  
  Q. Second round.   
 GILLES SIMON: No, I know it, but I mean you shouldn't tell me. You don't know if I want to know it. Strange way to...  
 Anyway, yeah, I looked at the draw because I like to watch the draw. I mean, what is important for me is to win this tournament for the moment. I'm feeling good. I played four good match in a row. I didn't lose any sets.   
 I know the victory here is for the moment the priority, and then I have to play against Lu one more time at the Australian Open.   
 We know how tennis works. You can win one week an easy win and then lose the week right after. So for the moment, I'm just focus on the final.  
  
  Q. Could end up being a France/Serbia final, back to Davis Cup.   
 GILLES SIMON: Back to nothing. We lost it anyway. Can win or lose, it won't change anything.  
  
  Q. How do you see the match playing out if it is Troicki?  
 GILLES SIMON: For tomorrow? Well, he has to win first. I mean, he's a good player; he's playing good; I know him. I mean, we all know each other, so we know what to expect about our opponent. I know that I will have to play good tennis to win.  
 I think I played more final than him, so I have a good record in final. I defeated him the four times I have to play him, so I hope to have a fifth one. (Smiling.)  
  
  Q. Has it created more rivalry between the French and Serbian teams having just played a Davis Cup final?  
 GILLES SIMON: Well, I mean, I told you, the Davis Cup is finished now. It's a good memory for them and bad for us. (Smiling.) That's it. Even if I win 6-0, 6-0 tomorrow, it won't change anything. I prefer to win the Davis Cup.   
 So I'm sorry. It's a nice tournament, Sydney, but I prefer to win the Davis Cup. (Laughing.)   
  
  Q. How close is this week to your best tennis since the knee injury? Is this as good as it's been?  
 GILLES SIMON: Well, I had some good weeks the last three months of the season. I'm thinking about Metz, of course. I was playing good in France, also in Valencia.   
 Well, I think it's good because I'm playing good and I'm moving good also. I mean, in Metz I was playing good, not moving as I wanted; in Valencia I remember I was moving very good. I was more and more confident about my knee, but I was not playing that good. (Smiling.)  
 So this week it's better.
