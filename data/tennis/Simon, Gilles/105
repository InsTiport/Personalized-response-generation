G. SIMON/C. Guccione
  6-7, 6-4, 6-1, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. You must be pleased with the result that you had today and looking ahead towards the tournament, some big matches coming up, as well? The match was tight. You managed to take the match away from him. How did you manage to do that?
 GILLES SIMON: I don't know, I think I was a little bit lucky at the end of the second set, because finally I broke him too finish the set, but it was 40-Love on his serve. Yeah, I mean, I had a chance to break before, but I didn't expect to win this game. 
 Finally then it was better for me because in the beginning of the second set I started to, yeah, read a little bit more his serve. First it was the first serve and then the second. Finally in the third set I was, yeah, much more confident because I was just feeling better. 

 Q. Guccione in Australia is known as a serve-and-volleyer. Did you do any research beforehand on Chris, how to break down his game?
 GILLES SIMON: No, because it's an easy way to play. You don't have the choice. He's just coming to the net every time he can. 
 What is hard is to stay focused on every point because you can feel the frustration even during the match because there is the crowd for him. Every time he's serving an ace, Yeah, c'mon. For me it's not easy on the court. That's why I'm pretty happy to win, because I didn't take pleasure to play today. It was really hard. 

 Q. Did you try to do anything to combat the conditions on the court?
 GILLES SIMON: No, because before I knew it would be hard. I prefer to play a player playing from the baseline because it's easier for me. I have time to play also. Here, you know, it's very hard. Every time it's Love-30 on your serve, you think that if you lose this game, maybe you just lose the set. 
 I just knew it before to get into the court. That's why, even when I lost the first set, I just tried to focus on what I had to do.
