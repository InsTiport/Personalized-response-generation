 G. SIMON/T. Berdych
  6‑3, 6‑3, 6‑2 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How did you feel that match went today?   
GILLES SIMON:   Really good.   This is not what I expected.   The last match was going the other way.   I had a good feeling, I mean, from the start.   I felt he was struggling also to put his game in place, and I was really good on keeping him in this gray area.   
I felt he didn't know what to do anymore on the court, and for me, it was really clear.   So I was just so happy that it last all the match.  
   
 Q.   Is it a surprise after the Australian Open in 2009 to come back and get your second slam quarterfinal on grass?  
GILLES SIMON:   I work for that, so I always hope it's going to come.  
No, it was just surprise that I was able to play this level for so long today.   I mean, it was not that long.   Two hours with a lot of interruptions, but, I mean, with Tomas, I had a good record against him, but every time I won it was really close.   It was hard battles.   
And I think it was the easiest one I had against him.   I'm surprised that he comes now in the last 16 Wimbledon because his game was in really good shape before.  
   
 Q.   You talked about the interruptions.   There was like a 15‑minute break when the fan got ill.   What goes through your mind?   Were you worried that it would break up your rhythm?  
GILLES SIMON:   Nothing.   I just want to play as fast as we can, but unfortunately it was, yes, at least 15 minutes.   
But one more time I had a good feeling.   I was like 6‑3, end of the set.   So anyway, it was okay.   
   
 Q.   Where would you say this performance rates in the context of your whole career?  
GILLES SIMON:   I don't know.   I didn't think about it.   I'm playing good right now.   I have no problem physically.   I just wanted to go there and play my best tennis.   
It was a really, really good match.   Now I hope I will play a few more.  
   
 Q.   I know you think a lot about the details of the game.   When you were serving to Tomas and also GaÃ«l and other players this week, you have been, on the second serve, going down the T, trying to get to their backhands almost every time.   That's what I'm seeing, anyway, in the stats.   Do you worry that becomes too predictable, or is it that's just your favorite serve to hit, kick serve down the T?  
GILLES SIMON:   It depends.   I'm just worrying it can become predictable and my opponent will use it, but I hope that they are not.   I have no reason to change.  
   
 Q.   You have Roger Federer next.   Can you talk about the challenge of facing him here on grass?   I know you have challenged him before on other surfaces.   
GILLES SIMON:   Facing him on grass, I don't know.   We have never played on grass.   Facing him, this I know.   But one more time, I think he's playing really good right now.   Today he was in really good shape.  
I would just go there and try to play what I'm playing from the beginning of the tournament and from the beginning of the grass court season.  
We often had some close matches with Roger.   Still he destroy me once, so I'm ready that it can be sometimes difficult to face him, but one more time I just feel good and I just want to play it.  
   
 Q.   This tournament is quite unique that there is Middle Sunday and then they make the women all play early today, so they play on the outside courts, some of them, because they are playing again tomorrow.   So Wozniacki was talking about the fact that it's a bit unfair for the women because they don't get a lot of opportunity to play on the big courts here.   When you look at the schedule, I mean, you're experienced on the tour, do you feel that the women here don't get the chance to play on the big courts as much as the men?  
GILLES SIMON:   I didn't really pay attention on the schedule.   Just I know that we are starting the match on the two main courts at 1:00 and that it's difficult.   I saw most of the day and Court 1 it was two women's match, because two men's match it's difficult to finish the schedule.   I know what I'm talking about.   I knew it from the beginning.   But then I didn't pay attention to it.   
And then that they have to play two days in a row, well, I think it's easier to ask for the women, not the men's.   You can have a match that last for five hours for us.   So I think it, I don't know why, but it have to be like this, because this is how they are doing it.   Then the courts need to rest on Sunday.   
Well, I don't see any big problems about the scheduling there.   I don't know.   I think they can play one match every day.   That's what they are doing all the season, anyway.   When you have 1000, I mean, you can play two matches in three sets and then you will have one more day of rest.   
Anyway, the slams is already easier for that reason than the other tournaments, so it's not a big inconvenience.  
   
 Q.   There are people who call Berdych an underachiever.   They say he has the game to win slams and all of that.   Do you agree with that, or do you think that what someone achieves in tennis is what they should achieve?  
GILLES SIMON:   Oh, I just think that he's a player that is able to win a slam.   He played the final.   He played a lot of semifinals.   He's really dangerous for a lot of players.  
But then you agree with Stan on this.   It's just not that you deserve it.   You make it or you don't make it.   I mean, some players that didn't have his career like‑‑ for example, Marin Cilic just did it and it's good for him, and no one is going to take it back from him.  
And Tomas is definitely able to do it, also, but it just didn't happen here.
