G. SIMON/G. Monfils
  3‑6, 6‑3, 7‑6, 2‑6, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   There is a very special atmosphere when you play with GaÃ«l.   Can you just comment on this and what it was like out there on Centre Court with those people doing the wave and all that?
GILLES SIMON:   Well, I think GaÃ«l is a fantastic player for the crowd.   He's doing a lot of things on the court.
He's an entertainer, and you have to deal with it because it's hard to focus sometimes when you face him. 
But I think he's bringing a lot to the game, and I'm really happy every time I have to play with him.
