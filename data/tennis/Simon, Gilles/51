  G. SIMON/D. Ferrer  6-3, 3-6, 6-1, 6-3   THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   Q.  Very hot day.  Going in against David Ferrer, one of the great grinders of his time.  What are you thinking going in?  How did you feel?  GILLES SIMON: Yeah, it was really, really difficult to play today.  I feel it was one of the hardest days for me on the court because it was hot and it was so humid. I never sweat like this in the last ten years, I feel (smiling).  So it was really difficult.  Plus, I was not really prepared because everyone was talking about the cooler day with maybe some rain (smiling). I didn't see it.  So, yeah, to play David in this condition is really demanding physically.  At one point I was really tired.  I felt it would be difficult. But then I had more energy; I felt he was in trouble, also.  I mean, it's not very often that him and me are tired like this just after two hours, but I feel we run a lot and, one more time, the conditions were tough.   Q.  What do you feel is the difference now in your game between now and when you were ranked No. 6 in the world?  GILLES SIMON: I don't know.  I just try my best every day.  I'm getting older, also, and I can't run like this every day.  I mean, I feel physically strong, but it's more because of the injury.  It's harder to be fit on every tournament. At that time I was just running every day.  Like it was normal for me.  I feel I'm a better tennis player, that I play better, but the ranking is over one year.  When you have too many injuries, then it's hard to have the same ranking. But I would just focus on now, on this tournament, playing the last 16.  I'm in good shape.  Just looking forward.   Q.  Do you feel the game has changed in that period?  Do you think the other guys are playing differently now or doing something different that makes it tougher?  GILLES SIMON: Yeah, yeah.  It's different definitely.  I mean, older guys, they are just ten centimeters taller and 15 kilos also more than before. Before was about the game.  Now I feel it's more about the serve, the return.  But that's how it is.  I just try my best every time to beat the guy I have in front of me.   Q.  In Melbourne last year you had these very high temperatures, over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, but not the humidity.  What is tougher?  How can you compare that condition to here?  GILLES SIMON: It's a few years that in Melbourne we have three days like incredible; this year we had it again. I don't know.  I feel it was too hot to play tennis in Melbourne.  So finally no one was able to play and we were just walking dead on the court and trying to support. But the intensity of the match was pretty low every time. Today what was hard is we just played and run everywhere.  It was more the combination of the heat and the humidity.   Q.  Your country has so many players who go deep into the slams, including this year.  What advice could you give to our country?  GILLES SIMON: Not many (smiling).  You win more titles than us, so won't give you any lesson in tennis.   Q.  You and Eric, you're the vice president for the players committee.  What's your priorities regarding to the players, and how is it going to be for you to be just representing the players with your busy schedule?  GILLES SIMON: Well, we have a lot of topics to discuss with the other guys, but the main one is definitely the negotiation we have with the 1000 events.  We had some long meetings here already before the tournament. But I'm really happy to do it.  I mean, it's really interesting.  Just happy to help the guys if I can.  Yeah.  That's it.
