R. BAUTISTA AGUT/G. Simon
  6‑3, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please, in French. 

Q.   After all those match points you saved, did you think you would be able to come back?
GILLES SIMON:   I tried, but I was not able to do that.   I would like to be able to do that each time. 
If I had won that second set, no one knows what would have happened.   He would have been down after that, I believe. 
But I didn't make it... 

Q.   It seemed you produced a lot better tennis than he did and still you lost. 
GILLES SIMON:   I didn't produce anything during that first set.   In fact, I was tired.   Long rallies were killing me.   In every game I was giving him a couple of free points, which hurts a lot on clay because from his side there were not many free points. 
In fact, if there was a long rally, each time I made mistakes right after, and it was very tough physically. 

Q.   Do you believe coming here straight after the Davis Cup was difficult?
GILLES SIMON:   Yes.   I knew it would be difficult anyway.   But I wanted to play this tournament because I like it and I did well last year here.   I thought maybe if I can win today, tomorrow is another day. 
In fact, I was hesitating between having some rest or playing because I do need to practice.   I tried to do both at the same time.   But during the week of practice, I didn't play well at all, so I knew it would be tough.   In this match I did have the opportunity to win. 

Q.   Are you tired physically or is it mental?
GILLES SIMON:   It's mainly a physical tiredness.   But, of course, both are related.   Sometimes I know I need to practice, like after the French Open, and I think I have to go adapt my game to grass.   I think, Okay, I want to practice, and at the same time I feel tired.   So it's the same here. 
But today I was not far from doing well. 

Q.   Is it just an impression or you're not very disappointed? 
GILLES SIMON:   I'm always disappointed when I lose a match, especially when I had breakpoints.   But this time I was serving so badly after those breaks, it was useless. 
It would have been easier to take if I had lost 6‑3, 6‑3.   But I may had match points; I was believing I could come back, so it was tough. 
But, as I said, during that week of practice, I didn't do well at all.   I can say today I played a lot better than during my practice, so I am absolutely not surprised.   I am disappointed, but not surprised. 

Q.   What is your schedule now?   You seem to hesitate between two different things. 
GILLES SIMON:   Yes, between resting or playing.   But I want to go Bucharest because I always had good results there, not only last year, but the years before, too.   I will go there without any pressure. 
If I win, it will be good for me.   But if I don't, I will have the opportunity of having a break for one week and practicing for one week. 

Q.   Are you pleased with the recent decision of increasing prize money in the French Open? 
GILLES SIMON:   I'm pleased to see that we're thinking the same way with the Grand Slams.   I believe this decision of increasing prize money has been welcomed very positively by the players.   It has been the result of a lot of work with the various Grand Slams, and it is extremely positive. 
It will be good for our sport.   I'm pleased that the French Open is following the decision made by the Australian Open and the other Grand Slams will follow. 

Q.   Do you want to continue to manage yourself?
GILLES SIMON:   Well, I am asking myself the question.   I believe I might have someone working with me.   It can happen. 
I believe I need to not only work on my physical fitness, but also on my game.   That is a lot easier with a coach.   So I know I have many things to improve. 
I have my experience playing alone.   So I believe someone would be very useful and it will happen before the French Open.
