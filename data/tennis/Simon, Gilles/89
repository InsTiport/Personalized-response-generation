R. NADAL/G. Simon
  6-4, 6-4, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Nadal said on the court you had a baby. 
 GILLES SIMON: Yeah. 

 Q. Two days ago?
 GILLES SIMON: Yeah. That's why I'm going to be short. (Laughter.) 

 Q. Boy or girl? 
 GILLES SIMON: Boy. 

 Q. Name? 
 GILLES SIMON: Timothy. Like Timothy in English. 

 Q. When is your flight home, and how eager are you to get home? 
 GILLES SIMON: As soon as possible. I don't know yet. But I had a great match to play this afternoon. I knew that if I lose, I will be home right after. 
 So my coach is doing the booking. (Smiling.) 

 Q. Were you distracted at all by these thoughts on the court?
 GILLES SIMON: A little bit. It's hard to focus for me the last three days. 
 But I think I was playing good. The two first sets were nice. I had some problem with my return today. I missed a lot of return. 
 And then the third set, I have to say that I was already in the plane. (Laughter.) 

 Q. Did Rafa say something to you at the net? I saw he gave a thumbs up. 
 GILLES SIMON: He knows I'm impatient to see my baby. He knows that I'm not really sad today, even if I lost. 

 Q. When did you first hear from your wife that she had the baby and what was your reaction?
 GILLES SIMON: Two days ago.

 Q. Thursday morning?
 GILLES SIMON: No. The night it was okay. When I woke up the morning, she told me, Baby is coming. So it was strange feeling. I mean, I was alone in my room. I definitely didn't want to be there, but I couldn't do anything. 
 I expecting him to arrive four weeks later, so it's just bad luck. 

 Q. First baby?
 GILLES SIMON: Yeah. 

 Q. You were in Manhattan in your hotel?
 GILLES SIMON: Yeah.

 Q. Were you planning to not play anything after the Open?
 GILLES SIMON: Yeah. 

 Q. So you thought it was all going to work great?
 GILLES SIMON: I was hoping to have more time, but... 

 Q. This is your first baby?
 GILLES SIMON: Yeah. Already asked. 

 Q. It seems like the French are doing really well this year. Overall I think there are six or seven players in the round of 32. I guess this means bigger, better things to come for the following year. Would you agree with that?
 GILLES SIMON: Well, we did better than the last year. I don't know why we had, you know, bad results here the years before, 'cause we likes when -- we like to play when it's fast. I mean, this is the fastest hard court. 
 Maybe we are tired at the end of the season. I don't know. But I think there is no reason. I don't think that it's an exception this year. I think it should be like this every year. 

 Q. Did you ever change a diaper?
 GILLES SIMON: Yeah. Was my cousins, because I'm the older one.
