J. CHARDY/G. Simon   
6-3, 6-0   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.   
 Q.  You were playing a bit better in Shanghai.  How did you feel today?  
GILLES SIMON: Not great.  Game-wise I didn't have a lot of energy, especially in my movements.  I was not able to play well.  I was late.  I was slow.  And I couldn't do much.   
I was hoping it was going to get better during the match, but it was worse and worse on the contrary.  So it was certainly not a match to be remembered.   
 Q.  Here at the end of the year we always take stock of the season.  What can you say about this year?  
GILLES SIMON: It was not my dream season, of course.  Many things happened.  It's just a pity to end the season on this kind of match because lately I was playing better and I wanted to do better than that here.   
But now I have been playing alone for a while.  I played many matches in a row, and today I didn't have enough energy left to do better.   
So now I'm going to stay quiet during the winter.  What I mean by that is I'm going to be alone.  I'm going to do my own stuff and I'll try to start next year good.   
 Q.  Did you think about having a coach next year?  Are you going to play alone again?  
GILLES SIMON: No, I'll stay alone, I believe.  But I need the physios and the trainers because totally alone is difficult.   
But of course, now we'll have to prepare during the offseason.  And I think I'm going to stay alone until I feel the desire to be with someone again.  It took a year last time I did that.   
 Q.  About your personal eagerness to play, how are you feeling especially about next year?  
GILLES SIMON: I love playing tennis.  I always want to play, and I still do.  But I didn't play like I wanted to today on the court.  I was too tense and I didn't enjoy it.  And the whole season was difficult because of that.   
My feeling is I had many matches in a row but I didn't play that much in the end, but it was many efforts that I had to make each time.   
The eagerness is still there.  I'm always happy to practice, to play matches.  I love tennis and nothing will stop me to love tennis.  But sometimes I can play better or sometimes not.  But I want to play.   
 Q.  You worked with a mental trainer.  Did it work?  Was it useful?  
GILLES SIMON: I mostly believe it was necessary.  It was even very important for me.  But it's like everything else.  Like physical practice, it is not the only solution.   
But I believe it was useful for me because I was playing better in the end of the season.  So I'll keep doing that and I'll see how it goes in the beginning of next season.
