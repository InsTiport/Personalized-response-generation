 Q.  Gilles Simon, another great win for you.  Second win in a row against Davydenko. 
 GILLES SIMON:  Yeah, that was a very nice match today.  It was close to be the perfect match for me:  6-4, 6-4. 
 I played my best tennis every time in the match, even when it was hard to finish the first and second set.  I made some winners and I was very aggressive, so for me that was a wonderful match. 

 Q.  You have to play twice today.  What are you going to do in between the two matches? 
 GILLES SIMON:  I don't know yet.  I'm going to stretch a little bit because I had a tough match yesterday night, very long.  This morning it was okay, but you never know.  Maybe I'm going to be so tired tonight. 
 So I just have to rest a little a little bit.  Maybe sit with the trainer for a little massage. 

 Q.  Tonight will be the winner of Almagro/Mathieu.  Another tough opponent. 
 GILLES SIMON:  Yes, but the draw is very hard.  There is so many good player.  This tournament is between a Masters Series and the US Open, so every player wants to play here.  I think that's why the draw is very hard. 
 Tonight is going to be a tough match for me, but it's going to be a tough match for everybody I think.
