 THE MODERATOR:   Of course it's been a busy day at Melbourne Park.  You had a good win against Taylor Fritz and also some good effort in the doubles.  Just talk to us about your experience today at Melbourne Park.
 JEREMY CHARDY:   Yeah, it was nice.  Is always nice when you win (smiling).
 I think I play really good match against Taylor this morning.  I played solid from the beginning to the end, so really happy with my levels in the beginning of the tournament.  And I was lucky that Stan could not play, and after, we play the doubles.  And it would be difficult to play two singles and one doubles, so I take the win against Stan and the win in doubles.
 Q. I will ask in English if you can respond in French.  It was a busy day today.
 JEREMY CHARDY:   (Answer in French.)
 Q. Not having to play the second match, how important is that for you physically because there is still so much tennis to be played?
 JEREMY CHARDY:   (Answer in French.)
 Q. Are you pretty comfortable and happy with the way you're hitting the ball at the moment?
 JEREMY CHARDY:   (Answer in French.)

 JEREMY CHARDY:   (Answer in French.)
 Q. Have you looked at the Australian Open draw?
 JEREMY CHARDY:   (Answer in French.)
