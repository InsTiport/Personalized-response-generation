A. MURRAY/J. Chardy
      6‑4, 6‑1, 6‑2

    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   The opinion was that you played very well in that match.   Would you agree?
    JEREMY CHARDY:   Yeah, I think I don't play bad today.   I played a good match, but he was too good for me. 
    I have a chance and I thought I try many thing, but no chance for me.   He was too good, so... 
    I played a good tournament, so I'm still happy.   But it's tough to lose with no solution.
