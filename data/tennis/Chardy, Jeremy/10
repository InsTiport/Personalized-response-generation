P. H. HERBERT/J. Chardy
2-6, 6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 9-7
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French, please.
Q. It has been quite a roller coaster match.  The fifth set, it was quite crazy.  What is your greatest regret?  How do you analyze it?
JEREMY CHARDY: I don't really have regrets on the match.  I'm happy with how I played.  I gave it all.  I fought until the end.
There's not one time during the match where I felt bad physically.  I fought with myself, with my feelings, sensations.
But then, at the fifth set, I was leading one break to have 4-1.  It cost a lot.  I needed to do a lot to go back afterwards.  If I do Love-40, then it can change if I have a double break.  But then he played well, and we had a nice fight, and that's it.
Q. When you actually save four match points, you actually believed in it until the end?  You still think that you can turn the match?
JEREMY CHARDY: I wasn't dead.  So if you still stand, you can still go further.  You always have a chance to rise up again.  I believed in it until the end, but he was stronger in the end.
That said, I'm quite happy with the way I play.  It was a pleasure playing today.  Physically and mentally I fought.
So I have to continue like this, and I hope that I will continue playing well.
Q. When you talk about a letdown, do you think that it's because of the two matches back to back yesterday?
JEREMY CHARDY: Well, especially the singles against Berdych, it was hard.  I had two sets zero.  They were quite nice sets.  And then the three sets I played the day after, they were hard.  There were a lot of emotions.  I lost a lot of energy on the court, but it was a beautiful victory.
And I was happy to have victories like this in the French Open.  Today was quite a fight as well.  I would have wished to win.  I didn't, unfortunately.
When I know that I've fought very much, I don't have, actually, a lot of regrets.
