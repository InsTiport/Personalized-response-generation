C. WOZNIACKI/S. Halep   
6-0, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Just talk us through what happened for you out there today.  
SIMONA HALEP: I think it was one of my bad days.  I made too many mistakes and she didn't miss.   
So I think I played both sides.  Also I did some good shots, good points, and I missed too many to win a match.   
After the first set, in the second set I felt that I can come back a little bit at 4-2 there.  Was a good game.  But it was too late.  I didn't feel the ball.  I don't know why.   
Also, the court a little bit slow, and I felt it heavy today, just today.  But that's it.   
 Q.  Did you feel a difference in the court compared to your first match...  
SIMONA HALEP: No, no, no.  No, myself.  Yeah, I felt a little bit heavier on court.  I felt everything slow, and I wanted to overhit the ball.   
 Q.  How much of it do you think was it you or that it was her?  She played very well, also.  Did you feel pressure, given how much she was covering the court and she wasn't missing a ton?  
SIMONA HALEP: Of course I give her credit for the victory.  She played well.   
But I missed too much.  I think if I just could keep the ball in, I think could have been much better.  But I played in her side today, in my opinion, and that was too much.   
 Q.  During the changeover, Darren was sort of urging you to stay in the point and not finish your points too quickly.  What do you think about what he said?  
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah.  I think he was right.  But at that moment I couldn't feel the ball.  I didn't feel it.   
I just maybe didn't try enough to keep the ball on court, but in my opinion I tried.  I fought.  I didn't give up.   
But I just couldn't feel, couldn't have the touch of the ball today.   
 Q.  Are you still optimistic of making the next round?  Obviously you have to win the next game, but based on the previous two years, even a win in next match wouldn't guarantee things for you.  
SIMONA HALEP: Even if I -- I'm not thinking about qualify.  I'm thinking about playing better than today, definitely.  Every time I go on court, I just want to be better than I have been two days ago or one day ago.   
So everything I have in my head is just to shake this off and just playing better next round.   
 Q.  Looking ahead, then, to your next match, what are your thoughts on either of the players?  
SIMONA HALEP: Do you want me to announce it now?   
 Q.  Some thoughts.  
SIMONA HALEP: Okay.  Let's have positive thoughts, then.   
 Q.  Positive thoughts would be nice.  
SIMONA HALEP: I served pretty okay today.  I returned okay.  Just during the points I missed too many, and I wanted to overhit the ball.   
So maybe next round I have just to calm down and to keep the ball in play more and make the opponent run.   
 Q.  Obviously Wozniacki has played very good.  This surface seems to suit her.  Was there more nerves, I guess, going out there today than maybe even in your first match, just knowing that you were going to have to play really well against her?  
SIMONA HALEP: Not really.  It was nothing different than previous match.   
I practiced very good, the warmup.  Everything was okay.  Of course I know that she's very tough opponent, but I didn't feel that she does everything on court because she didn't make many winners.  I mean, I knew that her game is just to keep playing, to put you in a difficulty, but also, I knew that I have a chance against her because I won many times on hard.   
But still, I keep my opinion that I missed too much, and this was everything of the match.
