S. HALEP/B. Strycova
6-3, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Relatively quick morning for you, but still a tricky opponent. How did you navigate the match today?
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, definitely was a little bit early. With the jetlag, it's not easy. I was motivated to go on court and to give everything I have, to play well, to fight for the victory.
It's always tough against her because, as you said, it's tricky. She comes to the net. Sometimes she slices the balls. It's never easy to play against her.
But I'm confident every time because I have few matches won against her, so it's a good thing for me.
Q. The point where you sprinted, hit that cool volley...
SIMONA HALEP: That was nice (smiling).
Q. How proud are you of yourself?
SIMONA HALEP: Very proud. Very proud. I think it's the ball of the match, maybe of the tournament.
Q. In terms of your movement today, everything, despite all the jetlag, that has to be one of the better performances from front to back that you've had here in Wuhan in a while.
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, definitely I think it's one of the best matches that I played here. I came Wednesday, so I had enough time to get ready with the jetlag.
I'm motivated to win matches here. I try my best. I'm positive. It's a good start. I'm looking forward to the next one.
Q. Some frustrating moments in the middle of the second set when things were close. Anything she was doing with her game, or readjusting to match conditions?
SIMONA HALEP: As I always look for perfection, I'm frustrated, yeah, many times during the matches.
But it was a positive frustration today. Just I wanted to make sure that I understood what I missed, and next ball to make it better. It was a positive match with everything.
