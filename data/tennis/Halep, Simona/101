S. HALEP/V. Williams
6-2, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Were you relieved to get that match done so quickly after a long day?
SIMONA HALEP: Well, yeah, it was good that it was so short after that first long match.  I saw that Venus was not feeling great, so we cannot talk about this match too much.
But I'm happy even in this situation I could win the match.
Q. How are you feeling physically after the first match?
SIMONA HALEP: I feel better.  I feel more relaxed.  That first match was really important.  I got very tired.  But then I had about four hours to recover.  It was good.
We will see tomorrow when I wake up because for sure I will be sore.
Q. Next game you're playing tomorrow night, Caroline Garcia.  What do you expect from her?
SIMONA HALEP: I expect a tough one, as usual.  We played many times, so we know each other pretty well.
It's going to be a new day, a new match.  Hopefully I will be close to 100% physically.  If I feel good, I can just give my best, try to fight till the end, and believing that I can win.
Q. What are the challenges when you're facing weather days, playing twice in one day, staying with your routine and having to recover so quickly?
SIMONA HALEP: Well, yeah, I don't really know the routine because we don't play very often two matches in a day.  But today I just chilled, I just stayed on the couches in players lounge.  I tried to sleep.  I couldn't.  I rested.
I felt great on court.  Also the atmosphere gave me energy.  I felt like I'm enjoying the time on court.  That's why maybe I played well.
Q. There were six Romanians in the main draw this week.  I asked the other girls why.  They said when you started getting good results, it changed everything in Romania.  How do you explain the growth of tennis in Romania?  Do you feel you have a responsibility?
SIMONA HALEP: Well, it's a good responsibility.  I take it positive.  I try just to inspire the kids.  Many kids started to play tennis because of my results.  It's a nice thing.  Also gives me a lot of energy and a lot of, you know, confidence.
Yeah, I think we work pretty much.  We work well.  We are very ambitious players.  I think everyone is just giving the best on court.
Coming from a small country, we have maybe a bigger desire to get in the top.
Q. Do you find when you're playing an opponent that played earlier in the day that the matches would go by quicker?  Do you find there's a difference in the pace of the match, the speed?
SIMONA HALEP: You mean, if I take the first match and...
Q. If you're playing a player that has only a few hours of recovery time, what is the pace of the match like compared to if you had the day to relax?
SIMONA HALEP: Actually, I can say very honest when the rain started, I wanted it to stop because I felt that I'm a little bit fresher, more fresher than her.  I just wanted to play tonight.
I think it was an advantage for me to play tonight without injury, so I was able to run and to stay very well on court.  But I think for both of us was a little bit tough today.  I just want to take, like, a great day.  You don't have very often these days, winning two matches, with tough opponents.
It's just been a good evening.  I try just enjoy it.
Q. It's 8-0 against Pavlyuchenkova.  This one was tough.  What made it so difficult out there for you?
SIMONA HALEP: I think every match is difficult against her.  We played many matches three sets.  She's a very strong opponent.  She hits the ball very strong.  She's fast.  Today she was moving really, really well.  It was really tough for me to adjust myself to this match because it's been a long time since I played the last match in Wimbledon.
I had just to stay there focused, to be concentrated for every point, which was not easy.  I just hoped in the end that she's going to miss more than me (smiling).
Q. You're playing well in Montreal.  Do you like poutine by any chance?
SIMONA HALEP: Who?
Q. Poutine, a typical dish in Montreal.
SIMONA HALEP: I never tried.
Q. You should.
SIMONA HALEP: I will.  What is it about?
Q. It's fries, gravy and melted cheese.
SIMONA HALEP: Okay, I like how it sounds (smiling).
Q. A lot of calories.
SIMONA HALEP: That's okay, I had a pancake last night.  Tonight I will have two.
Q. First game you had something on your foot.  Is that an issue?
SIMONA HALEP: It was a blister.  We often have blisters.  It doesn't look very bad.  It bothers me when I run.  I have to treat it a little bit tonight.
