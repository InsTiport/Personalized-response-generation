S. HALEP/S. Errani
  6‑2, 6‑0

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Congratulations.   That seemed like a very strong win for you.   How did you feel about your performance?
SIMONA HALEP:   Yeah.   Thank you.   It was a difficult match, because before the match I couldn't prepare very well the match because I'm not 100%.   I cannot run very well on court because I have my injury.
But I was very strong mentally and just wanted to be focused every point, because she's a great player and I know she's coming back very well during the match and she's running well.
So I just wanted to be aggressive and to finish the point as soon as I can.

Q.   Can we say that you took your revenge from her?
SIMONA HALEP:   Yes, I can say that, because I didn't forget the match in Miami.   She beat me so fast, so quickly. 
And here I just wanted to change the tactic and to be more aggressive than that time.

Q.   Can you talk a bit about the game of tomorrow?
SIMONA HALEP:   I don't know yet against who I will play, but both of them are good players, good players and they are different. 
Radwanska is playing different game, smart game.   Wickmayer is hitting the ball very strong.   So I will see after they finish what game I have to prepare.

Q.   Can you talk a little bit about the injury and where you feel it's at or how much it's injuring you?
SIMONA HALEP:   It's an injury like my Achilles.   I feel pain, and when I'm running I feel it.   So I hope it will be not very dangerous and to be well soon.
