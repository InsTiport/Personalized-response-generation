C. GARCIA/S. Halep
6-4, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Talk about the match a little bit.  Seemed like you played pretty well, but maybe just the key moments were a little bit off today?
SIMONA HALEP: Well, yeah, I consider that she won the match, I didn't lose it.  Of course, I couldn't be, like, 100% after yesterday.  It was a little bit tough.  I felt tired a little bit.  My legs were a little bit sore.
But I think I fought till the end, which I'm really happy about.  She played an amazing tennis.  To win two tournaments in a row, it's a great thing.  She deserved to win today.  She was better.
Q. There are many who wonder how she is doing what she's done over the last two tournaments.  Standing across the net from her today compared to Toronto, what did you see she did particularly well that can explain her rise?
SIMONA HALEP: Well, always she has been very solid, very strong.  She hits the ball very strong.  Her serve is very good.
I think she's playing the same, just more confidence.  She had this level also in Toronto.  Every tournament she played, she looked very confident.  But now I think just change something in her mind.  Was just dominating all the matches.  Credit to her and congrats to her.
Was not easy for me today to run to the balls.  Like I said, I was a little bit tired.  But it's normal.  To be honest, I cannot be sad, sorry (smiling).
Q. Did having this No. 1 figure hanging over your head make any difference facing an opponent?  Does it give them an extra incentive to beat you?
SIMONA HALEP: Well, I don't know this.  But I can imagine that everyone wants to win against the world No. 1.  Like I am always when I play against No. 1 in the world, I always want to win.  Gives maybe more energy, more confidence, to play without fear.  Today she just played really well.
In my mind nothing changes.  I'm just happy now, and I want to go home.  Then next week, actually after few days, I will be back on court and thinking about Singapore, the last tournament, then I will relax completely myself.
Q. Before the match, were you expecting that maybe she would be more tired than you because she had so many hours on the court?  Were you surprised that physically she seemed pretty okay?
SIMONA HALEP: Well, I can say that she was pretty strong physically.  I was, as well.  But for me was emotional.  Was too much yesterday.  My body was just sore after yesterday's match.  Even if was not three sets or something like that, I just felt a little bit over inside because of the happiness.
But I think we played a great match, and she did better than me today.
Q. What have the last 24 hours been like?
SIMONA HALEP: I couldn't sleep too well (laughter).
Q. No?
SIMONA HALEP: No, I couldn't sleep very well.  In the morning, I was, like, Okay, now I have to focus again, to go on court and work, which I did.  It was very good.  It was a very good step, important step.  But still inside I was too happy.
Q. Were you just on the phone all day yesterday?
SIMONA HALEP: I had many messages, but I couldn't reply to all of them.  It's not easy to stay just on the phone.  I just talked to important people that I'm talking every day.  I didn't reply, so I will have time next days.
Q. Given the circumstances of how you felt when you woke up this morning, everything that's happened, are you okay with the performance today?
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, I'm okay.  Of course, I wanted to win the match.  It was not very far to win it.  But just I felt my legs that are gone a little bit.  It's normal.
I think I played well.  I hit the ball well.  I served pretty okay.  But she served better in the important moments.  So I'm okay with the performance and I'm okay that I could do a great match.
