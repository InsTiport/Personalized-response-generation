S. HALEP/L. Tsurenko
6-2, 6-1
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. That must have been a relief to come through quite a quick match after a couple of challenging starts?
SIMONA HALEP: Well, to be honest, I expected a tough one, because always when I played against her, the second set, I was in trouble.
But she changed the plan today.  She was hitting really, like, strong and wanted to finish the points fast.  That's why she missed that much.
But I had in my head that I have to stay very strong, to play more aggressive, to stay closer to the baseline, which I did, and when I have the chance, to open the court.
So I think today was a better match.  I played better.  And I felt better on court.
Q. How much of a worry was it, the amount of times you dropped your serve in that match?
SIMONA HALEP: When I dropped my serve?  In the first set, I think...
I was not worried, because it's happening often (smiling), losing my serve.  I'm very confident on my return, so I didn't think something negative.  I didn't have in my head something negative.  I just looked forward for the next point.
Q. How much did nerves play a factor, now that you've had a few matches to get into things?  Are you feeling more comfortable now?
SIMONA HALEP: Before the match, I was really nervous.  I have to admit big emotions, but it's normal.  I'm here again.  I'm feeling good, and I have expectations for myself to play good tennis.
But after few games, I was free emotions, and I could focus on the game.  I think I managed very well the atmosphere before the match and the feelings that I had, and I played a good match.
Q. We have seen former champion GarbiÃ±e Muguruza do her speech in French.  Are you going to be doing your speech in French postmatch?
SIMONA HALEP: I hope in this life, but I don't know until I will finish tennis.  I will keep working on that.
