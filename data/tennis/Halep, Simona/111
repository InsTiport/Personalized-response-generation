S. HALEP/A. Petkovic
7-5, 6-0
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.
Q. How difficult was it to sort of concentrate after Andrea hurt her knee in the second set?
SIMONA HALEP: Well, I knew that -- I saw actually when she hurt herself.  I didn't think about that.  I just tried to keep the focus there.  It's always tough when you cut your rhythm a little bit, and was long, like, five, six minutes.
But, yeah, I didn't think about injury.  I just kept playing what I did also in first set but a little bit better in the end.
I was happy with the performance, and I feel sorry for her that she got injured.
Q. Do you think it's your best match since the beginning of the tournament?
SIMONA HALEP: Well, I play better and better day by day.  I can say that today I really felt the ball, and the game, also, and the way that I finished pretty strong, give me confidence.  And, yeah, I can say it was the best match here at this tournament.
Q. She just said in the first set she felt the quality was very high because you make her run and run and run and in the end she finds herself praying to God for it to finish.  How does it make you feel knowing that what you do is you make players play their best tennis to try and beat you?
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, always happens the same, no (smiling).
I don't know what I'm doing, but I think they are motivated when they get on court with me.  I was in that situation when I was younger and I was playing with the No. 1 in the world.  You don't feel pressure, don't feel anything that you have to lose.
So you go there and just give your best.  It's good that I have opponents playing at the highest level, because I stay, like, motivated, focused, and I don't go relaxed on court.
Q. You have had another great week so far, and we know that you are enjoying your tennis.  Do you think you are struggling a bit to find your rhythm early on in some matches and do you think there is a reason for that?
SIMONA HALEP: No, today was a little bit different, because the court is pretty small, and I felt that all the people were on court with me.  So it was tough to adjust myself, coming from Chatrier it's a bit difficult.  But, you know, I just needed a few games and then I think I played okay.  I think I played well.
She was at the very high level of tennis, and it was tough to play every point there, to run for every point, and also to stay focused.
So I did pretty well in the end of the first set, and then I felt more confident and then I felt I could dominate the match.
Q. Talking about the court, were you surprised to play in this court and not Chatrier or Lenglen or No. 1?
SIMONA HALEP: Not surprised, but, you know, I'm here to play anywhere.  I have no problems.  Of course it was different, but no excuses.  I just try to find myself on that court.  I practiced there last week, so all good.
