THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  I was wondering how are you feeling coming into this tournament?  You had withdrawn from Doha with injury but came back in Indian Wells.  How are you feeling?  Back in top form?  
SIMONA HALEP: Well, I think good.  I have no problems, no injuries.  So this is the most important thing.  I played okay in Indian Wells.  I had some tough moments but now I'm back.   
I practiced hard these days.  Still practicing today.  Tomorrow I will have match.   
I think I feel ready to start the tournament.  It's going to be a tough one, for sure.  It's a big tournament, so every match is going to be difficult.  But I'm here just to give my best and to try to win every match I play.   
 Q.  (Question about soccer.)  
SIMONA HALEP: Well, my brother also always was with Barcelona, so I will take Barcelona.  I'm not following soccer.  I like soccer, but it's too tough for me to stay and watch 90 minutes of football, of soccer, so I don't follow but I will take Barcelona.   
 Q.  With the upcoming tournament next year, change of venue, what are your thoughts of that?  (Indiscernible.) Are you going to miss this site?  
SIMONA HALEP: I didn't have the chance to go there, so I don't know how it looks.  I just saw some pictures about it.   
Of course we are gonna miss this place because we used already to play here, like five, six years for me.  It's not easy to change things, but for sure it's -- it's something new, so will be interesting and it will be nice, for sure.
