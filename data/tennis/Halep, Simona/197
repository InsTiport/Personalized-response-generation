S. ROGERS/S. Halep   
6-3, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  She played great.  On your side, did you feel a bit less at your usual level?  
SIMONA HALEP: Definitely she played well.  I think she played very high standard.  I had pain at my knee.   
For me, in the second set, was difficult to move anymore, but she deserved to win.  She was aggressive, and she hit very strong, the balls.   
 Q.  Did you think you could withdraw before this tournament, or you thought it was it would be okay to play?  
SIMONA HALEP: No, I'm never thinking to withdraw a tournament, because it's not in my inside.   
But I tried.  I had some anti-inflammatory before the match, and the previous days.  But when you have the tension of the match, official match, the pressure, it comes harder.   
So I had harder pain, and I couldn't do what I wanted.   
 Q.  When did you start feeling the pain in the knee, generally?  
SIMONA HALEP: About Singapore, first time.  Every day I had pain.  But offseason was okay.  I didn't feel much.   
But then in China, the first match, end of the first match, I felt it.  Here I had every day pain.   
But was not that hard like today.  But at 5-3 today, I felt at one -- at one point I felt the knee very strong.   
 Q.  Does it impact you more when you run or when you...  
SIMONA HALEP: Every time.   
 Q.  Do you know what the issue is, specifically?  
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, I have tendinitis.  The tendon.   
 Q.  Which knee?  
SIMONA HALEP: Left.   
 Q.  So what is the plan?  Is it to rest...  
SIMONA HALEP: I don't know yet.   
 Q.  Surgery?  
SIMONA HALEP: No, no, surgery.  Not that bad.  I need MRI again, and just maybe take some rest and physiotherapy to get it well.   
 Q.  How frustrating is it?  
SIMONA HALEP: It's second time.  It's a bit -- yeah, I'm a bit frustrated, but you cannot change much.   
I'm okay.  Just looking ahead.  It happens, and I just want to be well with the knee.   
And then I will think about the game.   
 Q.  Was it from the initial point of, like, the first point of the match?  Did it start then, or sort of progress throughout?  
SIMONA HALEP: No, no, no.  I can play about 45, 50 minutes without pain.  And then it comes.   
But today was about 5-3 in the first set, so then it was tough to fight.   
 Q.  When you talk about the tension kind of mounting throughout the match, you had the one break point that maybe was a missed opportunity there.  Do you feel like at that point things got a little bit tighter, more stress?  
SIMONA HALEP: Not really.  I was a little bit, yeah, upset I didn't finish that backhand.  I still have it in my mind.   
But it's -- anyway, I think the pain was thereafter few games.  I cannot say much about the game, because I couldn't do my best.  So I think it's the first match when I say, like, because of the pain I couldn't do much today.   
But, still, it was a match, important match.  But it's okay.  She deserved to win.  She was stronger today than me.   
 Q.  How do you feel, like, you're going to be able to come back long term?  Do you think it will be an issue for future tournaments?  Are you going to take time off?  
SIMONA HALEP: Can be, yeah.  Can be, but I'm not sure now.  I didn't see the doctor yet.  I need an MRI.  But, yeah, probably need some time off to get it well, recovered, because it's difficult to play with the pain, and the knees are dangerous.  So I have to take care.
