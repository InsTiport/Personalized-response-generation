S. HALEP/A. Sevastova   
6-4, 6-3   
 Q.  Simona, another good win.  What did you make of that match?  Do you think your level was better today than it was yesterday?  
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah.  I can say that it was a little bit better.  I felt the ball a little bit better.  But you know, it's different opponent, so it's always tough to compare the matches.  But the most important thing that I can win the match.  It was not easy.  We had some important moments during the match.  So I'm really glad that I could finish it in two sets and play like I played.  I mean I'm really pleased with the way I played today and very confident.   
 Q.  I know that you're obviously trying to get your game more aggressive and you were, especially in Australia.  Here do you feel like you're being more aggressive or do you feel like it's the same level that you were executing in January?  
SIMONA HALEP: It's tough to say because I cannot feel it 100 percent the rhythms because there it was a little bit different.  Pressure was different.  Here is a little bit like more relaxed for me and I can go for it easier.  So I'm looking to do that more and more.  And I can say that the little percentages more aggressive are my game here than Melbourne.   
 Q.  Next you've got young CiCi Bellis.  
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah.  I feel old.   
 Q.  She said that Pliskova was one of her idols.  So that makes all of us feel old.  But what are your thoughts on her game and how she's developed?  I mean for an 18-year-old and that group of 18, 17, 19-year-olds, how good do you think she is?  
SIMONA HALEP: She's very good.  I saw her playing a few times, not today but in the past.  I feel that she's moving pretty well.  She's hitting fast.  She tries to be aggressive, close to the baseline.  So I will see tomorrow.  I never played against her.  I never practiced with her.  So it's going to be a new thing, new challenge.  But I'm ready, and I feel that I have just to do my game, not thinking about anything else.   
 Q.  So you and Wozniacki are close to the No. 1 ranking.  How much do you think about that or not at all?  
SIMONA HALEP: Not at all.  I don't have any idea about the points.  I know that there is like 300, or it was at the beginning of the tournament.  But I'm not thinking about that.  I just want to play my matches and to win them.   
 Q.  And Federer is almost similar.  He might be No. 1 this week.  What are your thoughts on him achieving that at this age?  
SIMONA HALEP: We were talking today, me with my team about him.  And I asked them how long since he was number -- how long is it since he was No. 1 in the world.  I think four years.   
 Q.  2012.  
SIMONA HALEP: 2012.  Six years.  Wow.  That's going to be great, and I wish him to achieve another record.   
 Q.  And how do you feel so far playing with Nike?  You've had two matches.  
SIMONA HALEP: Great.  Great.  I feel great on court, and I really enjoy my outfit.  The shoes and everything.  I feel happy that I have this chance to play with Nike.   
 Q.  So it's been two weeks it's Australian Open, and we are going to have a big tournament coming up in Indian Wells and Miami.  So what is the importance of this tournament?  I mean what is the main focus for you?  Being healthy or just winning matches as many as possible?  
SIMONA HALEP: Well, I am healthy.  I have just a little injury on my foot.  And the doctor said that it is nothing dangerous.  It's just the pain that is bothering me.  But nothing can be worse than this.  So I'm trying just to do the treatment every day, to -- not forcing it, but at the moment it's not getting worse during the matches.  I feel the pain, but it's the same, in the same level.  So I will wait.  Day by day I will see how it is and then I will decide if something is getting worse.  But both are important.  Also the tournament, also my health.  So I will see.   
 Q.  After so many years of the start of the season being very frustrating for you, how good and how different does it feel this year to kind of -- you only lost one match, you're playing well.  
SIMONA HALEP: Well, yeah, it's very different.  But I started the year with a very good preseason.  I was not sick, cold.  I was not injured.  So I could train properly.  And then I was more relaxed.  I achieved the No. 1 place last year, and maybe that helped me to relax myself and to just enjoy the matches and the moments on court.  So I think also the work that I've done mentally I think helped me to have a good start.  I just take it and I don't want to analyze too much.  Just take it like it is.
