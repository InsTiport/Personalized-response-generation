    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please.   
   
 Q.   There are a few players left in this tournament who are the only players from their own country in the tournament.   How do you feel about representing Romania in this tournament?  
    SIMONA HALEP:   I feel good that I can represent Romania in quarterfinals in this tournament, so it's amazing feeling.   
    I hope that next round I will try my best again, I will do my best again, to win the match to be in the semifinals.  
    But I have to be very focused to fight for the match and to be happy, because it's first time quarterfinals in Paris.  
   
 Q.   She's a tough opponent.   You lost to her a couple of times.   Tell me about the match today and what you felt like you did better than in the past.   
    SIMONA HALEP:   Yeah, she beat me in Australia on hard, but I remember that I beat her in Barcelona on clay court a long time ago.   But was good for me because I knew how to play on clay.   She's better I think on hard court.   I'm better on clay.   So I had advantage.  
    I think I managed very well the match.   I opened the angles.   I wanted to do her ‑‑to run a lot on court.   I think I played aggressive.   I dominated the match, I think.  
    I didn't serve very well, but I tried to return better, and I did.   
    So it was a very tough match.   She's a great player.   We both, I think we played good tennis today.  
   
 Q.   You have won a lot of matches in the last year.   Talk about how that process has helped you at these bigger tournaments.   You won a lot of smaller tournaments, a lot of matches all over the place.   
    SIMONA HALEP:   Yeah, I had a lot of matches.   I didn't play just small tournaments.   Because I played also Doha, and I won quarterfinals in Australia, and Madrid also I did finals.   
    I have more confidence in me now, and I try to do my best at Grand Slam also.   I'm in quarterfinals second time this year.   I'm happy, and I feel prepared to go more far.  
   
 Q.   You say you love clay.   Why is it?   Is it because it's more tactical than the other surfaces?  
    SIMONA HALEP:   Yeah, you have more time to think about the point, to run.   You have to run a lot.   
    But I love to play on clay, but I don't think that it's my best surface because also on the hard court I played really well, and I like to finish the point very fast.  
    So hard court is also good for me.   I played really well everywhere.   So I have to try on grass court more, because I didn't play very well last year.  
    Yeah, I feel good on clay, and I think that my game, it's also good for clay court.   
   
 Q.   What prompted you to take off the visor?  
    SIMONA HALEP:   Yes.   
   
 Q.   What prompted that?  
    SIMONA HALEP:   I don't know.   Just natural.   Because maybe it disturbed me at that moment, and I wanted to continue without it.   
   
 Q.   You and Sloane were ranked pretty close together, but you have made a jump up since then.   What advice would you give to her?  
    SIMONA HALEP:   What advice I want?   
   
 Q.   What advice would you give to Sloane for her career?  
    SIMONA HALEP:   She's very tough player.   She's a great player.   I believe that she will be in top very soon.  
    She's very strong.   Her game, her ball, it's very heavy when you play.   
    So I had to fight today and to run a lot during the points.   So she's very great player, and I wish her good luck and keep going like this, because she's very tough player.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel ready to win this tournament?  
    SIMONA HALEP:   I'm still so far because I have to play quarterfinals only, so will be very tough match next round.  
    I believe in my chance, but I don't think too far.   So I stay focused for my quarterfinals first.
