S. HALEP/Y. Duan
3-6, 6-3, 6-2
Q. A big fight out there.  Take us through your match.
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, it's been a great match.  I think she played really well.  She's a very strong player and on grass court is really difficult.
But I'm happy that I could manage and to win this match was important.
Q. With the rain here, schedule is pretty crazy.  You're going to have to play two matches today.
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, it's something new, so I have just to get ready as soon as possible and to go to try to win the second one.
