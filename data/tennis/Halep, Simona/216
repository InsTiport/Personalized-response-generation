S. HALEP/F. Schiavone
  6‑1, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

Q. Congratulations. That was a very convincing win. How do you sum it all up?
SIMONA HALEP: It was a good match. I played really well. I was very happy with the way that I mixed the game. She played sometimes soft. Sometimes she hit the ball. 
So it was a good match. I think I did pretty well on all what I had to do, because I knew before the match how I have to play. So I think I did pretty well.

Q. Does it mean more to you considering that you weren't able to play any grass court events leading in?
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah. Actually, if you don't play matches before coming here, you are a bit stressed that you are not prepared like official for competition. But like I said, I had many days practicing here, playing points. So I was ready to start the tournament. 
I feel good here. Hopefully I will have many more good matches.

Q. Do you have a favorite match that you have played at Wimbledon in your mind?
SIMONA HALEP: Favorite match? Definitely would be the first one on Centre Court in 2014. First round I played good tennis and first time on Centre Court, so was amazing.

Q. How far do you think you are from that form you had in 2014?
SIMONA HALEP: I'm not very far, but it's a different situation. I'm two years older already, so it's a bit changed. (Smiling.) I feel good, I feel prepared, I feel my game, so I feel confidence. I just have to go on court and to play my best tennis if I can.

Q. Can you talk about your next match with Kiki Bertens. 
SIMONA HALEP: It will be a tough one. I know her. She's in good form now. She played semis I think in French Open.
It's different here. It's grass. I played against her many years ago, so I don't know pretty ‑‑I don't know her very well. But it's gonna be a tough one. It's gonna be a good challenge for me. And why not? I have to believe that I can win it. 

Q. Were you surprised by her results in Roland Garros?
SIMONA HALEP: No, I was not surprised because I knew her since many years ago, like I said, and she plays different a little bit, under the ball, and the ball is coming different. She's strong. She has power. She serves well. I was not surprised that she's doing good job.

Q. And the same preparation. No grass. She was injured. 
SIMONA HALEP: She was injured. I didn't know. Yeah, that's why.
We'll see tomorrow or after tomorrow.

Q. Is it tomorrow?
SIMONA HALEP: Tomorrow? 

Q. Yeah, I don't know. You think so?
SIMONA HALEP: I don't know. Maybe. It's a good chance to play tomorrow, but I'm not sure.
