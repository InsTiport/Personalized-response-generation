S. HALEP/Z. Diyas
7-6, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How does it feel coming into this year's Championships compared to last year?
SIMONA HALEP: I feel better.  I feel more confident, more relaxed, I can say.
I have already few good matches in Madrid on clay.  I feel good.  Yeah, I just want to do my job here.
Q. Diyas came out pretty strong in the first set.  What thoughts were running through your mind when you were down 4-1?
SIMONA HALEP: I expected a tough match.  I played two times against her and I know that the score was easier, but still I felt her very dangerous.
She has a flat game and today she played really well.  First set she was hitting all the balls and very flat, so the ball didn't bounce too much.  I stayed a little bit too far from court.  I couldn't make anything like strong.
But she's served well; she returned well.  My serve wasn't very strong today and I struggled a lot with it.  But in the end I found the rhythm.  I found the way to play aggressive, to dominate the game, and I finished it in two sets.
Q. The last time you got to the third round you in fact made it to the final.  Does that give you extra confidence going forward?
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah.  You know, I'm not thinking about finals.  It's very far.  I'm thinking just for the third round.
I had two good matches here already.  I'm looking forward to play the third one.  I expect a tough one.  She's a young player and she has nothing to lose.  It's going to be good match, and hopefully I will win it.  I'm here to win.
Q. Talk about looking into the next round.  What do you think you'll be looking to improve from today?  Obviously the serve.
SIMONA HALEP: Serve for sure.
Q. Anything else that stands out?
SIMONA HALEP: The serve.  Today I think I was bit too stressed and that's why my arm was blocked.  I think everything is okay, but still I have to work.
I have almost two days until the third round.  I have enough time to prepare myself to get ready for the next round.
