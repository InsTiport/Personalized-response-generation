S. HALEP/A. Sevastova   
6-4, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  It's looking like it's easy.  You're playing very, very simply, very quickly.  Do the matches feel quite tough?  
SIMONA HALEP: No, the match felt quite tough.  Was not easy at all.  I can say that I'm not playing my best tennis in this moment, but winning, even if I play less good, I think it's a big plus for me.  It gives me a little bit more power, inside power that I can handle it.   
So I won against 15th player in the world playing not as I want.  It's a big thing, and I'm really happy about it.   
 Q.  What's stopping you from playing as you want?  
SIMONA HALEP: I don't know.  If I would know, I would have changed something.  But maybe just a little bit, like, tough days, it's normal.   
I had a big run before, so now I'm just working harder, I can say.  Just believing that it will come fast.
