  6‑4, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.

Q.   Good week playing against Azarenka last week, and now coming from the qualifiers and one big one gone. 
SIMONA HALEP:   Yeah, I played really good these matches.   It's not easy because I played a good player today.   I tried just to do my best and to play my game. 
So finally was very good for me.   I am very happy.

Q.   What can you draw from this sort of experience wherein you play the big ones all the time?
SIMONA HALEP:   Yeah, last week I played with very good players.   I have more experience now and I believe in my chance more than before.   I feel the ball very good, the court, and I feel my game very good. 
So it was important, the victory against Hantuchova. [Sic]   After that match I believed more in me, and so I play better every day I play better.

Q.   So you look at a much better future? 
SIMONA HALEP:   Yeah, I want to improve more and to stay more hard on the court and to run a lot, to hit the ball, and to stay calm, relax.

Q.   You're still in Constanta?
SIMONA HALEP:   Yes.

Q.   What was it like growing up in a portside city?
SIMONA HALEP:   Yeah, actually I have three years I stayed in ‑‑ I moved in Bucharest, the capital, because from there is my coach and I have to practice there. 
So at my home I didn't stay long time.   But I started there the tennis, and it's a very nice city.   I love it, and I want to come back there, to go back there.

Q.   To Constanta?
SIMONA HALEP:   Yes.

Q.   It's a very good place.   What sort of following do you have in Constanta?   Are you famous?   Do people recognize you?
SIMONA HALEP:   Yes, they know me.   It's nice when I go home.   So it's not ‑‑ like I'm not very famous because I am top 50.   I have to improve more and to be more famous probably.
But I feel good in my city.   The people are very nice with me.

Q.   And your father, the shop, everything is in Constanta?
SIMONA HALEP:   Yes, yes.   My parents are in Constanta, my family. 

Q.   What would you say was the difference today between your game and Anastasia's?   What were you doing better that she was struggling with? 
SIMONA HALEP:   So the wind was very hard today.   Wasn't easy to play.   But I think I played better in important moments, so I hit the ball.   I played one time before against her in the juniors, and I knew that‑‑ I knew her game, and so I just stayed there and I hit the ball. 

Q.   She's renowned for being quite a heavy hitter.   If you give her a flat ball to hit, she can perhaps blow her opponents away.   Was there a tactic to move her around or take that strength away from her a bit?
SIMONA HALEP:   My tactic was to hit away from her body and not very flat, because she block very good.
I tried and I did.   I think I did good. 

Q.   How do you feel now in the tournament obviously having played quallies and...
SIMONA HALEP:   So it's first time here and it's amazing.   I like very much.   The courts are very good.   The people are good.
Tomorrow I have a very difficult match with Wozniacki, against Wozniacki, and I will try to play my best and to enjoy the match.   Going to be a nice match.

Q.   Is it a good time ‑‑ is it evera good time ‑‑ but is it a better time to play Caroline now, you know, having lost the No. 1 ranking, having gone out early in Qatar? 
SIMONA HALEP:   Yes, I think it's a good time.   Was my dream to play against her when she was No. 1, but is late now and she's No. 3 or something like this.   So she's a good player, very good player.   I have to enjoy.
