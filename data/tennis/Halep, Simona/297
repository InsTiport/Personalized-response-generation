  S. HALEP/J. Gajdosova  6-2, 6-2  An interview with:  SIMONA HALEP   THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   Q.  When you know that Rafa is playing before you, are you in the mindset that you're expecting this to be a long wait?  SIMONA HALEP: No, I didn't expect.  But, you know, that's tennis.  Sometimes we have to wait few hours to play.  But was okay.  If I won, everything was okay.   Q.  What were you doing when you were waiting all this time?  How do you keep your mindset in the right way?  SIMONA HALEP: I just stay in the locker room or in the lounge, players lounge, with my team.  We are speaking, laughing.  Normal things.  Nothing special.   Q.  Do you think it makes a little bit more sense to put the women's match before the men in the night session?  SIMONA HALEP: I think, yes.  I believe that is better to play first at 7:00 the ladies because it's maximum three hours of a match if the match is long.  But to wait like five sets before playing, it's so tough.  But, you know, sometimes has to be like this, so you have to accept.   Q.  Do you enjoy playing a hometown hero, the Aussie?  SIMONA HALEP: It's not easy because everyone is with the opponent, but it's normal.  I played in my country, so was the same thing.  So I understand this.  But sometimes it's good for me as well because I'm like more concentrated for every point if I listen the crowd screaming for the opponent.  So it was good for me tonight.   Q.  How do you feel about your game at this stage in the competition?  SIMONA HALEP: I played much better than first round tonight, so I'm happy with this.  I am more aggressive and I served very well tonight.  I played fast.  I stayed very close to the baseline.  She shows very strong on court.  I felt her like big serve and big shots.  But, you know, I was very, very fast on court, I think, and I opened the court very well.  I did some good angles, and I just wanted to finish the points, like to make winners.  So I did well tonight, and I'm really happy with the way how I play now.   Q.  Your next match against Bethanie.  How do you look ahead to that match?  SIMONA HALEP: I played once against her in French Open few years ago.  I expect tough match.  She's playing well.  She's fighting till the end.  So I have confidence that I can win that match.  But, you know, I have to be very focused for every point and to play my game.   Q.  Maria today saved two matchpoints and ended up winning.  You've been in the situation against her where she comes back and fights.  Do you think she is the biggest fighter in the women's game?  SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, I think she is one of them.  She likes to fight.  I admire her that she's fighting till the end.  She's playing for every point.  She's a big champion, and she knows how to manage every situation during the matches.
