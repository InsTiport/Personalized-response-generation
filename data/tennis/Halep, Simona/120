S. HALEP/Kr. Pliskova
6-1, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What was it like playing the other Pliskova, a bit more of a battle today?
SIMONA HALEP: It was what?
Q. Battle, a fight.
SIMONA HALEP: In the second set, really, she started to play really well.  I think she served much better and I couldn't do much with the return.
But I served well, too.  So, it was there.  I feel like it was a very good match, the hardest here.  She improved a lot since last year, we played together here, and she was different player.
So, yeah, I'm really happy I could finish that second set.  It's always tough to play against the sisters.  I always said that, because they have a strong serve.  They can hit the ball very strong.  So it's a very good win for me.
Q. You could actually end up playing Karolina next.  What are your thoughts on Sloane as a possible opponent?
SIMONA HALEP: Both of them are very, very tough opponents.  I don't really know who is going to win.  The match is open, in my opinion.
Stephens is playing really well in this tournament so far.  Karolina, the same.  So doesn't matter against who I play.  I know that the match will be very tough.  So, I will be ready.  I will focus on myself, like every match.  And we'll see what is gonna happen.
Q. How hard was it for you to control your emotions today?
SIMONA HALEP: It was hard.  Every match I have emotions.  And at this tournament it's really nice that I know I can play my best tennis, and I feel a little bit of pressure when I go on court.
But, after few games, I just relax myself and I'm just starting to play my best tennis.  It's nice to have those emotions.  They are special.  And when we don't have tournaments, we miss them.  So it's good when we have them.
