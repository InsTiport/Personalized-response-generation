S. HALEP/J. Jankovic
  6‑1, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.

Q. You surprised at that scoreline? With all the matches you're played and everything, I don't know if you expected it to be so straightforward. 
SIMONA HALEP: I didn't expect that will be short match, but I knew that I feel the ball very well, that I'm ready to play against her, and that I know how to play her.
Even if she hits the ball strong or is playing soft like she did today.

Q. Are you surprised you were able to play what was the best match now this deep in the tournament?
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, I think was the best match in these two tournaments. I played very aggressive. I made some winners, good winners. My serve was smart. Not very strong, but was smart.
Return was pretty good. I think everything went well today for me. 

Q. Go back to the end of last year. Obviously Serena next, but you played exceptionally well against her the first time you played. Did everything work that day?
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, everything worked, so I hope tomorrow is going to be almost the same. The same is difficult, but I believe that I have a chance.
But of course I expect a tough match. She's the best player in the world, so I have nothing to lose. I just want to try to do what I did today. 

Q. Going to try and replicate that game plan from then tomorrow?
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah. I want to be aggressive; I want to stay close to the baseline. If I do step behind the baseline I have no chance against Serena.

Q. Have you learned anything about yourself over the course of the last two, three weeks? Taking four weeks off after Wimbledon and then the last couple of weeks on court, what have you...
SIMONA HALEP: I have learned that I have to be relaxed. I knew this, but when you get used to the tournaments every week, you lose those things from your mind.
Now I have again very strong in my mind that to be relaxed, I have to be fresh when I start a tournament. I have to believe that I have a good game for the top players. 
I have to do what I'm doing during the practice, because sometimes I try other things during the match than practice. So it's not a good idea.
I try just to keep focused for what I have to do, and I did pretty well these two weeks.

Q. How often do you watch Serena?
SIMONA HALEP: I don't watch.

Q. No?
SIMONA HALEP: No. Today I watch because was before me. But, no, I don't watch. I don't watch players. Only Federer. 

Q. You mentioned you're relaxed and refreshed. Given that and your results the last two weeks, is this maybe what you might look to do next year, maybe take a tournament or two off that you'd planned on playing because you come back refreshed and playing so well?
SIMONA HALEP: Until next year I have many tournaments to go, so I'm thinking now for the last Grand Slam of the year. I hope to be relaxed. I hope to be ready to start the tournament.
I know it's going to be every round tough match. I feel the ball, I feel the game, I feel prepared. Still, every match is difficult. I just have to be focused and to believe in myself.

Q. How comforting is it to have Darren come out there and have him tell you you're doing everything well?
SIMONA HALEP: Today I had him all for me. No more adidas player. It's good for me. I have confidence and I believe in hisself. He helps me, and it's really good to have a big coach next to you.

Q. What makes you guys get along? 
SIMONA HALEP: I believe in what he is saying. He gives me positive energy. He believes in myself that I can be there, I can win matches. I like how we speak. I understand everything he says about my game, about how I have to play.
So it's everything okay. It's good. 

Q. Going back to you watching Roger play, do you take any aspects and elements... 
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, the backhand, the spin. I cannot hit like him. I love to watch him. It's really amazing how he's playing.
