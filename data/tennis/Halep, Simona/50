S. HALEP/M. Buzarnescu
6-3, 4-6, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Very strange match today.  You had 2-Love lead in each of the sets, lots of breaks of serve.  How did you come through that match?
SIMONA HALEP: Definitely in the second set I was up 2-0 and 40-15.  I couldn't take that game.  Then I lost the confidence a little bit.
But I think she played much better after that moment.  She got more confident.  I think it was a good match for both of us.  Was a tough one, as I expected before.
Q. Through two matches, how do you feel about the level so far just to start the tournament?
SIMONA HALEP: I think I'm playing okay.  It's always tough on grass.  But it was a tougher match than first one, so it was good that I could win it.  Also I had tough moments during this match.  I lost the second set when I was leading the set.  Then I just had to fight till the end and for every ball, which I'm really happy that I did.
I felt confident on court.  I felt also strong mentally.
Q. What are your thoughts on facing Vika and the history between the two of you?
SIMONA HALEP: Well, very tough matches in the past.  We played I think two years ago here.  It's going to be a big challenge for me, tough one, because she's playing not very flat but she's very aggressive.  So on grass it's not that easy.
I am confident I have my chance and for sure I will win it.  I want to win badly every match I play.
Q. What's the key to that match?
SIMONA HALEP: The key is the mental part, I think.  Also the game.  I have to be strong on my legs to be ready for her strokes because she hits very strong.  Then we'll see.
Q. Can I ask you about the interruption in the match, when unfortunately the fan fainted.  How do you stay focused when paramedics are coming onto court?
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, I felt sad about that.  It was a tough moment because I didn't know what to do, like to stay focused on my game or to go there and to ask.
But I knew, I saw the people are coming to help him.  Yeah, it was a sad moment.  Hopefully he's okay now.
Q. Order of play has been released for tomorrow.  Some people on social media say they're disappointed.  Both the top seed and champion on the women's tour are on Court No. 2.  What is your opinion, because in the men's draw some would say that never happened?  What is your opinion about it?
SIMONA HALEP: Well, I think all the courts, the first courts here, are great.  Doesn't matter where you play.  I think many girls were in the top and now they are No. 6, 7.  It's not that bad that we are scheduled on Court 2 or Court 3.  Everything, it's okay here.
I really enjoy playing on all the courts.  I love to play on Court 1.  Court 2 was not that bad.  I am happy everywhere.
Q. Are you able to describe your work ethic and what it takes to sustain the level of success that you've had off the court?
SIMONA HALEP: Well, as I said this year, it's different a little bit because I won French Open last year.  My mind changed a little bit.  But when I said is a chill year, I didn't mean that.  My English is not that great when I want to translate something from Romanian.
I'm still working hard.  I'm motivated.  I want to win every match I play.  But I want to be chill as a person more than last year.  I don't want to stress myself that much about the result.  Also the nerves should be less because I did everything I wanted.  So now everything, it comes as a bonus.
My work ethic is like very focused on what I have to do.  Every day I respect the schedule.  I don't take days off any more.  I'm just trying to get better as much as possible.
So I am positive and I am ready to fight for every match I play.
Q. How would you describe the mixed doubles team of Andy Murray and Serena Williams?
SIMONA HALEP: Today I heard.  Today I heard they are playing together.  That's very nice, first.  Hope they put them on Centre Court because everyone is going to watch it.
Q. What do you think you'll see when you watch it?
SIMONA HALEP: What I will see?  Two great champions first.  I think is going to be a nice experience for everybody to see both of them on court, on the same side.  Good serves there and also returns.  We will see.
Q. What do you feel has been the main difference between the transition from the clay court season to the grass court season between this year and last year after you won the French?
SIMONA HALEP: It's a little bit tough when you come from clay court.  But this year I had more time to get ready for the grass.  It's totally different, the game.  I cannot slide here as I like on clay court.  You don't have that much time to think about the shots.  You have to be very fast, a little bit to block the balls when the opponents are hitting strong.  So is different.
I'm trying just to improve in this way.  Today I did not go to the net at all, but my goal is to do that.
Q. The two wins off the top of my head that were memorable ones that you got over Vika, US Open and here a couple years ago.  What do you think you did well in those matches to get those wins?  How do you game plan against an opponent on grass who takes that ball so early?
SIMONA HALEP: To play the same.  I think in US Open when we went back on court, because we had an interruption of raining, then I was more aggressive.  That's why I was able to win it.
Here also I played -- I remember from two years ago I was really aggressive, too.  If I go back, I have no chance.  So I will try to do that.  I will try to be strong.  It's tough to explain the game on grass court because you never know what to expect.
It's important also the serve, how you return, to open the court.  You don't have that much time to do that.  So it's a little bit mixed game there on grass.
Q. You mentioned your work ethic.  What are some of the specific things that make up your routine from what you have for breakfast to what music you listen to?  What things are most important to your daily regimen?
SIMONA HALEP: Well, this year I changed many things.  I'm not focused on those things any more.  I'm more relaxed.  I'm trying just to focus on my game and on my personality on court, attitude.
I don't have that strict routine that I had in the past.  Of course, I am a little bit superstitious.  I have some things to do before the matches.  But I keep it simple and more relaxed this year.  This is the change.
I can't tell you exactly what I'm doing because I'm changing every day something.
