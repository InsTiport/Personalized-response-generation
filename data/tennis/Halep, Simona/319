  6‑4, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please. 

Q.   After a quick exit in Stuttgart, you're playing very well here.   Tell us about today's match. 
SIMONA HALEP:   In Stuttgart I played also well, but Kuznetsova played better than me.   I had 5‑2 in first set and 5‑4 in second set, and she played really good on the important moments.
Here I feel better.   I feel good in Madrid.   I love to play here.   This tournament means a lot for me, because the last year help me a lot.   I'm really happy that I could win today in two sets.   I'm really happy that I can be in third round here. 

Q.   She played very well in the second set.   She picked up her game.   Did you have to adjust your game plan today? 
SIMONA HALEP:   She played well also in the first set.   I had 3‑0 and she had she came back 4‑3.   In that moment my serve helped me.   I served really well few services.
She's a good player on clay because she has Spanish style:   the forehand with a lot of topspin.
But I just wanted to stay focused for every point and to fight for every point.   So I did really well in the end, and I'm really happy that I won. 

Q.   And you might face your countrywoman Begu or Lisicki next.   Thoughts about either? 
SIMONA HALEP:   It will be a tough match for sure.   I can say that it's more difficult to play with a Romanian girl.   But we have to enjoy.   I will be happy if we can play both for Romania tomorrow in third round.
But everyone is tough at this level, so I have to stay focused and to try to play my best game and to be aggressive. 

Q.   Madrid last year was the turning point of the year and of your career.   What changed?   Because after this tournament started getting amazing results. 
SIMONA HALEP:   Yeah, it means a lot because Mr.Tiriac help me every time here with wildcard.   Last year I had tough match with Dominguez Lino.   I played about three hours and 30 minutes and lost 6‑4 in the third. 
At that point I felt I can play good tennis.   That's why this tournament means a lot.   Here I started to play really well.   In Rome was the big click, and then I played really well there with top players in Rome. 

Q.   I want to ask you why is Madrid so special to you.   We have been seeing your personal blog and you look really comfortable here. 
SIMONA HALEP:   I like this tournament because it's Mr.Tiriac, and I like that I feel like home here.   I like the public, the people, and also the food.   And the city is really nice here.
So I feel good on this tournament, and I just want to enjoy it.
