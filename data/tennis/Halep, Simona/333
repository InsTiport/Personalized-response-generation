S. HALEP/E. Makarova
  6‑1, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You had such an easy first set, then the rain delay.   How much did that affect your play in the second set?
SIMONA HALEP:   Yeah, I played really good in the first set.   She didn't play so well.   She did a lot of mistakes first set. 
But in second at 1‑All, we suspended the match.   The rain was coming.   I was a little bit nervous after that.   I played really slow after. 
But I came back from 4‑2 again and I did well. 

Q.   I counted 16 fans in the stands.   Is it different when you're playing basically by yourself out there on the grandstand court than when you're in a stadium full of people?   How does that affect play?
SIMONA HALEP:   Yeah, I mean, it's very nice to have a big support in the public.   But every time I try to play myself, to be confident with me, to don't see outside the court, you know.   Just focus every point, do every point, to try my best. 

Q.   Can you talk a little bit about the tiebreaker.   There were two mini breaks in there. 
SIMONA HALEP:   Yeah, it was very tough because she played really good in second set.   She served very good on the left side.   I just tried to be focused every point. 
At 5‑All I served one ace for me, and it was good.   So I just tried my best and to be relaxed because was tough tiebreak. 

Q.   What do you like about your game right now?   What do you feel is coming easily?
SIMONA HALEP:   I'm more aggressive on court.   I hit the ball.   I move very good.   I'm running a lot.   I feel the game very, very good now at this moment. 

Q.   Having all these matches on the same surface as the US Open, how is that going to help you next week?
SIMONA HALEP:   I'm a bit tired right now.   But I want to play tomorrow, to try my best.   After that I will see what it will happen. 
I will recover.   I have time to recover.   It's good tournament before US Open, I think ‑ and I hope, too (smiling).

Q.   Will you stay and watch a little of the next match?
SIMONA HALEP:   No.   I will go to rest at the hotel.   My coach maybe will stay.   But, no, usually I don't stay to see my opponent. 

Q.   What are your thoughts about those two players?
SIMONA HALEP:   Both beat me:   Wozniacki last year, and Stephens this year in Australia.   She played really good there. 
But now my game changed and I have my chance tomorrow.   I'll try my best to be relaxed on court, to enjoy the semifinals. 

Q.   The rain delay before the start of the matches, looked like you were playing fussball.   What do you do during rain delays?
SIMONA HALEP:   I just tried to relax a little bit, just focus on the match.   Is not easy to come back on court after the rain. 
But it was okay.
