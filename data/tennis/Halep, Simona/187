S. HALEP/Kristyna Pliskova
6-1, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You took care of that very quickly.  Can you describe how your performance went from your perspective?
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, it was quick because I started aggressive.  I had this in my mind, to play my style, to play aggressive, to take her fast.
She did great in Prague.  She came yesterday.  Maybe she didn't have time to get used to this court.
But I wanted to do my job from the beginning.  I think I did pretty well.  I finished strong.
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the emotion you have when you step back out onto a court where you performed well in the previous year?  Do you block that all out or do you try to let the good memories come?
SIMONA HALEP: I blocked.  I blocked everything out.  I didn't think about the fact that I won last year.  Is different year.  Is different tournament.  Different everything.  So I'm not thinking.
I take every match.  I was a little bit nervous before this one because I know that she's very dangerous with the serve, with her lefty.
So, yeah, I'm looking forward to play tomorrow doubles because, yeah, it's first time when I play doubles here.  Yeah, I just want to do my job.  I'm not thinking about the result.
Q. You get Roberta Vinci next.  Different kind of player.
SIMONA HALEP: Since long time I didn't play against her.  Bucharest maybe, two, three years ago.
I know her pretty well.  Her slice is not easy, but I will get used to it in a few games.  She's a good opponent.  She's a tough player.
But, you know, I have confident that I can play very good tennis against her to win the match.  But I'm not thinking about that.  I'm thinking just that I have to be aggressive again, to do my style, to do my job, and to try to win, try everything.
Q. With on-court coaching visits, do you like the fact that the fans are seeing this side and can hear what you're saying to your coach, or do you prefer they weren't?
SIMONA HALEP: No, I don't like (smiling).
But in our plan, it's to give up a little bit this on-court coaching.  It's better to do alone, to solve alone the problems during the match.
But, yeah, it's better if is not microphone on court.
Q. Talking about doubles, how comfortable do you feel on the doubles court?  Do you feel like you know what you're doing out there?
SIMONA HALEP: Half.  Let's say half, yeah.  Now I'm used more to doubles game.  Is not easy because you have different angles.  Everything is different.
I cannot say I'm a doubles player, but I'm trying.  I play to improve a little bit the net game, to serve more, to return more.
It's just a better practice, in my opinion, unofficial practice.  I started to like it more than before.  Every time when I go on court, I'm thinking to win.  This was not before.  Before it was just to play some points.  Now I really want to win every match I go to play doubles.
Q. Speaking of the net, are we ever going to see a Simona Halep that looks to get into the net, that looks to put away those balls?  There's a lot of times during your matches where it would be a great opportunity to sneak in, but that's not your game style at the moment.
SIMONA HALEP: I don't know to answer now exactly.  But I don't really believe that I will be a net player.  Maybe I have to improve more to finish the points quicker and to go there and to hit the normal volley.  Normally I hit the spin volley, so it's different.
But I would like one day to be more aggressive and to go to finish the points at the net, but it's not easy.  I'm not tall.  I need more speed, so I have to work more.
