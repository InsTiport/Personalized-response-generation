S. HALEP/T. Townsend   
6-1, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Your third time beating her in straight sets.  Pretty efficient for you.  What do you think is beneficial about her game for you?  
SIMONA HALEP: I think this was my best match so far.  I feel more confident.  I feel the game here.  I think today I just liked how she played against me.  The atmosphere was good, the weather.   
I have only good thoughts about this match.  It was really good.   
 Q.  Were the conditions different playing later and practicing early?  
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, I was waiting a lot today.  Was not easy.  I practice around 3 p.m., was very early.  For everybody is the same, so I'm not going to complain about this.   
But the weather was nice.  Playing during the night is a little bit better.  Is not that humid, not that hot.  The wind was not there.  It was a good timing.   
 Q.  Would you attribute this improvement in rhythm to the coaching switch?  
SIMONA HALEP: Practice.  I practiced a lot since the coach came here.  Credit to him because he just settle me down a little bit.  Now I start to feel the ball very well.   
 Q.  Obviously you are playing an American player, but there were many Romanian fans.  Did you expect that before the match?  
SIMONA HALEP: It's always nice atmosphere here when I play in Miami.  Many Romanians are coming to watch me.  I can say I expected because in the previous years was similar.   
 Q.  You are the No. 2 seed in the tournament, but your first match was not on the grandstand or the stadium.  Did you feel surprised when you heard about this?  
SIMONA HALEP: I'm not thinking about these things ever.  I'm just trying to focus on my game, on myself.  Everywhere I play, it's okay.  As I showed today, didn't matter where I play, I just played well.  The court was nice.   
 Q.  Talk about your next matchups.  
SIMONA HALEP: Misaki Doi, we didn't play since long time ago.  I don't know if we played together.  But she's fast.  She's moving well.  I have just to see a little bit how I have to play.  I'm pretty sure that I will be ready.   
Against Hercog, I know she has a big forehand, serve is good.  I just have to adjust myself on the position on court and we will see.   
 Q.  With the clay court season coming up, what adjustments do you feel you can make in your game on the hard court?  
SIMONA HALEP: I'm not thinking about the clay court yet.  I'm just focusing on what I have to do on hard court.  Is the last tournament.  I want just to give my best, try 100% what I have to try for this surface.
