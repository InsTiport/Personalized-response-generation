S. HALEP/P. Martic   
6-4, 6-7, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  It was a bit windy out there, eh?  
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, a bit too much.   
 Q.  What was it like?  Explain what the conditions are like out there.  
SIMONA HALEP: It was tough to play, because the ball was really moving, and we didn't really know what's going on on court.   
But I just, you know, tried everything.  I tried also to push a little bit the ball and then to hit it, so to change, to mix.  Was not easy at all.  For both of us was difficult.   
And definitely she's a very good player, and was really tough to play against her.   
 Q.  What do you think the key was in the end, coming back from a break down?  
SIMONA HALEP: Well, I think I calmed down myself a little bit more, and I just was more focused on what I have to do, not about the wind, not thinking that much about the wind and what is going on on court.   
Yeah, I just fought till the end, and I think that's why I could win.   
 Q.  In the second set breaker, was there a lot of frustration because of the conditions?  
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, everything I had today frustration way, it was because of the wind.   
 Q.  You have played for a long time in all kinds of conditions.  Have you ever sort of had this much of a problem assessing how to hit the ball?  
SIMONA HALEP: Here because of the altitude as well, and the wind is really difficult to play.  In the last few years, I don't remember to have so difficult wind and to feel that tough to play a game.   
Yeah, I think here was the most difficult.   
 Q.  What do you need to do technically when the wind is going on or certain things you remind yourself to do?  
SIMONA HALEP: I wanted to do too many things (smiling).  That's why I didn't -- I couldn't stay calm.  I panicked a little bit.  But, you know, you have just to keep the ball in play and just trying to find the angles.   
But also, you have to see where the wind is going, because you can be helped by the wind a little bit, but it's really tough.  Your body is sore all the time.   
 Q.  You have played many tough matches already in this tournament.  How do you feel now?  
SIMONA HALEP: I'm okay.  It's normal to be a little bit tired, because I had so many weeks off.   
But I'm feeling good.  I'm ready to play the next match.   
 Q.  Towards the end of the second set and the start of the third set, was that a little bit of the old Simona coming out there?  
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah.  But it was good that after 3-1 I just woke up, and I realized that I'm not doing the right thing on court.  And it was really good that I can see that and change that, so that makes a big change.   
 Q.  How much of the ability to do that comes from confidence from winning 17 matches this year?  
SIMONA HALEP: Well, the confidence is there just for the game.  For myself and my attitude, I have every day to work on it.  Doesn't matter that much the confidence in that direction, but I have confidence that I'm able to do it.  So I believe that I am able to do it every time, so I have just to try it and to take it, like, to do it.   
 Q.  Are there things you say to yourself in your mind to calm yourself down, or is it the sort of thing where it just has to pass and you start to feel self-confident?  
SIMONA HALEP: No, I have to work on myself.  Things are not coming and going like that.  It was easy if it was like that.   
I have to work, and I have just to put the thoughts, like, in the right place.   
 Q.  What was Darren urging you to do after the second set?  
SIMONA HALEP: When I called him, he told me just, We talked at set all (smiling).  And I knew what he told me, but I just wanted to call him to calm me down, which happened after I lost the next game.  After that, I realized that something is wrong, so I have to calm down.   
But, yeah, he told me just to hit the ball, because I was pushing too much at one point.   
 Q.  How exhausting is it to have to constantly kind of manage your emotions on the court?  How much more does that take out of you than even the running around and playing?  
SIMONA HALEP: Before was more difficult.  Before, I was losing energy a lot to do that, but now comes a little bit more natural, and I don't waste energy that much.   
So when I see it, I do it.  I know what I have to do.  I do it, and it turns.  So I don't lose energy that much.   
 Q.  Could you talk about your next opponent, potential opponent?  
SIMONA HALEP: Well, both of them are big hitters, so I hope the wind will be out slightly (smiling) and we can just play the game.   
It's going to be tough always against them, so I just want to, like I say every time, to focus on myself more than the opponent.   
 Q.  Karolina said back in Australia after you beat her that there's just -- you just seem to read her game very well.  She feels it in practice that you can feel it.  I mean, is that a confident matchup for a top-10 matchup for you?  
SIMONA HALEP: I cannot say that it's -- even if I won few times in a row, doesn't mean that the next time will be the same, because every match is different.   
And you never know with her.  So she can play an amazing game.  She can miss some easy balls.  I have just to stay ball by ball and just thinking that I have to do the plan against her, because I really know what to play against her.   
I can say I read her game a little bit, but also I like her game.  So it's together, and we will see, but I cannot be sure that I will win the match.   
 Q.  Do you like Osaka's game, as well?  
SIMONA HALEP: I love it (smiling).  It's not that easy to play against Osaka, because she's also hitting the ball -- every player is different, but in the end, some players are pretty similar.  So both of them are similar in the game.   
I will be ready.  I have one day off, so I will not think about that now.   
 Q.  What are you going to do on your day off?  
SIMONA HALEP: Tomorrow I will have a lazy morning, and then practice.  Depends when will be the semifinal.  If it will be late, I will practice late.   
Nothing special.  Same boring stuff.
