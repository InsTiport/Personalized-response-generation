THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  The long day yesterday, how tough is it coming into today knowing you might have to play two matches?  Everyone seems on edge today.  How do you feel?  
SIMONA HALEP: Well, yeah, it's been a little bit tough because we had to stay yesterday till late here.  But for everybody was the same.  I cannot complain about that.  I just couldn't win today.   
Actually I have extra days off, which is good (smiling).  I will enjoy the rest now the rest of the days here, and I will try to be ready for French Open.   
 Q.  A lot of people left in the tournament will play five matches in four days before a Grand Slam.  How does this tournament feel now?  Do you sort of feel lucky to escape?  
SIMONA HALEP: Well, if I see the positive way, yes, I'm lucky to escape.  Of course, I didn't want to lose today.   
But, yeah, it's a tough thing now.  It's a good tournament, so I think who can go till the end, it's a good week.   
 Q.  How concerned are you about the leg?  When did you start to feel the pain there?  
SIMONA HALEP: A little bit in the second set, I started to feel I think a little bit from sliding.  Yesterday I didn't do much.  I had two days off, so it was a little bit tough to get back to this rhythm, very high rhythm.   
But is nothing, like, tight or something broken.  Is just a little bit of injury, which in a few days is going to be okay, I'm sure.   
 Q.  Having played her twice, she's very talented from Czech, can you talk about her game, what is so tricky about it?  
SIMONA HALEP: Her dropshots, for sure.  Many today (smiling).  I think she's very talented, like you said.  She's a very good player.  For sure she's going to be in the top, in my opinion.   
Lefty, it's always difficult to play against.  She serves well, moves well.  She can slice all the balls that are very far to her, which is a good thing for her.   
 Q.  What do you think it's going to be like going back to Paris?  
SIMONA HALEP: Well, I can't expect anything because to be a defending champion in Grand Slam is for first time for me, so is something new.  I will be, like, more relaxed.  I will try to enjoy more.  Hopefully I can win some matches.   
But there is nothing to do extra.   
 Q.  Now with the second Grand Slam of the year, we've had five months of results, we see how many different champions there have been.  Do you think the French Open maybe feels more open or less open than the Australian Open, when we didn't know kind of what was going to happen this year?  
SIMONA HALEP: Actually I don't know what is going to happen in French Open, as well.  I always said in the last few months that tennis is very open now.  The top is open.  Anyone can win.  Kiki Bertens has a chance, in my opinion.  Stephens again.  Many players are playing well on clay.   
We will see.  I'm very curious, as well.
