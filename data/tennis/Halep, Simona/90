O. JABEUR/S. Halep
6-1 (ret.)
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Can you tell us what is the status of your back?  Is the pain the same as last week, better or worse?
SIMONA HALEP: There is a pain.  I couldn't move properly, so that's why I stopped.  I don't know exactly what it is.  I will go home.  I will have an MRI and I will see.
Hopefully is not the back, the bones or something like that.  I'm just worried now.  I feel sad that I couldn't finish.
Q. Last week you were not too concerned, you were hoping that it's a few days.  Are you now feeling it's different than what you felt in the past?
SIMONA HALEP: The muscle is better, the muscle of the back.  But now I started to feel yesterday in the bones.  So it's really tough when you have back injury because you cannot bend, you cannot react at the balls.  All body was really contracted.  I couldn't play.
Q. Was there any worry that you shouldn't play today or you were told it won't get worse?
SIMONA HALEP: That's why I stopped, because I felt like it's getting worse if I continue.  Today I could stop.  I think last week was also good point to stop, but I forced a little bit to see how it goes.  But here it was a bit too much.
Q. Was there a point in the match when you started feeling it, when you had the trainer come out?
SIMONA HALEP: No, it's since the beginning of the match.  Also before at the practice.  The pain didn't let me at all.  I knew that there is pain, but I thought if I warm up during the match, it's going to be better.  But wasn't.
Q. It's difficult to judge, but this is the first time she'd played you.  She's 113 in the world.  What are your thoughts on how she played?
SIMONA HALEP: She can hit the ball very strong.  She's playing well.  I cannot analyze this match because I was not able to do anything on court.  But she's a good player.
Q. What was the diagnosis from the doctors in Wuhan and here?  It was just only the muscle, and you feel it's something completely different now?
SIMONA HALEP: No, in Wuhan was also the lower back was blocked so I couldn't move for two days there.  Then with a lot of treatment, it was better.  I started to feel in the muscle a lot.  Was really, really contracted.  Then I had some needles.  I did the treatment.  The muscle was better.  But now I still feel the bone.
