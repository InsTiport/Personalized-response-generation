6-3, 4-6, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Can you just talk about the transition from Madrid to here?  Did that play a little bit of a role in your performance today?
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah.  It's different.  The conditions are different.  The game is heavier here.  The court is heavier, and the balls, as well.  It was tough to adapt, but, you know, she played well.  She did her game.  That's it.  It's just a match, it's just a loss, but I take it as it is.
Q. Is Madrid going to be the one result you will focus on instead of, heading into Roland Garros, instead of taking this loss?
SIMONA HALEP: It's not a big drama that I lost today.  But still was a loss and it's not easy.
But I take just a positive from last week.  Today was tough for me to adapt, but still I could play better, but that's it.
Yeah, I take it like it is.  Like I said, it's just a match.  I'm still confident, but I have to keep working to go to French Open.
Q. She's had a lot of good results since last season.  What is it especially difficult about her on the court?
SIMONA HALEP: She's a good player.  When you don't feel the game, everything is difficult to play.  To everyone, actually, is difficult to play against.
She's moving well.  She hits the balls.  She has a good game.  I mean, she's a good player.  It's not that I lost to someone who doesn't know how to play tennis.  She plays well and it's okay.
Q. What wasn't working for you today in your game?
SIMONA HALEP: The feeling.  I didn't have the feeling.  Because I had only one practice yesterday.  It's normal, but still, I played okay by my side, and it's -- it's not a big drama, again.  It's just a match.
Q. Do you think, because you had a bit more rhythm towards the end of the second set, do you think the rain delay kind of broke that a little bit?
SIMONA HALEP: Maybe if it wouldn't rain, maybe I would play -- I would have played better.  But it's -- that's it.  I cannot change anything.  If it's raining, it's raining.  If I lose, you lose.  So I won a lot of matches last week, so I don't give up now that I lost one match.
Q. So what's your plan between now and Paris?  And when do you expect that you'll arrive there?
SIMONA HALEP: I will go to Paris earlier.  I don't know when, but I will do early.  Now I don't know what I'm doing.  Maybe I take a few days' rest somewhere.  I'm not sure yet.  I have to think tonight.
Q. And in Madrid you got there relatively early and you were able to practice and all that.  Is that kind of the same game plan for Paris?
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah.  I think I will do the same, the same like Madrid.
