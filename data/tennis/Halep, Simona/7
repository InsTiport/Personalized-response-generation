 6-2, 6-1
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Tell us how you felt out there.
 SIMONA HALEP:   Very nice atmosphere.  Good vibe.  I was really happy to be back on court with some people in the crowd and really happy that I could win the match.
 Q. You have just beaten an Australian and have another Australian in the next round.  What is it about the Aussies that have troubled you?  Obviously it was a great match today but what do you think about your next match with Tomljanovic?
 SIMONA HALEP:   Well, it's going to be a tough battle.  I expect a tough match because I played against her before and I know how it's gonna be somehow.
 She's a good opponent, a good player, and I will focus just on myself like I do every time, but I'm ready for a good battle.
 Q. Congrats on the win.  Some people said the court is faster than last year.  How did you feel?
 SIMONA HALEP:   Yeah, it is faster, much faster, actually.  But, you know, I got used to it already because we have about 10 days here.
 I feel good on the court even if it's fast.
