 S. HALEP/T. Pereira
  6/2, 6/2 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   A bit cold out there, otherwise is that the perfect start?  
SIMONA HALEP:   Yeah, it was a perfect start for match.   First round always it's difficult, but today I played really well.   The court was beautiful, so I was enjoying every moment.   
Yeah, it's not easy to start the tournament, but I'm happy that I did and I did very well.   
   
 Q.   How is the shoulder?   
SIMONA HALEP:   I didn't have problems with shoulder.   I had back here.   (Pointing to scapula area.)   The muscle was contracted.   Now I recovered very well and I can play.  
   
 Q.   The draw seems a little kinder this year than previous years.   Is that a chance to set record straight at Wimbledon?  
SIMONA HALEP:   It's tough to say now because, yeah, I have better draw because I'm seeded now and it's normal.  
Next round I play against Tsurenko.   She's a good player.   I played against her last year.   It was difficult match.  
So I'm very focused.   I want to give everything I can on court and to try to play my best.   I want to play many matches here, but it's not easy.   I want to take match by match.  
   
 Q.   Does it feel different being seeded here, particularly so high this year compared to previous years?  
SIMONA HALEP:   Yeah, it is.   I feel a little pressure.   It's normal.   But I want just to get it and to keep in my mind only and to think about what I have to do on court.  
It's not easy to be seeded, but it's also nice to be there.  
   
 Q.   Do you have a goal or expectation from the next couple of weeks?   
SIMONA HALEP:   Of course.   Every day I have a goal.   I want to win every match and every tournament, but it's not easy.   I will try to give everything on court and to do my best always.   
Otherwise, I cannot stay and don't think about the goal.   I have a goal every day, and I want to fight for it.
