6-2, 6-0   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Nice to get a quick one, wasn't it? Appreciate that.  
SIMONA HALEP: Two sets. Me, too (laughter).   
 Q.  How did it feel out there?  
SIMONA HALEP: It felt much better than previous matches. I played really well. Everything went in my side. I felt the ball great. I feel like I played the best match since I came here.   
 Q.  Can you talk about Rybakina, how much you've seen of her. This is her fourth final of the year. What do you make of her?  
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, it's amazing what she's done already this year. I saw her a little bit during some matches. But I don't have the feeling how she's playing because I think we never played together.   
She has a big serve. I have to pay attention on my return and to be like today: confident, aggressive if there is a chance, just fighting. It's the best thing to do now.   
 Q.  How comforting was it today after those two three-setters you had? Once you got through those two, it loosens you up a bit more.  
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, and you get the feeling of the match. You get the feeling of the court a lot. Escaping from that first match, it's really important to just stay focused on yourself and just dig in every single point.   
I did that, and I feel like the level, it's been increased.   
 Q.  When you go into a final at a place you've won the title before, does that make any difference to you?  
SIMONA HALEP: A final, it's a final. It's always a nice opportunity and privilege to play the last match of the tournament. I play for another trophy, so I'm relaxed. I'm focused. I really want it.   
Loving to play here in Dubai makes me happy on court, and that's why I can actually feel like every day improve.   
 Q.  When you we're playing Jennifer today, it looked like you were shrinking your own side of the court, expanding the other side, making her run. Is it fun? Do you have fun doing something like that?  
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, it's fun when you feel the ball and when you can do anything you want. Today it was one of those days, I could open the court easy. I felt like every time I hit the ball I feel it.   
Yeah, it looks really, really nice.   
 Q.  Is that a similar kind of challenge tomorrow or is it a different kind of a match?  
SIMONA HALEP: Different match for sure because it's a different style. I think Rybakina is not playing that spinny like Brady. It's a different style.   
But I will do the same. I will do my job. I just want to win it so I will see.   
 Q.  Last week I spoke to Irina Begu in Cairo. She won there. She said a big motivation for her to play these ITFs is to get her ranking up so she can play doubles with you in Tokyo. Are you keeping tabs on her progress?  
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, we talk most of the time. I really congratulated her because I know that it's tough when you don't have confidence. She has the game, but she doesn't have the confidence at that level that she needs to be at these big tournaments.   
Now she's coming back. I'm really happy for her. I'm sure she's going to do it better this year and she will be in Tokyo.
