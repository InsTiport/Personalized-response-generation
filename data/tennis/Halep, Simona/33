E. RYBAKINA/S. Halep
5-4 (ret.)
(Transcribed from WTA recording.)
Q. What is the injury you had today?
SIMONA HALEP: It's a lower back. I think it's more a muscle, but I don't know yet because I didn't check it properly.
Q. When did you first feel it in the match?
SIMONA HALEP: 4-All, Love-30, with the backhand. I had a sharp pain.
Q. Is it anything similar that you've experienced before or you don't know yet?
SIMONA HALEP: I don't know yet. But looks a little bit different. It's still the same zone.
Q. Any concern for the rest of the season or you don't know?
SIMONA HALEP: I don't know yet. I have to check with the doctors.
Q. Disappointing, of course.
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah. I started to play well this tournament, but I'm disappointed it happened again with the back.
