K. PLISKOVA/S. Halep
6-0, 2-6, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. That was a very cruel last point for your season to end.
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, it was very unlucky game for me let's say. 30-Love, that ball that line umpire called out, and it was a little bit good. Yeah, it was a tough match honestly.
Q. What did you feel about your performance overall?
SIMONA HALEP: I didn't play my best tennis. For sure I was right there with everything after that very fast first set. I came back into the game. Also in the end I was very close to turn it around.
But she was good. She was strong. Yeah, it's a tough lose, honestly.
Q. Talk through the final set, what was going on in your mind in terms of having a little bit of an opportunity to go up 3-Love.
SIMONA HALEP: I was thinking after the match, I had time to think, and I thought that it was a little bit of pressure, seeing that I'm going well, close to make 3-0. I think that moment I lost my mind a little bit. I was too nervous, too agitated. I couldn't stay into the game that much. It's good I didn't finish that direction because in the past I would have done that.
I think it's positive that I turn it around a little bit, yeah. We go ahead.
Q. We heard some strong words from Darren in the last on-court coaching. What did it feel for you to hear those kind of words? What impact did they have on you?
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, it was a little bit of the impact for me. But I'm pretty sure that I deserve because I was not calm. I changed something in my attitude. Everyone knows that I'm working on that. I was a little bit pissed on myself that I did that. I'm sure that I made him pissed also.
Q. You haven't played a ton of matches since Wimbledon. Did you feel that at all today, not being able to overcome the pressure?
SIMONA HALEP: Actually I feel that I didn't practice much before this tournament. I'm falling in pieces. Everywhere I have something. It's normal. I've been injured in Asia. After that I couldn't play at all. I couldn't move actually home.
I was really happy I was able to play these three very tough matches at the highest level. I'm actually proud of the way I responded to the work this week and last week.
I'm not very happy with the way it went. Again, this tournament is not for me, it's definitely not for me. The court is too tough for me. But I keep trying. Hopefully I will have another chance next year.
Q. Now that the season is over, what is the biggest lesson for you?
SIMONA HALEP: Biggest lesson? That I have to be more consistent for the practice and for the work. This year I was kind of up and down a little bit too much. Maybe because I have six years in the top, and I didn't have a bigger break than three weeks. I can say I feel it mentally and also physically.
I have done a great job, even if it was not very good year. I've won Wimbledon, which makes a great year in the end. I'm not disappointed with myself and with the year. I put it next to 2018. I'm looking forward for the next one. So I'm good.
Q. I know your 2019 season has only just ended, but looking ahead to 2020, does the return of Darren give you a lot of encouragement for next year?
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, I feel that. I feel more confident for what's coming up. I am motivated. I'm fresh mentally, even if it ended like this at this tournament. I don't feel exhausted like last year. It's a good sign.
But I need a holiday. I need a holiday to just forget about everything, then I'll be ready for the off-season.
Q. Have you discussed, will you be doing your pre-season in Romania, Australia?
SIMONA HALEP: No, Australia, no. I've done that once. Was a little bit tough for me to stay so long there. Australia is not an option.
