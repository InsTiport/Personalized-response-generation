  S. HALEP/Y. Wickmayer  6-4, 6-2  An interview with:  SIMONA HALEP   THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   Q.  With the seeds falling, especially in the women's draw, how much confidence does it give you going into the quarterfinals?  SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, a lot of confidence I have now because I didn't lose a set.  I had good matches here in first week, so I'm really happy that I'm in second week now like last year.  Here I started to play my best tennis in Grand Slams.  So means a lot for me.  I really have more confidence now to play the quarterfinals.   Q.  You face Makarova next.  Tell us how much you know about her game.  SIMONA HALEP: I know.  I know her.  I play a few times against her.  She serves pretty well; she's moving well; she's playing aggressive.  I have my chance.  I believe in my chance next round.  So I have to make my game again to be aggressive and to serve well like today.   Q.  A couple of times on the court you seemed frustrated by things that were not happening.  Did you feel you could do better or...  SIMONA HALEP: Well, you know, some moments of the match you are frustrated, but it's normal.  I have to accept my mistakes because it's normal to do some of them.  I just want to be perfect on court, but is not possible.  The perfect doesn't exist.  So I try to keep my mind very focused for every point and to forget about the mistakes.  I try to be better day by day, match by match.  Maybe that's why I'm a little bit nervous during the matches.   Q.  What do you think you did really well against her?  SIMONA HALEP: I think I stayed very aggressive.  I took the balls very fast.  I served pretty well today.  My serve helped me a lot in important moments, like in first set when I finished the set with two aces.  It was very important moment.
