7-6, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Pretty much every game was close, wasn't it?  
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, was close.  First set I had set ball.  I couldn't finish, and then I lost a little bit of confidence and it was over.   
 Q.  It's obviously a tough first match to play, but did you feel you were doing the things you wanted to do on court?  
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, I think I was doing okay.  I was aggressive.  She played really well.  She came back well.   
I served okay, returned okay.  I'm disappointed that I lost but it's okay.  I feel good.  Physically I'm okay.  I have no pain anywhere.  It's good, and the most important thing is that I'm healthy.   
 Q.  How did the day go for you?  Obviously rain delays and the interruption during the match.  
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, it's a bit tough.  But for everyone it's the same, so I cannot say that's the reason that I lost.   
It's normal.  These are the conditions, and we have to accept.   
 Q.  Obviously you had to play yourself mentally for a match.  You have a delay like that and then the delay during the match.  Is it easy to stay focused?  
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, it wasn't hard to stay focused.  I'm here to play, so I was full of -- you know, the focusing was only on my match so I was waiting.  I was relaxed.  I was practicing a little bit before the match.   
So everything went okay in the right way.  So, yeah, she was better than me today and she won.   
 Q.  Do you think there was a bit perhaps more pressure on you as defending champion?  
SIMONA HALEP: No, I didn't feel pressure.  It's not about the pressure.  It's just that I need the matches, many matches, because I had a tough period before.   
So that's it.  And I'm not very upset.  I'm disappointed but it's okay.  It was a tough round, so it's fine.   
 Q.  Are you going to Doha?  
SIMONA HALEP: Yes.
