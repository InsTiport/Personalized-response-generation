THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   First match here.   How did you find the conditions?   How did you like your game today?  
SIMONA HALEP:   It was nice weather to play today.   The sun wasn't shining too much and it was perfect to play.   I felt really well today, and I think I did my game.   I was aggressive.   
I'm happy I could win in two sets.  
   
 Q.   How did you feel about your opponent's game?   
SIMONA HALEP:   She's fast, but for me it wasn't easier to play because I take the ball fast and it's better for me.   The ball is coming fast.   
I just wanted to be aggressive, to stay on court, and to hit the balls.   Because she's not that tall.   It's better if you take the ball fast and not so close for her, you know, to open the court.   
   
 Q.   The ball can move very quickly through the court here.   Have you found that to be the case?   And also, do you have to adjust your game to, you know, fall back a little bit more, or do you try to stay still on the baseline and adjust your timing?  
SIMONA HALEP:   Yeah, I try to stay close to the baseline and to open the court because she's running very well, but she's not that tall and it's easier for me to finish the point very quickly.  
Like I did today.   I hit some drives, few drives, a lot of drives today, and I finish the points very fast.   And I think I return really well today.   
So it was good point for me, the return.   I lost few serves in second set, but I could be focused for to finish the second set.  
   
 Q.   Kurumi said she looked up to you as a role model in terms of play style and games, because you are not that tall, as well.   She said your play style is similar to her.   
SIMONA HALEP:   Yeah, we play similarly.   Yeah, I know this.   She's playing better with the backhand, like me.   Yeah, I like to play more with my backhand.   
Yeah, I'm not tall, so we have a similar game, fast, and we move very well on court.   
   
 Q.   What kind of treatment did you have on your feet to make it better?  
SIMONA HALEP:   Laser and ultrasounds, just a few days, about seven, eight days.  
   
 Q.   It feels perfect now?  
SIMONA HALEP:   Now, yeah, I didn't feel pain during the match, so I'm happy that I'm healthy to play again.  
   
 Q.   You've obviously won a lot of matches this year, more than the past years.   Does winning still feel special, or is it something normal at this point?  
SIMONA HALEP:   Every match is special and every win is special for me.   I'm enjoying every day and every match.  
It's really nice to win and I don't like to lose, so I want to keep going like this maybe if it's possible.   
But next round I know will be very tough match.   She's a great player and she's lefty, so is not easy.   But I have just to try my game and to play like today:   relaxed and enjoying.  
   
 Q.   Do your results affect your mood like outside of tournaments?   Do you feel happier now that you're winning a lot more?  
SIMONA HALEP:   Yeah, I'm happy.   Every match, it's very important for my mind, and I want just to keep this way going and to work hard like usually.  
And, you know, every point and every match, it's good if you win and if you can do your game, so I'm proud of that.  
   
 Q.   What do you do to keep your mind off tennis outside of tennis?  
SIMONA HALEP:   I don't keep my mind off tennis, out of tennis (smiling).   I'm thinking every day tennis.   And I like tennis, so it's not difficult for me.  
I'm going to shopping every day if it's possible ‑ or not too much ‑ but one hour, it's perfect for me to relax my mind.   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Do you like to watch tennis on TV?  
SIMONA HALEP:   No, I don't (smiling).   
   
 Q.   Not at all?  
SIMONA HALEP:   No.   
   
 Q.   I talked to a number of other players and commentators and they speak very highly about your game.   They like the way that you play, balanced, tactically, and things.   Why do you think that is?   What is it about your game do you think makes it special?  
SIMONA HALEP:   I think my game is complete.   I mean, I can play good with both shots.   I don't serve really well, but I keep working that point.   And I move well, so I stay close to the baseline.   
I think I have a beautiful tennis I like to play.   Maybe that I'm very relaxed on court now, and that was the secret to win a lot of tournaments.   
I just want to keep going and to don't change my mind, because I think is the right way, to win.   
   
 Q.   Have any of the Romanian women players from the past had any influence on you?  
SIMONA HALEP:   My manager is Virginia Ruzici, so she's telling me about her experience every time and she helps me a lot to think about tennis, to think about the pressure.   Because now I have more pressure, and it's good to speak with someone who knows about this.   
   
 Q.   Do you see her every day?   Is she here?  
SIMONA HALEP:   Not every day, but I'm speaking with her every day.   She's coming in Miami.
