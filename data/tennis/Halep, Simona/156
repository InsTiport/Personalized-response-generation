S. HALEP/B. Strycova
6-1, 6-0
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Quick turnaround from last night.  What was the key today?
SIMONA HALEP: Well, I think I played a little bit more stronger.  I've been more aggressive.  And also the return, I was better than last night.  I got used to the courts.  I got used to the balls.  So I feel better.  I feel with more confident after yesterday's match.
So, yeah, I think it was a good match.
Q. Did all of that help ease some of the frustration that you might have been feeling last night just getting used to everything, the conditions, everything like that?
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, but also it was a little bit different because it was a day match.  Yesterday was a night match.  We played with the lights.  So it was a little bit different.
But, yeah, I'm getting better day by day and it's a good sign.  So I just want to play better tomorrow.
Q. So obviously there's a lot of talk about the Romanian fans, but do you ever look up and see that giant cardboard cutout of your head at all, and what goes through your mind when you see that?
SIMONA HALEP: I think it was in Indian Wells we had those pictures.  So I don't know how they got it, but it's nice.  It's nice feeling down there having such a big support.
I want to thank them.  And I think I can say, is not a bad thing, but I think that they have to be a little bit more fair play with the opponent, because today was a little bit too much in my opinion.
Q. Talk about the next match.
SIMONA HALEP: Next match I play against Garcia, right?
Q. Right.
SIMONA HALEP: She's a hitter, big hitter.  So it's going to be very different, but I think I'm ready.  I don't believe I played against her lately.  So I don't know how it's going to be, but I will check some of her matches.  And I will do the plan with my coach, and we will see tomorrow what it's going to be.
Q. She was talking about after her second round feeling like there needed to be a maturity process to sort of get used to playing on this circuit and play as consistently as she seems to be now playing.  Is that something that you can relate to?
SIMONA HALEP: She's definitely with big confidence in this moment.  She played really well this year.  So it's going to be a big challenge, but I'm in the same position.  I feel good.  I feel confident.
You never know in the tennis match.  So I just want to be ready to fight and to give everything I have tomorrow.
Q. You said that chocolate was all the same in Canada: Toronto, Montreal.  Is there any special treat --
SIMONA HALEP: I didn't eat much this week.
Q. No.  Trying to keep it calm?
SIMONA HALEP: I can't eat.  But, yeah, I'm not worried about that.
