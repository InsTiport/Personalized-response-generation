6-7 (1), 6-4, 6-1,
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Simona Halep, please.
Q. How do you feel right now?
SIMONA HALEP: A bit tired.  A bit disappointed that I lost from a set and 4-1, but that's tennis.
I have to keep working and soon it will come in my way.
Q. What are your main objectives for the season?
SIMONA HALEP: To win a match first and to play all the tournaments.  To be healthy first and to be working hard like I did the last few weeks.  I'm happy that I'm healthy and I can work hard like I did.
Yeah, goals, I don't have.  I just want to go on court and to win matches.
Q. Regarding this tournament, Kerber left, Jelena left and you left as well the tournament.  So it's small open for other outsider.  What do you think?
SIMONA HALEP: When I came first here, I said the tournament is open.  Everyone can win.  Without us, it's the same thing.  Everyone can win.  And we'll see in the end.
Everyone is playing well at this level, so everyone has their own chance.
