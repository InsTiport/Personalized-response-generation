S. HALEP/K. Pliskova   
6-4, 7-5   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  That was very good performance against a player who has done well here and is a great player.  What were your thoughts on the match?  
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, I know was tough today.  Was very close.  I was leading in first set 5-1, but she came back really strong.  She did two games in a row at zero.  Yeah, I know that she's playing tough, she's playing well, and she's strong with the serve.   
You know, I expected that she's going to hit all the balls, so she did.  Against her you don't have rhythm too much, so that's why it's tough to play.   
I think I did well that I stayed focused in the last games, in the second set, and I could finish in two sets.  Because the weather was pretty warm and was tough for me to handle it.   
 Q.  The heat is a factor obviously in the Australian summer.  How do you recover from a draining day like that?  
SIMONA HALEP: I did ice bath before coming here.  I try to recover.   
Yeah, it's cold, but we need it.  Yeah, I will have a massage and ready for tomorrow.  I'm okay.  I'm not tired.  A little bit is normal.   
It's my second match this year, so I handle it and I'm fine.   
 Q.  Sick of getting questions about your Achilles every time you play?  
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, I had pain again in second game of second set.  After that game gone, so I felt okay today.   
 Q.  What was the message from Darren before you played Pliskova?  She was a runner-up here last year.  Any special message he gave you?  
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, we spoke about the match before.  Actually, I knew her.  I played few times, couple times against her, and I knew how she plays.   
Yeah, he told me what I have to do.  I think I did pretty well.  Was not my best day.  It was okay.   
 Q.  You seem to really enjoy the battle today.  Lots of fist pumping.  You happy with your energy and your positivity on the court today?  
SIMONA HALEP: I wasn't too positive today.  (Smiling.)  Yeah, was tough to say positive.  It's normal.  It's the second match, and since Singapore I didn't have official match.  It's tough to come back.   
It's okay.  It's good that I passed it.  Now I am in the semifinals first tournament.  I have just to enjoy and be more positive tomorrow.   
 Q.  You don't look like you've got any cobwebs from the pre-season.  You feel like you have any little kinks you want to get rid of in your game?  
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, of course.  I have to work more on my game.  I know what I have to do better, but takes time.  I need couple of months more to like make it stronger, my game.   
I have been for four weeks strong in Romania, and I did a good job with Darren.  I know that I improved a lot, but today my serve wasn't too good.   
About the pressure, a little bit emotions.  It's normal.  I accept if and I feel good now that I could win.   
 Q.  And you got Svetlana Kuznetsova next.  Thoughts on playing her?  
SIMONA HALEP: I know her pretty well.  I played against her.  I know that she's playing a lot of topspin, so it's different player tomorrow, different style.   
I like to play against her.  I had good matches with her.  I expect a tough one.  Of course every match at this level is very tough, but I believe I have my chance.   
So I'm going on court tomorrow positive and to take my chance.
