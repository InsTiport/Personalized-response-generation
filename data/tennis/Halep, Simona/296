  S. HALEP/B. Mattek-Sands  6-4, 7-5  An interview with:  SIMONA HALEP   THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   Q.  How would you rate your game for now?  Are you pleased with your game?  SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, I'm okay with my game.  I played well today, better than the second round, so this thing is good.  She was very strong and I just wanted to play my game, but, you know, it was a great, great match for both of us.  I was hitting aggressive and I stayed very close to the baseline.  I served well.  So I'm happy with my game now.   Q.  What do you expect for your next game against Yanina from Belgium?  SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, she beat me every time when I played her, but next round will be a new day.  I have my chance to win it.  But I expect a very tough match.  She's very tall and she's very strong.  So I have to wait and to prepare myself to be ready before the match.   Q.  Can I ask about your new racquet, how you're getting on with it and how it differs from the racquet you were using last season.  SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, it has more control, you know, also power I have with it.  I like a lot.  You know, if you feel good and if you like it, you want to play with it.  I have more control and more power with it.  I think now it's the best racquet for me.   Q.  When you first started training with it did you like it straightaway, or did it take you a little while to get used to it?  SIMONA HALEP: No, straightaway.  I just took it and I liked it.   Q.  About Yanina, would you ask Wim Fissette some advice about her game?  SIMONA HALEP: No.   Q.  You don't have contact anymore?  SIMONA HALEP: No, I don't have contact anymore.   Q.  What makes it tough to play against Yanina?  SIMONA HALEP: She was in the top 20 in the past.  I know her, that she's strong.  She hits the ball very, very strong.  Yeah, when I played against her.  Was like few years ago, so now it's other story because I improved a lot in my game.  But still I will be very focused for every point and I will fight for the match.  She serves well.  She hits with both sides very well.  I have to move very quickly and just to stay, make my game, to be aggressive, and to play fast.   Q.  She likes to play top players like you.  How is it for you to play against a girl who is the underdog?  Is that more dangerous?  SIMONA HALEP: No.  I think for me, in my opinion it's the same.  If I play with top players or if I play with like 20 or 30 on the rankings, is the same thing.  I think every player it's very tough now to play with because it's the highest level in tennis.  So we have to be careful to take every match very, very focused and to be very serious during the match, because you have to fight for every point.  So, I mean, I expect a tough match, so I'm prepared to play.   Q.  Last year was an incredible year for you.  What has changed in the way people look at you?  Do you feel expectations are maybe higher or...  SIMONA HALEP: You know, last year I played great in Grand Slams.  I did my first final.  So that gave me more confidence now to play in Grand Slams.  Everyone I think is expecting that I have to win every match - from Romania.  I know what I have to do.  I know what I want to do.  I'm working hard every day to do many more results.  We'll have to see.  It's not easy.   Q.  How is it for you in Romania?  Are you a big star?  SIMONA HALEP: I think I am now, yeah.  We have a small country, so everyone knows me now.  It's not easy, but it's nice, as well.  I enjoy.   Q.  You were back home in Romania during the off-season.  How long did it take you to get used to the conditions here?  SIMONA HALEP: It was very, very cold in my country, about minus 10 degrees.  But I started in Shenzhen where wasn't too hot, like 15, 20 degrees, so it was good.  I needed just few days to adapt.  So it was fine if I won there.  So everything was good there, yeah.   Q.  So the hot weather training is less important than getting good training wherever?  SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, I like to train home, so every time I'm going home to practice everything.   Q.  Can I ask why you decided not to work any more with Wim Fissette?  SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, we had a good season together.  But, you know, was my decision.  I just wanted to change something.  For me, you know, I mean, I have confidence in myself that I can play at the highest level in tennis.  So I believe in my chance.  Now I'm happy with my team.  Was my decision and I'm happy with it.
