A. RADWANSKA/S. Halep
  6‑3, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Just talk a little bit about what it was like today. 
SIMONA HALEP:   It was a tough match.   She played really well.   She deserved to win today.   Every ball was in for her, and I had to run a lot.   I think I started the match a bit too soft.   I was not ready to play. 
But she was a great player, and she is a great player.   Her game is very difficult for me.   It's difficult always to play against her.
I started soft like ‑‑in Doha I started too aggressive, and here I said that I have to change to start the match different style.   I did, but it wasn't too good. 
I wanted to find my way to play.   I did, but was too late in first set.   So, I mean, she played really well today and she deserved to win.   She was better than me today.

Q.   Do you want to talk about some of those rallies that went on forever?
SIMONA HALEP:   She was running unbelievable today (smiling). 
I hit the balls I think strong a few times, and she catched all the balls.   She's playing very flat balls.   The balls don't jump anymore, and is very difficult to play from down to up.
I did few mistakes, important mistakes with my backhand in the net.   Were very important moments at that time, and she did very well.   At that moment she did also serve and volley. 
I was very surprised at that ball.   I think I just have to say that she was better than me and she deserved to win today.   For sure she will do great final Sunday.

Q.   What are you going to take away from this match and this tournament?
SIMONA HALEP:   This tournament was very, very great for me.   I played really good matches here.   I'm very happy because I did semifinals.
I came after one injury.   A small injury, but was injury and was not easy to come back.
I just want to enjoy my result.   Tomorrow I will go to the pool, to the shopping again.   I have to be happy for my ranking, new ranking.   It's 5 in the world and it's amazing for me. 
I'm not sad because I lost here.   I think I could play more smart today, but I didn't.   So it happens.   And that's tennis.   I have to understand that I cannot win every match. 
So I'm fine.

Q.   Could you talk a little bit more about playing smart, what you could have done better?
SIMONA HALEP:   Smart like to open the angles, to be aggressive but not too aggressive.
I mean, I don't have to hit the balls very strong, just strong enough.   You know, to let the opponent to run more.   Yeah, I don't have to make mistakes.   You have to keep the ball on court. 
And to move well, I have my game like I play every time, and I feel it, but today wasn't easy because she's playing different game than the other players.   Is not easy to play from Bouchard or Safarova.   They are hitting the balls, and Radwanska is playing softer and more intelligent, and it's very tough to change.
It was a great match.   I think I played well, but she won.   It's okay.   I mean, she's No. 3 now or something like this.   She's a great player and she deserves to win.

Q.   Was the Achilles bothering you at all today?
SIMONA HALEP:   No, I don't have pain.   I feel good.
