M. BOUZKOVA/S. Halep   
6-4, 0-0 [Ret.]   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Could you just share with us what happened with the injury?  
SIMONA HALEP: Achilles problems.  I felt since the first match here.  And today I felt it more, so that's why I decided to retire.   
 Q.  A lot of people wanted to see a match tomorrow between you and Bianca.  Do you have any thoughts on that if you were?  
SIMONA HALEP: The match is Sunday if I would have played final.  So tomorrow it would have been Serena and is not easy.
