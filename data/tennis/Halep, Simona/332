  6‑2, 7‑5

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You started out so strong with the break.   What was your strategy going in?
SIMONA HALEP:   Yeah, I played really good.   I started good, the match.   She played good today.   We just tried to do a nice match today because was semifinals. 
I'm really, really happy that I won this match because I was nervous before the match.   She's a top player.   She's a good player.   But I just tried my best and I did well. 

Q.   You didn't seem to act nervous out there.   How high is your confidence level now?
SIMONA HALEP:   I have big confidence in me now.   I hit the racquet a little bit, but just because I did a lot of mistakes with my first serve. 
But I came back and I finished really good. 

Q.   So starting with Rome, you're 28‑5 in matches, three tournament championships.   What caused that? 
SIMONA HALEP:   I feel very good.   Was good period for me.   I play really good.   I feel the game.   On court I have pleasure, much pleasure than before.   I feel good.   I just trying to play my best every time and to be confidence with me every moment because that is the most important. 

Q.   What about playing Petra tomorrow in the final. 
SIMONA HALEP:   I didn't play against her, so I have to enjoy and to try my best because she's a great player.   She's a top player.   Will be tough match, I know this. 
But I just want to enjoy the finals again and just to play. 

Q.   How do you change your tactics, your game plan against her?   Petra hits a bigger ball. 
SIMONA HALEP:   Yeah, I know she hits the ball very strong.   But I didn't see her very good.   Tomorrow on court I will see. 
I will try to make something on court, just to be calm and to play the best.   It's most important to play relaxed because is the final. 

Q.   Were you trying to run Caroline back and forth a lot?
SIMONA HALEP:   Yeah, because she's running really good.   She's playing really good.   Her backhand, it's strong.   But I just try to play more on forehand, and that was very important, very good. 

Q.   So your success this year, two championships on clay, one on grass, but hard court hasn't been very good until this tournament, right?
SIMONA HALEP:   Every time I felt good on hard court.   I told that hard court is my favorite surface.   But I did well also on clay and grass. 
But now I'm playing really good on hard, too.   So I don't know which one is my favorite (smiling).   I like all the surfaces now. 

Q.   How much has your game changed since the last time you played here last year?
SIMONA HALEP:   I didn't play last year here.   It was two years ago. 
Now I feel more confident with my game.   I play really strong.   I am offensive, aggressive every time.   Just trying to hit the ball. 
I changed the coach.   He tried to make me like more confidence and to play more aggressive because I can do it. 

Q.   How close do you think you are to taking that next step to being a top player?
SIMONA HALEP:   For me? 

Q.   Yes. 
SIMONA HALEP:   It's very tough because it's higher level.   I'll try to do my best to get in top 20, because it's first step.   It's very hard, I know, but I have to keep going my hard work and to try to be in top 20 as soon as possible.   Is my dream. 

Q.   Was that a goal of yours for the year?
SIMONA HALEP:   No, I didn't say before this.   But now I think I'll be 21 starting Monday.   So I have just a little step.   But I hope after US Open I can do it.
