  6‑4, 6‑1 
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
   
 Q. Congratulations on that win. It didn't look like you were playing your first grass court event of the season. How do you sum it all up?  
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, it was my first match on grass. Pretty difficult at the beginning. It's tough because I'm not used. But I had many days practicing here. I feel the grass. I feel the court. I feel the atmosphere here. So I'm happy that I could win today. I'm looking forward for the next round, and maybe I will play better after two days.  
   
 Q. What was your grass court preparation? Was it just here?  
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, just here. I played two, three days in Birmingham, and then I couldn't start the tournament. So I went home for treatment for four days, and then I came straight to London. I was practicing here.  
   
 Q. How are you feeling now injury‑wise?  
SIMONA HALEP: I have like five days already without pain, so I feel good. Hopefully will stay like this, because this Achilles is very strange. Sometimes it's hurting me; sometimes not. Just I hope to be okay.   
   
 Q. Given that you haven't played any lead‑in events on grass, it's sort of a low‑key approach for you. Is that how you like it?  
SIMONA HALEP: Not really. I like to have some matches before Wimbledon, but this year I couldn't. My coach told me that it's better to come here straight to practice. In my head I had that it's better to play Eastbourne, but he said that it's better to come here straight because the conditions are the same and I have to get used.  
So I did like he said, and now I feel good.  
   
 Q. Speaking of your coach, can you talk about the influence of Darren Cahill.   
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah. The most important thing I think there is that he believes in me and I listen him what he says. What I have to do I do without questions. I trust him, and we have good communication also during the matches.  
So this give me more power, more confidence that I can win matches, and now I started to believe that I have the game to win more matches.  
   
 Q. Do you think you moved better than you maybe expected today?  
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah. I moved better. I was everywhere, I can say. She had only four winners, so means that I was pretty good on my legs.  
I played also okay, good game, but I missed a few shots easy balls with my forehand. So tomorrow I'm going to train more. But it was very good for the first match on grass.  
   
 Q. Did you just practice at Wimbledon before? Did you do practice sets with other players? Did you try to simulate matches?  
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah. Actually I played almost one match. Was set and five something and we had to stop because the hour was finished.  
But, yeah, I played many sets and it helped me a lot.  
   
 Q. Who did you practice with?  
SIMONA HALEP: Wickmayer. Who else? Many. I don't remember now. Sorry. Five, six players. So every day I had one player.   
   
 Q. Were you nervous then going into today's match, not knowing...   
SIMONA HALEP: I was. Yeah, I was a little bit at the beginning. But after two games when I started to feel that I am there, it was okay.
