P. KVITOVA/S. Halep   
6-1, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  When Petra is playing like that, is there much you can do?  
SIMONA HALEP: Actually, she played really well today.  She hit the ball very strong and with power.  She didn't miss.  It was tough to do something else.   
I tried to change a little bit.  But I think was not enough.  I didn't have the idea, best idea, to what I have to change.  But she did really well, amazing.  It was tough to do something.   
 Q.  It's your first loss against Petra.  Can you compare what she did today compared to the previous matches?  
SIMONA HALEP: She hit the ball stronger and she didn't miss that much.  I think I played a little bit too far back to the court.  I think she had time to do everything she wanted.   
But still her ball was strong and put me a little bit back.   
 Q.  Do you feel like your serve maybe let you down a little bit on the first-serve percentage?  
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah.  I tried to change, not to give her that much power, because she likes the power.  But, yeah, I missed a lot.   
In second set I started to serve better, stronger.  But still she did some winners there.  Was tough to continue everything.   
 Q.  What kind of positives do you feel you can take from this week?  
SIMONA HALEP: I'm going to Singapore (smiling).  I played semis, the best result here in China.  I played good matches, good tennis.  Even today I'm not negative.  I cannot be.  I played tough matches in the last months, and all were very, very good.  So I'm okay.   
 Q.  Have you been speaking to Darren over the phone?  
SIMONA HALEP: He's flying now.  He's going to Beijing.   
 Q.  Do you remember the last time you felt like this on the court?  She hit 34 winners.  Was there a match where you felt so powerless?  
SIMONA HALEP: Not really, not really.  I didn't play with someone hitting that strong.  Even with Serena, was slower, the ball was coming slower.  So, yeah, was the first match.   
 Q.  I don't think we see you serve and volley very often.  
SIMONA HALEP: Oh, you saw that?  It's amazing, huh (smiling)?   
 Q.  Did it hit the frame?  
SIMONA HALEP: No, no, no.  The string.  In the middle.  I wanted to do that.  C'mon, do something (smiling).   
 Q.  That was match point down.  
SIMONA HALEP: I didn't think about too much at the moment.  I just did it.   
 Q.  Were you trying to change things up, trying something?  
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah.  I tried, but was too late to change something at 6-1, 5-1.  It's a bit too late with someone that is playing this way.   
But it was nice and I felt well at that ball.   
 Q.  Facing someone who is so powerful, hitting winners everywhere, how do you cope with that?  Is there something you should have done, that you felt you should have done?  
SIMONA HALEP: Well, now I don't have idea about what I had to do to win this match.  But I felt that I stayed a little bit too far first, and then maybe too high the ball, and she had time.  She likes to hit from there.  Maybe some slices, but the ball was coming so strong.   
Yeah, now I don't know.  I will watch the match and I will learn something maybe.   
 Q.  The past three years you played in the Wuhan Open.  What do you think of your performance at the Wuhan Open?  
SIMONA HALEP: My performance this year, I think it's a good result because I played semifinals.  I win matches against good players.  I'm happy with the way I played this week.  Always was tough for me to adjust myself to these conditions in China.  Also the food was fine for me.  I'm healthy.  That's the most important thing.  I take it like a big positive.   
 Q.  Wuhan local fans are crazy about you.  Are you going to play in the next Wuhan Open?  
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, I saw the fans.  Also on my birthday day was really nice.  They did something amazing.  I was really happy.   
Yeah, for sure I will come next year.  Hope I will be healthy and come here with all the power to do better than this year.  We will see.   
But, yeah, I enjoy more and more playing here in Wuhan.
