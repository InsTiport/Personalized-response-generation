S. HALEP/K. Pliskova
  6‑4, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   What is her game's biggest challenge?   Obviously she's very powerful, consistent, big server.   You have beaten here twice now in about a month.   What is it about her game you have been able to match up well against?
SIMONA HALEP:   Yeah, I think I have a good return.   That's why I can win against her.   You know, my serve went very well today.   I am improving every day by day a lot, and I'm really happy for this.
I just try to play my game, to be aggressive, to stay very close to the baseline, but sometimes I did a step behind because she's hitting strong, like you said.
I have confidence right now, and maybe this one is the most important thing.   I go on court just to fight for every point.   Like you saw, I thought the match was finished at 5‑3. 
Yeah, I was fighting for every ball, and I think that's my style.   Now I feel pretty confident.

Q.   Is that something you had to learn?   I remember you said it was ‑ I think it was in Doha or Dubai ‑ where you were saying you need to become a fighter girl. 
SIMONA HALEP:   Yeah.   Again, I feel like I found my way again to fight for every ball and every match.   I lost this during Australian Open.   Against Makarova I didn't fight, and that was, you know, the worst thing in my mind.   Then I said that I don't want to stop fighting.
So I feel better now.   I feel more confident.   I'm just going on court just to play every match.

Q.   You said that you feel like your game has been improving as this tournament has gone along.   What specifically have you seen that's improved?
SIMONA HALEP:   In my serve? 

Q.   Just in your game in general. 
SIMONA HALEP:   In my game?   I think I hit stronger now.   I move better on court, and my serve, it's pretty good.   Was pretty good today. 
Yesterday I was working a lot to serve more like percentage, not too strong.   I was working with coaches, with my coach from Romania and with Darren Cahill from adidas.   He's helping me, and I'm really happy that I could serve better today.

Q.   Has it been tough having a lot of different coaches in a short time, having a lot of different voices?
SIMONA HALEP:   No, it's not tough.   For me, it's good.   I decided to have like this.
So I'm really happy with them, and they are really helping me now.

Q.   You have a lot of Romanian fans obviously.   Lepchenko match, especially.   The amount of support you get all around the world now, how happy does that make you?
SIMONA HALEP:   It's really exciting to see how many people can come to watch you playing.   They supporting me a lot, and it's really nice to see Romanian people around the world.
But everyone is it's really, you know, really supporting me.   I saw a few other people not from Romania that they are supporting me.   They like my game.   So I just want to thank them.   You know, I appreciate that they have time to see watching me.

Q.   I see Moldovan flags and flags and Bulgarian flags.   Everyone wants a part of you. 
SIMONA HALEP:   Doesn't matter what flag it's, just if they supporting me, that's okay.
