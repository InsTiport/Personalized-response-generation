E. SVITOLINA/S. Halep
4-6, 7-5, 6-1
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. First of all, how is your ankle?
SIMONA HALEP: It's sore.  It's a little bit big.  But it's normal.  It was pretty tough there in the first set when I switched it.
It happens, so that's it.
Q. It seemed like you were moving okay in the second set.  Did it start to get worse and worse and bother you more?
SIMONA HALEP: At 5-3 in the second set, when I turned to hit inside out forehand, then I felt again.  That's why I called to tape it, because I was scared not to do something worse.
I never like to give up during the match.  I don't want to stop the matches.  So I just wanted to try to win the second set.
I couldn't.  So then it was too bad to go through.  So I said that it's better to calm down.
Q. Was it more of a physical, something that prevented you the way you wanted to move, or a mental distraction to have this...
SIMONA HALEP: No, I had pain.  I had pain and I still have pain when I walk.
Mentally, it's not that bad.  So I'm strong, still strong, so I don't panic about this.  I had many on the other leg, but this one is new.
So I have to be careful with it.  Physically I couldn't run, so that's why I didn't do anything in the third set.
Q. Overall you have had this incredible clay court season so far.  Knowing that this accident that happened, does it make this loss easier at all?  You just know physically you weren't able to compete at your best and so there is no panic about this loss or anything?
SIMONA HALEP: No, I don't panic about this match.  I mean, she's a great player.  She plays really well this year.  She won so many tournaments.
No, I don't panic, and I will go to recover fast, as fast as possible, and to go to Roland Garros.  It's what I'm looking for.
Q. What is your recovery and the next couple days going to look like?  It's only one week essentially until Paris.
SIMONA HALEP: I think it's enough.  I think it's enough for an ankle, but I have to do MRI to see what it is.  I go home to do that, so tomorrow I will find out.
Hopefully it's not that bad.  I don't feel it that bad, but I still feel pain.  So I have to go and check.
Q. Would it have been your decision to just put the racquet aside for maybe a day and three in general?  Because you have had a lot of matches over the last two weeks or so.  Just to get your head free?
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, definitely tomorrow I will not play (smiling).  Tuesday, I don't know.  Depends of my leg.
But few days, yeah, I will have few days off, recovering with everything and then to start again.
Q. Do you think you are still the favorite for Roland Garros?
SIMONA HALEP: No.  No.  In this moment, no.
Q. Who do you think is?  If not you, who?
SIMONA HALEP: About 15 players.
Q. Just a little bit about Elina, playing her.  You haven't played her since Sofia a long time ago.  What did you make of her game and how has she improved?  What makes her a difficult opponent?
SIMONA HALEP: Well, I don't remember exactly how she played in Sofia.  I don't even remember how I played there.  So it's tough.
But she's very strong.  We can see that she has won many tournaments this year.  So far she played really well.
I think she has confidence.  She feels the game, and she goes there without, like, nothing to lose.  That's why she's playing great.
