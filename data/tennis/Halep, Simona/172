5-7, 6-4, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Talk us through that match.  
SIMONA HALEP: It was tough match.  It was a tough match.  I was leading.  I think I played really well, but in the third set I was a little bit tired.  It's normal.  I played many sets today.  But was a good match and in the end she was stronger.   
 Q.  Do you feel much more confident going into Wimbledon now that you have the two match wins on grass?  
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, it's a good thing, my opinion, and I feel that it was really good to come here and to play these matches.   
But the rain was a little bit tough with us.  I feel a little bit tired, but I have enough time to recover and I'm looking forward to go to London.   
 Q.  Obviously rain delays are nothing new, but six sets in one day?  It could have been worse.  You could have been playing three times in a day.  You're glad you got at least one match out of the way?  
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, I'm really glad, actually.  It was tough.  I played two matches with three sets but tough sets.  The first match was really tough today.   
On grass everything is tough, so you never know.  But I was really happy that I could win the first one and then to play three sets again.   
 Q.  Explain a little bit about the physical and indeed the mental transition from clay to grass.  
SIMONA HALEP: It's different, totally different, the game.  The time of the balls, the points here are fast.  Still I played two hours every match.   
It's different.  I feel that I started to play well on grass even if I had a good clay court season and I was, like, 100% there with everything, the feelings and the game.   
But now I switched fast.  I feel ready.  But we'll see.  Every match is difficult on grass, so I don't have expectations.   
 Q.  Have you enjoyed your first time in Eastbourne this year?  
SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, nice question.  I enjoyed (smiling).  I enjoyed.  And I like that I have sea view from my room.   
 Q.  Have you any other reflections on Eastbourne this week?  Anything amusing happen to you at all?  
SIMONA HALEP: The rain was a little bit tough with us.  I don't want to remember only that.   
I remember that I played good tennis.  I remember that the courts are good.  The people are nice.  The atmosphere during the matches is nice.  It's fair.  You don't hear, like, every time loud crowd.  They are very nice.  I feel that here is, like, elegant feeling for everything.   
 Q.  What do you do to occupy yourself in a rain delay?  
SIMONA HALEP: Nothing much.  Just breathing, listening to music and talking with my team and home with WhatsApp, you know, that I stay all the time on WhatsApp.   
 Q.  What's your plan now going forward?  When will you head to Wimbledon?  
SIMONA HALEP: Tomorrow I go to Wimbledon.  I already put my practice, so I'm on fire.
