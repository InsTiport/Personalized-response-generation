  6-2, 7-5

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Heck of a first-round match. You just took out the French Open champion. What does that mean to you?
 SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, it's a great win for me. It's unbelievable. I feel very good. I played good. I played before a lot of great players, Serena Williams in Wimbledon, Kuznetsova in Toronto. 
 A lot of good matches for me. This one, it's my best. 

 Q. She said she played like shit. 
 SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, maybe she played like shit, but it's okay (smiling). 

 Q. Were you surprised? 
 SIMONA HALEP: Yes, I am surprised because she's a great player. If she said she played shit, it means she is playing good because she doesn't play very bad because she won the French Open. 
 I don't know. I felt very good the ball, the court, and I am happy that I beat her. 

 Q. How much does that lift your confidence? 
 SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, it's a very good win for me. I am a little bit injured at my ankle. But I hope that next match I'll be better and I'll feel better, my foot. And I hope that I play my best again. 

 Q. It's been a good tournament for Romania so far. 
 SIMONA HALEP: Yeah. 

 Q. Did you watch any of the match yesterday? 
 SIMONA HALEP: No, I didn't watch because I had practice and treatment for my foot. 
 But it's a great win, winning for her also. I want to congratulate her. It's very good. 

 Q. When you hear that result yesterday, do you even get a little more confidence, if she can do it, I can do it, too?
 SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, it means good for me. I played two weeks ago with Kuznetsova and I won. And today was much better for me to play again with top player. 

 Q. She's the French Open champion. You didn't appear intimidated. Is it the depth of women's tennis? How do you go into that and not feel like you're playing a Grand Slam champ?
 SIMONA HALEP: Yes, it's not easy to play against one Grand Slam champ because it's very top level. I had emotion. I was nervous before the match. But I wanted just to enjoy the match, to feel the ball good, and to play my best. And was good. 

 Q. When did you hurt your ankle?
 SIMONA HALEP: In Toronto, before Kuznetsova's match. Yeah, there I switched my ankle. 

 Q. You seem to be playing well since you hurt it. 
 SIMONA HALEP: Yeah, I hope that I can play more with this.
