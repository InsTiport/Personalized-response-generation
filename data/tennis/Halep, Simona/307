S. HALEP/L. Tsurenko
  6/3, 4/6, 6/4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Pat Cash has spoken about some female players having to play without their bras on, the color of their underwear contravene Wimbledon rules.   What are your thoughts about that?
SIMONA HALEP:   I think it's special to play here.   They have the special rules because you have to be in white.   I think it's not really difficult to get white clothes.
So I like this tradition.   It's really nice to see everybody in white clothes. 

Q.   What happened in the second set?   Didn't look like you were enjoying yourself. 
SIMONA HALEP:   Yeah, I didn't play my best today.   It was tough match.   I expected that she will play very well; she did.
You know, on grass is not easy.   Every match is difficult.   You never know who will win or who will lose because the court, it's really difficult. 
I believed in my chance today, but after I lost second set, I said that maybe I lose the match because I didn't feel my game.
But I was keep fighting and I was enjoying in the third set after I took the break out of the court.
I left the pressure outside and I just wanted to hit the balls and to stay aggressive.
Wasn't my best match, but I'm really happy that I could finish well in my way. 

Q.   What will you need to do better in the next match? 
SIMONA HALEP:   I think I played bad today because I stayed two days.   It's not easy to wait two days for a match.
Tomorrow I have again match.   She's a young player; she's a strong player; I never played against her; will be first time.   I hope just to feel my game, to be aggressive again, and to fight for every ball.
Like I said, on grass you never know what can happen. 

Q.   My question is also about Belinda Bencic.   Also a very talented junior Wimbledon champion.   How do you prepare for a match like that?
SIMONA HALEP:   Like always.   I prepare the match like always:   I stay relaxed and I will practice I think today again because I didn't feel my game very well today.
Yeah, I expect a tough match.   I didn't see her playing never, and tomorrow will be a little bit tough because I heard she's a good player and she's strong.   She's also aggressive. 
So our games are almost the same.   But I believe in myself and I think I have my chance to win tomorrow. 

Q.   Again about Bencic.   You have been sort of like a young, up‑and‑coming player.   Now you're No. 3 in the world and you are going to face a player that is way younger than you.   Maybe she has nothing to lose against you. 
SIMONA HALEP:   For sure will be like this.   I mean, she has nothing to lose against me.   Also, I have nothing to lose because is first time third round here in Wimbledon.   On grass it's always difficult to play.
So I have my chance tomorrow.   I will fight for it.   I will try to find my good way to play and to be happy on court.
She will play for sure good tennis tomorrow.   I expect a tough match.   But I'm ready and I'm prepared to play against her.
