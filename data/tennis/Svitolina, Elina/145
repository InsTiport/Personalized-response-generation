6-3, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Did you just feel like you were in control pretty much throughout the match today?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, I was trying to be under control.  Under control of my emotions was the key.  Yeah, I think today was really windy, so I needed to, yeah, try to adjust fast.   
I know she was struggling little bit.  I think, yeah, this was the key, that I adjusted fast, yeah, was under control almost all the match.   
 Q.  She had 33 unforced errors during the match.  Was your focus on making sure that you didn't make those kind of errors?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, I think so.  I was trying to push her to make those errors.  I think in the end she was just going for too much.  I know that she's a shot-maker.  I was trying to give her one more ball to hit, and to go little bit further probably.   
So, yeah, today she was making more mistakes.  I think I was playing quite solid.  Okay, I did some mistakes, as well, but I think less.  I don't know how many I did, unforced errors.  The score looks like I made less unforced errors and more winners, so...   
 Q.  Talk about this summer, what it means to you to get this far in this tournament after what you did in the Olympics and how you're set up for next week.  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, it was great result for me in Olympics.  I think it brought me a lot of confidence.  I'm playing well.  Today was great match.  I'm feeling good on court.  Doesn't matter about the result tomorrow.  I think I'm going to just try and play my game, and we'll see.   
I'm serving really well, feeling good on the court.  So I'm going to try to play my game tomorrow.  We'll see what is going to bring tomorrow.   
 Q.  A lot of this tournament is about getting ready for next week.  When you get to this point and see a possibility of winning a championship, does your focus switch at all?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: No, I don't think this way, that this tournament is preparation.  This tournament is a new tournament.  Every match is a challenge.  I don't take it as a preparation.  I just take every match what I can challenge myself today.   
Yeah, it's great to play here, to play in front of people that are watching every day, trying to support us.  Yeah, I'm really happy that I play great all my three matches and finally I can play non-Russian player tomorrow (smiling).   
We'll see.  New day, new opportunities, new challenges.   
 Q.  What has led to the strong play during the summer?  Is it just your serve or are you doing other things well right now?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, I think I move player on the court well.  Return been great today, yeah, from the start.  I think I had three strong players, three strong shot-makers.  Yeah, I've been really strong during all those three matches.  I really happy the way I played and served.  I think you can see in the last game, I was really strong.  Today was really solid performance from me.   
 Q.  You never played Larsson before.  What do you know about her game?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: I know she's quite aggressive player.  She also plays with a lot of spin, tries to move you around.  Yeah, I need to move and to look for the ball, to be really focused every point.   
I think I'm just going to go out there and play my game.  Yeah, I'm feeling good, so we'll see.  It's going to be tough match, for sure.
