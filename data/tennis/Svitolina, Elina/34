E. SVITOLINA/P. Martic
6-4, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How would you describe your hunger to go deep here, all the way?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Well, I didn't really expect at the beginning of the tournament.  Really when I go into the Wimbledon, I don't have any expectations.  It's very not different, but just I say tougher for me to play here before.  So I didn't really play well here before, so I had no expectations going into this tournament.
That's why, yeah, it's just take one match at a time.  Just try to focus.
Q. What did you learn about playing on grass over the years?
ELINA SVITOLINA: I think it's very important to be mentally strong because on this surface, sometimes you have to expect that the balls are going to skid, that you have to, you know, just go more for your shots.  Sometimes it's, yeah, tough to get used to it, where you need to just take one point at a time.
So don't think so much about what's going on because it can change like in one moment.  You can be winning, then the opponent can get the momentum.
Q. Can you tell us a little bit about your connection with London.  Do you have a home here?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Well, I had a coach, like, four years ago I think from London, so I used to come here a lot.  Now my coach is also from here, so I decided to move to London a few years ago.
Now I train between Geneva and here.  I come quite a lot to London.  I love the place.  I love the atmosphere.  I love the city.  I really enjoy spending time here.  Yeah, for me it's very comfortable.
I can train at the national center.  It's perfect conditions for the players to improve their game.
It's really comfortable, very easy also to travel to the other tournaments around the world.
Q. Can we see you as an honorary Brit then?
ELINA SVITOLINA: I'm not sure about it.  I love my country, so...  But I spend lots of time here.  I love London.  Is one of my favorite.
Q. Since the opponents you might face are still on the court, could you start with Pliskova.  How can you describe what you've been able to do so well against her, winning your last three matches?
ELINA SVITOLINA: We played many times.  I think even we played in juniors or something.  It was, like, many years ago.  I know her game.  We practice quite a bit.  We both know each other's game.
It's going to be first time that we play I think on grass, so is going to be an interesting match.  It's a quarterfinal.  So it's exciting for both of us, I guess, to go into semifinal.
Yeah, it's going to be a good match.  Have to just keep working my way into the matches.  Yeah, just try to stay focused on my game.
Q. She won the first five times you played one another.  You've won the last three.  What's been the key to turning it around?
ELINA SVITOLINA: I think I became more just a better player myself.  I think physically I became stronger.  My game improved since the few times we played when she won, even though it was very tough matches, I think three sets.
In general, I think we are both good players.  Just, I don't know, sometimes...  Last three matches I won, but I don't think it's massive difference or makes a difference.
Q. If you play the other Karolina, what would be the key?
ELINA SVITOLINA: I think I played against her once.  Actually she's very, very talented.  I think it's tough to play against her on grass because she has lots of variety.  I think I played similar player today.  If I'm going to play against her, it's going to be quite the same match plan for the next match if I play against her.
Q. Looking at your record, remarkable you haven't been past the quarterfinals with your talent.  Do you think this might be your time?
ELINA SVITOLINA: I don't want to put any pressure on myself.  I know I haven't been past the quarterfinal, but, yeah, I think it's a matter of time.  I'm still 24 years old.  Yeah, just I have to take my time to don't put so much pressure on myself, just to take the match itself, just try to think maybe it's the first round.
Yeah, just go from there.
Q. You spoke about being a better player yourself, that that is why you've been able to do well against Pliskova.  What has made you better?  What about your game is better today than was a couple years ago?
ELINA SVITOLINA: I think little bit of everything.  To be a top player, you have to improve everything little bit.  To stay on top, you have to be consistent.  That's why you have to have groundstrokes very solid.  You have to have the variety of your game.  If Plan A is not working, then you go into Plan B and you try to win the match that way.
Also physically you have to be stronger to play so many matches throughout the year, to still have this motivation to go to the tournaments with the hunger to win them.  To have this, it's important just to keep consistency.  That's how you become a better player.  That's how you become a top player.
Q. Of all the times in your career, how would you compare how you feel about your game today with everything before?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Well, definitely I feel much, much better.  I feel physically more fresh, much more stronger than before.  I was struggling little bit with my injury for the past few months.  Now I finally have a chance to play 100%, push my physique to 100%.  Before I started to feel pain, I start to listen more to my body.  Sometimes you get confused because it want to get more injured.
That's why now it's actually much better.  I can push.  I have opportunity to just play my best tennis.
Q. I understand you're a big boxing fan.  You have a fighting spirit.  I read that you worked on the pads, as well.  Is that part of your training?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Actually I do the boxing workouts.  Actually in London it's very popular.  That's maybe why I love London.  I love watching it.  In Ukraine there is great fighters.  I don't know why, but, yeah, just from the long time ago I start doing boxing with my brother.  Then throughout the years, yeah, continue doing it.
I think it's a great workout because sometimes you just need to let go the negative things in your head.  Sometimes it's frustrating matches that you lose.  I think it's a good workout also for your mind.
Q. You're a fan of Anthony Joshua?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, big fan of his.  Unfortunately last fight wasn't great.
