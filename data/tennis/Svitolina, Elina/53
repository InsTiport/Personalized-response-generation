THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Good, solid performance.  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Well, another good day, so I'm very pleased with the way I played today.  It was very tough.  I was expecting a tough match.  She made me work for every ball.  In the end, I was very solid and happy the way I played.   
 Q.  With all the discussion of history, all the things that are on the line this week, how pleased are you with how you were able to navigate it all?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: I tried to put it on the side.  Of course, it's a very nice motivation.  In same time, I'm here to win as many matches as I can.  For me every match is another story.  I try to be ready for it physically and mentally, then what happen happens.   
 Q.  For some people, when they go to a tournament as defending champion, they feel pressure.  With you, you seem to be better each time.  What is your mentality in these situations?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Well, the tournament is not finished yet.  I want to just focus on what I have to do my next match.  Semifinal is going to be another tough one.  For me, it's just important to take one match at a time, to don't look so much ahead.   
I'm going to give everything to play my best tennis.  This matters the most for me.  I've been working on this for long time.   
 Q.  Did you see any of the match before you went out?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, I saw little bit.   
 Q.  Do you have any thoughts?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: I think they both looked little bit tired.  It was a good match anyway.  They had very long rallies.  It's going to be tough.   
She deserve to be in semifinal as much as me.  For sure is going to play some good tennis.  I'll have to be ready for it.  Yeah, just another match.
