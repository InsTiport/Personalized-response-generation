 Q.  You managed to do it in 65 minutes, which is pretty incredible.  Were you surprised how little time it took you to clinch that crown?

 Q.  It's a long tour.  We've seen a lot of people unavailable for the Oz Open on men's and women's.  At the start of the year, is it a bit daunting looking forward and going, Oh, god, there's so many tournaments to come?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, of course.  You know, our season is one of the longest in sports, and that's why you have to be consistent.  You have to be ready to compete at your best.
