6-3, 1-6, 6-0
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What changed between the second and third sets?
ELINA SVITOLINA: I think I just gave her this chance to come back into the match.  Obviously it's very, you know, disappointing that I let her back into it.  And then, you know, she went full, yeah, got rewarded which, yeah, I'm really disappointing.
Q. How do you assess your performance in Grand Slams this year?
ELINA SVITOLINA: I would say it's average.  I was expecting a little bit better results, especially, you know, Roland Garros and here, as well.
But I lost to the players that were like playing really amazing tennis against me and was tough matches.
So, yeah, it's disappointing, but, you know, I have to look forward and, yeah, just go back on court and put the hours of work.
Q. Is there something in your game you feel you need to change going forward from this?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, I think there is few things I have to sit down with my team and think about.  I think physically have to get much stronger since, yeah, there have been a change in my body.
I think, you know, it takes a little bit more time than I expected to get used to it, because I have to change a little bit my game style.  Because, you know, playing the same way as I was playing last year, I know my body is not allowing me to show my best.
I have to think what I have to do differently.  You know, for the moment, it's tough to say, because after the match, you know.  You are sad and disappointed.
Q. What's your upcoming schedule?  You will leave New York very soon or stay here for a couple more days?
ELINA SVITOLINA: I will stay a little bit in New York.  You know, I have friends here.  You know, I have a little bit of time to think about what I'm going to do.  Maybe think about playing Tokyo.  Depends, you know, how I'm going to feel.  Maybe go to see my brother in Los Angeles.  I have maybe preparation there.
I have few options, and I will see.  It's tough to decide now (smiling).
Q. Is there any positives that you take away from this week?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, I think in general this American swing was solid, but not as good as I would have wanted.
I played, you know, quarterfinals, semifinal in Montreal, here last 16 is not bad.  I showed good tennis.  Yeah, no, I'm moving forward step by step, little by little, which is good, but, you know, I want to improve, I want to be better.  You know, it takes time.  You know, I'm ready for hard work.
And Asian swing, as well.  You know, my goal is to play in Singapore, so I'm going to do everything what it takes to be there.
