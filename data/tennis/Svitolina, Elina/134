A. RADWANSKA/E. Svitolina
6-1, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You seemed to figure things out a little more in the second set.  What was she doing in the first set to be so dominant?
ELINA SVITOLINA: I think her game was on top.  She always play this way, really low.  The balls are really low and they're like skidding little bit.
She was at her best, I think.  And me, I was a bit up and down all the time.  It's really tough to play against her when she's getting each ball and playing so deep.
So, yeah, was a bit struggling.  In the second set, I think I found a way.  Yeah, it was really, really tight second set.
Yeah, sometimes it happens.  I was little bit not focused 100%.  But it's finals, you know.  Everything can happen.
I'm happy that I could find the way and play my game in the second set.
Q. You had two set points in the second set.  What happened there and was your ankle bothering you at all?
ELINA SVITOLINA: My ankle was fine.  I just twist it.  But, I don't know, it's cracked back.  It's fine.  I was little bit worry.  In the end, I was running, and it was fine.
Yeah, set points, they come and go in five seconds.  She served two big serves.  She placed it really well.  But I think I was kind of expecting this from her because she's so experienced and she knows what she can and what she cannot do.  Otherwise she wouldn't win so many titles, being so many years top 10, top 5 in the world.
Yeah, I needed to play better, to be more patient.  But today she was more patient and more aggressive on important points.  I think that's what happened in the second set.
Q. Overall are you happy with your week here going into the Open?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, of course it's great to have many matches here.  There's not so many difference between New York and here.  It's great to play in the final and to play against her and to see in which level you are before US Open.
Of course, I'm little bit disappointed in first set today.  But I think it happens sometimes.  So, yeah, for the rest I'm positive.  I'm looking forward to play on Monday.  I play on Monday already.  We'll see.
There is no time to be sad because US Open is just on Monday.
