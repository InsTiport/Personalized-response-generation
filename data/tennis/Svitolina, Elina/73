E. SVITOLINA/Q. Wang   
6-4, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  She's a tough opponent.  Hits hard.  A slugfest out there.  Straight-set win.  How do you feel?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, you know, I played against her couple of times.  For me was very important, you know, to take one point at a time and always put pressure, because last time I played, I lost second set because I was a little bit, you know, not consistent with my game.   
So, you know, I was just trying to stay focused and I think it helped.   
 Q.  Tough opponent coming up.  I don't think you guys have met before.  One time?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Once, yeah, but long time ago.   
 Q.  Just talk about that matchup.  Obviously she's playing very well, as well.  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, of course, she's top 20, so she deserves to be out there.  Yeah, I'm going to just try to prepare for her game.  It's a little bit tricky with the slice, a little bit of spin.  You know, make sure of different things.   
That's why it's for me, it's important to be ready for this.  Physically, mentally be fresh.  That's, you know, to give myself a good chance to win.   
 Q.  That second set today was tougher than the scoreline probably looks.  How did you pull it out?  You were down a break and then she's coming back as you're serving for it.  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, you know, that's tennis.  If you give a small chance to the opponent, it can turn the match.   
So that's why I have to fight for every ball.  You know, I gave her this little chance.  Then in next game straightaway, you know, she gave me the chance to play aggressive, to dictate the game.  I took it.   
In tennis, it's always up and down.  You win, lose it, but who is more consistent, that person wins.   
 Q.  Just assess your game right now.  Are you happy with all aspects of your game?  Are there things you'd like to see improved going into the latter rounds, second week?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, you know, from the beginning, I think I was getting better and better.  Each match gave me different look on my game.  You know, I'm working really hard on day offs, and on my game, you know, to be ready for the matches.   
I think, yeah, so far I think I'm playing really solid.  That's what we are looking for.  Hopefully next match is going to be good.   
 Q.  I know players don't like to look beyond the next match and you obviously have a big challenge ahead, but do you think right now you have the game to really go deep into next week?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Well, as you said, it's important to take one match at a time.  I believe that I have a game, you know.  I have won big tournaments.  I beat good players in the past.  For me, you know, it's just, you know, the matter of if I can do it, you know, in a Grand Slam.   
I believe that I can do it.  I work for it really, really hard.  I just try to earn this opportunity to play well and to go deep into the tournament.   
 Q.  How did you deal with the conditions today?  It was obviously a lot cooler, less humid than the last few times you played.  
ELINA SVITOLINA: You just adjust.  You adjust your tension, you adjust your game a little bit.   
It's the part of tennis.  You have to be ready.  You know, everyone is in the same conditions, so everyone has to adjust in their way, their own way.  For me, yeah, it's the same.  I just try to think what's the best, what's the best for me, and then just trust the decisions.   
 Q.  You're playing more doubles this year.  You've got mixed with Bruno, of course.  Was there a specific reason you wanted to add more doubles to your schedule this slam?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, I'm playing mixed like in 30 minutes.  I try to work on my game and I'm trying different things, you know, to see if they're gonna help mentally.  And also, for my game, I think, you know, I'm going more forward and finishing at the net.  You know, these kind of things that mixed doubles and doubles, they are helping me.  That's what I been looking for.   
Sometimes I play and sometimes I don't play.  This slam is just another, yeah, decision.   
 Q.  Is this the best that you have felt at a major tournament this year?  Physically, mentally?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: I feel good now, but I think I was feeling really good in Australia, as well.  I was really confident after winning Brisbane.  And, you know, that small injury that I got before going into the Mertens match was really disappointing for me, because I was really on top of my game and was feeling great.   
This is a little bit different, but still, you know, I feel good with my tennis and I think we can see on the scoreboard.   
 Q.  A few words about Olga.  She played her last match with you in the doubles.  She said she was keeping it quiet and then you told everyone in press.  
ELINA SVITOLINA: I didn't know it was a secret, so, I mean, yeah, it's been a long journey for her.  I remember when we were playing ITFs together, and then she was already playing great in singles and doubles, you know.   
Today, all the experience that she shared with me, this was really impressive.  You know, there is not so many players who are like that.  That's why, you know, our friendship really, yeah, really strong.  I'm really happy, you know, that I played with her, her last match.   
Definitely there is lots of memories ahead, moments in her career that she will remember.  It's a new chapter for her.  I'm really excited about it, and she is, too.
