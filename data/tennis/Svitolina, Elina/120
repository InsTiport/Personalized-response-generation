THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  After a difficult match on Monday, was it nice to get an easier win today?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, sure, it was much, much more confident win.  And I felt much confident on the grass.  I think I showed that, you know, I can play well and I can, you know, feel confident on the grass.   
 Q.  Did you feel like every part of your game was working well today?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Well, I needed to work myself into the match because I didn't feel so well.  Yeah, I was a bit struggling at the start.  I was a bit slow.  Needed, you know, some time to be there, mentally as well.   
Yeah, I think everything was working well.  You know, it was quite good to see that I can, even when I'm not feeling good, show good game and work myself into the match.   
 Q.  Do you feel like you're starting to build some momentum now in this tournament?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Well, I take always one match at a time.  I try to don't really look at the draw.  I have my next round.   
I play good tennis.  I serve good.  But, you know, I need to work on some things to be ready for next round.  There is always tougher opponent.  Yeah, it's going to be something new, because the first time for me here in the third round.  It's very exciting.   
But, yeah, we'll go tomorrow on practice court, work on my game, be ready for next round.   
 Q.  Is the injury responding okay?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Well, we can see that I'm walking, so it's already a good news (smiling).   
There is still a bit of an issue.  But everyone is doing their best, physios, WTA physios, tournament doctors, my physio, you know, my team.  We are really working hard to prevent the injury and to, you know, get it better.   
But it unfortunately cannot get better when I'm playing.  Luckily it's not getting worse.  Well, it's still there.  It's hanging.   
 Q.  What do you think of the London heat today, the tropical weather conditions you were playing in?  Were you ready for that?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Well, I spent already little bit of time in London.  Last month was most days high temperature.  So it is very surprising because we are all used to rain and wait and rain, rain again.  So it's a little bit of a surprise.  But I think it's a good surprise from up there.   
 Q.  What do you know about your next opponent?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Next opponent, I know that she hits very hard.  I know that she can play a good match.   
But I will try to do everything what is in my power to not make her play her best.  Play my game, focus on what I have to do, focus on the things that I need to produce to be ready for the match.  Just enjoy.  It's the first time for me.   
 Q.  Are there any types of opponents you find more difficult to face than others, big servers, hitters, people who move you around the court a lot?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Every player produce something different.  Every person is different.  Personality is different.  Everyone tries to do their way.  It always comes up differently.   
When I go on court, it's very, like, interesting to see what the player going to come up with.  Sometimes, you know, when I watched my matches back, I always want to see what they come up with because sometimes, you know, some players, they play differently against me.  So it's always nice to see, like, what they think.   
For me, you know, I don't really think about opponent's game.  Of course, I know few things what opponent doesn't like or does worse.  You know, such a high level that we're playing now, there is no player, like, who is playing shit from forehand or backhand or who is serving underarm.  There is no such a player like this.   
For me, I need to be out there and be ready for everything, show my best.   
 Q.  Do you feel like you have the shots and movement to take on anyone?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Well, I think it's the question for you (smiling).   
For me, I do my best.  I try to work on every aspect of my game, everything, from dropshots to smashes.  Then, you know, I feel confident on going into the match when I can say to myself, You did everything on the practice court, so now it's time to show your game.
