THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How do you feel so far in Melbourne after your big week in Brisbane?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Well, I feel good.  It's nice to be back.  Unfortunately, bad weather is here.  Doesn't seem like we are in Australia really.
So, yeah, I'm very happy to be back.  Training, yeah, just enjoying first Grand Slam of the year.  Always exciting.
Q. To play the first week of the year the way you did, to win, then to not play the second week before a slam, is that something you feel differently about compared to previous years, having a different approach?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, definitely this was one of the things that we changed from one year probably.  I was always playing before a tournament before the Grand Slam.  I think it's quite exhausting because you already with your mind there on the Grand Slam.  Probably adds little bit more pressure.
For me, you know, I'm that kind of player that likes to be 100%.  I was pretty much, like, exhausted going into Grand Slams.  This was decision we made.
Q. You play against a qualifier first.  They're not even done with the second round of qualifying because of the rain.  I don't know if that helps because you probably won't know your opponent till Sunday night.
ELINA SVITOLINA: It's fine.  I don't have choice.  I cannot, you know, change the weather or change this thing.  For me, doesn't really matter against who I'm going to play.  For me, it's important to bring my game into the match and be ready, really focused and fresh.  Yeah, that's the goal.
Q. When you sit down and talk to your coaches, what do you think is the key for the next couple weeks to get a better result than you have in the past here?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Well, each Grand Slam is always little bit different because it depends how you do in the tournaments before, how much confidence you have.  I had a great, yeah, week in Brisbane.  Of course, I'm confident.
But I try to take one match -- I will try to take one match at a time, be really focused on my game, and don't have, like, crazy thoughts in my head.
Q. When you talk about things getting complicated sometimes, your mind wandering, what do you mean by that?  What makes those moments complicated at slams for you?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Well, you have lots of different kind of pressure when you're playing Grand Slam, from the media, from expectations from everyone.  Sometimes you're really, like, not focusing on your game and just playing, just playing not 100%.  You're not focused on your game plan, you're not ready to compete.  Yeah, just all over the place.  It can happen.
Just that moment where you have to just come back to the basics, just start building again.
Q. Can that come from wanting it too much?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Of course.  Everyone wants to win a Grand Slam.  Everyone wants to play well.  So, I mean, I try to find my way, what can help me to be there, to be ready for the fight.  Yeah, just one match at a time.  Just see how it goes.
Q. I went to the cricket in Sydney.  I bumped into Don.  He said he came to the final in Brisbane and sat in your players box.
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, it was very special.  I didn't know that he was coming.  Then tell me for the final, he was supposed to come.  I was like, no pressure.
Yeah, it was so nice from him to come and to support me on that day.  Yeah, I mean, thankful for his time.
Q. He said no one knew who he was.  He just told them he was security when he was asked.
ELINA SVITOLINA: Well, yeah.
