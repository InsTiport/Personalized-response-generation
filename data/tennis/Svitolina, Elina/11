THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Not a good day for you today. What went wrong?
ELINA SVITOLINA: It's tough to say. I don't know. It was not a bad start, but then everything just went downhill. I wish I could regroup better. In the end, I didn't feel so good the ball. Just everything was all over the place today.
Q. It's unusual when you play so well here for so many years really.
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, that's why it's more upset about that. It's very tough to say now what happen, why did I play the way I play. Yeah, I wish I could play better here because I really love to compete here. I have great memories.
Yeah, it's very, very tough for me.
Q. You had such a great finish to the last season. What went wrong this time? You've struggled the whole year so far.
ELINA SVITOLINA: I'm trying still to find what's going on, what I have to add to improve. Yeah, it's very tough to pick one thing. I think just everything has to come together. I have to be stronger physically. I have to be in a better shape. Just everything has to get better.
We're working hard, but something is maybe not right now. We will continue working and trying to find that particular moment where I will feel better and play better.
Q. Can you say maybe one thing that was working last year which isn't working this time?
ELINA SVITOLINA: I think at this level it's tough to pick just one thing because everybody is putting the ball over the net, and you have to play long rallies, you have to build the points. It's not one thing.
I mean, generally I think I was more composed with my game. Now it's little bit of a struggle. Maybe, I don't know, mentally or something. Everything needs to get better to get back on the level at least where I was.
Q. How difficult was it to play somebody who had already played three qualifying matches?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Well, for sure this was little bit of advantage for her. But I played well here before. I mean, I don't have any excuses. I had to find the way. I had to play better. I had to fight. Unfortunately, yeah, it didn't happen. I didn't play even 10% of what I can.
Q. How much does this sort of affect the next thing that you're going to do?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Oh, it doesn't affect my tournament scheduling. I'm going to Doha next week. For now we have tournaments almost every single week. You have to get ready. You have to regroup. The bad days happen. Today unfortunately was one of them. You have to try to avoid to let it happen next week.
I'm going to get back on the court and work on my game.
