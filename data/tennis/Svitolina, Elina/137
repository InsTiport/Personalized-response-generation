An interview with:
ELINA SVITOLINA
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Of course you don't ever want to underestimate your opponent, but considering Abanda was ranked much lower, were you surprised by her game level today?
ELINA SVITOLINA: No, I was expecting that she would play well and play strong.  She had some good shots.  I was expecting this.
For me, I was a bit disappointed in my performance today.  It was in and out all the time.  So she was playing great, I think.  For her it's a great experience.  I think she will make a move forward with this.
Q. End of the first set your coach came to see you.  What did she tell you at that moment?
ELINA SVITOLINA: She just told me to stay calm and to stick to my plan, not rush so much.
But unfortunately today I didn't feel so good on court.  I think, yeah, I was a bit disappointed that I couldn't stick to my plan 100%, give my best today.  Yeah, it was kind of disappointed for me.
Q. How is it to work with Justine Henin, who is such a great champion?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, it's amazing experience for me.  Every day I try to get something special.  Of course, there have been many changes in my game, in my preparation.  With her experience, yeah, it's only moving forward for me.  It's great opportunity for my career to improve and, yeah, to try to break into top 10.
Q. What does she bring?
ELINA SVITOLINA: She brings lot of confidence for me.  Especially when we're doing some talk after the match, she always tell me some positive things.  It's great to hear from her.
Yeah, it's good to have her with me, to have some confidence from her and from her side to hear some good words, what I improved as well.  Yeah, from January I think I'm playing much better.
Q. What do you think is your priority in order to get to the top 10?
ELINA SVITOLINA: I think to improve more fitness and to be physically stronger, to play long matches in the same level physically.  Of course, it's going to help as well mentally.  It's just all connected, I think.  For me, yeah, it's the most important thing for now, it's get better and, of course, to be injury-free.  This is the most important thing for now.
