THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Defending champion and two slam semifinals. What gives you the most satisfaction, going far in slams or coming back as a defending champion?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Definitely the Grand Slams semifinals has been something special. But obviously not satisfied with the results. I wish I could play better on the slams. But, you know, it's small positive steps that I made this year, played better the slams.
Q. Talk about the group that you landed in. You have Pliskova, Andreescu and Halep. What are your thoughts on those players and the challenges they bring?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Well, there is no easy draws. It's always very tough to play the Finals because you're straight into playing some tough matches. But I've been doing it three times now, so it's exciting for me.
Every single match is going to be extremely tough. I have to take one match at a time, to don't think so much ahead. Yeah, that's very important, just to be focused on every single match.
There is good thing that you get another match next day, but you have to give everything each match. Each match is going to be extremely tough.
Q. You are the champion in Singapore, but you are going to defend your title in Shenzhen. Do you feel it's weird? What do you think is the biggest difference between the two cities, the courts, the weather, everything?
ELINA SVITOLINA: I mean, there is not much difference between. I think the court looks pretty much the same. It's very similar. Little bit different, I would say, the ball bounce. But the court itself, the stadium looks the same.
It's very different. I wouldn't even compare Singapore event to here. But the organization is perfect for every single player here. Everything is very, very comfortable, feels very good. Very special obviously to be in the last eight elite players. That's amazing.
You cannot really think about the weather because we're playing indoors, so it doesn't really affect anything. But it's quite hot in the stadium.
Q. I think actually you secured a spot for the WTA Finals before Moscow, but you still decided to play there. What was the reason?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Well, definitely wanted to get maybe another title. This year I haven't had a title. In each tournament I play, I want to win. Yeah, I made the decision.
Unfortunately didn't go as I wanted. But it's the last tournament of the year. It's always very tough mentally and physically.
I'm just trying now to think about Shenzhen and the Finals. Very positive going into this week.
Q. As a tennis player, you have to travel around the world. Do you have any secret to deal with the jetlag?
ELINA SVITOLINA: I think the most important thing is to get enough sleep, try to drink as much water as you can. Sometimes try to stay awake, try to fight it. Maybe go to the gym. That's one of the things to fight, to stay awake.
Q. You have Karolina Pliskova first. You've won your last three against her. How confident do you feel facing her Monday?
ELINA SVITOLINA: As I said, try to just focus on my game and on this match itself. There is no easy matches. You have to bring the best on that day.
Yeah, I will try to give everything each match. It's the last tournament of the year. You never know what's going to happen. I try to be focused on what I have to do on the court, yeah, just try to let it go and see what's going to happen.
Q. Sorry if I ask a stupid question. I just found the dress you choose for last night's party is different from the other girls. It made you look beautiful and special. Last year you also chose pants instead of a skirt. Is that a good luck thing for you?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Actually last year it was not on purpose. It's just because it was last moment that I got in last year. I didn't really had outfit. We were in Singapore. I really couldn't find a dress I liked, so I decided to go for the trousers. I mean, wearing trousers can be quite elegant.
Then I asked this year, as well, if I could wear trousers because last year it helped me maybe, some people are saying (smiling). I don't know.
Yeah, I just feel more comfortable in trousers. I know that it's a long day. Yesterday we waited very long for all the draw and everything, so it was a long day. It's more comfortable for me that way.
