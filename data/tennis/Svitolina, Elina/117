E. SVITOLINA/M. Linette
6-4, 7-5
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Congratulations on making it into the forth round.  It was a little bit earlier this morning, you had a match afterwards, but can you just recap quickly how you worked yourself through those two sets?  Because it looked like a straight-set match, but it looked like a lot of work out there.
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, it was very strange match, because she was playing good.  And I was playing okay, but I think today was enough.  For me, on important moments, I played very good and that's what made the difference.
But for the rest, you know, my game was I showed today was enough, and I was very happy that I could finish in two sets.  Because I was Love-30 down, 4-5 down, and I played some great tennis.  So this is what I'm proud of.  And, yeah, I'm looking forward for next match.
Q. In general, how do you feel this week has gone so far?  Because you came in with the title from Rome.  Obviously you've played a lot of great tennis this year.  But do you feel it's been a week sort of where you have kind of maybe even flown a little bit under the radar, got your matches done and moved through into the second week, and how happy are you moving into the second week here again?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, I had some good matches.  I was playing some good tennis.  Of course, I had some down times, but I think I recovered very good.  And physically I feel fine.
Yeah, it was a little bit struggling at the start of the tournament.  But now, you know, I have some matches under my belt.  And, yeah, it feels good to be second week again here.
And, yeah, it's amazing that I play very consistent at Roland Garros.  And I always come back and I feel very good.  And yeah, for me it's very important to have consistency in my game.  And it looks like, yeah, it's working good here.
Q. I don't know if you have noticed this yet, but there's going to be a new first-time Grand Slam champion on the women's side.  There are no more Slam champions left in the draw.  Is this what the other players and particularly you have come to expect from this tournament?  Because I think the players as well as everyone else expect this to be a very open tournament.  What do you make of that, and is this a chance where more people are going to sort of try and seize the moment and grab this opportunity?
ELINA SVITOLINA: I don't think the players was thinking much about there is going to be a new Grand Slam champion.  Everyone is just trying to give their best at the Grand Slam and try to win, have the goal to win the Grand Slam.
But still, you know, there's so many matches even from now in the fourth round.  You need to win so many matches and so many tough matches.  We are going to be on this road.
So it's going to be very interesting what is going to happen, who is going to be the champion.  But, you know, I think sometimes it's good to have a new champion.
Q. You're going to face Petra Martic in the next match who's been away from the game for quite a while due to a back injury.  She's had a great comeback this year coming into fourth round from quallies.  How much do you know about her and what do you expect from that match?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, I know that she played here as well -- and I don't remember, quarterfinal -- a couple of years ago and she was quite injured a lot.
I mean, I don't really want to focus so much on her game.  Of course, I know the way she plays and what she going to bring tomorrow.
But I try to prepare myself for everything and then just bring my game to the court and play how I did for the last year.  From the start of this year, I was playing very confident and, yeah, showing good tennis.
So I'll try to keep the same mindset and give myself a chance to, yeah, to play in quarterfinal.
