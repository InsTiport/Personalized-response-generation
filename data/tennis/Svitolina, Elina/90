E. SVITOLINA/D. Allertova
6-3, 6-0
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What's the big difference from the first set and second set?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Well, my intensity was the same throughout the match.  Was very high.  At the beginning, you know, she was matching my intensity, and then, you know, was just trying to raise my level, trying to go more for my shots.
In the end, you know, I was probably stronger with my game, because she start a little bit missing here and there, and I think this was the key.  Just, you know, I was more patient and, yeah, was more solid.
Q. In Brisbane you talked about how you weren't sure how Grand Slams should feel different in terms of atmosphere, pressure.  You seem to be handling it pretty well so far.  Talk about your comfort with your four wins here.
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, of course.  It's tough to transfer from other tournaments, but I think I did it pretty well, and I'm really happy with the way I started the first slam, and for me, it's only positive.  Of course, it's a good sign that I'm doing the things right and, you know, for all my team, that's a good sign.
So we will continue to work on that, and, you know, go even further and try to, you know, to dig deep.
Q. What has been the key to transferring successfully?  Have you done anything different this time?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Well, we changed a little bit the way we were working during the offseason.  The small things.  It's tough to say one.
We had more time together with my coach, with my second coach, with Andy, you know, just to have the big picture and the structure of my game and clear what I have to do.  Then it's my turn to go on court and do the thing.
Q. You have Mertens next.  She's unseeded but is in great form at the moment.  What do you have to do to beat her?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Well, I'm going to go out there and try to play my tennis and, you know, I already mentioned that I don't really care who is in the other side of the net.
I have my plan, what my, you know, what I have to do on court and just, you know, go out there and fight until the last point and just give my best.  Then, you know, of course I will have few things.  I know her game because I played against her once and I know what to expect from her.
I'm going to have few things from my coaches.  But the main thing for me is to be there, you know, be ready.
Q. Were you surprised to see Mertens in the quarterfinals?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Not really, because she was playing great tennis, and, you know, she can produce really good and high-level tennis.
I don't know.  You know, she been playing well, definitely.  I didn't see so many of her matches here, but if she's in quarterfinals, definitely she deserve to be there.  There is no easy ways to get into quarterfinal.
Q. Two years ago you worked with Justine Henin.  Are you still in contact with her in any way?
ELINA SVITOLINA: I'm not in contact with her, but sometimes, you know, when I win a tournament she always sends a nice message.  It's very nice from her.
Q. What do you think of a Grand Slam quarterfinal occasion, how do you handle that?  That's as far as you have gone before.  What do you think that match will be like?
ELINA SVITOLINA: It's gonna be, you know, quarterfinal, Grand Slam.  It's nothing really change.  I don't want to add any pressure.  You know, she deserves to be there.  Every player who reach certain stage of the tournament deserve to be there.  There is no easy way, no shortcuts in the Grand Slams.
You know, it's going to be tough.  I need to be ready for everything and just go for it, and, you know, then we will see what's the cards have for me.
Q. Could you tell us about your gift?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, the wrist bands.  It's signed wrist bands.  It's very important for me.  Sometimes I give towels, like, on my last practice, before I gave lots of towels from here, so for me it's very important to share, you know, good moments with the fans.  You know, they are paying attention to what I do, coming to my practices, you know.  It's just I give them something from my side, because, you know, they have lots of fun things.
They always watching my matches and cheer me up when I'm not playing well.  It's very important for me to give back and, you know, show them that, you know, they really push me to go further each time.
Q. You have a specific tattoo on your leg?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah.
Q. Tell us what it is.
ELINA SVITOLINA: It's very personal, actually.  I know that you can see parts of it, but, yeah, it's quite personal.  You know, it's like my way.
Q. The margin between top players in WTA is very narrow.  The battle of the top spot is very close now.  Do you visualize and see yourself in top of the rankings soon?  Maybe this year?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Of course I see myself, but I believe that I can be there, but I all the time put in my head that I have to go on court and work my ass off to earn this place, because there is no shortcuts to be out there and to earn that spot.
Everyone is very hungry for it.  Everyone is, you know, doing their best.  So, you know, there is no other way.  There is only go on court and do your thing, what you're doing the best, and just, you know, stay out there and be tough.
