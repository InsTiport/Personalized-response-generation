1-6, 7-6, 3-2 [Ret.]   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What were your thoughts on that match before it ended, obviously, before you thought it might.  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah.  First set she was playing very good.  You know, there's not so many things that I could really change.   
And I was expecting this because I know that, you know, she can play a really high level.  You need to really be focused on every point and wait for your chances, you know, how I did in the second set.  I was just trying to be rock solid and wait for the small chances that she can give you.   
And, yeah, in the second set I was just trying to serve well and be ready for this kind of moments.  And I think, yeah, I did well in the tie-break.  I was there 100%.  And, yeah, just was very happy.   
But, yeah, you know, it's always tough to see when your opponent is injured.  And, yeah, hopefully she can recover well and be ready to play 100% for Australian Open.   
 Q.  When did you first realize that she had a problem?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: I think 1-0 in the third set.  Because I served wide couple of times and, you know, she didn't really go for her shots.  And, yeah, she was trying to hit as hard as she could, trying to finish the points already.  And, yeah, I could see that.   
 Q.  How much confidence do you get out of a match like that, though?  I mean, given before the tournament you were talking a little bit about maybe a handful of matches that got away last year against top opposition.  Here, you stayed patient and were able to turn things around.  Do you feel like it was a good early boost in the season to be tested like that?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, of course.  You know playing against top 10 player early in the year, it's always -- of course, it can be challenging, but it's good.   
You know, I was calm even when I was losing first -- after losing the first set, I was trying to stay calm and to realize what I was doing wrong, and actually came back in the second set.   
And it was good tennis from both of us.  And, yeah, I was trying to stay really positive about the situation.  And I think it worked really good in the second set that I was trying to be out there and take my chances.   
 Q.  You've got another big hitter next for you, either Pliskova or Kanepi.  Can you kind of talk about what you might expect out of those match-ups and would you rather get your shot at another top 10 opponent and kind of go toe-to-toe or what do you prefer?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: I don't know.  I don't have any preference.  You know, they both play kind of similar tennis, big serve and then big strike.   
It's going to be, of course, tough.  I will be trying to stay focused on my game as I did today, just try to play one point at a time and give everything what I have in that game, in that moment and that day.   
Yeah, just, you know, it's going to be a new day and new match.   
 Q.  Just physically, three matches in, how are you -- how is your body pulling up between matches?  Have you been pleased with that or are you having to do more treatment between matches?  How is the body feeling?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Actually, I'm feeling quite good and recovering quite good.  And, yeah, I'm very happy that I recovered well after two matches.  And I was feeling fine today.  Even going into third set, I was pretty fresh.   
And, yeah, ready to fight mentally, and physically I was feeling fine.  Of course, there is always little bit pain here and there, but it's quite normal.  That's why I have my physio here, yeah, to do the treatment and, you know, be ready, ready for everything.   
 Q.  Your Australian Open, you could still move between, like, four and six, which would make some difference where you are in the draw.  Does that matter right to you?  Is that something that you're at all worried about or caring about?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: No, I don't think it matters because here, for example, I'm No. 3, and I had to play No. 5 seed.  So it can be unlucky sometimes.   
But you cannot really, you know, change it, because it's a draw and everyone is tough on the Grand Slam.  It's always challenging from the first round because you never know.   
Like, for example, with Kerber when she won her title, she faced match point in the first round.  So you never know.  You have to be ready from the first point and just give everything 100% each match.  You know, this is a Grand Slam where, you know, every game can change everything.  You never know.   
 Q.  You mentioned the other day that you spent some time training in London.  Where do you play there and practice?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: I'm practicing at Chelsea Harbor Club.  It's perfect conditions for me.  I'm very happy that I could manage to get into that place and it's perfect.  There's 20 courts.  It's outside in the summer, and swimming pool, all the spa treatments, and perfect gym with all the equipment that I need.  And, you know, I'm very happy that it's, like, 10 minutes from my place.   
 Q.  And good hitting partners?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Well, I have Andy Bettles who is always traveling with me and hitting.  So he's good so far.   
 Q.  And when you were back in London, did you stay up at night to watch the cricket in Australia?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yes, couple of times.  But it was not my intention I can tell you this.  It was someone's -- (laughter).   
 Q.  Yes.  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah.   
 Q.  When was the latest that you stayed up until?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Probably 3:00.   
 Q.  Okay.  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah.  Well, I'm happy that I'm here in Australia now so I don't have to stay up.  Yeah.  (Laughter).   
 Q.  Are you going to watch it on television now?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, I watch a little bit just to be, you know, aware what's going on.  I know that it doesn't -- that it's done already.   
But, yeah, actually, when I will be in Melbourne, I will try to go and watch T20.  And, yeah, because I like the sport, and I like to watch T20, and it's quite intense.
