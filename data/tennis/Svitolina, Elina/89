J. OSTAPENKO/E. Svitolina   
7-6, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  I know you are very confident with your tennis, but today Ostapenko hit a lot of incredible winners.  So after she's playing such good tennis, do you still feel fully comfortable during the match?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah.  I mean, this was another day, and she was playing great tennis.  I was tactically playing a little bit not the right way.  That's probably that's why, you know, she won 7-6, 7-6.   
 Q.  So how does your body feel?  I saw you called a medical timeout during the match.  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, I was hurting a little bit today, but it was on and off all the time.  So, yeah, I was a bit disappointed.   
But, you know, it's tough to say.  You know, I was playing great tennis, and she, you know, she played great match.  I mean, she was much, much better today than me if you look at the game.   
 Q.  Just in terms of the stomach, was it more injury concern or you're just not feeling well today?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: No, it was not injury.   
 Q.  And just in terms of the match itself, you're saying tactically maybe you were playing the wrong way.  What stopped you from making the corrections, do you think?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Because of mentally I was a little bit on and off, as well, and didn't really focus on the right moments and the right things, and, you know, the small things, because she's such a great player.  She doesn't miss those opportunities.   
Today she didn't miss.  So that's why, you know, it's 7-6, 7-6.  And of course disappointed that I couldn't bring my best game today and, you know, play a good match.   
 Q.  Was there any one point where you thought you could do something different that would turn it around?  It was such a close match that...  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Of course I was trying to change.  But in the end, you know, few points, few deciding points that I didn't go for my shots or I didn't play the right way, and then she played three, four unbelievable winners, so that's why -- I mean, just all together, you know, it just came all together.   
And, yeah, I was not there and she was playing unbelievable shots.  You know, so many balls on the line from her.  She really made, like, so many winners.  Yeah.   
 Q.  Just with the kind of hard court season finished up a little bit, I know it's right after the match, but can you reflect at all on the first three months of the season?  What is your takeaway from the first three months?  Are you pleased with where your game is?  Moments of disappointment?  What are your thoughts?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, definitely I'm pleased with the performance I have been showing throughout the hard court season.  Yeah, winning couple of titles, the big ones, defending Dubai and then winning in Brisbane.  You know, those kind of titles definitely show I can play in high level and, yeah, playing consistent here, as well.  I was playing good tennis.   
I mean, I'm very, very happy the way I'm changing a little bit my game now and playing more aggressive.  Yeah, just improving in general.  That's tennis, you know.  This is progress, you know.  We have so many weeks on tour.  That's why you cannot escape of losing the matches and from those kind of matches we learn and move forward.   
So, yeah, it's just the progress and, you know, I'm going to have some time off now and then prepare for clay.   
 Q.  Have you talked to your team at all about the clay court preparations and what you want to make sure that you focus on before everything kicks off?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah.  My coach was doing the talking, and he's very pumped for clay court season (smiling).   
Me too, now, since I finish the tournament.  Yeah, we'll see.  I'm going to have some time off now because I was very busy for the last, I don't know how many weeks.  I haven't been home since Doha, so that's why now it's time to go home, recover, and, yeah, go back to training and, yeah, just hard work.
