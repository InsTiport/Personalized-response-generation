E. SVITOLINA/Wang Q.
6-1, 5-7, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. We didn't expect you to lose the second set.  Would you care to explain yourself?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Well, I didn't expect either.  But always try to expect unexpected.
I, of course, was little bit angry at myself that I didn't bring my best game in the end of the second set.  I had to accept and bounce back.
Yeah, was very happy the way I was playing.  In the end, the win is the win.
Q. (Question about opponents stepping up their game against her now.)
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, I have this already for a little while.  I notice it before, as well.  It's normal, you know.  It's a good thing probably to have as you're growing as a player, getting high in the rankings.
Definitely, you know, of course it's tougher.  No one said it's going to be a tough road up there [sic].  Yeah, I'm expecting this.
Q. You're playing Naomi Osaka next.  Talk about her and the challenge of her game, what she does well.
ELINA SVITOLINA: Well, she has great baseline game.  She strikes the ball.  I didn't see much of her lately, but definitely my coach is going to take me through her game.  Yeah, we going to have a plan that I will have to stick to.  Yeah, just try to bring my best game into the next match.
Q. Do you think she's one of the younger players to make top 10, challenge the top?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, definitely.  She has the weapons.  But, yeah, I don't know.  As I said, I didn't see much of her game.  We played maybe one or two years ago.  It was quite a long time.
I'm playing a little bit differently now.  It's tough to say.  Of course, I know that she -- I don't know.  What is her ranking now?
Q. 14.
ELINA SVITOLINA: So for her age, also is quite good ranking.  She's beating good players.  She's here in quarterfinal.  Yeah, going to be definitely a challenge for me.
Q. Does it make a difference for you if you're playing during the day or later?  Tomorrow you're early-ish.
ELINA SVITOLINA: I don't know.
Q. Does it make a difference to you if you're in the sun or not?
ELINA SVITOLINA: No, not really.  I try to accept everything.  I don't have much choice.  It's not me who is scheduling.
I don't mind playing day, night, yeah.  Just happy to get a win, and that's it.  That's what matters.
Q. Is the pace of the ball hugely different?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Sorry?
Q. The pace of the ball, is it very different between day and night?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yes, it is different.  It flies a bit more.  I will have to adjust few things.  But she's in same condition.  Everyone is in same conditions, so who adapts quicker and gets ready quicker.
Q. Are you still in touch with Justine?
ELINA SVITOLINA: No.
