 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Any cause for concern with your right wrist, taking the medical timeout and getting it wrapped up?
 ELINA SVITOLINA:   Yeah, after the treatment, the tape, it was a bit better, and after, it got a little bit better.  But I'll have to see, take my time.  It's good that I'm not playing tomorrow, so it's extra day for recovery, and, yeah, just see how it goes.
 Q. How does it feel to be back in the win column after losing your last couple of matches there in Doha and Dubai?
 ELINA SVITOLINA:   Yeah, I try to not really focus on the losing.  For sure it was disappointing that I couldn't play well in Dubai where I always played good and had some great memories, but sometimes, you know, it's life.  You have to look forward.  You have to move forward and not focus on negatives.
 I did a quick analyze, and I was training straightaway next day after my tournament in Dubai.  I stayed in Dubai for extra 10 days.  Was working with my fitness coach, with my coach, as well, and I arrived here.
 So, yeah, I was tried to regroup really quick, and it's nice to get the win today.  Was not perfect performance from me, but the win is the win.
 Q. I just want to get your thoughts on a three-set battle against a very tough opponent today.
 ELINA SVITOLINA:   Yeah, it's been really tough battle for me.  I started quite well, and unfortunately didn't hold my serve.  Was a bit disappointing.  And then I got a bit distracted with the wrist pain.
 Yeah, it was not perfect performance, but in the end I was trying to fight, trying to really put aside all the distractions that I had.  And it was also a bit windy so there was lots of things that you had to deal with, and I'm happy that I dealt with that and got a win.
 Q. How do you feel for your next match?  Do you think your wrist might play a factor for your next match or not?
 ELINA SVITOLINA:   Well, it's early to say.  Still have some time.  Will try to recover, try to see a physio, try to be ready.  For sure I want to play matches.  I have been missing playing competitive matches.
 For me, it's important to focus on recovery and just gonna be a new day and we see how it goes.
 Q. You said you were battling a lot of things:  the wind, the opponent, your wrist.  How do you stay in the moment and stay calm despite all of those things?  And which of those things bothered you the most?
 ELINA SVITOLINA:   Well, I think I have been playing tennis for quite a few years now, and you get back to your routines.  You get back to what you can control.  Like the wind is a factor that you cannot control, so you just have to really put it aside and try to play with it in a smart way, try to adjust your feet, try to adjust your shots.
 For sure you cannot control few things, like, for example, if opponent is playing really well, you cannot control that so you have to accept and try to play around that.
 Q. How do you go about preparing for the match against a big hitter like Shelby who is in form, as well?  How do you prepare for that before the match?  And during the match, how do you stop her playing her game?
 ELINA SVITOLINA:   Well, I have been practicing with big hitters, as well.  For me it's important always to adjust my feet really quick.  I try to really put my attention on that, because the ball comes really deep and quick on my side, so I have to be ready, balanced with my shots.
 So that's, yeah, just the reactions.  I think that's what's important in my game.
 Q. You mentioned that you have been playing tennis for a long time.  I'm just wondering, obviously you're still young, but have you ever felt your age at all?  In recent years there is always young players coming up.
 ELINA SVITOLINA:   Yeah, for sure it's a very interesting question that you ask.  For sure I'm 26 now, 27 this year.  There have been players 16, 17, 19 years old who are already achieving great results and winning slams.
 For sure I notice that, but for me I have my own path.  I try to not get these negative thoughts into my head, because for sure you are not getting younger.  You only get older and your body sometimes is not recovering as quickly.  You have to adjust, but I think everything is about adjusting.  Everything is about the mindset and how you see things.
 So it's just important to take it as it is and try to think with a positive mindset.
