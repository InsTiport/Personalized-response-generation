 ELINA SVITOLINA:   In general I would say it was a good tournament.  I had lots of good matches.  I went through tough moments where I was down and then came back to win in a few of the tough matches.
 Definitely after losing early in Dubai it was important for me to bounce back, and to do that in such a big tournament against good players was very important for me, and definitely I take it as a positive.
 To be fair, it was a good match, all credit to Ash.  She played some great pressure moments.  I wish I could do a little bit better on my serve today, but she was holding the grounds very good and almost didn't let me to come back really into the match.
 Yeah, it was a really good performance from her.  Maybe also in some ways she didn't let me play my best tennis.
 Definitely I'm excited about the clay court season.  I'm going to have a few days off now.  I'm going to recover and try to sort out the injuries that I picked up during the week here.
 For sure excited about the Fed Cup that I'm gonna play in few weeks' time.  Then gonna play Stuttgart, Madrid and Rome, and of course Roland Garros.
 That's going to be lots of good matches on clay, and I'm really looking forward to good preparation and play well.
