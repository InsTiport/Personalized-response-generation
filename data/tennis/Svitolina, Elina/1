THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. Tell us a bit about your preparation, how you feel.
ELINA SVITOLINA:   Yeah, it's been good preparation.  To be fair, cannot complain about anything.  It was really nice time outside.  Was practicing with Iga Swiatek.  We had a great time.  Really enjoyed our company.  Was quite fun.
Was pleased with my preparation.  Now is a little bit different with all the people that are out.  You feel a little bit strange at first, but in the end I'm really happy that everything went quite smooth.
Yeah, happy to be playing and competing.
Q. Being in the top 10 for more than three or four years, what do you think you need to win a Grand Slam?
ELINA SVITOLINA:   It's really tough question.  I get that question quite a lot.
For me, I think the most important is to be consistent, to get another chance to play the quarterfinals, semifinals.  It's all the time these kind of matches that you have to go through to win the title, those tough moments.  Every match really matters, and there is tough opponents who are there to give you hard time.
It's very tough to pick one thing that I have to improve.  I've been in semifinals.  I wish I could play better that time, but it didn't happen.  Hopefully I get a chance another time and will try to play better.
