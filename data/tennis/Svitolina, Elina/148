  4‑6, 7‑5, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   There was a clear turning point in that game.   You seemed to start slowly and then roll over the top of Angelique.   Can you explain how it unfolded?
ELINA SVITOLINA:   Yeah, it was something change.   Just I was trying to fight, and that's the only thing what I was trying to do.   And to find my rhythm back because I lost a little bit after losing the first set after the tough game on 4‑3 in the first set. 
So I was just trying to fight, and I was hoping for a chance.   There was chances, so I took it.   Really happy that I could manage to win. 

Q.   So down a set and a break...
ELINA SVITOLINA:   Yeah.

Q.   How were the nerves then?   You said you had to fight it out.   Were you seeing things happening in the game that you thought you could capitalize on? 
ELINA SVITOLINA:   Yeah.   I was not really thinking about the score.   I was just trying to play every single point as the last one.   That was the only thing I was thinking about, to find my rhythm to play, just rally with her.
And after, you know, to find my forehand back.   So was really happy that I could find the way and of course to win. 

Q.   Are you aware of what's going on out there with Maria's dismantling of her opponent?   She dropped one game in her first match.   She's improved her form.   How do you feel about coming up against her?
ELINA SVITOLINA:   Yeah, I'm looking forward FOR this match.   It's always great to compete against these players.   You can see what you need to improve.   It's just great to play against them. 
So I hope I can show my best.   Of course I will just try and fight as I did today, and hopefully I can win tomorrow. 

Q.   One more.   You haven't played her before, have you?
ELINA SVITOLINA:   I played her one time last year.

Q.   How did that unfold?
MILOS RAONIC:   I lost to her first round in Beijing, yeah. 

Q.   Having seen you play for a few years ‑ and if you don't feel comfortable answering this question, that's fine‑ seemed to me when you would lose a point you would go into a funk and it would carry on.   It seems less now.   Is that something you're conscious of?   Is just you're getting older? 
ELINA SVITOLINA:   Yeah, I'm thinking getting older, of course.   It comes with experience.   I think when I was playing juniors I was doing too much of it and showing my emotions, so now try to keep it more in myself.   So just trying to fight and not think about the last point; just think what I can do.
Of course, yeah, just fighting.   That's the most important. 

Q.   Bad for my pictures, but good for you. 
ELINA SVITOLINA:   Yeah.

Q.   You switched coaches last year. 
ELINA SVITOLINA:   Yeah, I switched.   I think in that stage I needed somebody who had more experience.   So I knew Ian before, and was just looking forward to working with him.   He can give me some experience because he been there with Andy Murray before.
I think that's what I need for a moment, that small details which is change a lot in the professional tour. 
So I think I'm on the right way.

Q.   He worked with British before?
ELINA SVITOLINA:   He was working with the Federation I think and working with Andy Murray as a, I don't know, just on the team working with him before.   So for me it's great that I can take something from it. 

Q.   Final question:   I've been asking a lot of players, if you were at the tournament and they said, Okay, when you come on the court we're going to blare music, is there a song you would want to hear? 
ELINA SVITOLINA:   I think it would be AC/DC

Q.   Which one? 
ELINA SVITOLINA:   Hells Bells.   Yes, this is my favorite.
