E. SVITOLINA/G. Muguruza
7-6, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Another satisfying win for you.
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, yeah.  It was tough match, but it was good win in the end.  By the end of the day it's a win and it's just history, really.
Q. Pretty tough match to get through really, wasn't it?  Tough competitor?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah.  It was tough conditions.  Both of us was struggling, so that's why it was really a roller-coaster.  It was tough to stay focused because you never know it's gonna be winner or error.
Need to be positive all the time and keep going.
Q. Why did you win?
ELINA SVITOLINA: I think I won because I put more balls on the court today (smiling).
Q. You've probably been asked this before, but when did Justine join you?
ELINA SVITOLINA: I was working with her couple of days in Abu Dhabi during the offseason, but we just started this week.  And, yeah, it's just started.
Q. What has she added to your game so far?  I mean, nice win tonight.
ELINA SVITOLINA: I think positive attitude.  For the moment, nothing really changed yet, but there have been some things.  I think you will see maybe later in my game, but I don't really want to speak about it yet because there is still so many hard work ahead of us.
Q. Seems like a strange tournament.  Seven of the eight seeds are out.  We don't know about Petra.  You have been responsible for a couple.
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, it's always been tough tournament in Dubai because the balls are flying.  But still, you know, there is good tennis there and I don't really look at the other part of the draw.  But just happening like this.  Probably some players are playing better those days.
