E. SVITOLINA/T. Pironkova   
3-6, 6-3, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  You haven't played Pironkova before.  Did it take you a while to get the measure of her game?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, I didn't play her before, but I saw -- I know her for many years.  I watched couple of matches of hers.  I knew what to expect from her.  But I think today she was playing really very good.   
And, yeah, I was just waiting for my chance to be back, because I didn't play that bad in the first set, but I think she was playing, like, really amazing from start (smiling).   
 Q.  The first five games in the second set when neither of you could hold serve, could you explain how that felt?  It seemed quite intriguing to watch.  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, I mean, in women's tennis, it happens a lot.  So, I mean, and she returns very good.  So it was quite normal for us, I think.  We was returning good, putting more pressure on opponent's serve.   
This was not really what I was expecting.  But in the end, you know, I was very, very happy that I could find the way to win in the second set, and then really find my game back.  Because I think I didn't finish so good the first set, and I was a bit struggling with my movement.   
But in the end, you know, I was very happy that I could go through this and just find my game and win quite confident.   
 Q.  You're playing Magda Linette in the next round.  You haven't had a previous meeting with her.  How will it be to play someone you haven't played?  Have you watched her playing?  Do you know her style of play?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, of course.  We all know each other pretty good, you know, all the players who are 150, yeah, we see each other almost each week on each tournament.  Sometimes someone does better than other one.   
So I know what to expect.  I'm going to prepare.  I have day off tomorrow, so I'm going to just work on some things what I have to do, and just play my game.  I don't think there is something special that I need to do, you know, like maybe 100 dropshots (smiling).   
But, yeah, I will just take it easy and be ready for next match, next opponent, and there's going to be a tough one, of course, but I'm going to be there, gonna be ready for it.   
 Q.  How much satisfied were you about your today's performance?  Was it your top-level performance or not yet?  Preparing your top form for the final?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: (Laughing.)  Well, you know, I did today what I had to do.  Second and third set was not easy, but I think I was ready with my game at the important moments when I needed, and it worked really good.   
But I think today what worked really good is that I was waiting for the right ball, because Tsvetana is playing very good when she is under, when someone hits very big.  So I think I changed at the right time, but as I said, the first set she was playing really, like, amazing shots and hitting the lines and net cords a lot.   
So I was a little bit disappointing of this.  But, you know, it happens.  It's life.  Sometimes the opponent can get lucky, but I was trying to accept this.  You know, tried still to go for my shots.  I think I did today what I -- yeah, in the right moment was I brought my game and it was good.   
 Q.  I'm just wondering, how is it to play a Grand Slam as a WTA No. 1 in the race?  Is that in any way confidence boosting?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, I think today it worked really good.  And I think today was actually my confidence what brought me to win this match, because probably if I would be struggling a little bit of confidence it would be really tough, because, you know, she was striking the ball really good, and I just tried to stay calm and, you know, tried to build my way into the match and find my game.  I think I did really good, so I think it's really was the matter of confidence today.
