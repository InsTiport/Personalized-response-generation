6-2, 3-6, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Really couldn't have been any closer, could it?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Could be...  But, yeah, it happens, so...
Q. What are your thoughts on the match?  I know it's difficult straight after.
ELINA SVITOLINA: I wish I could play better.  I did some unforced errors in the moments where I not supposed to do errors.  But I know she took her chance.  That was the end.
Q. How difficult was it to serve out for the match?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Well, it was difficult, as you can see.  I didn't do so many first serves.  That's why I think I lost that game.
Q. What do you think she did well today against you?
ELINA SVITOLINA: I think generally she played a good match.  I mean, good match, and it was really close one.  Nothing much to say.
Q. In terms of being able to turn it around after that first set, what do you think you did tactically that shifted things back on your level?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Well, I put three balls more over the net.  This was the most important because in the first set I was a bit struggling to put more than two balls in the court.  That's why I think it made a difference.
