E. SVITOLINA/A. Barty   
7-6, 5-7, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Three hours and 12 minutes.  That's the longest WTA match of the year.  Did it feel that long when you were out there?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, actually, it felt pretty long, because we had long rallies and long games.  It was, you know -- yeah, it actually felt longer than three hours, 12 minutes (smiling).   
 Q.  How important was the fitness today?  Is that something that you have been working on?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Well, I always trust my fitness.  I know that, you know, I can play good matches, and I'm physically strong.  It's one of my strengths, I would say.  So I have just to trust it.   
You know, I was working before coming here on my fitness.  So, you know, I just had to go out there and try to, you know, to stay tough and fight until the very last point, and it really helped me today.   
 Q.  I think there were a couple of match points in the second set.  So to have those match points, to not convert, and then to have to sort of regroup, because it had already been pretty physical in those first two sets, what did you do mentally to try to make sure you were ready for that third set?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, it was tough.  It's always tough when you have couple of match points and you lose there.  Because in one I had really big chance, you know, to finish the match, and then she played unbelievable points.  So I was a little bit unlucky and then she played great.  So I tried to, you know, take one point at a time.   
Had a little, yeah, energy drop.  I think, you know, I just told myself that I have to stay strong, I have to fight until the end, you know.  We are both in the same conditions and she had to really, you know, push myself.   
 Q.  You seem to have a really cool knack for brushing off tough moments in matches where between points you seem maybe upset, and then you quickly brush it off and be focused, and that repeats the whole match through.  How hard do you work on the mental aspect of your game to be able to do that?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, as you said, I try to always reset for each point.  It's not always happens, but I always, you know, try to stay calm.  And I work a lot on my mental strength, because, you know, tennis matches, they are very long.  One, two points can change the game.   
So that's why, you know, it's also experience.  You know, you have to know what works for you, the routines before, you know, the point, after the point, and it changes.  It's not like, you know, two years ago something was working for me and I'm doing it still now, you know.   
There is always, you have to adjust.  You have to learn.  You know, just move forward to find something new that helps you to keep the focus.   
 Q.  Besides having Andrew help you, he was a big help in that match today on two occasions, I spoke with Olga Savchuk and she said you put a lot of effort into reading books about mental toughness.  Is that true and, if so, what kind of things are you reading?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, I really enjoy discovering something new about the humans.  It's a big part, psychology is a big part of sport, any sport.  In tennis, I would say in particular, because the matches are very long and it's up and down.  You lose, you win points, and you have to stay very strong and be tough.   
I have been working with Andy and also myself, because, you know, when you go on court, you are alone, and you have to make decisions.  You have to make statements in your mind.  That's very important.   
The year also is very long.  You have lots of matches.  Maybe you lose twice or three or four times in the first round, so you have to regroup.  You know, don't get upset about it, because daily everyone is putting lots and lots of work.   
It's all about, you know, just trusting, trusting it and trusting your team and, you know, find the right people to surround yourself.   
 Q.  I think you have Vondrousova next.  She had a good win against Simona.  You have played her a couple of times.  She's very creative in the way that she plays her tennis.  What does she offer that's different that you're going to have to counter out there on court?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, I think we played twice.  Obviously, you know, her spin is a little bit different because she's left-handed.  I have to adjust to this.   
For me, it's just important to bring my game.  I try to recover first.  I don't think so much about it tonight.  Just enjoy this day to day, because it was very, very tough.  And very happy the way I could finish it with a win in the end.   
For me, it's just another match, another match to bring my good game tomorrow.  So we'll see.  It's never easy, but I will try to work my way into the match.   
 Q.  This is your seventh trip to Indian Wells and your first quarterfinals.  How good does it feel to break through, especially after a tough match like that?  
ELINA SVITOLINA: Definitely.  I always like to come here and always like to play.  I had some tough matches here, and, you know, finally I'm in quarterfinal.   
It's not the end of the tournament.  You know, for me, every tournament I try to win, and this is the main goal before any tournament.   
Of course, it's amazing that it's the first time happen here, but I have my match tomorrow and I have to, you know, to stay focused and, you know, just bring my best game.
