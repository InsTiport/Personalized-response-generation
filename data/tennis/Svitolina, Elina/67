E. SVITOLINA/E. Mertens
7-5, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. It started out pretty good for you in the first game, then it was 0-4 kind of quick.  What do you think went wrong at the beginning of the first set?
ELINA SVITOLINA: I think she started pretty well.  She was striking the ball and everything was going in for her.  I just had to accept and move from there.
I was just trying to stay longer in that set.  I think it really helped me to get back my rhythm, and then I was just going more and more for my shots.  I think this was the key.
Q. You played her in Australia and may not have been 100% fit at the time, but did you get anything from that match that helped you tonight?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, definitely.  She was playing really amazing tennis, so I was expecting similar thing tonight.  I knew the way she was hitting the ball.  That's why, you know, I was just trying to be ready for it.  Definitely it helped.
Q. Simona was saying it's very tough for her to play a night match, then a day match.  From your experience, is it really something that can affect the outcome of the following match, cause a lot of trouble to you players?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Definitely it's very, very different conditions when you're playing day and night.  The ball is different going through the air.  When you look up, sometimes you just lose the control of the ball, and the ball is not coming down as quickly.  That's why you have to adjust for it.
It can be tough, you know.  It's definitely very different.
Q. You let out a bit of a yell in the second set.  We don't see too much negative emotion from you.  Were you more frustrated than normal?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Well, there was few things that I really wanted to make right, and I had to be really strict with myself.  I was just trying to be precise with what I had to do.  That's why I was very, yeah, strict with myself.
Q. Your thoughts on coming back tomorrow to play Sloane?  It's been a while.
ELINA SVITOLINA: I don't actually remember when we played.
Q. You played in Charleston and beat her, also Australia the same year.
ELINA SVITOLINA: It was long time ago.
Yeah, it's going to be exciting.  She came back.  You know, she's playing great since.  Yeah, it's going to be another tough semifinal match.  I'm just very happy the way I was playing today.  I'm happy to be again in semifinal Rogers Cup.  It's something that I'm very positive.
Yeah, no, it's good to be in semifinal again.
Q. It's not always easy to defend titles, but you defended Dubai and Rome.  What is the key to performing well at the same events?
ELINA SVITOLINA: First of all, we're still couple of matches away.  I take only one match at a time.
Second, the last year I played in Toronto.  Here in Montreal is different conditions, different court.  It's very, very different.  It's completely different situation that I'm in.
I only take my semifinal.  I have to recover.  I have to eat well, sleep well, and be ready for tomorrow's tough, tough match.
