THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Obviously you had a change in coaches recently, deep run in the US Open, but disappointing result in Wuhan.  Was there any adjustment that occurred with the new coach?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Well, I wouldn't say it was really disappointing because obviously my opponent, she's having a good couple of months recent.  It was a three-set match.  So it was nothing disappointing.  There's lots of positive things in that match.
I was trying to fight back and, yeah, I'm trying to take one match at a time, do don't rush things, don't have high expectations.  After two weeks, you can't massively change your game.
Q. A lot of the players talk this time of year saying they're quite tired, nine or 10 months on tour.  How are you feeling physically and mentally?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Of course, it's tiring.  In the same way, I always try to find the motivation.  There is big motivation for me to play Singapore, to finish the year very strong.  Everyone has their own goals.  For me, Singapore definitely stands out there.
But, yeah, it's very tiring, the end of the season always.  Especially when you're very, very close to the holiday.
