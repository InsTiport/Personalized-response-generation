6-1, 6-1
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Obviously Serena is playing so well.  At the end of the match when you shook hands with her you were pretty much smiling and laughing.  What was that about?
ELINA SVITOLINA: I mean, the match finished and I had nothing already in my head.  Of course it's really disappointed that I couldn't show my 100% today; was not playing great.
But in the end of the match, you know, the match is finished, so I need to be realistic and just look forward to what's happened next, you know.
Match is just a tennis match.  It was not my day today.  She was playing great.  I think she was serving good in the right moment and moving the ball around the court really, which for me was a little bit unexpected.
Yeah, it was just a match, and I need to analyze and move on.
Q. Very difficult to play against her.  What was your strategy going into the match?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Was trying to serve well and to move ball around the court.  Obviously today was -- okay, I made a lot of mistakes from the second ball, which is bad.  You cannot play against her making these errors.
Yeah, it was sometimes really like small mistakes.  But still, one, two, three, four, in the game was of course against you.  You cannot play this way.  That's why was really disappointed that from the start of the match I was with my game not there.
