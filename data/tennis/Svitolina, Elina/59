E. SVITOLINA/P. Kvitova
6-3, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What were you most happy with today during the match?
ELINA SVITOLINA: I mean, I think everything, a little bit of everything.  I was playing good today, you know, quite solid from the baseline and putting pressure on Petra today.
This was the key for me.  Yeah, this was the most important thing and I think the key.
Q. How emotional was this win tonight?  You weren't even sure if you were going to be here necessarily, and now here you are with a really big win over a player you haven't had the most success against in the past.  How important is this today?
ELINA SVITOLINA: Definitely was very important for me.  You know, winning this match, definitely gives me lots of confidence.  I mean, this win definitely now I want to take, you know, as one to go forward, and for all those probably people and haters that were saying, you know, that I don't deserve to be here and I'm, you know, not good (smiling).
So, yeah, I think this, you know, until the next match I can really enjoy this win.
Q. Last year obviously you had a consistent year but struggled when you got here.  This year you just seem so fired up.  I mean, was there an element of that, as well, that you really wanted to bury 2017, the experience here?
ELINA SVITOLINA: I think last year I was really like too nervous, and it was the first time here.  Even today I was -- I mean, it's normal to have nerves and in this kind of tournament.  But you have to, you know, just take one point at a time and play here your best.  That's what I did today, and I think, of course, I had the nerves and I think Petra, as well, and everyone here, you know.  It's the part of tennis.  But I'm happy the way I did it today.
Q. How did you find the court?  How fast did you feel it was?  How slow did you feel it was?
ELINA SVITOLINA: (Pause.)
THE MODERATOR: We just need a few minutes.  Sorry.  Just take a break.  We just need a couple minutes.
We might just come back in a few minutes, if that's okay.
(Recess in the press conference.)
THE MODERATOR: She's not feeling great, but she will take two or three more questions.
Q. I had a question about your serve.  You served amazingly well today.  I just wanted to have your feelings about that.
ELINA SVITOLINA: Yeah, I was serving good today.  I'm very pleased the way I was handling, because every game was very tough on my serve.
You know, the way I handled it, it was, yeah, I was really, really solid, and I think this was really the key, because she's playing, you know, she's striking the ball really good.  Before, in the matches, previous matches that we had, you know, I had to play really good.
Q. Do you just want to share what's going wrong with you right now?
ELINA SVITOLINA: No, I'm just not feeling good.
Q. It feels like the group is just going to get harder and harder from this round.  Your thoughts about who you might be facing?  Obviously you won't know until after this match.
ELINA SVITOLINA: It's not going to get harder and harder.  It's already very, very hard, each match.  I already had the match today which was, you know, extremely hard for me, because I lost seven times against her.  So, I mean, you couldn't ask for a harder start, I think (smiling).
So it's going to be good match next match.  I will just try to recover and be ready for next one and, you know, I have to, yeah, be ready for anything and just fight, because it's round robin, so you don't know, you know, until the very end.
