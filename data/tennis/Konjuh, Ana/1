A. KONJUH/S. Zhang
6-0, 6-1
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. That felt good, didn't it?
ANA KONJUH: Yeah.  My first, you know, main-draw win here.  Last two years I played quallies, so I'm really happy to be in the main draw this year and to keep my game like that.  Hopefully I'm going to continue.
Q. Why do you think you won so easily today?
ANA KONJUH: I think -- you know, I know her.  She's a great player, so I think she wasn't that much high level that she can be on.
You know, I just continue, didn't make any mistakes.  I just kept her pressure, and I think, you know, she felt like she cannot continue with my level.
Q. The courts are playing a little bit fast.  How long does it take for you to kind of adjust to changing conditions like that?
ANA KONJUH: Well, I came here on Wednesday, so I think I had pretty good preparation.  Came right after the Fed Cup.
It was real slow in Estonia, so it's pretty big difference.  But, you know, I think I adjust really good.  I think the weather should be a bit more warmer next few days, so I think it's gonna fly a little bit more, but I'm expecting that.
Q. How difficult is it to adjust from being a fantastic junior to hitting on the main tour and mixing it with the best every week?
ANA KONJUH: Yeah, that's an often question that I get.  But, I mean, it's pretty tough.  Especially I think in the men's game.  I think it's a bit easier with us.
I stopped juniors when I was 15, so I think this is my fourth year on tour.  So I think I'm kind of adjusting pretty good.
But it was really hard.  You know, the game, the level of the game, it's really difficult to, you know, be and continue throughout the year.  It's a really long season.  And in juniors, you can play the tournaments good or bad, it doesn't matter, you'll still be No. 1.  Here you have to keep your level, and that's, I think, pretty tough.
Q. Thoughts on your next match?  You play Sam Stosur.
ANA KONJUH: Yeah.  Never played her.  I think, you know, she's experienced player and she's long on the tour.  I think I'm gonna have to keep my level with her.
She has a great forehand, great kick serve.  So it's gonna be really uncomfortable, especially it's flying high here.  But I'm kind of expecting that and just hoping that I'm gonna stay healthy and play a good match for the experience.
Q. Are there players on tour that you still are looking forward to playing for the first time?
ANA KONJUH: Yes.  I haven't played Serena.   (Smiling.)  And I grew up, you know, watching her, and I think it will be a dream come true to share the court.  I think, you know, she's a legend.  Hopefully that day is gonna come soon.
