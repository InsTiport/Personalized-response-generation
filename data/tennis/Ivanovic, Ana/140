  2-1 (ret.) 
   
  Q. Can you describe what happened?   
 ANA IVANOVIC: Just obviously disappointed the way it finished, you know, because I felt like I had really good run and it was a good start of the match I think for both of us.   
 And just on that one forehand when I went to step around it, I just felt like pain all of a sudden, so much pain in my foot and I couldn't step on it anymore.  
 And, you know, I tried bit of tape, but I could not put any weight on it, and there was no point in me continuing. Just I had straightaway doctor appointment make sure it's nothing serious and to do it as soon as possible so I give myself time to recover.  
  
  Q. So this something that happened during the match.   
 ANA IVANOVIC: Yeah, yeah. It was a little bit tight, you know, because I had lots of blisters. It was getting tight like inside of my foot. But, you know, it was no pain or anything, and just all of a sudden on that one shot I felt like something, you know, crack a little bit. I was very, yeah, scared and painful.   
  
  Q. Just an overall comment on the week and the event and the tournament.  
 ANA IVANOVIC: Yeah, it's been great week for me. Still I played some really great tennis, and I was very excited about this match. I think we both started really well, and it was gonna be I think a good match.  
 But, no, it was great, you know, all the support I had here, and the facilities are really good. I did enjoy my week, and I look forward for next year.
