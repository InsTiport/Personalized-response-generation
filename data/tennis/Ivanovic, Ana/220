THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  What do you think of your performance in that match?

ANA IVANOVIC:  Well, it was actually pretty hard to play.  The first match is always very, very hard.  Usually you start a little bit nervous.  And she's a great player.  She didn't give me much rhythm.  Like through all the match, I was trying to find my rhythm, but didn't work really well.  But on the end, I'm really pleased I took the opportunities and won the match. 

Q.  Tell us about your connection with Melbourne. 

ANA IVANOVIC:  Well, I have relatives here.  So I was actually here in December practicing, here in Melbourne Park.  And they really nice.  They help me out a lot.  I have lot of sparring partners.  Yeah, they help me out a lot.  I was really happy with the opportunity to come and practice here rather than stay in Europe.

ANA IVANOVIC:  Uncle and auntie, yeah.

Q.  Where?

ANA IVANOVIC:  They live in Mentone. 

Q.  Who did you hit with?

ANA IVANOVIC:  I was practicing with Nicole and Casey and also some other girls.  And I have (indiscernible), as well. 

Q.  They were here for the camp.  Did you join in?

ANA IVANOVIC:  It was very nice.  The organization is very good.  They certainly help me out a lot.  I always had the court, the sparrings, the balls, everything.  And the people around, they were just very nice.  I really enjoy my time here.
