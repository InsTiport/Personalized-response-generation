(Transcribed from WTA recording.)   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What would you like to say?  
ANA IVANOVIC: Obviously it was a tough match.  I played so well.  First set, I won it.  I felt like I produced some good games, created some opportunities.  But she came back strong with a very powerful game.   
I thought the third set she served better than me.  She could get more on the first shot because of the serve.  I felt that was the big difference in the third set.   
 Q.  Obviously the atmosphere and the crowd throughout the whole match was definitely supporting you a lot.  Did you feel that?  
ANA IVANOVIC: Yeah, definitely.  As soon as we walked on the court, that was amazing feeling.  Yeah, I really wanted to win and have a chance to come back.  The crowd was just really amazing don't.   
 Q.  Despite not winning the match, have you been encouraged by the form you've shown here?  
ANA IVANOVIC: Definitely it was a good match from the beginning on.  It was a high level.  Like I said, she came out with some firing strokes towards the end of that match.  She stepped it up.  It went her way.   
Obviously a little bit disappointed but a lot to look forward to.
