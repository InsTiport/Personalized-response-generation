A. IVANOVIC/C. Suarez Navarro
  6‑1, 4‑1 (Ret.)

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Could you tell us how close you are to the game you played when you were No. 1 in the world?   How has the year been so far form‑wise for you?
ANA IVANOVIC:   I think it's very hard to compare, actually, because I feel like I'm completely different player because   I work on maybe a little bit different things. 
Yeah, I think with experience and everything, you cannot really compare.   You know, I played well at that time, and I think I'm playing well at the moment, too.
It's still a long way to go to the top where I want to be, but I'm really enjoying the process.

Q.   Navratilova said yesterday that Azarenka and Kvitova are playing a different kind of game and they have taken the game to another level.   Do you think it's very different from the time you were No. 1?   How difficult is it going to be for you to get back?
ANA IVANOVIC:   I think it's different in the sense that now a lot more girls can challenge top players from the early rounds.   That's exciting for us, because we do want challenges.     In that sense, yes.   But I feel like those girls that are on top at the moment, they're playing very aggressively, and that's the way you have to play in order to win. 
They're definitely playing well with the big serve.   And Kvitova being a lefty, I think it's a good advantage for her.
It's a big challenge for us to raise our level.

Q.   Do you think you can challenge them and be No. 1 again?
ANA IVANOVIC:   Well, that's why I'm here.   If I didn't think so, I probably wouldn't be sitting here. 
But, yeah, I definitely believe so.
