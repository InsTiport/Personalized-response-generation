A. IVANOVIC/F. Pennetta
  7‑6, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please. 

Q.   Obviously you got down big early, 5‑1, how were you able to make such a big turnaround so quickly in that match?
ANA IVANOVIC:   Actually, I didn't think so much about the score.   I really struggled to find my rhythm in the beginning.   I felt the ball was flying. 
And then I sort of just tried to think of getting back into the match.   I thought the first set was already gone, but then I started to play better and started to be aggressive, and then I just basically played point by point. 
I didn't really think I could come back in the first set, but I really played well and stepped up when it was very tight.   So that gave me confidence. 
I could see her body language change in the second set, and I started to play a lot better then.

Q.   Pennetta is a player who has upset a lot of big names.   Obviously you knew that was a big challenge going in.   Mentally when you got down like that, did that go through your mind? 
ANA IVANOVIC:   Yeah, definitely when I saw the draw, I'm sure we both thought it was tough first round for both of us.   She's been playing really well lately and is such nice girl.   When I went on the court, I knew it was going to be very, very tough.
Just tried to play my game, tried to be aggressive, and I really found my rhythm in the second set and I played much better match. 

Q.   This year seems you turn thinner and thinner.   Are you reducing your weight on purpose?
ANA IVANOVIC:   I don't think so.   I been working really hard in the gym.   I tried to get stronger and more powerful, and I think I'm moving a lot better on the court than I did at the beginning of the year.
I still have a lot of work to do in the off‑season, but I don't feel like I've been getting weaker.   I feel I've been getting stronger.
