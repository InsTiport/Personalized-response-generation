P. HERCOG/A. Ivanovic
  6‑4, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please. 

Q.   When you look back at the whole season, do you feel disappointed with the performance in the whole year?   You said you wanted to go back it top 10, you want to be the top players.   You seem to have failed the mission a couple times.   What do you think about this?
ANA IVANOVIC:   No, I don't see it that way.   I really feel like I made a lot of progress and my game is at a high level.   Tough match today, but overall I'm not thinking down. 
Still, I have a few years to achieve the goals that I have. 

Q.   Is there something you would like to work on during the off‑season to get some improvement technically?   The forehand, the backhand, or even the serve?
ANA IVANOVIC:   Yeah, I'm going to work a lot in the gym, and also on the serve and forehand and just overall on the whole game. 
I think I have to raise the base of the game and then work on specific shots that I want to improve that I'm going to discuss with my coach.

Q.   I understand the fans in China send you a very special gift.   It was a portrait of yourself on a T‑shirt. 
ANA IVANOVIC:   Yes.

Q.   Do you love the present they give you?
ANA IVANOVIC:   Yes, it's very nice.   I saw some of them wearing it, so I'm going to actually, now when I go back, and I'm going to take photo and thank them, because it was very nice of them.
