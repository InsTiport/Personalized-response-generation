E. SVITOLINA/A. Ivanovic   
6-4, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  You had quite a strong record against her.  What do you think was different this time?  
ANA IVANOVIC: Yeah.  I knew that going into the match today.  I thought I did have a lot of chances in actually both sets, but in first set especially.   
My forehand wasn't really working today.  I was making a lot of errors.  I managed to get back into match and then few disappointing errors always came in the wrong time.  I felt like that was sort of throughout the match.   
It was really disappointing, because, you know, I have played so well.  You know, just -- yeah, my forehand let me down today.  I think it was more positioning.   
 Q.  Last year things kind of came together for you here.  How do you feel now compared to that time?  
ANA IVANOVIC: Honestly, every tournament every week every year is a new sensation and new emotion.   
It's really a little disappointing to finish in this manner, but I always enjoy coming back here and competing here and clay is my favorite surface.   
 Q.  A bit left field, but what makes Andrew Bettles a good hitting partner?  What's good about him?  
ANA IVANOVIC: Well, he's very consistent.  I know him for a long time.  We used to hit before, and it's nice to have someone you know and you can sort of swing through and not worry so much about, you know, the other side.  He does bring a lot of balls back.
