 A. IVANOVIC/S. Cirstea
  6‑1, 7‑5 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Tell me about tonight's match.   The first went quickly; second not so quickly.   
ANA IVANOVIC:   Yeah, I was happy.   I was a little bit doubtful going on the court considering last few weeks.   I had a little bit struggle with my back, but I was able to move free, especially in the first set, and I played well.  
Also, it was tough playing good friend of mine.   It's never easy.   You have to put it aside and try to do the best you can on court.  
   
 Q.   How is that out there?   I know that's difficult.   You guys are really close.   
ANA IVANOVIC:   Yeah, she's my best friend on tour.   It's always tough.   We had few matches in the past.   You know, we had close one in the Fed Cup earlier this year.   
So I really try not to think who is on the other side of the net.   Rather try to think about what I have to do on court.  
   
 Q.   Your back, it's been a bit of a problem, but you felt healthy enough to play today.   I know you're worried about it.   You want to be full speed for the US Open.  
ANA IVANOVIC:   Definitely.   I'm doing a lot of recovery work.   It's something that, you know, it's not going to go out by itself.   I have the strength, but first I have to get inflammation out.   It's a little bit Catch‑22.   
At the moment, thank God for the physios here.   I really tried to be as best possible shape for each match, and then obviously have a week to prepare for US Open.   
Hopefully it will be enough time to settle it down.
