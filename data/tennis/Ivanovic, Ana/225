THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  I was watching.  At the end, obviously you played well, but a couple of let cords helped a little bit. 

ANA IVANOVIC:  Yeah, yeah, I think third set I played quite well.  I think it was a good match.  She played also very well.  On the end I really pushed to the maximum, I gave my best, and I was really little bit lucky. 

Q.  It was 4-5, she served for the match.  Two in one game, dead lets.  Then to start the next game... 

ANA IVANOVIC:  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  I think that doesn't happen too often.  It was like first time.  But I was really lucky, so I appreciate that.

Q.  Did you go to church yesterday or something?

ANA IVANOVIC:  No, not really (smiling).  But I really appreciate that.

Q.  How would you rank this as far as one of your biggest wins of your career? 

ANA IVANOVIC:  Yeah, I think this is quite the big result for me.  I think also like the beginning of this year when I won my first WTA Tour title it was really also big thing for me.  But now I'm really happy, I beat two Top 15 players.  This give me more experience.  I think I am pretty happy.

Q.  I know you had a great year.  Mauresmo has been a thorn in your side.  You've got her again. 

ANA IVANOVIC:  Yeah, this is third time in this year that we play together.  Last time we played three sets, so I know little bit what she about.  So looking forward for that match and really want to get the best out of it.

Q.  Where do you train full time? 

ANA IVANOVIC:  Well, I don't really have some base where I train, like, full time.  But we are now trying to make some base, maybe Switzerland or someplace where I can really, after tournaments, go there and practice.

Q.  Where do you live now?

ANA IVANOVIC:  I am in Belgrade, home. 

Q.  Belgrade is still home?

ANA IVANOVIC:  Yeah.

Q.  No thoughts of moving to Florida like so many do? 

ANA IVANOVIC:  Well, no, not really.  I am still going to school, so that's why I'm trying to go back and try to finish that.

Q.  What grade are you in?

ANA IVANOVIC:  I'm third, third grade.  So I have still like two years to go.

Q.  Is that like a junior in high school?

ANA IVANOVIC:  It's high school, yes, yes. 

Q.  Do you actually attend school or do home schooling?

ANA IVANOVIC:  No, no, no, I go to school, like.  We don't have this home schooling or Internet, so you really have to go there and make examinations.

Q.  Was this an Easter break for you, Spring Break? 

ANA IVANOVIC:  Well, not really.  I don't have to go, like, every day to school, just examinations.  So I can study when I am on the road, and then just give exam when I go back.

Q.  What are you studying for now, anything particular?

ANA IVANOVIC:  No, not really.  Just normal high school like.

Q.  How long have you had the braces on?

ANA IVANOVIC:  Since few months.  Since last November. 

Q.  When do they come off?

ANA IVANOVIC:  Like in month or so.

Q.  Already?

ANA IVANOVIC:  Yeah. 

Q.  That's quick. 

ANA IVANOVIC:  Yeah, that was quick one. 

Q.  It seems like you weren't intimidated by this US Open champion.  You matched ground strokes with her.  I think you have a better serve and volley.  What are your thoughts?

ANA IVANOVIC:  Well, definitely she's a great player, US Open champion.  I know it will be tough match.  I started quite well the first set.  I think I was serving quite well also first set, and on her serve putting her under pressure, returning quite well.  In the second set I went little bit down.  I think my serve also didn't work that well.  Just didn't move.  But I'm really happy that I pulled through this match, and really looking forward.

Q.  Your weapon, the inside-out forehand down the line?  Is that your weapon?

ANA IVANOVIC:  I like to hit forehands all over the court, yeah (smiling). 

Q.  Growing up, who were your idols and heroes?

ANA IVANOVIC:  Well, I start playing tennis because of Monica Seles, she was my idol when I start playing tennis.  But now I think Roger Federer. 

Q.  How old were you when you followed Monica?

ANA IVANOVIC:  Five.

Q.  You picked it up when you were five?

ANA IVANOVIC:  Yes, yeah.

Q.  Who's your coach?

ANA IVANOVIC:  Zoltan Kuharsky from Hungary.

Q.  He's traveling with you?

ANA IVANOVIC:  Yeah, he's traveling.

Q.  Any family traveling with you?

ANA IVANOVIC:  Yeah, my mom. 

Q.  What's her name? 

ANA IVANOVIC:  Dragana.

Q.  She travels with you full time?

ANA IVANOVIC:  Yeah, yeah, most of the time.

Q.  Keeps you away from the boys, huh?

ANA IVANOVIC:  Well, not really.  She helps me in lot of ways.  I'm really happy that I have someone from my family with me traveling.

Q.  You're 17?

ANA IVANOVIC:  Yeah.

Q.  When's your birthday?

ANA IVANOVIC:  November 6th.

Q.  Did you ever think coming here that you could be into the quarters of a Masters Series like this?

ANA IVANOVIC:  Well, I just -- I know I practice very hard last few months, so I really came here for like another challenge, try to do best out of it.  I'm really happy with quarterfinal, like the way I played, the way I pulled through this matches.  All matches very, very tough.

Q.  Did you set goals for yourself like Top 100, Top 10, Slams? 

ANA IVANOVIC:  Yes, I set some goals.  Like my goal was to be 50 around this time, but now it's obviously much higher. 

Q.  What's your next goal?

ANA IVANOVIC:  Well, the next goal is to be as far rank that you don't ask that question anymore (smiling).
