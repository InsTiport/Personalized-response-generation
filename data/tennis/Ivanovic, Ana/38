  6‑4, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   I have been asking some people this:   If you were at an event tournament and they played music when you walked on court, do you have one song where you say, I want to hear this? 
ANA IVANOVIC:   That's actually a good question.   Very first time I made Championships, it was in Madrid in 2007, and they played a Rihanna song for me when I was walking on court, Don't Stop the Music.   That song really associated me with really good memories, because that was the first time I was top 10 and it was great year for me.
So it's very special song for me.

Q.   So you still want to hear that?
ANA IVANOVIC:   Yes.   Yes, exactly. 

Q.   If there were three songs they could play for you at Australian Open, what would they be?
ANA IVANOVIC:   It would be this one, it would be Shakira Waka Waka, and it would be Eye of the Tiger. 

Q.   Can I ask about Bastien?   Is he still around?
ANA IVANOVIC:   I think that's quite private. 

Q.   You were slipping some.   Is it the surface, or you were just being slippery tonight?
ANA IVANOVIC:   No, it was actually a little bit, but it's also good, I think, to actually feel control of the court.
Okay, sometimes it's not good when it's too much, but it wasn't extra slippery.   It was fine.
