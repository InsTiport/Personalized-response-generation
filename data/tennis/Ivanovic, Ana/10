I. IVANOVIC/T. Patterson   
6-2, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How did you feel?  
ANA IVANOVIC: Yeah, it was really good to have a win today.  I thought I played a quite solid match.  I started well, tried to be aggressive and sort of transfer what I worked on in my practice court onto the match court.   
It's never easy playing someone you faced for the first time.  I haven't seen her play much before.  I was really happy I managed to just stay calm and get breaks when it mattered.   
 Q.  A lot of nerves going into this match, considering a lot of seeded players so far this tournament have been eliminated?  
ANA IVANOVIC: Definitely.  You know, first rounds are always tricky against also opponents you don't know.  There were also tough first-round pairings.   
But you really have to take care of your own game and yourself out there.  For me it was just a matter of focusing.   
Of course you're going to have nerves for every match because it means so much to you.  But it's about just trying to handle them.  I did that well today.   
 Q.  A couple wayward ball tosses throughout the match.  How do you work on that?  
ANA IVANOVIC: I work on it a lot.  On a daily basis I work on it.  Some days you have to accept you may have to stop it a few more times than the others.  I'm kind of used to live with it.   
But I think I served well.  I think my serve can be a weapon.  That's what's my aim.
