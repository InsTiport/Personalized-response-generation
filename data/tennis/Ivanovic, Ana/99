A. IVANOVIC/K. Bondarenko
  6‑3, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Do you have any superstitions you follow on the court or on the day you're playing?
ANA IVANOVIC:   I try not to step on the lines.   I try to stay away from superstitions, but sometimes I like to use the same shower and the same bathroom before the match. 
But sometimes it's occupied so I go with what's left. 

Q.   We spoke to the WTA chief executive earlier today about the grunting and noise reduction.   They're implementing a system mainly at a junior level to educate.   What is your take on the whole thing?
ANA IVANOVIC:   Well, obviously it's been a little bit of an issue lately on tour, but I think it's very hard to determine what's the limit.   I mean, how can you set that?   Then you say you have to go a little bit less squeaky, a little less loud.
I think it would be very hard to implement, to be honest.
