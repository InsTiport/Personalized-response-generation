THE MODERATOR:  Questions.  
 
 
Q.  Great match today.  Can you tell us a little bit about it?
 
ANA IVANOVIC:  Yeah, I think I start the match really good.  In the second set, I got a little bit nervous.  I was more holding back, and she started to play much better and put me under pressure.  But I'm really happy I could manage to win that match in the end.  
 
Q.  Can you tell us about what's next, your next match? 
 
ANA IVANOVIC:  Tomorrow I'll play against Bartoli.  I'm really looking forward for that match because that's for sure going to be great preparation for the New York.  I really enjoy playing here.  
 
Q.  You've had a great season so far.  Can you tell us a little bit about what your next goals are for this year and next year?
 
ANA IVANOVIC:  Looking back, I'm really happy the way it went.  Now, of course, I have much higher goals.  But at the moment, I just want to improve my game a little bit more, to play more consistently.  Yeah, I think that's the most important thing.  Of course, I want to do as best as I can on US Open.
