  6/4, 6/0 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   You're creeping up the rankings once again.   It's been commonly said, usually by journalists that probably isn't true, that you found it difficult being at the top end of the rankings when you were there some years ago.   Is that true?   This time, are you ready for what looks like a continuous rise maybe back to No. 1?  
ANA IVANOVIC:   It's been so long ago I don't even remember.   Definitely it's been a slow, slow climb back actually.  
I felt like I been playing a lot of matches and a lot of good victories this year I had, and rankings didn't really resemble that, which was little bit hard to take, you know, because you put so much hard work and then yet you're dropping in the ranking list.  
Actually, I'm sure it will take care of it later in the year.   I don't try to think too much about that or obsess.   I really try to do my work on the court, try to win the matches that I should, and to improve in each match.   Then rankings take care of themselves.
