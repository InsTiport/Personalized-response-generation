A. IVANOVIC/M. Sharapova
  6‑2, 5‑7, 7‑5

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   That was one of the wilder matches of the year.   How do you feel having survived it?
ANA IVANOVIC:   Yeah, definitely.   I mean, it's a very thrilling I think moment because it was very competitive towards the end, especially in the third set. 
Even in the second, lots of turn around, lots of breaks in the third set.   Just so, so thrilled and happy to stay composed and fight until the last moment.

Q.   Was it just a matter of nerves in the second set?   Building that lead, you know, just a game away and you called Dejan out. 
ANA IVANOVIC:   Yeah, I didn't call him because of that.   I was actually feeling quite good.   Then on 5‑3 when I was serving for it on the deuce, on 1‑4, and I really did not move my feet.   That was a little bit of nerves. 
It was frustrating that I let it good just because, yeah, I was a little bit too passive.   Against Maria you can't do that.   She's going to step up and take her opportunities, and that's what she did.

Q.   What happened in the third set when you were getting the medical attention?
ANA IVANOVIC:   I was really feeling nauseous.   I think I ate something bad today.   When my coach was coming out, I kept telling him I don't feel good, like my stomach is really upset.   Then it really build up in the third set and I was not feeling fine.
They gave me some pills and after some games it was better.

Q.   Was it a formal medical timeout?
ANA IVANOVIC:   No.

Q.   Just an evaluation?
ANA IVANOVIC:   Yeah, exactly.   They just gave me pills.

Q.   You were really dominate the first set and a half.   What was working exceptionally for you then? 
ANA IVANOVIC:   I was just trying to play my game.   Trying to step up and be aggressive and don't rush.   Against Maria you really have to try and push her off the court.   If you give her opportunity she's going to dictate the points. 
I was very pleased with that.   That's why when I let it slip a little bit‑‑ actually I was 4‑Love up, and then next few games for a little bit not as solid as up to that point. 
Then I was a little bit, yeah, disappointed at that service game on the 5‑3.

Q.   How did you get yourself going in the third after the second?
ANA IVANOVIC:   You know, I really tried to talk to myself and tried to see it as a fresh start and tried to realize that I did wrong that I was passive.   So I tried to be more aggressive again and tried to think about placement and to make more first serve percentage.
So I was really, really happy I managed to do that.   Still, there was quite a few breaks.   It was really up and down, that third set.

Q.   Is it hard not to think, as the second set slips away, Oh, God, I was up; this will be such a bad choke if I lose?
ANA IVANOVIC:   You know, I actually thought of you.   You remember the other day when we were talking about this?   I actually thought of that.   I said, If I let that bother me I'm gonna lose.
So I have to either stop or if that's going to bother me, the match is going to be over.   So really I put that a aside and just thought of it as it could happen anyway and try to think fresh and have positive affirmations. 

Q.   How big of a win is this for your confidence?
ANA IVANOVIC:   Oh, I mean, this means so much to me.   I think this is the biggest final I've been in in a while.   It's amazing feeling.   I've just been playing games, and after MontrÃ©al I wasn't even sure how I was going to play.
I've been trying to take it one step at a time.   I have been working a lot on recovery and keep everything together, because I have been playing really good tennis. 
I was so happy to manage to show that today, and when it mattered the most I played some very good tennis.

Q.   Is it weird at all because Sven and all of her team were sitting courtside in the photo pit.   Can you hear them?
ANA IVANOVIC:   Yeah. 

Q.   You have a former relationship with him.   Is there kind of like a moment where you're like, Whoa, he's cheering against me?
ANA IVANOVIC:   Yeah, you know, I think it was the first time my team was quieter than someone else's team. 
But, yeah, when I was on that side, especially returning from that end, it was quite loud.   All is fair in love and war.   It's a match. 
Obviously everyone wants their own player to win, so you can't hold that against anyone.

Q.   You broke her quite a bit to start the match and then quite a few times near the end of the match.   Were the breaks any different?   Were you able to execute anything different on the back end of the match as opposed to the front end?
ANA IVANOVIC:   Well, not really.   I really tried to focus on each point at a time.   She's very tall, so her second serves are coming a lot faster comparing to other girls.
I was not able to step in as much as I normally like to, but I really tried to just actually make a lot of returns and put pressure that way. 

Q.   You're playing Serena tomorrow.   Talk about that match and what you're expecting. 
ANA IVANOVIC:   Yeah, you know, for me, the most important is recovery for tomorrow and try to be fresh.   It's going to be I think a great match.   I think we played three times this year already.
Yeah, I think it's great test for me as well.   She's No. 1 player in the world and she's a great champion, so I think it's going to be a good match. 
Yeah, I hope it goes well.   (Smiling.)

Q.   Did you see or hear anything from Maria's side about the medical timeout during the match?
ANA IVANOVIC:   No.   No, I haven't.
