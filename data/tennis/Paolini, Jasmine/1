K. MUCHOVA/ J. Paolini
6-2, 4-6, 6-4
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. What were your thoughts on your match?
JASMINE PAOLINI:   I think I played not so good.  I didn't feel well because I wasn't moving so fast, so it was tough to play against a player like Muchova.  She's playing very good, she played very good on important points.  She made so many aces.  So for me it was tough because I was always late on the ball and, yeah, I could move better, yeah, and hit better also.
Q. Did the conditions affect you today in terms of it was a little bit hotter and warmer?
JASMINE PAOLINI:   No, the weather was fine, it was a bit windy, but it was okay.  It was not easy because there was half shadow on the court, but I like when it's hot and warm, so for me it was fine.
