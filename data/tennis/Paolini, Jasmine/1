 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Can you talk us through your match today and how you were feeling on the court?
 JASMINE PAOLINI:   The match was very tough today against a very strong player.  I couldn't hit deep the ball.  So it was tough because I was always running and always late on the ball and she was hitting very hard, so for me it was really tough today, yeah.
 Q. Can you tell me what were the conditions like on the court today?
 JASMINE PAOLINI:   Today I think the court was a little bit faster than the other days maybe because of the sun and for the hot weather.  I mean, I like when it's hot, but today it was so fast the court, so maybe also of her, I don't know.  But, yeah, it was a bad match for me.
 Q. What are your plans for your next match or your next tournament from here?
 JASMINE PAOLINI:   I hope to play the WTA next week, because I'm still out of qualies, so alternate.  So I will wait to get in, I hope.  And, yeah, I will play in the 250 here and then maybe Adelaide, but I'm not sure.
