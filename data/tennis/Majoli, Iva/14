Q. Your last meeting with Martina, you won the third set very easily, what was different today? 
 
 IVA MAJOLI: I think it was a very good match. And Martina is in a great form. She's been playing very well this year and especially the last couple of tournaments. And maybe I didn't feel the ball the best today but I have to give all the credit to Martina, how she was just attacking the ball, serving well. I think she improved her serve a lot from last time. And it was a good match. I have to be happy with this week and hopefully I'm sure we're going to play a lot more matches with me and Martina. So I'm sure I'm going to win some of them in the future. But today she was just, you know, better, I think.  
 
Q. How was your rib? 
 
 IVA MAJOLI: It was good, no problem.
