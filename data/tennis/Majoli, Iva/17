Q. Could you tell me a little bit of what was the most effective part of Lindsay's game against you? 
 
 IVA MAJOLI: I think she was attacking the whole match and I wasn't really into it the whole time. I think my concentration wasn't the best and there were a couple of bad calls, but I think she played pretty good. And I didn't play my best.
