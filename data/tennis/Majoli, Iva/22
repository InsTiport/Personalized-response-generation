Q.  We had the impression you never got into this match; is that right? 

IVA MAJOLI:  Well, before the match, I thought that I was going to play better and that match could be more interesting, but I guess it wasn't my day. Mary, played very well, so I didn't have any chances. 


Q.  Can you talk about how well she is playing? 

IVA MAJOLI:  Well, yeah, I think Mary improved a lot.  I mean, it just -- she played well, and I didn't give any fight.  I just didn't play well. I missed a lot of balls and, of course, she played even better. 


Q.  How has she improved? 

IVA MAJOLI:  Well, I think she improved a lot.  She is top five now.
