MODERATOR:  Questions for Mardy.  He has a doubles match in a short bit.  First question.  
 
 
Q.  What were you thinking when those two match points went by in the second set?
 
MARDY FISH:  That's not actually the first time that's happened.  That happened against Enqvist last week.  I knew that I had to hang in there because, you know, just keep taking care of my serve.  I knew I would have chances to break him.  Like I said, I just had to keep holding on to my serve and I would be in there.  
 
Q.  Why do you think you'd have chances to break him, knowing that Philippoussis has a pretty awesome serve?
 
MARDY FISH:  Well, I mean, he does have an unbelievable serve.  It's the best serve that I've ever faced.  But I think that I have relatively good returns.  I think I can make him play on a number of games - and I did that in the last game.  I figured that if I just take care of my serve, I knew I would have some chances.  
 
Q.  Where on the scale of what you've done do you rank this victory?
 
MARDY FISH:  I mean, last week and this week can't compare to anything besides maybe Davis Cup practice partner was really fun, and then this.  These three things by far are the top things I've ever done. 
 
Q.  Any reason that you think things are starting to come together for you now?  Your name has been out there along with Andy Roddick. 
 
MARDY FISH:  I've just been working really, really hard.  I have new coach since the US Open last year, and it took a while for us to start to gel and start to get used to each other.  Right now we're really working good together and we know what each other's thinking.  He really helps me out, prepares me before each match.  I think that's really helped me in the long run. 
 
Q.  Who is that?
 
MARDY FISH:  Brad Stein. 
 
Q.  What did he say before this match?
 
MARDY FISH:  I mean, he said  -- he has confidence in me.  He knows that I can win a match like that.  He just said, "Take care of your serve," which is a huge thing against a guy like that, with a guy like that's serve. If you lose serve, you really don't have a lot of opportunities to win the match.  I took care of my serve, and everything went well. 
 
Q.  Who did you say your coach is?
 
MARDY FISH:  Brad Stein. 
 
Q.  Have you spoken to him about some of the other players he's worked with, like Courier, Medvedev?
 
MARDY FISH:  Yeah, a lot.  He has a lot of good stories at dinner.  We talk about a lot of Courier.  He used to coach Jonathan Stark, Woodruff, Medvedev.  He has a lot of good stories.  He knows so much, it's great that I'm with him because we work really well together. 
 
Q.  When Pete was asked the other day who were the next great American players, he mentioned you and Andy.  What do you think about that?
 
MARDY FISH:  I think that's awesome.  I mean, just to be mentioned in the same breath with those guys, to be the next greats is unbelievable for me.  It's all come up in a short period of time right now, but I think it's really cool that guys like Andre and Pete can mention us and things like that. 
 
Q.  Any nerves about that, a little pressure?
 
MARDY FISH:  Yeah, I mean, but it's good pressure.  It's a lot of fun to try to be the next Pete or Andre or Todd or Michael.  All those guys are so good.  There's a lot of weight to carry.  I don't know if anyone can ever bring out a group like those guys did, especially Pete and Andre, because they won so many Grand Slams.  I don't know if there will ever be a pack of Americans that can do that.  But Taylor Dent, Andy, myself, James Blake, we'll try. 
 
Q.  Are you pushing each other?  Is it good that you have contemporaries who are coming up at the same time you are?
 
MARDY FISH:  We are, yeah.  It's good to have other guys coming up.  If it was by yourself, it would be a lot tougher, because they are pushing you.  Andy is ahead of the pack right now.  He's done the best in the challenger level and the tour level.  We're just trying to catch him.  He set the bar really high, really quick.  We're trying to catch up to him.  But it's good.  It's fun. 
 
Q.  How far below this gang of New Balls guys do you think you are right now?  Can you get into that level pretty quickly?
 
MARDY FISH:  I don't know.  I'd have to say I would have to be  -- every guy is top 40 probably in that thing.  I just cracked the top 200.  I'm not really close to that right now.  I think I have to crack the Top 50 at least before that. 
 
Q.  Is it better for the pushing of each other that you and Andy went through high school a little bit together?
 
MARDY FISH:  Yeah.  I mean, we know each other really well.  We have a history, like a background away from tennis.  We know each other really well away from tennis, more so than James and Taylor.  But, yeah, it is good because we did grow up together kind of in the junior and senior year of high school.  We hung out all the time, practiced all the time.  Andy and I know more about each other than the rest of the guys. 
 
Q.  By hung out, you mean Saturday night at the movies?
 
MARDY FISH:  Away from tennis, yeah. 
 
Q.  What is it going to take for you to get to that level?  What do you have to improve?
 
MARDY FISH:  I have to keep improving my forehand and my serve, just my strength, just keep winning matches like that.  Winning matches like this does wonders for your confidence.  Last week beating Enqvist and Chela in Scottsdale.  Then coming here and having a win is great for my confidence, knowing that I can play with everyone. 
 
Q.  Do you feel day in and day out that you can bring this type of tennis?
 
MARDY FISH:  Well, I've only been doing it for two weeks now, so I guess we'll see (laughter).  
 
Q.  How do you plan to guard against a letdown after today?  Will you go into your next match with as much enthusiasm?
 
MARDY FISH:  I'm still a heavy underdog.  I think I play Nicolas Kiefer.  He's a former Top  5 in the world not long ago.  He's the favorite.  But I kind of like the role of underdog.  I like being the crowd favorite out there.  It's so much fun to play out there in front of those people, have them cheering for you.  I think that, like I said, like I did today, it's kind of a different match.  Kiefer and Philippoussis play differently.  I think I just have to keep taking care of my serve and I know I'll have chances to break, chances to win the match, I'm sure. 
 
Q.  What is the feeling like playing out there?
 
MARDY FISH:  It's great.  I played one match at the US Open against Gambill kind of like that where they were all on my side, so many people, just the atmosphere.  It's unbelievable.  It was a great day, sunny.  Everyone's happy, I guess, I don't know.  It was fun. 
 
Q.  When you say Brad tells you stories at dinner, are they like stories about these guys' tennis or stories you probably won't want to be sharing?
 
MARDY FISH:  A little bit of both, yeah.  I try to ask him a lot about the tennis because he knows so much.  I've never been around anyone that knows that much about tennis, besides my dad.  He helps me so much on the aspect of life and not just tennis, so he's great with that.  
 
Q.  Are you receiving any assistance from the USTA?
 
MARDY FISH:  I am.  They're helping out a great deal, financially and having coaches out there.  They're doing a great job.  
 
Q.  Did you work with Stanford for a while?
 
MARDY FISH:  Yes. 
 
Q.  Was Andy at the same time?
 
MARDY FISH:  Yeah.  In '99, beginning of '99, Andy and I, we had the same coach. 
 
Q.  Is this kind of the life you've always dreamed about?  You're embarking right now on a pro career that would seem to be pretty exciting.  Are your dreams suddenly coming true?
 
MARDY FISH:  Yeah.  I mean, I've always wanted to be a pro tennis player.  I've dreamed of winning Grand Slams, making lots of money, having nice cars, stuff like that.  Hopefully, it can come true.  I've just been riding.  These past two weeks have been unbelievable, have been like - what would I say - how it will be at the Tour level hopefully.  Hopefully I can keep going. 
 
Q.  What are you driving these days?
 
MARDY FISH:  I don't know.  I don't have a car.  Take my mom's. 
 
Q.  In those dreams, who did you dream you would be playing?
 
MARDY FISH:  I don't know if it's against anyone.  Maybe Pete or Andre.  Pete at Wimbledon maybe.  Beating Pete at Wimbledon would be the ultimate, I think, since he's won so many there. 
 
Q.  How old are you?
 
MARDY FISH:  19. 
 
Q.  What does a 19-year-old do when he's not playing on the tour?
 
MARDY FISH:  I try to rest.  I try to rest all the time.  Just try to have fun.  I mean, I'm missing so much.  I'm missing like the college life.  I try to have a lot of fun with what I'm doing.  Brad and I have a great time like away from the court, we have so much fun together.  So far I'm not really missing the college life.  Sometimes when you're losing, it's tough.  But right now it's good. 
 
Q.  Did you give that serious consideration?
 
MARDY FISH:  Well, I did a little bit.  I always wanted to go to like UNC when I was younger, growing up, because I love Chapel Hill.  I used to live in North Carolina a little bit.  I think it was the French Open '99, Juniors, when I decided I was going to turn pro.  I just finished my junior year of high school. 
 
Q.  Did any one thing happen in that event that turned you in that direction?
 
MARDY FISH:  Well, I jumped into the Top 10 in the Juniors in the world like really quick, and then everyone  -- like IMG, my agent is Tony Godsick, and he was looking after me from the French Open.  He's great. 
 
Q.  Getting back to the match, would you say it was a matter of lack of experience that stopped you from closing it in straight sets?
 
MARDY FISH:  Maybe yes and no.  I've had a lot of experience now in the past few weeks from Memphis to Scottsdale to here trying to close out matches, and I didn't close out the match.  In Memphis, I lost a match to Magnus Gustafsson where I was up 6-1, 5-2.  I lost that set 7-5, went down 4-0, then lost 6-4.  From then, in Scottsdale, I had a chance to serve it out in the second set against Enqvist, but I won it in the third.  I learned from my first one and made it better there.  I knew I had to just stay positive and good things would happen. 
 
Q.  What was going through your head in the first match point, did you say, "Go for it and serve"? 
 
MARDY FISH:  I did.  I think I tried to serve an ace out wide and I missed it.  I don't know what happened at that point.  I figured that I was going to try to get it over with right here.  I was down 15-40 that game.  I was just trying to get it over with quick.  
 
Q.  If beating Pete at Wimbledon is your ultimate dream, how would you characterize in a few words beating Philippoussis here first round?
 
MARDY FISH:  I mean, like I said, it does so much for a young guy's career to do it in a place like this where everyone's out there, the atmosphere is so nice, so great.  To do it in America was even better because everyone's cheering for you and everyone wants the underdog, the young guy to win.  It's great.  It does so much for my career right now.  Hopefully, I can keep going here. 
 
Q.  Did you think that serve on match point in the second set was in?  Looked like Philippoussis started watching toward the bench. 
 
MARDY FISH:  When was that?  
 
Q.  The one you served wide to Philippoussis. 
 
MARDY FISH:  I don't remember. 
 
Q.  It was your first match point. 
 
MARDY FISH:  Was it?  
 
Q.  It looked like there was a delay in the call. 
 
MARDY FISH:  I don't know.  I thought it was out, I guess.  I didn't really say anything.
