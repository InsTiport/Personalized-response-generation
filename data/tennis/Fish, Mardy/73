S. QUERREY/M. Fish
      7-6, 7-5

 Q. It was a good match just apart from what seemed like a lapse of concentration in the second set. 
     MARDY FISH: Yeah. I mean, it's sort of inexcusable at that part of the tournament and that part of the match. If you have, you know, sort of -- I guess, you know, maybe nerves got to me or, you know, the moment. 
     I mean, I just wanted to play well at this tournament ever since I've been coming here, and, you know, if you want something so badly, sometimes it's not a good thing.
     You know, Sam's pretty free-flowing out there. Sometimes sort of his attitude of sort of happy-go-lucky is a great thing. I certainly know the history of this tournament and the names on the trophy, and that definitely caught up to me.
     I can only speak for my side of the net, and, you know, Sam certainly is the kind of guy that really goes with the flow, and that's gonna help him for sure in his career in big spots like that. He's sort of happy either way if he wins or loses. 
     You know, again, I can only speak for my side, and certainly, again, I know -- I know this is a great tournament, and I would have loved to have added my name on there. I felt like I was playing well enough throughout the week that not many of the guys could beat me here. I just didn't do it today.
