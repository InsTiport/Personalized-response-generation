R. FEDERER/M. Fish
  6‑3, 7‑6

Q. Can you tell us a little bit about the match today? 
MARDY FISH:   Yeah, it's a good match, you know.   I thought Roger played really well.   I played really well definitely in the second set.   In the second set the quality got really good.   I thought we played some great tennis.

Q.   Looking forward to the US Open, any thoughts on getting ready and prepared?
MARDY FISH:   Yeah, I mean, this is great preparation for me the past two weeks, making the semis in Washington and then two quarterfinals in both Masters 1000 events. 
It's been a good three weeks.   We will take a little bit of a break and then we will gear up for New York.

Q.   New York, how is that draw going to pan out for you?
MARDY FISH:   We will have to see.   I have a lot of points to defend from doing so well in the summer.   At least I have got myself into sort of a position by not playing for three months during the clay that.
But, you know, that I can be seeded again, you know, before, a pretty good spot in the draw.   So we'll see.
