 RODDICK-FISH/Mirnyi-Ram
  3-6, 6-1, 14-12 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. You guys were so happy, it's like you won the calendar year Slam there.   
 MARDY FISH: I was. I'm married now, so I need the money, and he doesn't.   
 No, we were excited, man. We were fired up. It was an unbelievable atmosphere. I mean, you know, even those guys I'm sure had fun. You know, it was a great match, 14-12 in the third.   
  
  Q. Were you having as much fun as Mardy was?  
 ANDY RODDICK: No, because I wasn't playing as well as Mardy was out there. You know, I'd like to sit here and talk about my doubles prowess, but about 2-All in the second set -- or no, we won 6-1, so 1-All in the second set, Mardy pretty much took over that match.   
 In the breaker, I didn't do much to help us. I double faulted twice, which was ridiculous. So, you know, I'm just glad he was able to step up and be clutch. I just rode his coat tails today.  
  
  Q. Is your back okay after he jumped on you after the match?  
 ANDY RODDICK: Well, it was only fair. He carried me for three sets. I only had to carry him for about five seconds. (Laughter.)  
  
  Q. Any thoughts about playing more together?   
 MARDY FISH: When it works out, probably.  
 ANDY RODDICK: I don't know.  
 MARDY FISH: We have to focus on the singles.  
 ANDY RODDICK: We might as well stop now.   
 MARDY FISH: We'll make Masters Cup without playing a Slam.  
 ANDY RODDICK: Mardy wants to be top 20 in doubles. He's going to go for four or five partners now. I think he's only got three now.  
  
  Q. Do you think that shows how doubles can really entertain the crowd? I mean, that was a big crowd for doubles, and they obviously enjoyed it.   
 ANDY RODDICK: I mean, I think -- you know, I think you gotta have big guys playing. I think the crowd at Rafa's match against the Bryans the other night was, from what I saw on TV and what I saw when I was leaving, was unbelievable.   
 I think it's a nice contrast which you get the doubles teams like that versus the singles guys. You know, so...   
 But good tennis is good tennis, whether there's two people on the court or whether there's four.  
  
  Q. Is it easier to enjoy yourselves in doubles, not as much pressure?  
 ANDY RODDICK: Yes.  
 MARDY FISH: Yeah, I mean, plus it's fun to play with friends. You know, we don't have to rely on it. You know, we play because -- I play because, you know, to get practice for singles. You know, I think it helps my game a ton, you know.   
 So, yeah, it's a lot easier when there's as that much pressure.  
  
  Q. Any plans on defending the title next year?  
 ANDY RODDICK: Whoa. Just let us settle.
