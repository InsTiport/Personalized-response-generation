THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How are you feeling?   Has it sunk in that you're actually going to get a medal?   
ANDREA HLAVACKOVA:   It's amazing feeling for both of us.   It was the biggest pressure on today's match that now we're clear to get a medal.   
I think we just want to enjoy this moment for today and think about the finals tomorrow.
