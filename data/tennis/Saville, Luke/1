 Q. Luke, John, it's been a long night for Australia.  Great to get the win there at the end?
 JOHN PEERS:   Yeah, definitely it was great to be able to play with Luke and represent the green and gold.  Had a lot of fun out there.  Created so much energy late at night.
 Yeah, getting the win was great fun.
 Q. Luke, John mentioned great energy.  What a fantastic atmosphere it was this evening.  How fun was it for you to play on Rod Laver Arena in that?
 LUKE SAVILLE:   Yeah, so much fun.  Like I mentioned out there, this is the first time that I represented the green and gold for Australia for many years since under-16s.
 Just to team up with Peersy, one of our best doubles players in the past 10 years, it's really wonderful for me.  Obviously we brought great energy out there.
 I think we've combined really well.  We've been training extremely hard the two, three weeks when we got called up.  Just such an honor to put on the green and gold.  Really, really buzzing right now.  Pretty thrilled.
 Q. John, just a word about your teammates.  Battled really hard tonight.  Especially Alex.  What have you got to say about their efforts, as well?
 JOHN PEERS:   Yeah, no, the boys fought really hard tonight.  We've always got their back.  We're always a strong team unit together.  I know the Aussies were always behind them.  We'll come out strong for the Aussie summer.  It was great to see the boys fight so hard.  Fingers crossed, they can get over the line once the Aussie Open starts.
