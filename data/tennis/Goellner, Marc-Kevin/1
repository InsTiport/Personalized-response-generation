MARC-KEVIN GOELLNER: Today my serve was horrific. I just didn't get into it. My serve
let me down today.
MARC-KEVIN GOELLNER: It is always something special to play Boris. But, it doesn't
bother me. I just try to see him as my opponent. But, this doesn't always work out.
MARC-KEVIN GOELLNER: After the match, I analyzed it with the team captain. That was
very good and I am glad that there is fresh air coming into German tennis. It is fun to
work if you see that something is happening.
MARC-KEVIN GOELLNER: It is always an incentive when a German player wins or when a
German player is coming to the top, especially because I trained with Tommy before the
tournament. Haas and Kiefer are the hope for Germany. I am talked about when they are
talking about experience since I have been there for a bit longer than they have.
MARC-KEVIN GOELLNER: It is fun. There is communication. The coaches communicate with
each other. Yesterday I trained with Tommy and suddenly Nick Bollettieri came to me and
talked with me about my forehand. I was very surprised. This never happened before that
another trainer came and talked to me. You can feel that we all have one goal which is to
bring the German tennis forward. I am very satisfied and I think that we are all very
satisfied.
MARC-KEVIN GOELLNER: I will play in Paris and Stockholm. Then I have two weeks off and
then I will start with training for next year.
MARC-KEVIN GOELLNER: I will go to Marbella. Actually I wanted to go skiing, but when I
heard that they are closing another training camp, I changed my plans. This is a good
opportunity to prepare myself for next year.
