THE MODERATOR:  Questions.  
 
 
Q.  Sort of a boring match. 
 
DAVIDE SANGUINETTI:  Boring (smiling)?  My point of view, wasn't that boring.  
 
Q.  What was it like out there?
 
DAVIDE SANGUINETTI:  It was great.  I mean, I felted like all the crowd was with me, except for the red corner.  But I enjoy.  I enjoy to play with him.  I think we play a really good match both.  We were running everywhere.  
 
Q.  You've been on the tour for a dozen years. 
 
DAVIDE SANGUINETTI:  Sounds so long (smiling).  
 
Q.  Where does this match sit as far as excitement?
 
DAVIDE SANGUINETTI:  Well, it's a good match.  I don't know.  I mean, I always tell like the semifinals in Davis Cup, it was my best match, best memory, to win here against the United States, against Todd Martin.  But I guess this one is pretty good also.  
 
Q.  What kept you going out there when your body feels like shutting down?
 
DAVIDE SANGUINETTI:  Well, I thought to myself, "This is the last set.  If I lose, I go home.  I want to keep playing, a couple more match, if I can, but at least one more match."  That what's kept me going.  
 
Q.  How does a nice Italian land up at UCLA for school?
 
DAVIDE SANGUINETTI:  Before UCLA, I went to Palmer Academy in Tampa.  From Palmer Academy, they told me, "Is not bad if you go to UCLA."  I said okay.  I enter only that school.  They pick me right away.  
 
Q.  What does it mean to get this far, good Grand Slam result for you?
 
DAVIDE SANGUINETTI:  It's a great feeling.  I mean, not that many college guys, they make it on the tour.  Also that is a great feeling, especially I was playing No. 6 and 4 in UCLA.  
 
Q.  For you now, in your career now, what does it mean to get this far?
 
DAVIDE SANGUINETTI:  It means a lot.  It means that I can still play in a good level.  It means that I can still enjoy myself on the court.  It's a lot of things.  I want to show to my daughter that daddy can really play, is still playing.  It's not bad.  
 
Q.  Never a moment you'll forget?
 
DAVIDE SANGUINETTI:  Every time I hug my daughter I never forget.  Not just because I won, but even if I'm losing, I will never forget.  
 
Q.  During that match you had a lot of interaction not only with the crowd but with Paradorn, too.  Is that something you do often?
 
DAVIDE SANGUINETTI:  Not really.  Sometime it came out like that.  Sometime it doesn't.  This today, it was like I had fun, so I was laughing with Paradorn also.  
 
Q.  You slowed the pace down.  That was strategic?
 
DAVIDE SANGUINETTI:  Yes, it was strategically.  If you hit the ball, he likes to hit the ball.  If you give no pace, he can miss.  I guess what he did. Then the end of the second set and third set, he wasn't missing anything, so I had to change something.  I went a little bit more to the net, I was a little more aggressive.  I was changing.  I guess was the key of the match.
