THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Congratulations. When you arrived at the start of the week, did you have a sense that winning this tournament would be possible or are you surprised?
JANNIK SINNER: I think I'm surprised, you know, because it's been an unbelievable week. All the players are unbelievable players. If not, they are not here.
I think I was the last one. You know, I was No. 8 seed. So I tried to have my chances, and of course today I'm very happy about my game.
Q. All of this is new to you: the public, the cameras, the media. Is it something you could get used to?
JANNIK SINNER: You know, it's something different, you know, because I never had, first of all, this kind of support, even on court. Off court, you know, making some medias, I'm still young, so now it's okay. I don't know if Roger or Rafa or whatever are still enjoying these kind of things, I don't know, but, you know, I'm young and I'm enjoying it.
Q. What are you most satisfied with this week?
JANNIK SINNER: I think I played game after game better, you know. I think that's the point and that's the thing we were looking for.
I played well the first match. Yesterday I started not perfect, but then after, it was a great match. Even today I started very well, and I think the first game was very important, you know. I was 30-40 and I served well twice. I'm very happy about that.
Q. From this tournament you have won more prize money that you have in your entire career. Are you going to buy something to celebrate, treat yourself?
JANNIK SINNER: No (smiling).
