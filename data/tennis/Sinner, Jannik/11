THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. A bit of a disappointing match today. What's your takeaways from today's match?
JANNIK SINNER: You know, it's been not easy today. A lot of wind.
He was playing better today. He deserved to win. There's not so much to talk about. I mean, he served better. The third set I was trying to going a little bit more forward, trying to close on the net, which was working a little bit better.
Then he break me immediately, and then he played better the important points.
Q. What are your expectations now heading to the rest of the season? Obviously you're coming off the back of your NextGen Finals at the end of last year. What are your hopes now looking ahead towards the rest of the year?
JANNIK SINNER: Well, I mean, nothing change. I mean, it's just one match. Obviously disappointing losing second round, but, you know, we have to keep going.
I mean, it's nothing happens. Sometimes, yeah, you have these days. I mean, he played better than me today, and he deserved it. It's not that -- I mean, I don't like these days, but you have to accept them and then trying to be ready for the next tournament.
