THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Can you describe what this week has been like for you.  Any highlights stand out, any moments?
JANNIK SINNER: I think this week for me was pretty emotional, on court, off court, knowing many players.  I think I've played especially the first match against Johnson in a pretty good way.  Even if I was down in the third set, it was not easy to come back.
Today I think it was very good to knowing how the top-10 players are mentally.  For me it's very important to know them mentally.  I think they're pretty strong, especially with the serve.  They're serving very good.
But I think I have now a good idea how I have to play in three years.
Q. What do you think is the difference between you and a player like Stefanos?
JANNIK SINNER: I think, first of all, they are always playing on high level the full match, which for me is not easy at the moment.  It's very important to play ATP tournaments for knowing how the level is.  Then, of course, physically.  I think that's the point where I have to work on the most.
Q. Riccardo the other day was saying he thinks you can be as good as anybody he worked with.  Pretty high praise.  What do you think about the praise he has for your game and work ethic?
JANNIK SINNER: We are working on making the game, which it was not easy today against Stefanos.  But anyways, I try to push a lot on his backhand, then moving on his forehand, which especially my game is.  It's not a new thing.  I think we are on the right way.  We just have to continue like that.
