THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. When you were watching this tournament last year in the stands, you had the experience as a spectator. What do you think the atmosphere will be like when you play tomorrow in the final?
JANNIK SINNER: I think the atmosphere will be great like today. I mean, it's unbelievable here, the atmosphere, and I enjoy every moment I play.
Of course I will try to play my best tennis, because against Alex, if you want to win, you have to. It's not easy match tomorrow, but I try my best.
Q. Some players get nervous playing in front of the home crowd, the public, but you seem to thrive on it. Your best results so far have come in Italy. What is it about playing at home that helps you do so well?
JANNIK SINNER: I think the crowd gives you a kind of energy, which is very important for a player, and I try to not be so nervous.
Today I was a little bit more nervous because it's semifinal, and tomorrow I will be of course a little bit nervous, which is normal, you know. You have to try to put away and trying to focus in about your game, which I think I have done a good job today.
Q. Next week you're playing a challenger. What made you decide not to end your season here and do one more challenger to end the season?
JANNIK SINNER: The challenger is in my hometown or near to my hometown, and I enjoy playing there. It was my first challenger where I made ATP points last year, and it was the first challenger what I was watching when I was a little kid. So of course I enjoy to play there.
