J. SINNER/M. Ymer
4-0, 4-2, 4-1
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You seemed very relaxed after the win, kind of like it was almost expected. To be 2-0 this week, are you surprised by that, or did you think you could do it when you came here?
JANNIK SINNER: I don't know. It's difficult to say, you know. Every match is important here.
For sure today was, from the score, was a little bit easier, but I think in the second set it was still very tight. You know, if he wins the ball 40-All, you know, it can change everything.
At the end, I'm very happy that I won today, and I'm very happy that I can play the semifinals, for sure.
Q. You did so well on the deciding points today. You won four of the five points that went to the decider. Is that something that you are generally good at, just being focused on the big points, or did you raise that even more today?
JANNIK SINNER: I think everyone is focused about the big points here, because, you know, 40-All, it's very fast games, you know.
I think I served well even today, like yesterday, and I just try to keep going like this.
Q. This is a unique situation now. You're already guaranteed to play the semis, but you have another match tomorrow no matter what. How will you prepare for it?
JANNIK SINNER: I prepare like always. It's one more match which is still very important for me, because you can get very much confidence if you win tomorrow. And he is a completely different player, like this, too.
He's lefty, so I'm happy I can play against him because he has a completely different ball. It's going to be a different situation.
Yeah, as I said before, I would like to -- I just give my maximum tomorrow.
