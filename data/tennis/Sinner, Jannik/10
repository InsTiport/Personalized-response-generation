J. SINNER/S. Tsitsipas
6-1, 6-7, 6-2
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. Last year in this same tournament, you lost against Tsitsipas.  What did you change our evolve in your game to beat him today?
JANNIK SINNER:   You know, especially when you're young, in one year you can do a lot of things.  I think I have improved, yeah, everything.  You know, especially the serve.  The serve today, I served a little bit better, changing rotation and everything.
You know, there is not like one exact point, but I think everything a little bit.  So, you know, playing against him is never easy.  Last year was like, you know, my first test against -- for me, there was, like, the first time I have played against a top-10 player.  It was a little test.
And like today I knew that I have the level to compete better against him.  Yeah, obviously it was a great match, and I'm very happy.
