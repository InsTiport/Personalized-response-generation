7-6, 4-6, 7-6
THE MODERATOR:   A tough match tonight against Karen.  How pleased are you to be in a final again after winning your first title at your last tournament last year in Sofia?
JANNIK SINNER:   Well, first of all, I think it was a good match from both of us.  You know, he was tired; I was tired.
So, you know, I think mentally we both were quite strong.  Deliver a good match on both sides.  Honestly, I'm very happy to be in the finals tomorrow, and trying to sleep, trying to rest in the best possible way.  Then we will see how I feel tomorrow.
Q. Where would you rank this performance and this win in your young career?
JANNIK SINNER:   It's difficult to rank.  I mean, you know, I won it a few times, this match today.  I have been set and break.  Then in the third set I was break up.
I played well the tiebreak in the third set.  I think went twice with the backhand down the line, which made a difference.  At some point I was serving not that well, so, especially in the second set.
I cannot rate, like, you know, out of 10 is 7 or 8.  But I think, like, not like my performance, but I think from both of us I think it was very high, the level, yes.
Q. There is a lot of talk about yourself and Alcaraz as the young teenagers on the tour.  What are your thoughts on Alcaraz?
JANNIK SINNER:   Alcaraz, I played against him two years ago on clay, and already there I knew he's going to be a very, very great player.  He's now here improving day after day.  He has the right mentality, so he for sure has a great future ahead of him.
As I said already the last time, it's great to have new players, new people in the circuit.  I think he's for sure one of the best newcomers which is coming.
Q. Tomorrow is almost, on the men's side, almost an Italy day with the number of Italian players featuring.  What are your thoughts there?
JANNIK SINNER:   Well, I think it's great to see for Italy many players, many great players.  I think everyone push each other a little bit.
Yeah, everyone is playing very, very good, good tennis.  Everyone is different as player, so I think it's great to see, and especially for Italy, having quite big amount of players.
We have a lot of challengers in Italy, so, you know, for us maybe it's a bit easier, especially on clay we have quite a lot challengers.  So, you know, everyone or most of the players can play there, compete there against other players around the world.
So it's good to making their experience, and now it's very good to see a lot of Italian people playing here in big tournaments.
Q. Does playing another Italian in the final, is that tougher for you, or you just take it as another match?
JANNIK SINNER:   It's another different match.  I don't see where my opponent comes from or he's always an opponent.  Opponents, you have to go there with the right mentality going on court, and trying to perform the best what you can that day.
You know, I'm looking forward to.  It's going to be a difficult match for both of us.  And, yeah, it's going to be an interesting match for sure.
