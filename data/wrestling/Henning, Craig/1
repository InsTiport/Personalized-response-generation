 Q.  Tell us a little bit about what your relationship is like with Barry Davis.  He seemed like a really great guy.  Tell us how Barry Davis has coached with you? 
 CRAIG HENNING:  It's great to have him as a coach.  He cares about everyone.  It's not just about wrestling with him.  Any time one of us wrestlers have a problem in like class and stuff, he's showing up every day at our house, making sure we're going to class and not trying to skip out or anything like that.  You can go up and talk to him about anybody.  You can talk to him about wrestling, and he knows more about wrestling than anybody I know, and still he cares enough about each one of us, where he makes sure we excel academically and athletically.
