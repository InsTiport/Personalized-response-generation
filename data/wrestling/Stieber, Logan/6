  THE MODERATOR: To my left is Logan Stieber of Ohio State, division winner, top seed, now 26‑0 for the red shirt sophomore.   Logan, you were up closing in on a technical fall victory in the second period, working for that fall.   
LOGAN STIEBER:   Yeah, I was.   There was a takedown at the end, but I was trying to keep scoring points, you know, and for me it's not a big deal if people are‑‑ they want to‑‑ as long as I can keep scoring points, that's all I'm trying to do.   
   
 Q.   Logan, tell us how you handled this afternoon?   
LOGAN STIEBER:   We spent the whole time together, relaxing.   This tournament he has had a lot of close matches, but the most important thing on this tournament is advancing, moving on to the next round.   
So hopefully‑‑ he's had close matches, but the biggest thing for him was to keep winning and he has a tough one tonight.   So excited to go watch him.   
   
 Q.   Logan, you put up a lot of points in this round.   Is this the style of wrestling‑‑ talk about how you've improved your offense and your ability to run up the scores in the semifinals of the NCAA.   
LOGAN STIEBER:   I have great wrestling partners, whether they be a back‑up team or Lou and Jay, I have the best wrestling partners and they allow me to get better every day and that's a big part of why I'm able to do well.   
THE MODERATOR:   Congratulations, Logan, good luck.
