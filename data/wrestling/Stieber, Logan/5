  THE MODERATOR:   To my left, two‑time NCAA champion and 2013 champion here at 133 pounds, Logan Stieber.   Logan, to start us off, would you take us through the scramble that ended up being reviewed.   
LOGAN STIEBER:   We both were moving, and he caught me.   My left hand was reaching up.   He got in a deep shot, and I fought him off, but he got up on it right away.   It really hurt too much.   I did like a dive through, and I almost had it.   I got my ankle locked.   If I wouldn't have had it locked, I would have been able to kick it off.   But he locked it with the cradle.   As soon as he got that locked, I knew I was in trouble if I tried to bail out.   
I knew I was close to near fall, but I didn't think it was.   They looked at it for like ten minutes, but that pretty much confirms it wasn't.  
   
 Q.   (Question off microphone)?  
LOGAN STIEBER:   It's hard.   It's tough.   It's crazy.   Every match is different.   It's been a lot of fun.  
   
 Q.   Logan, that's two championships that are now sort of controversial, if you want to use that word.   You and your match with Oliver last year.   What happens with these matches?   
LOGAN STIEBER:   I think if you watch the match, they have video review now.   I don't really think the match was that close to controversial if you looked at the video review for five minutes.   Basically, three or four refs were looking at it.   
If they wouldn't have had video review, I would have said it's a little bit closer to controversial, but they saw it wasn't that close.  
   
 Q.   Logan, how important is it in these big matches for you to get ahead early and to establish yourself?   Do you think ultimately the fact that you went out and took control early is the reason you ended up winning?   
LOGAN STIEBER:   Yeah.   You know, I have a lot of faith in my offense, and a lot of people sometimes think that I'm not very good on my feet.   I need to get as much feet down.   This year I know I've had a lot of takedowns.   Big Ten had three matches with takedowns.   
My takedowns have been pretty good all year.   So it's me just getting a nice lead.  
   
 Q.   Logan, obviously, this just ended, but your hometown has two (indiscernible) and you have two national titles.   Have you thought about being halfway to the ultimate?   
LOGAN STIEBER:   You know, it creeps in your mind.   I think it creeps in everyone's mind when they win it, it's a possibility.   But something that I always tell my brother and always tell myself, I couldn't win this National Championship on Thursday.   I couldn't win on Friday.   I had to win tonight.   
So I'll worry about four after I got three.   So worry about next year.  
   
 Q.   Logan, I know freestyle is a big part of your life.   Do you take a break, or do you get right into training soon for the Open in Vegas?   
LOGAN STIEBER:   I'll be training soon.   I think I'll take probably off tomorrow, and maybe Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.   Probably drill Thursday and Friday.   We don't have much time.   Basically have to get weight.   I have 2 1/2 weeks of hard training and then get into it.   
But really I've been training hard all year.   So it's not going to make that big of a difference.  
   
 Q.   Logan, regarding freestyle, though, you're going into being a senior.   How much does wrestling with these bigger guys help you?   
LOGAN STIEBER:   It helps me a lot because I feel comfortable with tough matches.   I feel comfortable with close matches, or if I tie.   If I'm losing, I can get the takedown.   And I've lost a lot of close matches, so I know how it feels on both ends.   I think I've learned a lot wrestling them.  
   
 Q.   Logan, talk about the atmosphere, given the fact we're in Iowa, and obviously you weren't the most popular person for those 10, 15 minutes.   Just describe being in on the island there.   
LOGAN STIEBER:   I like it.   I'd rather have 10,000 people cheering against me like here than having 500 people in the stands.   It's fun.   It s a great atmosphere.   Iowa fans are yelling at me, yelling things at me.   So it's fun.   I know it's just a sport, but it's a lot of fun.  
   
 Q.   Speaking of which, at the Iowa dual in January, you were hurt, and you were there, I believe.   People were talking to you.   Do you remember what was said to you back then?   
LOGAN STIEBER:   I don't know.   Just a lot of things that shouldn't be said, probably.   But they're diehard fans.   As much as I think they hate me on the mat, I think‑‑ I hope they like the way I wrestle.   
I'm not punky at all.   I'm not dirty.   I just try to have fun.   I think at the end of the day I want them to at least to respect me.   When I'm wrestling their guy and they hate me, that's fine.   
THE MODERATOR:   Congratulations, Logan.
