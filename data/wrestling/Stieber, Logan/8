  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please, for Logan. 

Q.   Last 30 seconds when he was in deep, what did you do to fight that off?   He started that period neutral, did that surprise you?
LOGAN STIEBER:   The scramble at the end, I tried to roll, not super fundamentally sound, it's still working a lot and showed (indiscernible). 
Like I'm starting 1â€‘0 every match.   I knew he was going to try to push up on his feet, so... 

Q.   (No microphone.)
LOGAN STIEBER:   It's fun, man, a lot of fun.   My brother is doing well.   It's fine.   A million tough tournaments.   It's been good. 

Q.   How is this different?
LOGAN STIEBER:   You know what's different, I came here a couple years ago, and I loved how in high school if I won State, like they cheered for me.   But here, if you fight off a takedown an Iowa guy, the Penn State, the Cornell guys are going crazy, so are the fans.
I love all the fan support, all the cheering, so...   It's great. 

Q.   Thought about Jordan Oliver?
LOGAN STIEBER:   People are saying look at the brackets.   But for me, if I look ahead to Oliver, if I did, I could have lost a couple matches. 
I'll look at it tonight.   I've wrestled him before.   I know what he's going to do, he knows what I'm going to do.

Q.   Will you look at the video from the national duels?
LOGAN STIEBER:   Yeah, I looked at it a couple times.   Still a lot of things I need to work on.   It's great to have film. 

Q.   What is it going to mean for you to see your brother win the next one?
LOGAN STIEBER:   It would be great.   It would mean a lot.   He's worked so hard.   With me, hopefully he can do it. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thanks a lot, Logan. 
LOGAN STIEBER:   Thank you.
