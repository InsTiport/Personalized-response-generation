THE MODERATOR: John Smith joins us.   
 Q.  John, could you tell us your thoughts of the team with a second-place finish and how it finished with national champions to complete your tournament?  
JOHN SMITH: Well, let's start with the national champions.  It's rewarding when you see these guys being able to fulfill a season goal.  For Dean Heil, the process has been interesting.  He came into the NCAA Championships last year unranked, 15th or 16th, I'm not sure, finished fourth.  And came out ranked No. 1 in the country.  So a lot of things happened pretty quickly for him.  And just for him to maintain that attitude that this is who I am was a key for him all season long.  He won a lot of battle matches.  He won a lot of close matches throughout the year.  And it really made the difference for him to be able to wrestle win close matches here.  Alex Dieringer, guys, I mean, (lost audio).   
You kind of piece everything back together and you work things out and you hope for the best.  They're in a position that we could use some guys and fill the weights and still be competitive.  But, yes, I knew it was going to be a lot tougher.  I think you've heard me say it before, you judge yourself at the end of the season.  And although you'd like to be taking home the championship trophy, there's no shame nor should my team have any shame in my performance this year and the efforts we gave here at the end of the year.   
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
