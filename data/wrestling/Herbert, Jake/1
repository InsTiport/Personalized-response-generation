  JAKE HERBERT:  I was hearing from the Michigan section, "Come on Tyrel.  Go Michigan.  Go Blue."  You have to block everything out when you're out there wrestling.  I heard a commotion. 

 Q.  Speaking of those finals, Jake, Varner said you faced off three times in freestyle and he came out on top twice.  What can you take from those matches, your win and two losses, into this match, or are they two separate things? 
 JAKE HERBERT: It's two separate things and they are the same thing.  If you have two wins over the match and that upsets me and fuels me to get going and get some revenge here.  It's freestyle.  It doesn't matter what happened before. 

 Q.  How much if any confidence does it give you knowing you've been on this stage before in the title match and he is a freshman? 
 JAKE HERBERT: Some people will let that get to them, but Jake looks like he's got it all together.  He is a good kid.  He works hard.  He's got a great coach.  It's just another wrestling match.  If you can block everything out, it doesn't matter.  All that matters is he gets the hand.  It doesn't where it's at or what happens.  You both have wrestling shoes on and you're both on the mat. 

 Q.  Have you and Ryan talked about if you guys win tomorrow night what that will do to this program? 
 JAKE HERBERT: We've been talking since freshman year what it will do to the program.  Just cause it took us two years to get going and now we are both defeated in the national finals and we're one match away from reaching our goal.  It just seems like it took a little longer than we needed.
