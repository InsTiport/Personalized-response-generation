  THE MODERATOR:   We have Quentin Wright.   Questions, please. 

Q.   You and Steve grew up wrestling together.   What do you think about getting him in the final? 
QUENTIN WRIGHT:   Next opponent, I guess.   Yeah, I mean, I'm really happy for him.   We worked hard growing up.   We were kind of like rival school workout partners on Sunday.   He wrestled a weight below me. 
But, yeah, I'm excited that he's doing real well.   We get a chance to wrestle each other tomorrow. 

Q.   Was your outcome at the Big Ten almost perfect timing for this, gave you more of an edge in the NCAAs? 
QUENTIN WRIGHT:   I don't know if it gave me more of an edge.   But it's wrestling.   Yeah, sometimes things don't work out the way you planned.   Sometimes you make mistakes training‑wise, in a match or... 
Just learn from it and keep moving on, don't make them again. 
I made a few mistakes at the Big Ten that I didn't repeat come Nationals.   Here I am. 

Q.   Ever since you were a kid, you wrestle like you enjoy the sport.   Is that something that helps you when you get to the big events with the pressure? 
QUENTIN WRIGHT:   It's just all training, preparing the whole year.   I might not have had the best year.   Didn't go undefeated, all the perfect things you want.   But life's not perfect.   You just got to keep waking up the next day and have a positive attitude. 
I learned a lot about myself last year.   Just using those lessons, the lessons from Coach Cael that he preaches every day in practice to us.   Just go out there and enjoy it, have fun, take risks.   Wrestling is fun.   Keeping that positive attitude really keeps us going. 

Q.   You went 5‑5 today in the semifinals.   What does that say about the depth of your team?
QUENTIN WRIGHT:   I mean, it's really good.   I think we didn't just go 5‑5, we dominated most of those matches. 
It just speaks a lot with our coaching staff, how they're training us, how they're preparing us, 'cause it's producing results at the end when it counts. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
QUENTIN WRIGHT:   It's not a game plan that he really discusses with us.   He puts us first as a team, what's best for the team, what's the best lineup for the team.   All those things about putting the team‑‑ making sure we have the team mentality, not 'I' and 'me.'   Looking at the National Duels, he has his own opinion on it.   We didn't wrestle in it.   He's looking out for us.   That's what he wanted us to do.   He didn't want us to do it. 

Q.   Do you remember the last time you and Steve worked out together or hung out or even talked? 
QUENTIN WRIGHT:   We used to workout in the wrestling club when we were in high school.   That was about it.   We wrestled each other every Sunday preparing for the state tournament.   I know he was at 160, I was at 170.   He was a weight below me. 
Other than that, we were just really good workout partners.   We started wrestling together back when we were younger at state college elementary program.   It's awesome to see one of your buddies come up and just be succeeding. 

Q.   What do you think the anticipation will be like between you and Steve? 
QUENTIN WRIGHT:   I think all of the county is going to be really watching this match because it's local guys.   They're two local guys and they want to see them, they want to watch them wrestle. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
QUENTIN WRIGHT:   Not really dÃ©jÃ  vu.   It's a national tournament.   It's just your next opponent. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thanks, Quentin. 
QUENTIN WRIGHT:   Thank you.
