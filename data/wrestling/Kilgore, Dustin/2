  THE MODERATOR:   We now have with us Dustin Kilgore.   
   
 Q.   Returning national champ, do you think you guys have been overshadowed a little bit?   
DUSTIN KILGORE:   No, not at all.   You're in it for yourself.   It builds character, makes you a very independent human being, and you know, All‑Around makes you a tough person.   I'm not looking for the publicity.   I'm just out there wrestling and it's all for me.   
   
 Q.   Quentin Wright, as long as we've seen wrestling, he's locking up, not afraid to go for the big one.   Anything you're going to adjust in your style?   
DUSTIN KILGORE:   I've thought about it and I'm going to basically do‑‑ wrestle how I did when I wrestled against (Indiscernible).   We wrestled quite a few times.   I trained with him over the summer.   I knew he had the same style as Quentin, he can throw him, goes for the double‑under.   He likes the back points and I'm going to stay low and try not to reach too much, be aggressive, in his face.   
THE MODERATOR:   Dustin, good luck tomorrow.   
DUSTIN KILGORE:   Thank you.
