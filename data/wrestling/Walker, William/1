   THE MODERATOR:  Colonel Walker, the chair of the Division I Wrestling Committee is here, and he's going to make a statement about the protest. 
 COLONEL WALKER: I just want to give you the resolution of the protest that Rider had in their match against Northwestern.  Rider protested three things in two categories.  First, they protested that a takedown that was not awarded midway through the third period should have been awarded for their wrestler, Fish.  Then they protested that Lang takedown on at the end of the match should not have been awarded because there was not control game beyond reaction time. 
 Neither of those protests are actually protestable incidents.  By rule those are judgment calls.  Takedowns are judgments calls and not protestable.  The other thing they protested was the last takedown against Lang was after the time had expired in the third period.  We reviewed that using video, and it was clear from video evidence that the takedown was in fact awarded before the end of regulation, so that protest was not allowed either.  As a result, the match stands as is and Lang is awarded the win.
