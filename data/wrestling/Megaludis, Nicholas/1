  THE MODERATOR:   We have Nicholas Megaludis advancing Saturday to take on Matt McDonough. 
Open it up for questions. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICHOLAS MEGALUDIS:   Sloppy match.   He's real good at keeping it close.   I only scored three points.   Can't be happy with that. 
Look forward to tomorrow and try to score a lot more. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICHOLAS MEGALUDIS:   I guess every point in a match like that is critical.   Everything matters.   Every second of the match matters. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICHOLAS MEGALUDIS:   Obviously he's pretty good.   But I'm excited.   He's going to wrestle hard for seven minutes.   I'm going to wrestle hard for seven minutes.   He's on a mission.   I'm on a mission, too.   It's going to be a fight. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICHOLAS MEGALUDIS:   To be honest, got a little bit hurt last week, took a couple days off.   I think it really refreshed me, my mind, everything. 
I feel fresh right now.   I was so excited to wrestle.   So anxious to wrestle after being off for a couple days. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICHOLAS MEGALUDIS:   Yeah, definitely affected it.   I didn't come here to be an All‑American.   I came here to be a national champ.   That's what coach when he recruited me a couple years ago, when I was going to wrestle as a true freshman, he texted me 2012 NCAA champ.   I had this in my mind since. 

Q.   Do you remember when he sent you that?
NICHOLAS MEGALUDIS:   When I lost to Sanders my second match of the year. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICHOLAS MEGALUDIS:   Yeah, definitely.   But he's different.   He's really strong.   He may be tired, but he's good at backing up and then shooting.   Every time he's about to be called, he takes a shot. 
He's a smart wrestler, very smart wrestler. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICHOLAS MEGALUDIS:   Yeah, definitely.   It's great that I have those losses.   I don't like losing.   Every time I lost, I worked on something.   Just made me that much more anxious to compete. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICHOLAS MEGALUDIS:   It's the most fun time of the year.   I'm the underdog.   These guys are all the big dogs.   I mean, of course, I'm a huge underdog tomorrow.   There's very few people that think I'm going to win.   You got to be having fun. 

Q.   Does the team's success help you individually when you go out there in this kind of pressure?
NICHOLAS MEGALUDIS:   Uh‑huh, definitely.   You got Taylor, Ruth, Wright, all those guys.   I really hope they get that this year.   It's just awesome looking up to them.   They're twice as good as me.   It's awesome to learn from them. 

Q.   Have you looked in the mirror lately, if so, what do you say about that?   Do you expect that? 
NICHOLAS MEGALUDIS:   I definitely expect it.   (Indiscernible) gave me the worst black eye I ever had.   It will probably be worse around 8:30 or whenever I wrestle. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICHOLAS MEGALUDIS:   It's good.   One match at a time, you know.   Four down, one to go.   The fans are awesome.   I just got to get out and perform, just have fun tomorrow.   I have nothing to lose.   He has nothing to lose either.   But that's why it's going to be a fight. 

Q.   You talked about being injured last week that kept you out for a couple days.   Would you care to elaborate on what the injury was? 
NICHOLAS MEGALUDIS:   It was just something small, you know.   I'm fine now.   It's all good. 

Q.   You don't want to elaborate on what that was?
NICHOLAS MEGALUDIS:   No.   Sorry. 

Q.   You're obviously going to be facing somebody from Iowa tomorrow.   The points might be out of reach before we get there, but how important is it for you to set the stage tomorrow against a team that's relatively close to you in score?
NICHOLAS MEGALUDIS:   Well, to be honest, when I was young, my coach from Iowa, Jodie Stritmatter.   To be honest, I loved their style, loved how they wrestled.   Now I got to hate 'em. 
I mean, I'm not disrespecting them at all.   They're tough wrestlers.   But it's business now.   It means a lot to the team to go tomorrow and wrestle.
