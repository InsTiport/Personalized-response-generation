  Q.  What did you learn from that experience last year?   
 JOSH GLENN:  I learned what I need to work on more.  I need to work a lot more on my feet and being aggressive toward the end of the match.  When you lose like that it keeps you hungry for the next year around, so I wasn't going to let the same thing happen again.   
  
  Q.  Josh, you've changed weight classes this year.  Do you feel you're stronger and you wrestle better at this division and that's one of the reasons why you haven't had a chance to win that first NCAA title for your college?   
 JOSH GLENN: Our program is based on what he believes in and most of the guys on our team we try to stay strong and solid, last year I was last year as an 84 pounder.   
  
  Q.  At the Midland summer finals, I believe the only time you faced Jake Varner this year, he caught you in a move late in the third period.  What are you going to take from that much into this title match?   
 JOSH GLENN: It's going to be a fun match.  He is the only person I've lost to this year, so I'm looking at having another shot and it's going to be a great match.
