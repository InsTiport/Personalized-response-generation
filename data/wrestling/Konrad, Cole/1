   COLE KONRAD: It's definitely on your mind.  I sat on the edge warming up, watching the whole time.  It makes a difference.  We're a close group of guys.  It's tough to watch them lose, especially when you see how hard they work.  It plays a role in how I wrestle, too, but not that much. 

 Q.  Cole, talk about this last match, 2-1 victory.  What does Waterson do that he was able to keep it closer than some of the guys have this year? 
 COLE KONRAD:  Nothing.  Made sure I didn't score.  That's all he did.  He blocked a lot.  He took a couple of shots, but they didn't have any heart behind them.  That's what they did.  I did what I had to do to win.  That's all you have to do in these matches.  Winning a national title is a national title.  I don't care what the score was.  That was my mentality going into it.  I didn't want to make any dumb mistakes.  He if do make a mistake he gets a takedown, then what do I do, force it.  And then they decide the match for you.  I'm going play smart.  If I can ride him, I'm going to ride him, and I did. 

 Q.  Would you expect Anspach to wrestle you any different tomorrow night than what he did? 
 COLE KONRAD:  I hope so.  It actually depends.  He backed up a lot.  He's not giving him a chance to win.  I'm expecting that's how he'll wrestle.  It's going to be a battle.  I don't care what it was last time.  It's a national final.  They'll be going all out.
