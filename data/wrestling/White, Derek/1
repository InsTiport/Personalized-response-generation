THE MODERATOR: Congratulations, Derek, hard-fought victory, talk about the overtime win there?   
DEREK WHITE: I wasn't expecting it to go into overtime, but that's just the way it went.  But, yeah, hard fought.   
 Q.  Hard fought is pretty much the way you would describe your career, wouldn't it be?  I would like you to talk about how much have you built and learned from your past to help you have this moment right now?  
DEREK WHITE: I've learned a lot, you know, going to Nebraska for two years, transferring to Oklahoma State.  It's been a long journey, but just had to overcome some challenges in life, and, you know, finally made it to where I wanted to be.   
 Q.  Derek, are you pleased with the way you're wrestling this week?  You're getting the Ws.  You're getting the opportunity to face really excellent wrestlers on the big stage.  What kind of match are you looking to show tomorrow in the finals of the NCAA Tournament?  
DEREK WHITE: A lot of them haven't been very pretty this weekend, but, you know, I've been pulling through and pulling them out.  So that's all that really matters.  Tomorrow night I hope to go out there and put on a show.  But, you know, looks like I'll be getting a rematch with Anthony.  So looking forward to it.   
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Derek.
