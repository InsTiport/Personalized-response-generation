  THE MODERATOR:   To my left is Kendric Maple of Oklahoma, 30‑0 this year, red shirt junior, No. 2 seed.   And could you tell us about that match that put you in the finals? 
KENDRIC MAPLE:   Not quite the match I wanted, but to get it done no matter how it happens.   It will be all different tomorrow. 

Q.   Going through the tournament, did you expect to be the No. 1 seed?   Were you upset that you were not? 
KENDRIC MAPLE:   Seeds don't matter much to me.   If anything, it fueled me.   I feel like I want to be the best and I am the best, so just kind of fuel on the fire. 

Q.   Do you have a history with the guy you're going to wrestle in the finals? 
KENDRIC MAPLE:   We wrestled in Midland this year, pretty tough match, and I think it was 11‑7 or something. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KENDRIC MAPLE:   He's going to come out battling.   He's a great kid. 
He's hard‑nosed, and I've got to be the same. 

Q.   You're the only big name right now that Oklahoma hasn't red shirted.   Has it been tough wrestling for the Sooners knowing that all of these guys are waiting for next year? 
KENDRIC MAPLE:   Never tough wrestling for the Sooners and with family and friends, and Coach expects us to do well next year, and we will. 
THE MODERATOR:   Good luck in the finals.
