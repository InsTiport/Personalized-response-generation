The Texas Bowl is an annual postseason NCAA-sanctioned Division I FBS college football bowl game first held in 2006 in Houston, Texas. Each edition of the bowl has been played at NRG Stadium, previously known as Reliant Stadium. The bowl replaced the defunct Houston Bowl, which was played annually from 2000 to 2005, and before that the Bluebonnet Bowl, the first bowl game in Houston, played from 1959 through 1987.
Beginning with the 2020 edition, the bowl is sponsored by Mercari, a Japanese e-commerce company, and is officially known as the Mercari Texas Bowl. The game was previously sponsored by Academy Sports + Outdoors from 2017 to 2019 when it was known as the Academy Sports + Outdoors Texas Bowl, AdvoCare from 2014 to 2016 when it was known as the AdvoCare V100 Texas Bowl, and Meineke Car Care from 2011 to 2012 when it was known as the Meineke Car Care Bowl of Texas.
The 2020 edition, slated for December 31 between TCU and Arkansas, was cancelled on December 29 due to COVID-19 issues within the TCU program.
