The Big 12 Championship Game is a college football game held by the Big 12 Conference between the best and the second best Big 12 team. The game was played each year since the conference's formation in 1996 until 2010 and returned during the 2017 season. From 1996 to 2010, the championship game pitted the Big 12 North Division champion against the South Division champion in a game held after the regular season was completed. From 2017 onward, the game features the two teams with the best conference records.
In the first eight Big 12 championship games, from 1996 to 2003, the divisions split four games each, with the north champion winning in every odd-numbered year and the south champion winning in every even-numbered year. However, the North division champion did not win after #13 Kansas State's 35â€“7 upset victory over #1 Oklahoma in 2003.
The game will be played at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas until at least 2021.
