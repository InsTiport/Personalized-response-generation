The ACC Championship Game is an annual American college football game held in early December by the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) each year to determine its football champion. The game pits the champion of the Coastal Division against the champion of the Atlantic Division in a game that follows the conclusion of the regular season. The current champions are the Clemson Tigers of the Atlantic Division.
The Atlantic Division has been represented by either Clemson or Florida State in twelve of fifteen years through 2019, including eleven straight from 2009 to 2019, and five straight by Clemson from 2015 to 2019. The Coastal Division was represented by either Georgia Tech or Virginia Tech for the first eight games from 2005 to 2012, but from 2013 to 2019 all seven Coastal teams each represented the division after Virginia won in 2019. Louisville, North Carolina State, and Syracuse have not won the Atlantic Division. Clemson in 2018 became the first team to win four consecutive ACC Championship Games, on the heels of FSU winning three straight.
The Atlantic Division winners have gone on to win the ACC Championship Game for nine consecutive years as of 2019 and are 11â€“4 in the game overall. The Coastal teams won four consecutive years from 2007 to 2010 but have not won since.
For the 2020 season, Notre Dame is joining the ACC for conference play in football due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the ACC has decided to use a division-less format for the game.  Instead of representatives from two divisions, the two teams with the best conference records from a ten game conference schedule will earn a spot in the game.The ACC Championship Game is held at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina each year, after being held in Florida (Jacksonville and Tampa) for its first five years. It is to remain a permanent fixture in Charlotte through at least 2030. The game's corporate sponsor was Dr Pepper from 2005 through the 2018 game.
