"Holiday" is a song by American rock band Green Day. It was released as the third single from the group's seventh studio album American Idiot, and is also the third track. The song is in the key of F minor. Though the song is a prelude to "Boulevard of Broken Dreams", "Holiday" was released as a single later on, in the spring of 2005.
The song achieved considerable popularity across the world and performed moderately well on the charts. In the US, it reached number nineteen on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks and Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks charts. It debuted at number eleven in the United Kingdom and reached the top twenty in Denmark, Ireland, New Zealand and Norway.
The song has appeared in various media, including the 2006 comedy film Accepted and an episode of CSI: NY. It was also used as the goal song of the Vancouver Canucks during their run to the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals; the Canucks also reused it for Henrik Sedin's personal goal song in 2016–17 and for the team as a whole during the 2018–19 NHL season. "Holiday" was also featured in the soundtrack of the video game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland.
