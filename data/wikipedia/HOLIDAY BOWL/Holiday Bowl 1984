The 1984 Holiday Bowl was one of the games that determined the national championship in college football for the 1984 season.  Played on December 21 at Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego, it pitted the top-ranked BYU Cougars against the unranked Michigan Wolverines. Despite six turnovers and down by seven in the fourth quarter, BYU rallied and won the game, 24â€“17; the attendance of 61,248 on Friday night was a record for Jack Murphy Stadium at that time.
