The Pac-12 Football Championship Game is an annual college football game held by the Pac-12 Conference to determine the season's conference champion. The game pits the champion of the North Division against the champion of the South Division. The inaugural game was held during the 2011 season.The game is scheduled to be played in Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada through 2022. In 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the game will be hosted at the home stadium of the division winner with the better conference record, which is the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. From 2014 to 2019, the game was played at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. The first three editions were also held at the home stadium of the division winner with the better conference record: Autzen Stadium in 2011, Stanford Stadium in 2012, and Sun Devil Stadium in 2013. The game is usually held on the first Friday following the conclusion of the regular season.
The winner of the game is awarded the Pac-12 Conference's automatic berth in the Rose Bowl Game, unless the team is selected to play in the College Football Playoff (CFP), or in seasons where the Rose Bowl hosts a CFP semifinal.
Television broadcast rights to the game are shared by Fox Sports in even years and ESPN in most odd years, with ESPN carrying the 2019 edition over-the-air on ABC. ESPN Radio holds the radio rights.
