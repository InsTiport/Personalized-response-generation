The Holiday Bowl is a post-season NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision college football bowl game that has been played annually since 1978. San Diego County Credit Union has been the game's title sponsor since 2017, and the bowl has been officially known as the San Diego County Credit Union Holiday Bowl.
On October 22, 2020, organizers cancelled the 2020 edition of the bowl, citing complications from the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.  Had the game been played, there was some talk of moving the game to either the University of San Diego, San Diego Mesa College, or to Southwestern College.  There are still plans to play the game in 2021; however, since SDCCU Stadium (which had been the site of every edition of this game) is being demolished in favor of Aztec Stadium, the venue for that year's game is unclear.  Petco Park, the city's only other large-scale outdoor venue, was built for baseball and would have to be reconfigured to accommodate a football field.  Officials have ruled out Dignity Health Sports Park, which is the temporary home of the San Diego State football program for the 2020 and 2021 seasons. Aztec Stadium will host the Holiday Bowl effective with its opening in 2022.
