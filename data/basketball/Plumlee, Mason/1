Q.   What's the prospect as far as the contest? 
MASON PLUMLEE:   The prospect?   I think it will be fun.   I think you got a good group.   Oladipo is very athletic.   So is Giannis.   I think it's a good group of guys. 

Q.   Do you have any message to the Japanese fans? 
MASON PLUMLEE:   Thanks for the support.   We love our fans all over the world.   I hope to visit Japan some day.   Maybe there will be an NBA game there someday, who knows. 

Q.   What is it like to be involved in this in front of your home crowd? 
MASON PLUMLEE:   It's a lot of fun.   I'm very excited to be a part of the weekend in any capacity.   But to play Friday night and then do the dunk contest Saturday is going to be special. 

Q.   What about the dunk competition that you're most looking forward to? 
MASON PLUMLEE:   Really what the other guys are going to do.   It's a competition, but I think there's some great athletes.   So I think it's going to be one of the better dunk contests in recent years. 

Q.   I'm sure you don't want to give away any secrets.   Do you have anything planned you're willing to tell the public? 
MASON PLUMLEE:   No.
