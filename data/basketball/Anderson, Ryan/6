  RYAN ANDERSON:   It depends on how much the crowd is going to be rooting for me.   Honestly, I think it'll be a little bit more at ease.   I'm shooting in front of people that I have for three years now, and it'll be fun.   It's exciting.   Obviously, yeah, it's different because I've never been in it, I've never done it before, and I'm sure it'll be a lot different than I think or expect.   But as long as we have fun with it, that's all that really matters.   That's what it's about. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RYAN ANDERSON:   Yeah, shot straight from the hip, and then I moved up to the shoulder. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RYAN ANDERSON:   No, I wouldn't survive a second in this competition still shooting from the hip. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RYAN ANDERSON:   I think it's about developing strengths.   Obviously through high school is when you develop the most, and my shot really developed in my jump from junior high to high school.   That's kind of when I went from the hip shot to the shoulder shot to my shot the way it is now.   But everything is such a better‑‑ I'm a more consistent shooter the moment I shot from the shoulder, a lot more accurate.
