 Q.   Could you start with an opening statement, feelings about being drafted by Philadelphia?   
TORNIKE SHENGELIA:   I'm just glad.   I'm just very excited to be drafted by Philadelphia.   I would be excited with any other team, too, but I know‑‑ I don't know much about Philadelphia.   I know about the team but not about the city.   
The only one thing I can say is I'm really glad to get drafted by the Philadelphia 76erseses.   
   
 Q.   Philadelphia was one game away from reaching the Eastern Conference Finals, and so they are a young team on the upswing.   How are you looking forward to contribute to their continued success?   
TORNIKE SHENGELIA:   I would bring a lot of energy on the court.   I can be a role player, too.   I can score a basket.   I can play on defense.   So I would do everything I can.   It's my type of play.   
   
 Q.   Did you work out for the 76ers or go meet them or anything?  
TORNIKE SHENGELIA:   No, I didn't work out.   
   
 Q.   Had you had any discussions or talked to people?   
TORNIKE SHENGELIA:   No, nothing.   Probably they saw me in camp, I don't know, I'm not sure, but I did not have a discussion with them.  
   
 Q.   There are reports you've been traded to the Brooklyn Nets; if that becomes a fact, do you know anything about Brooklyn, New York, the team and how you might fit in in that situation?   
TORNIKE SHENGELIA:   Brooklyn?   I know about the team.   They are a young team, too.   I don't know much about the city because this is my first time in the States.   So not much.   
   
 Q.   Is there any player in the NBA you would compare yourself to, anybody that you kind of see yourself in or becoming in your career?   
TORNIKE SHENGELIA:   I would say more like Ginobili, like to penetrate.   I have to work on my shot.
