THE MODERATOR:   We're joined by Colorado State.   Coach, if you could make a few remarks about the game.   
COACH EUSTACHY:   Well, you know, I thought we were the tougher team for 38 minutes.   Unfortunately, it's a 40‑minute game.   Give Utah State all the credit.   
We just couldn't make the plays down the stretch, and they certainly did.   So they deserved to win.   
THE MODERATOR:   We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.   
   
 Q.   Jon, what really happened there down the stretch, especially the final minute?   
JON OCTEUS:   I'm not even sure.   They capitalized on a lot of mistakes.   We left them open at the three‑point line, they hit it I think three possessions in a row.   
Knocked down the free throws.   We didn't.   Took care of the ball.   We didn't.   The last two minutes of the game, we just didn't show up.   
   
 Q.   What about Dwight, what he did?  
JON OCTEUS:   Dwight just showed everybody that was watching what he's going to bring to the table next year.   He's been battling injuries all season.   It was nice to see him out there having fun, playing how we know he can play.   
   
 Q.   Dwight, did you see what happened with Daniel there at the end?   
DWIGHT SMITH:   I didn't see the situation.   I didn't.   Just had to keep our heads in a situation like that.   Game's too important.   
I didn't see it.   
   
 Q.   Was there a point in the game where you felt you had won?  
DWIGHT SMITH:   We got too comfortable.   Mental errors, just let up.   Coach told us it would be another game the last two minutes because they make shots.   They did exactly what he said.   
   
 Q.   Dwight, your first start of the season, talk about your play offensively.   Is it tough to reflect on that right now?   
DWIGHT SMITH:   Yeah, I just wanted to win the game.   Doesn't even matter at this point.   Doesn't even matter.   
COACH EUSTACHY:   You got to give these guys credit.   They played their hearts out.   I don't know if this is against protocol or not.   I seem to break it all the time.   
But these guys played their hearts out.   Just one of the most unusual, uncanny chain of events that I've coached in 20‑some‑odd years as a head coach.   
They have nothing to be ashamed of.   Stew told me after the game they got lucky.   The word 'lucky' is a little bit of that but a lot of great plays by them.   
But these two guys next to me have nothing to be ashamed of.   They played their hearts of.   I've never been prouder of a group.   
So I get fined for that or it's okay to speak out of turn?   
THE MODERATOR:   It's okay, coach.   
We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time and continue with questions for coach.   
   
 Q.   What was the explanation from any of the officials on the technical?   
COACH EUSTACHY:   They said that Daniel said something to one of the players and they warned him, then he said something to another player.   He put him in a situation that they had to call a technical.   
   
 Q.   At that point what do you say to Daniel to keep him up?  
COACH EUSTACHY:   Well, after that I was thinking about putting Carlton in for him because he was somewhat devastated.   
But what I told him after the game, it's a great learning experience, you know.   That's why we try to put our players in tough situations in practice so those things don't happen.   
But it happened.   The only thing you can do is learn, as I continue to learn as a coach.   You can learn as a player.   You know, it's a tough learning experience for him, so...   
I just, you know, told him we needed to keep playing, we can still win this game.   
   
 Q.   What did Marcus Holt show you today, especially against Shaw?  
COACH EUSTACHY:   Marcus was the reason why we had the lead.   Him and Dwight, you know, that's what we haven't had all year.   We just hadn't had that.   They've had opportunities, but they've struggled when given opportunities.   
They really stepped up.   Marcus stepped up today and was a factor around the basket.   I don't know how many blocks he had, but he changed shots also.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you very much, coach.
