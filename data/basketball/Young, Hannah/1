DENNIS WOLFF:   You know, I just told the ladies in the locker room, they gave all of us and everybody that follows our program a week to remember.   I don't think anybody thought we would be sitting here on Friday night.   We knew going in it was going to be a challenge.   I felt all along that Florida State is a Final Four‑type team.   They're tremendously well coached, they have depth.   So even if we hadn't played two days prior, it would have been a tough task for us.   
So they did a good job of taking away what we were trying to do, and we had a hard time guarding them.   Our hats off to them.   
In regard to my team, I'm really happy to be their coach, and they gave us a great week.   
   
 Q.   Obviously your third game in three days.   They were well rested.   Just how much gas in the tank, what kind of lead did you have in this game today?  
DENNIS WOLFF:   You know, we didn't have the same amount of gas we had the other two nights, but I don't want to use any of that as any way to take away from what Florida State did.   We would have to be on point to the nth degree to be able to put ourselves in position to beat them.   I think that the combination of how good they are and our having played led to a game like this.   
But again, they're very unselfish.   There's nothing about them not to like.   I'm sure Sue will come in here and say she wishes she shot free throws better, but other than that, they're big, deep, smart, and they did a good job of wearing us down.   
We don't have a tremendous amount of depth, and we had some ladies that played a lot of minutes the two prior nights.   Normally you get a little bit of rest, but you don't have that ability during this week.   
VANESSA PANOUSIS:   I mean, yeah, except like Coach said, you can't really say that as an excuse.   
   
 Q.   What did they do on the defensive end to make it such a bad shooting night?   
DENNIS WOLFF:   Well, I think they have great size, so they did a real good job of closing out on our shooters.   We started the game and had some opportunities inside that we didn't take advantage of where we missed a couple lay‑ups and we fumbled the ball, and that then put a little more pressure on us to be even better on the perimeter.   
You know, we were trying to tell the ladies as the game went on that we needed to be in not quite a rush on the perimeter when they were closing out, try to lift them up and take a dribble.   In the heat of battle after what we've been through, it's a little easier said than done.   
   
 Q.   Coach mentioned the three games you played here.   Can you talk about what this experience has done for you as a player and how this will help you and the team going forward?   
VANESSA PANOUSIS:   I think this experience has been great.   You know, we've had three tough games, and the first two, it was really pleasing to see that we could actually come up with the win.   
You know, we've had a few losses throughout the season, and to actually pull out those wins was really uplifting for the team.   
   
 Q.   You guys have played really good defense the last two nights.   What about Florida State's offense posed a lot of challenges for you tonight?   
VANESSA PANOUSIS:   I think they have really good range throughout the team.   You know, their guards are really good with the ball, and their interior play is great.   It was just tough to guard both outside and inside.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk about Kelsey's impact on both of you as individuals and the team and the program?   
VANESSA PANOUSIS:   Kelsey, she's great.   You know, she's so positive within the team.   She's the glue to our team.   She keeps us together, always positive, and she's a great leader, as well.   I think when you have those characteristics as a person, you can't really go wrong.   
HANNAH YOUNG:   What she said.   I'm going to miss her, that's for sure.   
   
 Q.   The players, in terms of the tough shooting night, did you feel‑‑ was it hard to get good looks?   What was the effect of the Florida State defense as shooters today?   
VANESSA PANOUSIS:   I think it was a bit difficult as Coach said how their defensive pressure kind of sped you up, so it was kind of difficult to try and slow down with your shot and to make a play for somebody else.   
DENNIS WOLFF:   They did a good job of pressuring Vanessa and Hannah and some of the people, and it was a little bit harder to catch the ball than it had been the prior two nights, and that's going to put a little bit more pressure on us in general.   
   
 Q.   Coach, what are you going to take away from that tournament and for your team moving forward into next season?  
DENNIS WOLFF:   Well, you know, I return everybody but Kelsey and Regan will be back healthy and we've had a good recruiting class.   I don't think by talking about it you can duplicate the kind of experience we've had, and now we've had some players that have lived through two days of success in the ACC Tournament, which is not something that's happened to Virginia Tech teams in the past.   So what we can take out of it is that if we stay the course and we keep battling as a team and working on the things we try to talk to them and work on and try to recruit to the level of the other teams in the league that maybe we can put ourselves in a position to be back here.   
   
 Q.   Dennis, the first meeting you held them to 59 points.   Their star center had a concussion and didn't play in that game, but anything else to kind of explain how they were much more productive than in Blacksburg?  
DENNIS WOLFF:   You know, again, I think they made a much more concentrated effort in this game to get the ball inside, so I think that their size was a big factor right from the beginning in the game.   
   
 Q.   The fact that you did win a couple games this week, is that something you can‑‑ do you feel the team can build on?   Is that something to give you some encouragement in the off‑season?   What can this week do for you guys going forward?   
VANESSA PANOUSIS:   Yeah, of course.   I think it's a great bonus for us to have 11 players coming back.   I think throughout the spring season, we're all going to work hard, try to get better, and then come back stronger for next season.   
HANNAH YOUNG:   I think we've had a rough season, and I think winning these past few games has almost like set a bar for us almost in what we can do, and I think if we work like what Vanessa said in the spring, we can reach this goal again or maybe even go further.   
DENNIS WOLFF:   I think there's some kids in the league, Kiesel last night is a player for everybody to emulate.   I heard her answer the questions and she worked really hard in the off‑season and came back and had a great year.   It's the only way it happens for any team, and I think now we've seen with the pieces we have and if we add a few more pieces that there's a possibility for some success, and hopefully that will spur everybody to work.
