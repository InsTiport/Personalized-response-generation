<p>	Q.  For those of us who haven't watched you game in and game out, how many teams this year have really tried to run against you?  What have you seen from Michigan State on film?  What do you expect from them as far as the running game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Sean, I understand since the tournament started, you've had the 1976 championship game tape in your bag.  You vow to watch it if you made it to the Final Four.  Have you watched it yet? </p>
<p>	Q.  If you could talk about what you've seen in terms of Roy's mood these last couple of days?  Has he seemed relaxed, uptight, anxious to get this thing going? </p>

<p>	Q.  What would it mean to each of you to win a championship for Coach Williams, who has been here obviously before, has had a lot of close calls, but never won one as a head coach? </p>

<p>	Q.  Talk about the importance of being experienced, juniors and seniors, and if Jawad could give us a feeling on how you're feeling?</p>

<p>	Q.  A lot of attention this week has been paid to the outstanding three-point shooters that have performed so well throughout the tournament.  This week as a post player, is there anything you can do or plan to do to sort of put the emphasis back on the paint? </p>
<p>	Q.  Sean, is it going to be strange to play against Doug Wojcik? </p>
<p>	Q.  Sean, over the years, how many stories have you heard from your dad and brother about getting to the Final Four?  What advice, if any, have both of them given to you now? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned that the game of basketball has changed quite a bit since that film that you have in your back.  It looks like tomorrow night is a little bit of a throw back situation in the low post, two big guys going at each other.  Have you studied some of these big-man match-ups of the past, watched them?  How do you see tomorrow night's match-up? </p>
<p>	Q.  Sean, it seems like you developed quite an affinity for Coach Williams over your time there.  What word would you use to describe when you've heard the number of questions he's gotten about never having won a national championship, how does it feel not to win a national championship?  What word or words go through your mind when you hear those questions? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned your knowledge of the history of college basketball, especially big men.  Is there someone you like to pattern your game after?  Your double-doubles, is it your size and strength that has allowed you to do that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Paul Davis, the way he's brought his game up the last couple weeks, what challenge you have against him. </p>
<p>	Q.  Now that North Carolina is back in the Final Four for the first time in a couple years, how much pressure are you feeling to finish the job? </p>

<p>	Q.  Jawad, how do you see this game?  What do you think are the most important elements of it? </p>

<p>	Q.  Roy, Tom Izzo said he learned a lot about pushing the team up the floor from your days at Kansas.  How much did you actually help him?  What do you see from this team as far as that for tomorrow night? </p>
<p>	Q.  Have you changed your approach or routine for the team in this trip to the Final Four than some of your previous trips with your Kansas teams? </p>
<p>	Q.  You had a couple of narrow escapes last week.  Has that been official or did you see stuff that you were concerned with going into this weekend? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have a set philosophy if you've got the ball at the end of a game, if the clock is running down, to call timeout or let things go?  When there is a timeout, it's a last possession, either offense or defense, how much of it is kind of a guessing game, chess match? </p>
<p>	Q.  Rick Pitino and Tom Izzo have talked about savoring this Final Four more than they did the other ones.  I'm wondering how you are approaching this compared to the other ones? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did your Athens experience help you as a coach? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you got to North Carolina, some of the guys, can you talk a little bit about their mentality and also the steps, especially guys like Jawad, Melvin, Jackie have taken to get from 8-20 to now at the Final Four? </p>
<p>	Q.  Following up on the Rick Pitino question, he looks more relaxed.  Is it going to be fun for you this week or is there just too much pressure, too much involved? </p>
<p>	Q.  Perhaps because his father played on a national championship team, does Sean May seem motivated to you in different ways than other players you have? </p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of three-point shots in the regional finals last week.  As the games get tighter, tougher, more meaningful, do we see three-point shots go up?  What's going on with that?  Do you expect to shoot more here? </p>
<p>	Q.  Have you spit in the river yet?  If not, anything else superstitious you'll do? </p>
<p>	Q.  Considering Marvin's chances for the NBA and stuff, do you look at him as whatever time you guys have with him is a bonus almost because of what he does have ahead of him? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you put a value on having a junior/senior team at that stage? </p>
<p>	Q.  Basically you went home two years ago.  After two years with this team, back in the program, do you feel more comfortable now?  Do you feel more at home? </p>
