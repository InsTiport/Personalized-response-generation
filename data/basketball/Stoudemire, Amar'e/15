<p>	Q.  How much was this you guys just getting back to doing what you did all year, but playing a little tougher in the stretch?</p>
<p>	Q.  You are not known as a defensive player, but you made two defensive plays down the stretch on Duncan.  Talk about that?</p>
<p>	Q.  You were everywhere, making blocks, securing offensive rebounds, scoring.  Was that just about survival, basically keeping the series alive?</p>
<p>	Q.  One of your coaches suggested that maybe you had heard some of the criticism and you were aware of it coming into tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just getting the win here and extending this one more game kind of serves as vindication of what you did all season?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just in terms of your defense on Tim Duncan.  Having Joe Johnson there to help double team, how much did that make a difference for you compared to earlier in the series?</p>
<p>	Q.  Because Tim was missing so many free throws, do you feel that took away from his aggressiveness on the offensive ends because he wasn't in any rhythm?</p>
<p>	Q.  You had a long week with these guys.  You come out and play pretty well in the first half and then Manu hits you with that shot at the end.  What are you thinking at that point?</p>
<p>	Q.  What are some of those differences that you all did that you all hadn't done earlier?</p>
<p>	Q.  What is it like to watch Amare (Stoudemire) make all those great plays down the stretch final two minutes?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much was it the entire game of you guys just returning to what basically you played throughout the season but playing maybe a little tougher, a little more physical?</p>
<p>	Q.  Your point numbers weren't as high as they have been the first couple games.  But your assists were back where they belonged.  Talk about that?</p>
