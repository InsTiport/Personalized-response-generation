  Q. Talk about your game.  
 AMAR'E STOUDEMIRE: My game is based on versatility. So I like to be able to placed where I can be effective in different positions, different spots on the court.   
 That's how I train. I train for every position.  
  
  Q. I saw where you wanted to go maybe after pick and roll or whatever, to a spot you were used to, and then Shaq was already there.   
 AMAR'E STOUDEMIRE: Shaq is phenomenal. Shaq is a guy who is used to playing in the post. You don't want to roll into him. You don't want to take his space up. My jump shot is not bad. So we are able to work with that. That's still not the reason why we are losing.   
  
  Q. How does it feel if this is your last home game on this court?   
 AMAR'E STOUDEMIRE: I tell you what, if my last home game is the All-Star starter here, that will be a great way to go out. I turn every negative into a positive. I just keep my head up. Got to turn it into a positive.  
  
  Q. Does that go back to being a kid?   
 AMAR'E STOUDEMIRE: It goes back to my days in New York, watching Spike Lee.  
  
  Q. With all these questions, are you mad or sad that it got to this point? Do you wonder what the focus is?  
 AMAR'E STOUDEMIRE: I'm trying to figure out what the focus is. I'm not quite sure. The franchise is trying to go for a championship, but it doesn't seem that way anymore. I don't know what to expect from the front office.   
 I'm not sure if they are going for a championship or freeing up money.  
  
  Q. Are you angered from where this has gone?   
 AMAR'E STOUDEMIRE: My teammates, we just got to stay focused, still improve regardless of what may happen or what's going on.   
 We just got to keep our head up, stay positive and to keep working. That's my motto. That's what I do.
