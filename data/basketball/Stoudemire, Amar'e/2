 Q. How disappointed would you be if this deal was done and he ended up in New Jersey and not New York, when your team has seemingly had deals on the table and he could have been there?
 AMAR'E STOUDEMIRE: I mean, any decision that he makes, I think he makes decisions based on him and his family. You know, it's hard to determine what moves he's going to make. 

 Q. Your team is in a position to trade for him which essentially would be their decision to pull the trigger or not. If the Nets were to come in at the 18th hour, would that be disappointing for them not to do everything they can --
 AMAR'E STOUDEMIRE: I'm not sure what the logistics are, but I think it's pretty much in Denver's hands. So we are just waiting on them. 

 Q. How much do you --
 AMAR'E STOUDEMIRE: Carmelo is one of the top players in the league and we are great friends. 

 Q. If it's not Carmelo, do you think you can make a team for somebody to get up to the level you need to be at? 
 AMAR'E STOUDEMIRE: We are playing well right now. We definitely can improve. I'm not the GM. We have to take it upon ourselves to get better. Until something happens, it's on us to really take that next step. 
 It's really more so from us as players just to try to win and play hard, so it doesn't really bother me at all. It may be frustrating for Carmelo trying to get over the hump and what-have-you, but hopefully it will end soon. 

 Q. Could you talk about you guys completing the second half of the season and how you are playing so far? 
 AMAR'E STOUDEMIRE: Yeah, so far we are playing well. I think we have exceeded expectations from the start of the season. We felt like we could have played better and lost a few games that we could have won. So going into the second half of the season, we feel we have a great chance to make something happen and we are going to work hard.
