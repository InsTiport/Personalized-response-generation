 Q.  How do you feel physically? 
 AMARE STOUDEMIRE:  I feel great.  There was a lot of hard work this off season, not being able to play last year was definitely hard for me. 
 But my health feels great.  It took a lot of hard work, a lot of motivation, but I'm here now. 

 Q.  Do you ever think about it while you're playing? 
 AMARE STOUDEMIRE:  No, I'm playing pretty much all out.  I don't worry about it, I just go out there and play and it feels good. 

 Q.  Are you 100 percent or do you think you could get in even better shape? 
 AMARE STOUDEMIRE:  I can get in better shape.  I can get more explosive.  And I'm definitely working toward that.  I can feel the improvement so far from the beginning of the season.  I'm feeling great. 

 Q.  How hard was it? 
 AMARE STOUDEMIRE:  It was very, very hard.  It was definitely hard, but all it takes is a strong work ethic.  My work ethic has been the same since the eighth grade. 

 Q.  Did you ever get to a point where you thought about quitting? 
 AMARE STOUDEMIRE:  No.  Some days you have a good day.  Some days you have a bad day.  So you kind of take a step back, naturally.  But other than that I feel great.
