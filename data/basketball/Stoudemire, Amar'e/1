 Q. Can you just talk about the game. Was it enjoyable to you, broken up about the loss? 
 AMAR'E STOUDEMIRE: It was great. We had fun. That's what it's about is really enjoying yourself and having fun out there. It got competitive during the second half. We wanted to win, started off a little slow, those guys scored about 300 points. Defense was, the lack of, but we had fun. That's the most important thing. 

 Q. Amongst this weekend, how much was the craziness of the whole Melo thing, and how do you see it right now?
 AMAR'E STOUDEMIRE: It's been okay with me. My thing is just give the teammates that I'm playing with now motivated and confident. It's going to be a tough 28 games left for the year. So I just don't want my guys to get distracted with all of the rumors. 
 So just pretty much keep everything above water and getting ready for the second half of the year.

 Q. What do you think about how it's kind of become a Knicks/Net competition?
 AMAR'E STOUDEMIRE: It's probably good for the league that basketball is coming back to New York or Jersey. But the team that we have now, we are not too bad. We are making our playoff push, but you never know how things may end up here in the next few days.

 Q. Talk about Kobe tonight?
 AMAR'E STOUDEMIRE: You could tell he started out from the start, he wanted to get the MVP; he was not passing the ball, at all. (Laughter).
 But that's Kobe. (Laughter).

 Q. It seems as the game went on, you were trying to dunk a little harder; that something you were just conscious of or just wide open?
 AMAR'E STOUDEMIRE: No, just playing the game. I'm getting old, man so, my dunks is not as hard as they used to be.

 Q. Make because Blake is out there?
 AMAR'E STOUDEMIRE: No, Blake is jumping over cars. My high-jumping days are over. It was competitive the second half, it was fun.
