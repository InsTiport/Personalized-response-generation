Q.  Anything this team can possibly do?  Seems like you have thrown everything at them. 

AMARE STOUDEMIRE:  Just play a little harder in the first quarter.  Every game so far in this series we were down points in the first quarter.  We have got to do a better job coming out strong. 

Q.  How do you go to the floor tomorrow night without having a defeatist attitude?

AMARE STOUDEMIRE:  I am always coming out with an attitude of trying to win.  That's just my character.  I just -- my teammates feel the same way.

Q.  Would being swept change this series for you guys, what you accomplished?

AMARE STOUDEMIRE:  I feel if we don't win the Championship then the season was pretty much a disappointment, you know.  My all-time goal is to win championships.  That's what I am looking forward to doing. 

Q.  Have you gained a greater appreciation of what it takes to compete at the Conference Final level, just how precious every possession is?

AMARE STOUDEMIRE:  Yes, it is precious, every possession is, really got to be focused every game, every shoot around, every practice, every defensive matchup, you know, from personnel to -- you got to stay focused, really tune in.  It's not easy to win championships in this league.

Q.  How does this team stay together and not point fingers?

AMARE STOUDEMIRE:  We can't point fingers at each other because it's a team thing.  Whatever the outcome may be, we all got to go through it together.  We have got to learn from it.

Q.  Are you guys feeling that's the sense of where you are right now, are you feeling good about each other?

AMARE STOUDEMIRE:  No question about it.  We have got great guys here.  We enjoy the camaraderie.  I don't think that's going to change.
