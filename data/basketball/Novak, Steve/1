Q.   Were you surprised at all the way JR has adapted to the sixth man role this season?
STEVE NOVAK:   Not really.   He's typically done that his whole career.   He's made shots and been an explosive scorer.   I think he's comfortable in that role.   I think he's talented enough to be a starter.   That's what makes him so valuable in that position.

Q.   What's the experience like this weekend?
STEVE NOVAK:   It's awesome.   I've watched the Allâ€‘Star Game for so many years growing up.   And obviously it's my 7th year in the NBA and I've never been a part of it.   It's special to be a part of something like this.

Q.   You play against these guys every day, but now you're part of this team?
STEVE NOVAK:   That's what makes it cool is watching it from a distance, especially when you think back to being a young kid and to look forward to the Three Point Contest.   To now be a part of it it's cool, knowing that there's other kids watching us now. 

Q.   Stephen Curry is in the Three Point Contest, you're getting ready to face Steph, one of the Warriors?
STEVE NOVAK:   Steph is a great shooter.   I think this Saturday is going to be good all around.   There's not one guy that can't win it.   The Slam Dunk Contest is going to be unbelievable.   I don't think there's anybody on any given day that couldn't take it home.

Q.   Could you talk about James Harden.   Just tell us what you think about him. 
STEVE NOVAK:   Yeah, he's a great player.   He's shown he's a great player, a great leader, he's shown he's a guy that can carry the team.   The problems he causes for teams in transition.   He's shown this year what he can do.   And he's proven the kind of player he is.
