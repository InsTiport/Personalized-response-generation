Q.   What's been the hardest transition for you so far?
VICTOR OLADIPO:   I think the number of games is probably the hardest thing. 
Just to get your body right, get your mind right, just being consistent.   It's something you got to work at.   So I'm trying to work on that right now.

Q.   Are you talking about just the recovery from like game to game, going from a game, going to practice, that kind of stuff?
VICTOR OLADIPO:   Yeah, but just the number of games in general.   It's a toll.   It's a lot of games.   We're like 54 games in now, so it's kind of a toll on your body and your mind, but you just got to be ready and prepare for it.

Q.   What's this been like so far?
VICTOR OLADIPO:   It's been fun, hanging out with these guys and those guys over there, just having a good time.   It's been cool. 
I had an early morning this morning.   I woke up at about seven o'clock, went downstairs, did some media stuff.   So it was cool. 

Q.   How do you think the season's gone for you so far, if you had to rate it?
VICTOR OLADIPO:   I think it's been all right.   A lot of ups, a lot of downs, but I'm just trying to keep an even keel and keep getting better.
