Q. Congratulations on your victory, sir, on your win.  Where does this rank among trophies on your mantle?
VICTOR OLADIPO: It would be hard to say.  You know, I'm just thankful to be able to receive an award and represent the Indiana Pacers.  So hopefully I can continue to keep doing a good job.
Q. What do you guys -- have you talked to Nate [McMillan] about next season?  Kind of what are you guys looking to do for next season, and when does the preparation for next season start?
VICTOR OLADIPO: I think the biggest thing for us is improving individually, continue to grow as players and as people.  The sky's the limit for us if we continue to do that.
Q. Did you get a chance to see James' [Harden] suit?
VICTOR OLADIPO: Yeah, I saw it.
Q. Compare it to yours, and does your suit stand out by far of anyone that's out here tonight because there are some pretty loud and crazy fits out there?
VICTOR OLADIPO: I think mine might be up there.  James' is nice.  There are a lot of nice suits out there.  The unique thing is everybody's bringing their own style and their own flavor, and that's what it's all about.
Q. Does this surprise you at all?
VICTOR OLADIPO: I'm not really sure.  I put in a lot of work, obviously it was a great season.  I'm blessed and thankful.  Sometimes you get to points in your life where you do surprise yourself.  But at the end of the day I'm thankful.  It's only the beginning for me and the Pacers organization, so I'm looking forward to the future.
