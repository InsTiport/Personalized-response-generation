 Q.  You're down 3-0 and missing three rotation players.  How would you describe the challenge you guys face for Game 4, against that team especially?  
JONATHAN SIMMONS: It's a big challenge, but we're going to accept the challenge.  We've regrouped and we'll be ready to play Monday.  We're not giving up.   
 Q.  What's the biggest thing that you've learned from Manu over the last two years?  
JONATHAN SIMMONS: He's a hard worker.  He plays hard every night.  He loves this organization, and he loves basketball.  You can tell every night he just leaves it on the floor, even at his age.   
 Q.  How well do you feel Kyle [Anderson] fit in with the starting group?  
JONATHAN SIMMONS: He fits in well.  He's a young guy.  We all have a lot to learn.  The future is bright for him.  He's a hard worker, and as long as he continues to work hard, he'll be a great player.   
 Q.  The minutes you've been given in the last series and this series, how much do you feel like you've grown getting those minutes in a playoff situation?  
JONATHAN SIMMONS: I've grown a lot.  There's a lot of fire out there for my first Western Conference Finals.  But I think I've handled it well against those guys.  I'm just looking forward to my future.   
 Q.  What's the key to attacking the Warriors' defense?  Do they throw a lot of looks at you so you have to go early?  
JONATHAN SIMMONS: I think you just have to play better together.  They play well together.  A lot of those guys have been together for a while.  I think it's just us playing more as a team and making them move a little bit on defense, like they're making us do.   
 Q.  Is that hard to do when the group that's out there right now is just --  
JONATHAN SIMMONS: It's not hard to do.  We're professionals.  We just need to come and do our job and expect to win.
