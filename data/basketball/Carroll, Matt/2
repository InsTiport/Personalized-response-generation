<p>	Q.  A lot of the players have been saying that the goal was to get to the Sweet 16, to get a step farther than last year, but now that you are there, do you have to come up with a new goal?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Arizona and the problems that they present with their depth and their versatility and their balanced scoring? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about this team being one of the best in the country but how much confidence does your team get from the fact that, from your scheduling philosophy, playing Creighton, Marquette, Texas and then obviously with the Big East you get a chance to play a lot of good teams. Can that schedule, just the things did back in November and December give you confidence entering a week like this?</p>
<p>	Q.  At this time of year, people talk about momentum and they will say, well, maybe last Saturday's game was a wake-up call for Arizona.  Maybe they have the momentum; maybe Notre Dame has it.  Is all that talk overrated at this point? </p>
<p>	Q.  And talking to Jordan earlier, but can you talk about  -- he said the whole team came together and watched the Butler game together, and just that, the team sort of coming together to cheer on Joel Cornett?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk a little bit about the Big East?  People thought that perhaps the League got slighted with the four picks and yet you look in here, it's 25  percent of the Sweet 16 are Big East schools?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've played both Texas and Connecticut this year.  Can you talk about how you see both of those teams matching up? </p>
<p>	Q.  If you could talk about Matt Carroll and Dan Miller and their ability to hit the 3-pointers?  It seems this region has some of the best shooters in the country with Stoudamire and Riddick (PH) and Heinrik (PH)?</p>
<p>	Q.  You played Arizona several years ago when you were with Delaware, did that experience help you, and are there any similarities between the team and when you saw them and what you are getting ready to face Thursday?</p>
<p>	Q.  Much is made over your three-point shooting but not your defense, and seemed like you were allowing the players, the opponents, to get the ball where you wanted them to get it rather than where they wanted to get it. </p>
<p>	Q.  With that in mind, last year before you played Duke in the second round, you issued a challenge to the team  -- 85, 90 points, you felt that you needed to get it to that kind of game, do you feel that way with Arizona or does the defensive effort last week give you confidence? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Chris and controlling tempo, is that something you've talked about or just him settling down, the way he can run this game?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously the point guard matchup  --</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about matching up with the three-point shooting?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Inaudible?</p>
<p>	Q.  Torin, I talked to your old coach and they are really pumped up for you.  You are just a freshman, how much are you looking back to your high school buddies?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Jason Gardner and how much you've played against the two Indianapolis guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  What's the thing that he does best, what do you have to be most concerned about in your matchup with him? </p>
<p>	Q.  Matt, I wonder if you keep an eye on the other shooters like T.J., Stoudamire, with the West -- and did you see them play and your thoughts on them? </p>
<p>	Q.  What's your success   -- the long distance? </p>
<p>	Q.  Matt, you guys have played this season seven of the 16 teams that are in the Sweet 16.   Can you talk about what that experience, starting from very early in the season with Creighton, Maryland, Texas, Kentucky, what that experience has meant going into the tournament and now as you get ready to face another? </p>
<p>	Q.  How do you re-adjust that goal now, because you focused on the Sweet 16 for so long and now that you are there, what do you have to tell yourself? </p>
<p>	Q.  You finished the season a little slowly and played very well in the tournament so far.  Was there a difference that you could sense in the practices in the week leading up to the first two games, was there any difference from the way you guys had finished just in terms of how you were practicing?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chris, you played against both T.J. and Brown this year  -- with that matchup that they have in the Sweet 16, I wonder if you could just talk about those two guys what it's like playing against them and their strengths, how you assess them as players? </p>
<p>	Q.  Matt, just wondering now the ankle is, how you are feeling and what are your prospects for Thursday? </p>
<p>	Q.  Dan, you've been talking about a week or so good about how in the tournament, it's just one-and-done, you have to play to keep moving on.  I wonder what it was like for you guys as a team to gather and watch the Butler yesterday? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you catch any of the Maryland game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Has it changed for you till now? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you are playing Sweet 16 games, are there consistent qualities to those games each year that are different from the other games that you play? </p>
<p>	Q.  You guys are all great players in your own right but has Dan helped you guys at all last few weeks in what you have to do to be successful? </p>

<p>	Q.  Chris, you talked about managing the game, can you talk about what that means and what you have done differently to do a better job of that?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Matt, your first game against Arizona  -- (Inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chris and Dan, could you talk a little bit about how Coach Brey has a low-key style and often credits you guys with setting the goals, what makes him such a good coach that's allowed you guys to reach where you are? </p>

<p>	Q.  Chris, did you have a chance to watch the end of the Gonzaga game? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you see that and you see, does that factor in to as you prepare, that they are beatable? </p>
<p>	Q.  Dan, can you talk about the success of the last couple of games and what turned it around?</p>
<p>	Q.  Inaudible)?</p>
