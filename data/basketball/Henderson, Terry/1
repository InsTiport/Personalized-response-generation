Texas   66
  West Virginia - 49

THE MODERATOR:   We're joined by West Virginia Coach Bob Huggins, student‑athletes Terry Henderson and Brandon Watkins.   Questions? 

Q.   Brandon, there were times it looked like early in the first half y'all were clear missing shots you don't normally miss.   Was the feeling like what's going on out here?
BRANDON WATKINS:   Kind of, sort of.   I mean, we were really shooting it well during practice.   And I just thought that we would be able to hit shots during the game.   But I mean, every game you can't just expect to come out and make a lot of shots.   Sometimes you have down games and you have good games. 

Q.   Terry, how effective did you think Texas' zone was or was it all your missed shooting?
TERRY HENDERSON:   I mean, they're a long team.   They've got a long back line in the zone, and they deflected a lot of passes.   We did a poor job of squaring up and really looking at the floor before we threw the ball.   I think we waited too late to try and flash in the middle to get some easy shots or some easy ball movement.
And we played this zone before.   We played against plenty of zones.   So their zone, we're used to playing against the 2‑3 zone.   So I don't really think it was supposed to bother us like that, but it did.   And playing catchup the whole game isn't going to help either.

Q.   Is this an even bigger bummer considering how well you played against Kansas coming into this thing?
COACH HUGGINS:   Well, I certainly didn't see it coming.   I thought we practiced‑‑ we had three pretty enthusiastic days of practice. 
We just‑‑ when you're as reliant as we are on making jump shots and you don't make jump shots, it becomes extremely difficult.   We can't score close. 
They did a great job of collapsing on Juwan every time he went to the basket.   We had a hard time.   We don't make shots when he drives and kicks it to people.   They're just going to sit in there, which is what they did.

Q.   As difficult as this is right now, do you still feel like you deserve to be in the NCAAs?
COACH HUGGINS:   Well, we were sixth in the best league in the country.   You know, we struggled early and we lost some games early because we were so young. 
And I think we've gotten better and better.   I think, are we one of the, you know, whatever, 60‑however‑the‑hell many there are now?   I don't even know.   Yeah, I think we are.   But I guess it's your body of work. 
It's kind of like they asked me the other day, you know, if Embiid didn't play would that hurt Kansas?   And I can remember when Kenyon broke his leg and the head of the committee came out and said it's the total body of work, we don't take any of that into consideration, whatever they did throughout the course of the year.   We were clearly the number one team in the country RPI, the number one in the polls, number one in everything else.
And we got the last 2 seed.   So I've learned that you sit there on Sunday and try and figure it out.   How do I know what goes on? 
But are we?   Sure we are, right now we are.   I mean, take today aside, yeah, we are.   But I don't know.   I don't know what everybody looks at and what's really important.

Q.   It looked like Juwan was injured mid‑stride on that layup attempt.   What's his diagnosis?
COACH HUGGINS:   I don't know.   I don't know.   He stepped on somebody's foot, I guess.   I don't know what it is. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, Coach.
