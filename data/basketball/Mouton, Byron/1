<p>	Q.  Juan, when they went ahead 44-42, you hit the three to put you back, can you tell me what kind of look you got, what you saw on the court? </p>
<p>	Q.  Juan, they scored only eight points I believe in the last seven minutes of the game.  What was the key to your defense down the stretch? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can I ask you, with everything that you've gone through this year, really your whole life, this moment for you, what does it mean, your thoughts, what's going through your heart and mind right now in?</p>
<p>	Q.  Lonny, is this win particularly satisfying because it stands in such comparison to the frustrating way last year ended for you. </p>
<p>	Q.  Byron, can you talk about that big save you made on the baseline, that led to a Drew Nicholas bucket to put you up 55-49.  What do you remember about that play? </p>
<p>	Q.  I wonder what you might say to young players who are thinking of leaving early to go to the NBA?  Are they missing something?  Is there something in the pursuit, the journey to your senior year? </p>


<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the inside game?  You and Wilcox were able to carve out a lot of space down low.  Can you talk about how you were able to achieve that. </p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering if the players can talk about what they're feeling when the game got close, if they were worried at all or felt any tension? </p>
<p>	Q.  15 points, 14 rebounds.  Was there a particular incentive for you tonight since you didn't play a whole lot Saturday because of foul trouble? </p>
<p>	Q.  Juan, there was only like eight seconds went by between the team they took the lead, the time you hit the 3-pointer to get it back.  Were you aware of the score at that point? </p>
<p>	Q.  Juan, can you give any sense of what this means, not only for this team, but for the whole program, the University of Maryland basketball program, what they've gone through over the years? </p>
<p>	Q.  I'd like to see what Lonny and Byron feel about it.  Finally breaking the  -- giving Maryland a National Championship, for all the guys that have played on this team, you guys are the first class.  Do you feel something, not just for yourselves, but for the program? </p>

<p>	Q.  Juan, could you talk about the match-up with Fife?  You went a little stretch without scoring.  Can you talk about the job he did, what he did well, what you did to overcome it. </p>

<p>	Q.  Thinking back on all the years, everything you've gone through, can you sum up what this means? </p>
<p>	Q.  How about the fact that it's your alma mater and it's the first one? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you're up 15 in the last minute, you were still coaching that team with great intensity.  There was no letdown or excitement there.  Is that what it takes to build?  When you look back, every second counts to build this thing?  Do you need to coach 40 minutes? </p>
<p>	Q.  You're probably the first basketball coach in history to start his head coach career on a soccer bench.  Did that experience help your basketball perspective?  Did you ever imagine you'd end up over here? </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm from Italy.  Soccer is the thing we focus on. </p>
<p>	Q.  You made reference to keeping focused in the last minute of the game, things were going through your mind.  Can you share what was going through your mind? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you describe your feelings now?  You don't sound any different.  Are you overjoyed?  Drained? </p>
<p>	Q.  Your team defense was outstanding tonight.  Can you discuss with us the defensive scheme?  You hold Indiana to under 35% from the floor.  We noticed you seemed to extend defensively.  Was that a conscious decision? </p>
<p>	Q.  Among the many people you probably are happy for,  two guys on your staff played for you, Dave Dickerson, Matt Kovarik.  Can you explain what you feel for them, what their role in this is? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kind of figures when you guys counterpunch, it was Dixon hitting the three.  Can you talk about how big players seem to step up in big moments like that. </p>
<p>	Q.  Indiana only had about nine offensive rebounds.  Can you talk about the job Lonny did on the backboards? </p>
<p>	Q.  People saw Maryland coming from a long way off this year.  They didn't see Indiana.  What does it say or what did you think of that run they made with a second-year coach? </p>
<p>	Q.  Your program has been in a position to win for a number of years.  You've been in the NCAA tournament eight, nine years in a row.  Do you believe this one game changes nationally the perception of your program?  Does it erase where you've been all along?  How are you going to celebrate this win? </p>
