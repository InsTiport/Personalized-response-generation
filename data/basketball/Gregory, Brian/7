Clemson  Â– 69
  Georgia Tech - 65

COACH GREGORY:   Obviously a tough way to end a pretty good run.   We did a lot of good things tonight and it's been like many of the games that we played against Clemson, back and forth.   They had a lead and we had a lead.   It usually comes down to making plays at the end of the game.   And they made more than we did, unfortunately. 
You got some timely rebounds and some put backs and we missed some timely free throws.   At the same time, you know, our guys showed a pretty good amount of fight and Daniel's shot there at the end of the game to send it in to overtime and then we had a lead in overtime.   A tough call there at the end.   I haven't seen it.   So not going to comment on it. 
You got a lot of guys hurting in the locker room because I know the way we've played lately and getting the guys back healthy, guys want to continue to play.   And it's unfortunate that it ends like this tonight.   I appreciate everything that Daniel Miller and Kam have given us, three years.   And unfortunately we didn't have Jason this year and then obviously Trae was a big bonus for us and he's done a great job in our program.   So those guys will be missed.
