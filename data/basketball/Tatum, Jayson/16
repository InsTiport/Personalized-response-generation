 Q.  What has your rookie year been like?  
JAYSON TATUM: It's been a transition.  I've had some good days and bad days, but I'm just trying to stay even.  It's a long season.  It's a long process.   
 Q.  What have you struggled with a little bit this season in terms of adjusting to the NBA lifestyle?  
JAYSON TATUM: Just traveling and how many games we play.  It takes a toll mentally and physically.   
 Q.  If there's one skill from a current All-Star that you could take and add to your game, what would it be?  
JAYSON TATUM: Shoot like Steph, dribble like Kyrie.  One of those two.   
 Q.  Who would get your vote for Rookie of the Year?  
JAYSON TATUM: Who would get my vote?  If I couldn't vote for myself?   
 Q.  You can vote for yourself.  
JAYSON TATUM: Myself.   
 Q.  Which teammate has been the biggest influence on you?  
JAYSON TATUM: Probably Kyrie and Marcus Morris.  Those are the two older guys I probably talk to the most on a daily basis.   
 Q.  You guys are neck and neck with Toronto.  What have you seen out of the Raptors so far this season?  
JAYSON TATUM: I think they've got the best home record.  They're a great team.  We split with them one and one.  Hopefully we can try to get back on track.  I think we play them the last game of the season.   
 Q.  What makes Kyle [Lowry] and DeMar [DeRozan] so tough?  
JAYSON TATUM: They're both great players.  Kyle is a great leader and he can really, really shoot the ball.  DeMar is just tough.  He can score whenever from anywhere on the floor, especially now because he's really shooting the three-ball.   
 Q.  You're having a great rookie year.  This rookie class has been one of the best all time.  Is that something you pay attention to, to use as motivation?  
JAYSON TATUM: Yeah.  Our class is really strong.  I felt that way coming in before the draft.  It definitely showed it's not just one or two guys.  It's a handful of guys that are contributing as rookies, starting, playing a lot of minutes throughout the league.   
 Q.  What's your season been like for you?  A year ago at this time you were in college, and you're on a high-profile team in the NBA.  Talk about all that stuff and how you're handling it.  A lot of things coming your way at one time?  
JAYSON TATUM: Yeah, I mean, it's definitely happening fast.  Getting drafted into the NBA and your role changes from what you expected it to be.  You're playing every game 30 minutes a night.  But, I mean, it's what I love to do.  I'm enjoying it.  Some days are better than others.   
 Q.  Has it been more than you thought it was going to be?  You obviously knew there were going to be changes when you got into the league, but those are some pretty serious changes.  
JAYSON TATUM: Yeah, I definitely didn't expect all of this to happen.  But everything happens for a reason.
