  Q. In that matchup with Jaylen Brown, he said you fouled him. Did you actually foul him when he drove on you?
 JAYSON TATUM:   No, I didnt foul him (laughing).  I was playing defense and then he got to the layup so I was going to move out of the way.  But were in Atlanta, so they gave him the foul.
 Q. You guys have been under such pressure all season long.  Was tonight fun, something that you had a good time with?  What will you remember about this game and take away from it?
 JAYSON TATUM:   It was more fun that I thought it would be.  I kind of forgot that feeling from last year.  I had a blast.  I think the best part was just playing with different players that you havent played with yet. It was a lot of fun.  And thats the point, to have fun.
 Q. What was it like to be a starter and hear your name called as a starter, to see the board?  And then to have Bradley Beal introduced after you?
 JAYSON TATUM:   That was super cool.  I want to continue to do that.  I want to start the next X amount of years, so I have a lot of work to do.  But in sharing that moment with Brad, everyone knows how much that moment meant to me.
 Q. How special was it to have your son there with you as you are starting in an All-Star Game?
 JAYSON TATUM:   This is my fourth All-Star weekend in a row, second game, and he has been at every one.  Hopefully we continue this tradition now.  Sharing that moment with him, well look back at these memories.
 Q. Second time around playing in this game. What was different for you being in that locker room the second time around?
 JAYSON TATUM:   I wasnt nearly as nervous as I was [last year].  Just with the overall environment, I kind of knew what to expect, how it was going to go.  I was much more comfortable.
