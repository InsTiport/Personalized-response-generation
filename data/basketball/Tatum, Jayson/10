 Q.  What's the first thing that comes to mind when you think about being an All-Star?  
JAYSON TATUM: The first thing that comes to mind is just how much does it mean to you to be great? How hard are you willing to work to -- how much are you willing to sacrifice to be as great as you can?   
 Q.  In a one-on-one tournament who would you want to play?  
JAYSON TATUM: Who would I want to play?   
 Q.  Yeah.  
JAYSON TATUM: I don't know. I think it would be a good idea. It would be fun.   
 Q.  Is there anyone you'd want to play against?  
JAYSON TATUM: Probably KD and Giannis.   
 Q.  The NBA is talking about the possibility of a mid-season tournament. What do you think about that?  
JAYSON TATUM: Sometimes change is good when they bring new things and new ideas. So I mean, I'm not opposed to it.   
 Q.  Jayson, what about a play-in game?  
JAYSON TATUM: I think it would bring a lot of attention to that game. It would be a big deal because it's like college, win or go home. That would be pretty cool.   
 Q.  On All-Star snubs:  
JAYSON TATUM: Everybody that made the All-Star Game is deserving, deserves to be here. There's always a few guys every season or every year that are in the conversation that should have or could have made it. Brad [Bradley Beal] is definitely one of them. He's averaging 30 points right now a game. I mean, yeah, if it was up to me, he would for sure be in it. But everybody here is deserving as well.   
 Q.  On Kemba Walker:  
JAYSON TATUM: Kemba, that's my guy. Our relationship and friendship has grown a lot over this season so far, from USA basketball to playing on the Celtics to experiencing All-Star together. So it's been a good ride. We're enjoying it.   
 Q.  How is this year at All-Star different for you?  
JAYSON TATUM: It's hard to explain, but it is a different feeling. This is my third time being an All-Star but first time playing on Sunday. It does, it feels different. It's hard to explain. It just feels different.
