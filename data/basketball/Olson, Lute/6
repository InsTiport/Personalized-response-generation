<p>	Q. Toledo Blade. Could you address the success that Michigan State has rebounding and what are some of the idiosyncracies of that success?</p>
<p>	Q. Cleveland Plain -Dealer. Last week after your away game, Richard Jefferson said he thought Illinois was the most physical team. I was wondering in scouting Michigan State if you want to amend that?</p>
<p>	Q. USA Today. Given Michigan State's rebounding talents, what is the best way to try to blunt or negate what they do?</p>
<p>	Q. Tucson Citizen. Can you talk about Richardson, the type of matchup problems he presents?</p>
<p>	Q. Associated Press. Can you talk about Loren's journey through this season and how he seems to have emerged from his self-confidence problems?</p>
<p>	Q. Spartan Network. What do you think you have to do to win?</p>
<p>	Q. Tribune San Diego. Lute, can you remember a time where it was this wide open with the four teams, that everyone's really saying one team specifically is the heavy favorite? And to that end, what gives your team an advantage, do you think, to go on and win it?</p>
<p>	Q. Baltimore Sun. What does it say about your players for them to get through the kind of season they had to get here? Also, did you learn anything about yourself getting through what you dealt with?</p>
<p>	Q. New York Post. You mentioned before you viewed the tape of the Michigan State-Illinois game and, compared to your game with Illinois, you said it was mild. </p>
<p>	Q. Did you show that tape to your players? And, if so, did you get a sense from them that they realized "We're up against a monster"?</p>
<p>	Q. Lansing State Journal. What has been the biggest factor or factors for the continued success you've had at Arizona over the last X amount of years?</p>
<p>	Q. Minnesota Daily. In regards to the Jefferson-Richardson matchup, are there any other key matchups, one-on-one, or any particular individuals that you need to step up in order to be successful?</p>
<p>	Q. Fox Sports. My question is what has Coach Olson and his wife meant to you guys over the time you've been at Arizona?</p>
<p>	Q. Associated Press. Loren, how does it finally feel to be up there after everything you've been through, and how do you feel about your play compared to the rest of the season?</p>
<p>	Q. Tucson Citizen. Richard, could you talk about your matchup with Richardson and what's that going to mean in the game?</p>
<p>	Q. Totino Grace High school. How much of an advantage, if any, do you think Michigan State has because they are the returning national champions?</p>
<p>	Q. Richard, can you talk about the defensive transformation you guys went through in early January and how important that's been to ultimately what you've been able to accomplish? </p>
<p>	Q. Loren, Michigan State or some players have played as many , almost 20 tournament games. Is that helpful or is that an overrated factor in terms of experience in the tournament?</p>
<p>	Q. Cleveland Plain-Dealer. You made a statement last week after the Illinois game you thought you had shown you could play with the most physical team in the country. Having looked at Michigan State on film, do you want to -- is there any amendment you want to make to that about Michigan State's physical nature, and could you and Loren discuss the way the guys go to the glass?</p>
<p>	Q. University of Minnesota, Jason, Temple decided to stop Michigan State's main scorers and let the supporting staff beat them. How do you guys plan to approach that?</p>
<p>	Q. Las Vegas Review Journal. There's been so much talk about how competitively balanced this Final Four is and how every team has a legitimate chance to win. Could each of you address why you believe Arizona can win? What will be the things that will tip the scales in your guys' favor to win this thing?</p>
<p>	Q. Finalfour.Net. Your matchup with Charlie Bell, he's not a prototypical point guard; you are. He's one of the better rebounding guards in the nation. Do you have any specific attack plan for him? Are you going to rely more on team rebounding to keep him off the glass?</p>
<p>	Q. Whose idea was it at the end of practice to prop you up for the dunk, and has Coach Olson in the past usually let you guys open it up in the last couple of minutes of practice like that?</p>

<p>	Q. Spartan Network for Loren and Richard. What do you worry about with Michigan State in terms of their attack and what do you think they should be worried about in terms of your attack?</p>
<p>	Q. Columbus Dispatch. Loren, if you could address also the question that was put to Richard earlier about how do you see Michigan State comparing physically to Illinois, and what do you see as your particular challenge as far as blocking out and rebounding with them?</p>
<p>	Q. Could you talk about the NBA's developmental league? If you were coming out of high school now, do you think you would look at that as an option as opposed to going to college?</p>
<p>	Q. It started this fall. </p>
