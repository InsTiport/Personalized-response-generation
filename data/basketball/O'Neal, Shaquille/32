<p>	Q.  Phil said that he you may have tired in the second half, did you get a little tired in the second half after the big first half? </p>
<p>	Q.  Tell us, you guys have been in this position a few years ago against Philly, put any pressure on you for the next game?</p>
<p>	Q.  You have 13 out of 16 field goals, maybe you should have gotten the ball more, maybe this was a game you were supposed to be in the high 40s?</p>
<p>	Q.  How did it feel not getting double-teamed for a change in your life? </p>
<p>	Q.  In a way did it take out the other guys because when they double-team you in the other series, the other guys, you fed those guys very well and this way, they kind of got shut out of the ballgame. </p>
