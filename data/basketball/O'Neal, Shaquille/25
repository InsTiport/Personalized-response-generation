Q.  Your thoughts on the game?

SHAQUILLE O'NEAL:  We played a pretty good game, we just made a lot of stupid mental errors.  Not all of the guys have been in a game so hard fought.  It was a test for us.  We've had it too easy for too long.  Now that we have a test, we have to come out and fight.  We had a lot of opportunities to win the game, but we just didn't -- we've just got to go back and look at the tape, make adjustments and come out and do what we gotta do, do what we're supposed to do.  We took a lot of good shots, but Eddie shot one that went in and out.  I missed a couple of hooks, but we've just gotta take the opportune shots, especially in a game in the 4th quarter when there are still a lot of opportunities to win the game.  And you know, this is nothing but a test for us, and we're not going to hang our heads now, we're just going to continue to fight.
