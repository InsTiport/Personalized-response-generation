<p>	Q.  Are you surprised by their defense and the effectiveness, and is it getting more difficult as it's going on to solve it with Karl being hurt the way he is?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you hear the suggestion that people are saying that you're old, slow, weak, how do you take that? </p>
<p>	Q.  On a different note, can you talk about the relationship between the NBA and Hollywood, such as some of the movie stars and movie producers, and how does that relationship help you personally off the court?</p>
<p>	Q.  How does that help you off the court, getting movie roles or commercials or anything like that, that relationship? </p>
<p>	Q.  How frustrating is it to go through the next few days with a memory of last night's game in your mind, and do you play things over and over in your head thinking, "I should have done this" or "I should have done that"? </p>
<p>	Q.  You keep saying that it's things that you guys have to do, but you failed to break 70 points for the first time ever in a playoff game.  Is there something that they are doing offensively to change the way you guys are playing?</p>
<p>	Q.  You said it's about you, you said it's about you guys and the adjustments you have to make.  Specifically, from your standpoint, could you talk about maybe one or two of what those adjustments have to be?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've said just about every time you've come in here that you're not getting enough touches, you're not seeing the ball enough, at what point does that back so frustrating for you that  -- when does it start to happen and have you talked to Phil about this?</p>
