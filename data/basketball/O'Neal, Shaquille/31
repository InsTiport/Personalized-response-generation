<p>	Q.  They didn't start throwing the double team at you hard until early in the third quarter, it did seem to take you out of it for a little while, do you think they might come strong with that immediately the next time through?</p>
<p>	Q.  Some people say that you guys need to suffer a loss to wake you up, to get your attention, do you agree with that, and if that's the case or whatever, has this game gotten your attention in terms of going on the rest of the way? </p>
<p>	Q.  They throw a lot of single coverage at you, how radical was that to see because usually you're double -, triple-teamed and stuff like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  How are Karl and Gary doing today?  Obviously a tough Finals return for them.  Did you have to talk to them to keep them up a bit? </p>
<p>	Q.  Being in this situation before against Philadelphia, is that something that gives you confidence that you can shake off the first one or was that a completely different situation because they were so injured and so down that you cannot look back at that and use that as a basis for confidence? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you expound on what you mean by you guys beat yourselves? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much do you think the five days off helped you?  It seemed like the rest of the team was a little bit lethargic but how much did the days off help yourself?</p>
<p>	Q.  It seemed like there were a couple of times when you had a shot, you had an opportunity to get in the lane and shoot and you dished off to Karl, were you actively trying to get him involved, trying to set some guys up like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you talk to Karl after the game last night?  He was really distraught and took a lot of blame on himself, I just wonder if you said anything to him. </p>
<p>	Q.  It seems like the West Coast teams all season long have been much stronger than the East Coast, yet in this first game, it didn't look that way. </p>
