 Q. One of the things that happened when you came here is you really helped Amar'e. I think Amar'e scored a lot of points after you ame. Do you say much to him now about this situation? 
 SHAQUILLE O'NEAL: We talk every day. I think he understands the business and the system we were in last year; it was a little bit different than it is now. I think that's why his numbers have dropped. It is a system he is not really used to. He is not used to posting up. He is used to picking and popping. 
 Now we are in an old tradition where double-team will be there, rotation is going to be there. I don't think he has adjusted to that. I think them talking about moving in has more to do with business.

 Q. Can you talk about after Miami when you got hurt, that you would play again? 
 SHAQUILLE O'NEAL: I knew if I got healthy, I got the touches, I would do what I do. If I take my time, I knew if I got the opportunity, I would be here. 

 Q. In Miami before the trade, was that a depressing time for you? 
 SHAQUILLE O'NEAL: Not really because I had been hurt before. The only thing that was really very upsetting is they didn't know how to fix it. 
 You go to them, they say we don't know how to fix it so they automatically go to, well, he's not hurt, he is just unhappy. That was the only thing that was very upsetting. 
 I came here to Phoenix and they fixed me up and I'm back.
