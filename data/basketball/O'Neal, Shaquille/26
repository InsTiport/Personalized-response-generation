<p>	Q. Shaquille, everybody's now referring to you as the elder statesman.  How do you feel about it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kobe told us you guys didn't talk all weekend.  Is there a reason for that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Are you like the good luck charm, wherever you go, they win in this game. </p>
<p>	Q.  Shaq, Allen Iverson was saying that he really cherished the opportunity to play with you tonight and was just complimenting you.  Was that pretty much the way he played the game as well with all of his assists? </p>
<p>	Q.  Just about Iverson again, he talked a lot about how he feels he's changed and how much he's grown up and how different he is.  Do you feel he's different from say, three, four, five years ago? </p>
