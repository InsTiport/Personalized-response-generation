  Q.  Talk about Vegas?   
 SHAQUILLE O'NEAL:  It's a nice city.  A city that never sleeps.  There are a lot of people here.  A lot of excitement.  It's fun to be here.   
 I know the Maloof family is interested in bringing a team here.  They can get the city to back them up and get a new fun-filled arena, the Steve Wynn Arena, the Donald Trump Arena, the Shaquille O'Neal Arena, that would be great.   
  
  Q.  Would you rather play in Vegas or be a cop in Vegas?   
 SHAQUILLE O'NEAL:  Neither.  I would get in trouble out here.   
  
  Q.  Talk about starting for the East?   
 SHAQUILLE O'NEAL:  I'm really happy that the fans considered enough of me this year to vote me in.  Dwight Howard was having a fabulous year and I thought he was going to be a starter and I would possibly back him up.  I really wasn't even paying attention to it.   
  
  Q.  Some people think an All-Star Game is a necessary evil, how do you deal with it?   
 SHAQUILLE O'NEAL:  It's fun to come here and mingle with the guys and just have a good time and show off and showcase certain things.
