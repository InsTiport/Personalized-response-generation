<p>	Q. Talk a little bit about the confidence of the team after gutting it out last night and beating the Pistons. </p>
<p>	Q.  You really made a difference, too, Shaq.  You hit all of yours; talk about that and the difference it made in the game from your perspective. </p>
<p>	Q.  What do you have to do for this team to win tomorrow night?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel like you guys were able to frustrate them and make them lose their composure to a certain extent?</p>
<p>	Q.  They're going to be pretty desperate not wanting to go to Miami 3-1.  Do you guys have to try to match that intensity or try to create it yourselves even though it's not really there?</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you think about their history of coming back from behind in series several times in the last couple years?</p>
<p>	Q.  How nice is it to just be able to focus on basketball with this team?  Over there they're dealing with some off-the-court issues with their coach going to Cleveland or somewhere else, to just be able to focus on basketball? </p>
<p>	Q.  What do you think about Dwyane?  He's playing really well. </p>
<p>	Q.  People have talked about Pistons playing the right way.  What do you show as far as your play?  Do you think that you've redefined playing the right way?</p>
<p>	Q.  What will you do today?</p>
<p>	Q.  How is the thigh affecting your ability to shoot free throws?</p>

<p>	Q.  Are you focusing on that when you get the ball?</p>
<p>	Q.  You put a lot of pressure on the officials to make calls with the way you played; you had a lot of calls last night, a lot of free throws both ways. </p>
<p>	Q.  Are you concerned with your injury? </p>
<p>	Q.  Are you amazed with the way Dwyane Wade has been able to play the last couple of games?</p>
