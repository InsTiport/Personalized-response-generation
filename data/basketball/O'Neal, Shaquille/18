  Q.  Did you guys think you were out of it when you were down 21?   
 SHAQUILLE O'NEAL:  No.  We knew that we just had to, you know, run a little bit, you know, just play a little defense.  I think the first half was just a little bit too silly, and I talked to them at halftime, Coach Saunders talked to them at halftime, we knew we just had to play a little bit of defense and play a little bit harder and a little bit more aggressive and that's what we did.   
  Q.  Dwyane, would you take us through the last basket, your follow?   
 DWYANE WADE:  Well, Coach called the 1-4 to let AI shoot, you know he took it.  I was just doing what we always do and follow it up.  I seen that it was short and I was in the right place at the right time to get the bucket.   
  Q.  Would you comment on when you guys got down, LeBron started to get on a roll, would you comment on his play.   
 SHAQUILLE O'NEAL:  He's a great player.  He's the future of the game as well as this gentleman sitting next to me.   
 I know these guys are big time, but I've got three sons and I go in their room every morning and there's no posters of me, there's posters of D-Wade, T Mac and LeBron.  These guys are the future of the game and I'm glad to be able to grow with these guys.   
  Q.  Who was your choreographer for the pregame dance?   
 DWYANE WADE:  That was original Jackson Five step from the Michael Jackson video.   
  Q.  Who was better, the East or the West?   
 DWYANE WADE:  The east.  They had Yao at the end of that line.
