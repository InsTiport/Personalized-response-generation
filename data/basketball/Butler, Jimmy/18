 Q.  A change, creating a little more intensity at the end.  
JIMMY BUTLER: It was dope. Damn sure got to compete at the end. It's still fun to go out there and be known as one of the best players in the world in this league. Hopefully it stays like that.   
 Q.  How did you feel about Bam Adebayo's first All-Star?  
JIMMY BUTLER: Happy for him, man. He's out there comfortable knowing that he belongs. Just experiencing it with him, seeing the smile on his face.   
But it won't be the last time he's out there. He's got a lot more under his belt.   
 Q.  Have any other players or other legends in the game come to you about Bam and what he's done this year?  
JIMMY BUTLER: Everybody has been all year long. I think it's so impressive what he's been doing for himself as a player and then what he's been doing for our team. I say this many times, but he's really the reason we're winning. Without him, we cannot be the team we are. I'm happy for him. I'm proud of him.   
 Q.  A couple days to recharge and get yourself ready for the last third of the season. What are your expectations for the end of the year?  
JIMMY BUTLER: To tell you the truth, just continue to win. But more than anything, I really want to go see my family and spend some time with my friends [for the rest of the All-Star break].
