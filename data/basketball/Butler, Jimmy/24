 Q.  What are you most excited about this weekend?  JIMMY BUTLER: Experiencing this for the first time with my buddies that are here and the friends I have coming here.  They've been a big part of why I'm here, also.  So it's only right that they should be here to go through this with me.   Q.  Who are you most excited to play with?  Against?  JIMMY BUTLER: To play with Pau.  You know, he's on my team, Chicago.  There's a lot of great players obviously on both the teams.  So it's just an honor to be here with all of those guys.   Q.  Jimmy, did you see Derrick's performance last night?  It was kind of the biggest sign or best sign that he will reach the level he once was at or still can?  What did you take from that?  Did it seem like he was above and beyond what he's done?  JIMMY BUTLER: Derrick has been playing well this season.  That game was a really good one.  He's done that before.  He does so many things well for us.  I know he's going to get back to where he was.   One game doesn't prove that.  He's been helping us win a lot of games all season.  He's coming back.   Q.  Do you prefer to be here or on the court defending --  JIMMY BUTLER: On the court.  That's more natural.  All of these flashes in my face.  I'll take being on the court.   Q.  Is it stress for you?  JIMMY BUTLER: Stress?   Q.  Yeah.  JIMMY BUTLER: No.  I just don't like all these lights.  I don't want to be under the lights.  The lights on the court are more fitting.   Q.  Those ones are better?  JIMMY BUTLER: Yes.   Q.  Jimmy, what are your thoughts on James Harden and how do you plan to play against him?  JIMMY BUTLER: The same way I prepare to play against him when he's in a Houston Rockets uniform.  Go hard and try to win a game. Yeah, he's a hell of a player.  I think it's going to be a great All-Star Game.  We have a lot of great players on both rosters.
