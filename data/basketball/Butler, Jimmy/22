		  JIMMY BUTLER: For me, I just want to play ball and get a chance to represent my country and potentially get the gold medal and play with this great group of guys. That's what's so awesome about USA Basketball. 

Q. Was it a difficult decision at all? 
JIMMY BUTLER: Not at all. Not at all. Not in a million years would I tell I wouldn't represent my country. So I think it was a noâ€‘brainer. It was easy for me to take that. 

Q. You haven't been a part of a World Championship or anything like that, but how do you feel? 
JIMMY BUTLER: I think everybody has that one goal and that's to win. But all the roles that we have on our respective NBA teams, put all that to the side and whatever role you have to do to win here, that's what you've got to buy into, so I'm excited about that. 

Q. We saw your Instagram post about Derrick Rose. Was it a shock? What was your initial reaction? 
JIMMY BUTLER: It was a little bit of a shock. If you pay attention to what was going on in the NBA, something was bound to happen, but I didn't expect that. But it's here upon us now. 

Q. How much do you think he has left? There are talks about him trying to get back to that MVP form? 
JIMMY BUTLER: I think he'll give us best effort out here in New York.
