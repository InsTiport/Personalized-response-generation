<p>	Q.  Update on Heather?</p>
<p>	Q.  So start of the season unlikely she'll be --</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) a bit of a dark horse (inaudible) team that can surprise some people in the north?</p>
<p>	Q.  How different does it look at your practice and not seeing Ann and all the starters from last year and how different will your team be this next year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Looks like the north division is really jumbled.  Some of the teams that weren't successful have a lot of people back.  Other teams lose a lot and are rebuilding.  How do you see the north this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Brittany, with all the kids you lost and just I would say very strong personality strong character kids along with good basketball players.  How is this team developing it's personality and chemistry can you tell so far this early?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is this Iowa State team going to look as much like the traditional Iowa State teams or is this one going to be something new, something different?</p>
<p>	Q.  Brit, seems like a lot of the teams that are here talk about being really stronger at the post than in past years.  Overall, do you think does it seem like this is maybe going to be a post year in the conference this year, who in the conference impresses you as far as the other opposing centers? </p>
<p>	Q.  Are you any more concerned than usual about going to Colorado this year given the way they played you at the Big 12 tournament last year?</p>
