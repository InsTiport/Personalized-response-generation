 Q.  Who are you most looking forward to being on the court with?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: Deandre Ayton, probably.  I played with him in the past; it was fun.  I kind of played with him a little bit, but it will be fun again.   
 Q.  He has an interesting personality, very funny.  Is there anyone else on the roster who has that outgoing personality that can rival Deandre's?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: Not as much as D.A., no.   
 Q.  Team USA has a lot of talent.  Who are you looking forward to getting on the court against?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: All of them really, to be honest with you.  I wouldn't single anybody out.  Yeah, it should be fun tonight.   
 Q.  Will you try to dunk on someone tonight?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: If I get a chance to.   
 Q.  If the Rising Stars game had a draft format like the All-Star Game, who would be your No. 1 overall?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: Kevin Knox.   
 Q.  Can you talk about playing in the Rising Stars game?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: It's an honor.  Something I dreamed about.  One of my goals that I set out for myself a long time ago, and I'm glad I got to achieve it.   
 Q.  Anyone you're looking forward to playing with tonight?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: The whole team really.  Just looking forward to going out there and playing, having fun and trying to get the "W."   
 Q.  Do you have a pick for the Three-Point Contest and Slam Dunk Contest?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: Three point -- I don't know who all's in it?  Curry's in it?   
 Q.  Yeah.  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: I'm going to go with the bigger brother Curry.  And Slam Dunk, I got Hami Diallo.   
 Q.  Can you remember the first time you watched All-Star and what you can remember?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: I do not remember.  I've watched it all my life, though.  I can't remember the first time.   
 Q.  Which player has been the most difficult to play against in the NBA so far?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: That's a tough question.  There are so many guys.  LeBron, obviously, Curry, KD.  A bunch of guys.  James Harden.   
 Q.  Do you have any favorite players growing up that you played against?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: Yeah.  KD was my favorite player growing up for a long time.  I kind of shifted around a little bit to my favorite player, but so many guys in the league.   
 Q.  Are there any teammates that have taken you under their wing?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: I would say my vet is Lou Will [Williams].   
 Q.  And what's your favorite moment so far this year?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: I don't know, one of our comeback victories.   
 Q.  Is there a skill you want to emulate right now?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: Curry's jump shot.   
 Q.  How do you feel representing Canada?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: It's an honor.  Obviously, not a lot of guys from Canada make it, even though we are on the rise.  But it's an honor.  It's a goal that I set out for myself a long time ago, and I was able to achieve it.
