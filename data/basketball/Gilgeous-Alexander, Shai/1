 Q.  On playing against PJ Washington:  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: Yeah, me and PJ are super close, obviously going to school together. That's my guy. It will be fun to go out there and play against him.   
 Q.  On Washington staying two years at Kentucky:  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: Yeah, a lot of people think, when you go to Kentucky, you've got to be a one-and-done. Obviously, it doesn't work like that. PJ stayed a second year, and it worked out beautifully for him. You guys see what he's doing now. So he made the right decision.   
 Q.  Is there a time that you can say throughout your career that you bet on yourself, whether it was high school, college, international play? Something that happened where you say, I'm glad I made that bet on myself?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: Yeah. There were doubts as far as me going to Kentucky, being a four-star recruit, being overlooked and things like that. But I knew with the opportunity and with my work ethic I would make it happen.   
 Q.  On having success with Oklahoma City:  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: Hard work, obviously, opportunity with the new team, and then just the supporting cast around me, my teammates. The organization does a really good job putting me in a position to succeed. It's just really, really been a blessed situation.   
 Q.  On helping Canada reach the 2020 Olympics:  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: Yeah, I'm excited, extremely excited. This will be my first chance to play on an Olympic level. We've got a lot of guys that are talented and, as far as I know, want to compete and win. With those two things, anything is possible.   
 Q.  On Canada basketball:  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: Yeah, it's super cool just to see how far Canada basketball has come. There are guys from all over. Myself being from Hampton, Nickeil [Alexander-Walker] from Scarborough, RJ [Barrett] from Mississauga and Brandon [Clarke] from BC. It's been super cool.   
 Q.  On Kobe Bryant:  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: As far as I know, every kid growing up viewed Kobe as an idol, always wanted to be like Kobe. I know for me and the guys that I was around, my family and my friends, he was our first superstar to really look up to day in and day out.
