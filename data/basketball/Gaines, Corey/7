  Phoenix Mercury - 84 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Coach, we'll go with an opening statement before questions.   
 COREY GAINES: They shot the ball well again. We did not shoot the ball well. We didn't play well at all. But it happens sometimes. This year it's happened a couple of times and we've always come back from it. So questions?   
  
  Q. Corey, was it something they were doing defensively? What kind of changes did they make from the way you guys played Tuesday?   
 COREY GAINES: They played the same type of defense, we just missed shots, we missed more shots and we tried to get to the basket and we missed those shots, too.   
  
  Q. Coach, in the first half when Indiana had the lead then the Mercury responded and you guys went up and Indiana regained the lead going into the half, how crucial was that and what kind of a tone setter for the game?   
 COREY GAINES: Well, you want to finish up the quarters or the half strong, which we didn't. It was only a 3--point lead if I'm correct. Was it 3 or 5? 3? I can't remember exactly.   
 But it wasn't that crucial, we got another whole half to play. We just came out flat in the third, we came out flat.   
  
  Q. Coach, can you give us an update on Penny Taylor and how did losing her in the second half affect you guys?   
 COREY GAINES: It definitely hurt, she had 14 in the first half and she got hit in the mouth, I'm not sure, I haven't talked to the doctors so I don't know exactly what's wrong, so I don't want to say something I don't know for sure. I know for sure she'll play next game, I know Penny Taylor she'll play next game, for sure, 100%.   
  
  Q. Coach, Cappie this morning said that the team need to do bring it for forty minutes, do you feel that your team brought it for forty minutes?   
 COREY GAINES: No, we didn't, we didn't. We had lapses where they ran us instead of us running them, they got easy buckets. So it happens sometimes to us. If I had to answer to that it would never happen. But I don't. But I'm sure I'll watch the film and I'll figure it out. If I had the answer to that --  
  
  Q. You guys can live and die with Cappie and Diana, and they didn't have a great night. It didn't seem like they were doing that much different on defense.   
 COREY GAINES: They weren't. We missed shots and instead of taking the three's, we decided to go in and get to the basket. They were attacking the basket, so last game they called fouls and this game we didn't get to the line so it's one of those things.   
  
  Q. Coach, Tammy Sutton-Brown seemed to have her way down low, how do you rectify that in Game 3?   
 COREY GAINES: Stop her from getting so deep, stop her from getting so deep. Trying to get her out of the lane, it's tough. She's good at it. Open court she runs down and plants herself down there and gets some easy shots.   
  
  Q. Coach, your thoughts on going to Indiana now and trying to capture Game 3 on the road?   
 COREY GAINES: Well, last time we played there we won, so it's not like it's an impossible dream. This year without me -- you know, I didn't play Diana that last game in L.A. We have not lost two games in a row, and if I'm knowing Diana and Cappie when they do have sub-par shooting nights they usually come back vicious. So it's a good thing.   
  
  Q. Coach, one of the advantages you had were points off the bench and aside from Penny Taylor who scored 14 four other players only scored eight. What do you have to do to get them going?   
 COREY GAINES: Well, we get those points from Ketia, DeWanna and Penny, and Penny was out the second half and that hurt us a little bit but we didn't get the second-chance point put-backs, and the game slowed down to a stall, if it wasn't the ball out-of-bounds it was a foul, time-out, it was something. You know, tip ball, side out of bounds, something. So that hurts us.   
  
  Q. Coach, can you talk about the way Briann January played in this game?   
 COREY GAINES: She played great. She didn't play like a rookie. She hit some shots, hit some big three's when they needed 'em. She's playing great, great player.   
 THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach, we'll see you Sunday.
