 THE MODERATOR: Coach Gaines, opening statement?   
 COACH COREY GAINES: Well, we came out with our backs against the wall -- I shouldn't say "we," I should say the players did. They gave it their all tonight and we changed the game plan just a little bit. We tried to use their defense against them. Learned a valuable lesson tonight, sometimes less is more.   
 They came through.   
 THE MODERATOR: Questions?   
  
  Q. Can you expand on that, "less is more"? What you felt like you did?   
 COACH COREY GAINES: We're a team of about 80 sets, and sometimes as a coach I learned a lesson I probably should have learned a long time ago but I didn't. Sometimes the simplest thing is what you need to win a game. And tonight that's what it was. It wasn't about having 15 options and 50 plays and -- it was something real simple.   
  
  Q. Again, they did a good job of chasing you guys off the 3-point line. This game you guys got back to the style of play that you prefer. What did you do defensively to get them off the 3-point line? They shot poorly, obviously.   
 COACH COREY GAINES: Truthfully, nothing, they just missed shots. And then in the fourth quarter, like most teams, if you're behind those shots are tougher to take. The shots are easier to take when you're up by 10, 12, 11 points. They're easy to take.   
  
  Q. You were just saying that it wasn't about 15 options and 50 plays, how far did you reduce your game plan then offensively?   
 COACH COREY GAINES: To one. Over and over again. One play.   
  
  Q. Coach, Katie Douglas was obviously a big factor in Game 1 but tonight you neutralized her. How were you able to do that?   
 COACH COREY GAINES: We didn't. They still got penetration, they just missed shots. They're a good team, they just missed shots. Just like we missed shots. We missed some key shots before in our losses. Miss shots you don't win games.   
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.
