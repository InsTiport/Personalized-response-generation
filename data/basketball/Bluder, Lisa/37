Iowa State - 76, Iowa - 88   
LISA BLUDER: It feels pretty good.  Our locker room was a pretty happy locker room and it should have been.  Our team prepared well for this game, mentally and physically, and I thought we kept our composure the entire game.  We get up big, they make a little run at us.  For the most part we really kept our composure.  I thought we were just the better team.   
We have five people in double figures.  We have two women out here who had career highs today in Tania and Kathleen.  We shot the ball extremely well.  But that second quarter was good.  Third quarter almost a perfect shooting performance in the third quarter.  I don't know if I've ever seen that before.   
 Q.  Is this the kind of game you were hoping you would get a lot of from Kathleen when you found out she was committing to Iowa?  
 A. Yeah, absolutely.  We knew how good of a player she is.  We believe in all of our players.  Christina Buttenham comes off and has a great performance tonight off the bench and provides us offense and defense.  That's what I love about our team is we're a team.  Everybody is important.  Everybody brings something to the table.   
 But certainly, yes, Kathleen's performance tonight was really great.  Tania's performance was really great as well.  Megan has a double-double.  I could just keep going on about them.   
 Q.  Second straight game you're shooting lights out from the floor.  Did you see this coming at all?  
LISA BLUDER: You know, we started out the season not shooting the ball well and it was just kind of a mystery, honestly.  We track our every shot in practice.  We know how well that we shoot the ball, so it was just a matter of time.  Luckily, you know, sometimes it just takes confidence too.  Some start falling and then it's kind of like an avalanche.  So I'm just glad they kept the faith.   
 Q.  They've been making pretty much every long-range shot the past couple of games.  One of the big things, I'm sure, on your scouting report.  You held them to 6-of-28 from long range.  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, they're a great three-point shooting team, and we talked.  One of our keys to the game was no uncontested threes.  Every three had to be contested, and our three-point field goal percentage defense has been very good this year, and we're proud of that and want to continue to do that.
