LISA BLUDER: I thought we played a fabulous second quarter.  We got down big, and I'm proud of the team the way they battled back. We made it a competitive game.  You know, going up at halftime to Maryland, I think, is a really good achievement for us.  But in the second half, we had too many turnovers. We gave up offensive rebounds, and didn't get enough offensive rebounds ourselves.  We only got one offensive rebound in the second half, and that was Tania who is not even supposed to be crashing for us.   
So we did not do a good job on the boards either way, but I thought their press really changed just the game.   
 Q.  What was it or what changed after the first quarter to make that second so good.  I thought that was the best basketball you guys played all year?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, we did a lot of good things in the second quarter.  With shot the ball well, we were defending.  We got Brionna Jones in foul trouble and that helps.  She's easier to guard when she's sitting on the bench.  I just thought we were playing really good basketball.  We were inspired out there, and I thought that was really nice.   
Tania, I thought, did a great job of getting the team, and the fire going there.   
 Q.  What did you tell them at that timeout when it was like 11-2?  Because after that they came and kind of had their momentum back.  
LISA BLUDER: I can't really remember exactly what I said in the timeout.   
It was more of a gut check than really making changes.  We talked about transition defense during that time.  But, yeah, more just having composure than anything else.   
 Q.  How hard is it to deal with their size?  They just keep coming at you on the boards?  
LISA BLUDER: I think Brionna Jones is one of the best centers in, not only the Big Ten, but in America.  She has tremendous foot work.  I said it earlier in the week, she's so efficient with her foot work.  She does such a great job of feeling.  She's really a textbook post player that you really want to watch clips of because she's so good.   
 Q.  Seemed like Walker-Kimbrough seemed like she had anything she wanted in that second half?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, first half I thought we did a nice job on her, and then she hit a couple threes from outside, and she's so explosive off the dribble, especially on that left-hand side.  But she's a fabulous player.   
 Q.  How nice was that to see the three-point shot, a little more success there in the second quarter?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, nice.  Tania hit some, Kathleen did, Mak got one, also Christina Buttenham came off the bench and did a good job with that.  So it's nice.   
I mean, obviously the three-point game is such a big part of our game now, and we want to utilize it.  I'm glad to see us doing a little better job with that.   
 Q.  Coach, even in a loss, are there a lot of things you can take away from this game?  You're playing the number three team in the nation, and you had them up against the ropes most of the game?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, you always look for positives in every game that you play.  I think that second quarter was really good, and we'll keep building on that.  We've got to get ready for Rutgers now.  We only have two days of prep and travel out there, so we've got our work cut out ahead of us getting out there.
