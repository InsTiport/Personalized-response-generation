COACH BLUDER:   You know, it's too bad, but I need to look at the film and see if more came against zone or player.   Our closeouts in the zone sometimes weren't very aggressive.   
You know, they're a team that can get threes in transition, too.   They're a good three‑shooting team.   You know, Rachel Theriot hit a couple tonight, and Brandi Jeffery hit a couple tonight, and those are big for them.   Extra players hitting threes that haven't consistently done that all year for them.   
But we'll get another opportunity in a week or so.   
   
 Q.   It obviously doesn't get any easier now.   How do you keep them up at this point?   
COACH BLUDER:   Well, you know, we have the No. 1 team coming in in our conference on Thursday, and we get them on our home court, so that's a great opportunity.   So we've got to make the most of that opportunity.   
We go to Purdue on Thursday, and Michigan was able to just get them over the weekend.   We've got them on our home court.   
Going to Nebraska, we feel like, hey, we were in this game tonight.   So we've got to remember that going into Nebraska.  
   
 Q.   Coach, what do you have to work on this week in practice in order to be ready for the next game?   
COACH BLUDER:   Well, I won't know that until tonight.   Because I haven't looked at Penn State, so I need to get ready for them, and I'll know that better ‑‑ probably about midnight, I'll have a better idea of that.   But I wouldn't be able to tell you that right now.  
   
 Q.   Coach, are you confident your resume still looks pretty good going into the last week?   
COACH BLUDER:   I think we still have some work to.   I'd like to see us win three more.   I think that would solidify things.   But I don't know.   Who knows what the selection committee will think.  
   
 Q.     It looked like ‑‑ was there an effort to get Morgan the ball in the first half and especially in the second half?   
COACH BLUDER: She was shooting the ball.   She was five for five in the first half.   So we definitely wanted to get the ball into her hands, and she's shooting the ball well tonight.   So, yes, we were looking to get her the ball.
