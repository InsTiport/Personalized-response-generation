COACH BLUDER:   First of all, I want to congratulate Morgan.   Pretty elite club.   Wonderful for her to be able to get in there and do it in her junior year with a year left to go.   Pretty thankful she has a year left.   
Good victory for us.   I thought we came out both halves really strong.   We shot the ball well tonight.   We did a good job on the boards.   I was worried about the boards.   The key to the victory was we had to do a good job on the boards.   I thought we did a tremendous job, 43 to 26, we held them to six offensive rebounds.   
Sam I thought played well, rebounded well.   Kelly Krei rebounded well.   She had nine rebounds, five offensive rebounds.   
I thought Kamille again led our team extremely well out there.   I thought we did a good job with our three‑point shooters, too.   That was a strength for them.   
Banham shooting over 50% from the three‑point range in the Big Ten season.   To hold her to zero, I was happy with our three‑point defense tonight, as well.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk about Dixon.   Tonight was a different night for her.   More of a supporting role.   
COACH BLUDER:   I think she's played really well.   She had that great offensive rebound and putback after she missed it.   She had her own offensive rebound.   That was fun.   I thought she did a very good job defensively for us.   
That's what I like about our team, though, is that Melissa was open in Indiana, she hit open shots.   Tonight maybe they had a better eye on her.   Other people hit their shots.   
I feel like they understand they don't have to force things.   They don't have to score 20 points or 19 points every time out in order to consider they did a good job.   
She did a good job tonight, and she did have a different role, and that was okay.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about the 16‑2 run.   
COACH BLUDER:   Let's see, that was in the first half, wasn't it?   
You know, Kamille had the hot hand during that time.   She hit some really nice threes and looked extremely strong putting them up.   
I enjoyed what we did.   Some things in the halfcourt press, I think that was kind of fun.   I think that frustrated them a little bit.   But defensively to hold Minnesota to 25 points in the first half was a very good job.   
   
 Q.   You've won your last four games.   Four games to go before the tournament.   How does this position you to get a post‑season berth?  
COACH BLUDER:   We have four games left, two at home, two away.   Sunday's game against Michigan State is very important because it's our solo meeting with them all year.   We are tied with them right now.   If it comes down to a tiebreaker, head‑to‑head competition is what we go to first of all.   
Having them on our home floor, knowing we're tied with them right now, it's a very important game going into the end of the season here and going into the Big Ten tournament.   
But I think we have a good feel right now.   We've won four in a row.   We're playing at home again.   I think that we're positioning ourselves well for these last games going into the Big Ten tournament.   
   
 Q.   You mentioned the three‑point shooting defense tonight.   This is the third straight game you shut that down.   Has something changed there?   
COACH BLUDER:   It's really two and a half games, because Wisconsin, they got us pretty good in the first half.   But the second half we did a much better job.   
But, you know, I think we're just being really cognizant of those three‑point shooters.   We're getting out and covering a little better.   We're playing screens better so we're able to get out there and cover the ball when they come off of a screen a little bit better.   
So I'd hope that it's just overall defensive intensity that we're able to stay in our stance, cover our screens, get out on the three‑point shooters a little bit better.   
Thank you.
