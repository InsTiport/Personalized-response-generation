COACH BLUDER: Well, first thing I want to do is thank our fans for coming out.  This was amazing to have almost eight thousand people here for us.  I wish we could have given a little bit more to cheer about, a little bit more to get excited about.   
Maryland is obviously a tremendous team.  I just want to congratulate them.  It's a Final Four program the last two years.  Brionna Jones is probably the best center in the Big Ten, in my opinion.  I think she's outstanding.  We have a freshman battling against her.  I thought Megan played her heart out out there against her.  Shatori Walker-Kimbrough, she was on the USA team and the PanAm team with me last year.  I know how good of a player she is.  I think she's just a tremendous kid, too.   
I'm proud of our rebounding.  They come in there plus 19 rebounding.  We out-rebound them.  I don't think anybody could have ever thought that we could out-rebound Maryland.  I'm especially proud of the box-outs of our players.  We gave up nine offensive rebounds to that team.  I think our team did a great job of boxing out.   
But we have to take better care of the ball and shoot the ball better than we did today.   
 Q.  How big were the turnovers?  
COACH BLUDER: Yeah, that's not Iowa basketball.  We're very disappointed in that.  Not taking care of the ball, not passing the ball for high-percentage shots.  That's not what we practice every day.   
I feel like a lot of the turnovers were unforced errors.  I feel like they're a little bit of mental errors.  We got to get control of this.  This has been too many games in a row where we've had way too many turnovers.   
 Q.  Maryland, was quickness a factor at all, the way they attack on defense, their overall quickness as far as turnovers?  
COACH BLUDER: I mean, they're an athletic team.  But we've seen athletic teams before.  We have to compete against it.  They're in our conference, so we better be prepared to handle that type of athleticism and quickness.   
So we can't use it as an excuse.  We just have to get better at it.   
 Q.  How hard was it to get back on the horse after what happened Thursday in Ann Arbor?  
COACH BLUDER: For sure that took the wind out of our sails a little bit.  That was a tough way to lose.  You're up 17 on the road, we lose in the fourth quarter.  So that's one of those that mentally can have some hangover.  I think there maybe was a little bit of that.  But right now we have to right the ship and we don't have a long time to do it.   
In 16 years I've been in the Big Ten, I've never been in a stretch where we have five games in 12 days.  Unbelievable.  We never can give our players a day off mentally or physically.  They're having to learn a new scouting report every three days.  Of this stretch, three of the five are on the road.  We have two road games this week.  Three of the four in this stretch are on the road.  This is crazy.   
We're in a tough stretch.  But we cannot have a hangover tonight that affects us on Wednesday night.  We've got to bounce back.
