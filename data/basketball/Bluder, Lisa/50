Michigan State - 74, Iowa - 69   
COACH BLUDER: Michigan State is a great team and we played competitively with them for most of this basketball game.  It's a one-possession game with a minute left to go, and things didn't go our way unfortunately.  Too many turnovers at inopportune times.  But we shot the ball well against a good defensive team.  We out-rebounded a team that's a plus-ten rebounding team and we out-rebound them by six.   
We did a lot of good things.  You know, Megan got into foul trouble early, that hurt us a little bit.  But Christina, I thought, came in off the bench after sitting out a week and she did some really good things for us.  We just have to keep moving ahead and try to get a win on Thursday against Ohio State.   
 Q.  Obviously this is a loss, but the second half --  
COACH BLUDER: I thought the last ten minutes of the second quarter were outstanding.  We go on a 10-0 run to go in the locker room and we got great momentum going.  The second half, it was probably better.  It was progress, yeah.   
 Q.  Have you had a chance to look at Ohio State yet?  
COACH BLUDER: I haven't looked at them at all, so I really don't have anything on them, sorry.   
 Q.  Still thinking you can turn the team from 4-2?  
COACH BLUDER: Yeah, it's definitely a tough road to hoe, but it's possible.  It's definitely possible.  So obviously winning Thursday would be a huge boost, getting one of those coveted Top-25 wins would be also great for the selection committee.  That's why this win again would have been so nice today.   
Obviously Ohio State, an excellent basketball team coming here, Top-10 in the country, but we beat Top-10 teams before and there's no reason why we can't do it on Thursday night.
