COACH BLUDER:   Well, we took care of business on our home court tonight.   A very important game because they're breathing on the back door there for second place.   Giving them one more loss and us keeping them 0‑2 is really good this time of year.   I thought our defensive effort was outstanding tonight.   We just kept track ‑‑ I mean, Mitchell has half of her points she's been averaging.   Ameryst has half of the points she's been averaging, and that is obviously the key to our winning tonight.   
So I thought our players did a great job of communicating out there, and I thought the top, Melissa, Whitney, Sam when she was up there, I thought they did a great job on those two players and really communicating where they were.   
We have four players in double figures.   Sam's one rebound away from a double‑double.   Again, I'm really happy with the defense and we won rebounding more.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the quick start?   
COACH BLUDER:   It was big.   We got our transition going.   We forced some turnovers and got it going.   Those are high‑percentage shots for us, so that was good.   They took that away from us in the second half, but I thought that a good early start was good.  
   
 Q.   You talked about a strategy against Mitchell and Alston earlier in the week.   What were you guys able to do that no one else in the country has this year?   
COACH BLUDER:   Play them again.   
   
 Q.   Was it defensive intensity on your part?   
COACH BLUDER:   I think they really talked well.   They communicated where she was all the time, and we respected them coming in here.  
   
 Q.   How frustrating were the turnovers?   
COACH BLUDER:   Yeah, again, our fast break was so there in the first half, and second half they did a great job of getting back.   I think we had some turnovers trying to push it.   But it's hard.   When you've been successful at it and been able to push, it's hard to pull back the reins a little bit.   But several times they were making a run, and I thought we had some untimely turnovers.   But I never like turnovers, no matter when they are.  
   
 Q.   Coach, preliminarily what is Wisconsin's concern on Sunday?   
COACH BLUDER:   I watched them play Ohio State, but I was watching Ohio State.   We've been fairly successful at Wisconsin.   It's been a good road place for us to win.   I know they've won more games this year, I understand, than they have in the past in the Big Ten.   So they're obviously playing well.   
You know, Sam is from Wisconsin.   That means a lot to us whenever we play in someone else's home state.   We want to make them proud that they left their home state and chose us.   Megan Gustafson who is a recruit, obviously, that's come in next year.   You have Carly Mohns, you know.   We want to go up there and do well because it's been a good recruiting area for us, so we certainly want to shine there.
