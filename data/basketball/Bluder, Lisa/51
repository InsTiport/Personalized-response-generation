COACH BLUDER: They came out and played a great game.  Couldn't tell that that team was on a five-game losing streak.  They came out, inspired.  They came out with a little bit of a chip on their shoulder and they took it at us.  I thought they did a great job.  Obviously we got out-rebounded.  We gave up 50 percent of offensive rebounds.  We had to box out better, but it's our defense.  We just came out and played lackluster defense.  That concerns me.  But obviously we just have to go back to the drawing board and keep working on it and get ready for Purdue on Sunday.
