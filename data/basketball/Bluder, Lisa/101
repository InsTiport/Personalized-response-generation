 NEBRASKA   80
  IOWA - 67 
  
COACH BLUDER:   I'll start with the only positive thing, and that was the great crowd we had today, terrific support today, appreciate that very, very much.   So I want to thank everybody that came out today.   
Nebraska played very well.   I thought they really ran the ball extremely well.   
You know, we only had 11 turnovers, but they made us pay for the turnovers that we did have, and that's what good teams do.   When you turn the ball over, they are going to make you pay for it and they did that to us today.  
Laudermill, we just could not stay with her.   We did not have an answer for her.   Hooper is a great player as we all know, and we couldn't shut her down or even slow her down, either.   
But their defense obviously bothered us quite a bit, but I think it was their offense.   Their transition that kind of just took the wind out of our sails and just put us on our heels on both the offensive and the defensive side of things.   
   
 Q.   Laudermill, a player‑‑  
COACH BLUDER:   She's quick, but Penn State is pretty quick, too, that we play next.   I think she's just as fast.   But she's obviously very good.   
   
 Q.   Inaudible ‑‑  
COACH BLUDER;   19‑19 with seven minutes and we got tanked‑‑ you know, I can't really tell you right now about going back and looking at the film.   I know that they‑‑ we kind of just went cold.   We did not score very many points in that next series there, not getting stops or scores is tough.   And we had one offensive rebound at the half, not giving ourselves second chance opportunities that, was disappointing.   But I don't know, I can't tell you.  
   
 Q.   How does that affect you, you guys fell behind in the rest of the second half, trying to get back, the offense‑‑  
COACH BLUDER:   Well, I think sometimes we tried to take shots that we don't practice and I think that's‑‑ you're not going to make them.   
I mean, maybe once in awhile you're going to make them, but you know, you've got to stick to what you do, and I thought the first half, we went away from what we do and we tried to create things for ourselves instead of just letting the offense work.   
That's frustrating because you know 25 games into it, we should trust our offense, we should know that we are the No.1 scoring team in the Big Ten for a reason, and let it happen, instead of trying to create stuff.  
   
 Q.   With Penn State coming up, what will your message be to the team?   
COACH BLUDER:   Well, we obviously know we're up against the wall going to Penn State, No.1 team, Top 15 ranked team in the country.   They are a lot better than Nebraska on paper, so we know we've got a tough challenge going on the road to play at Penn State.   
Now, we've played well on the road.   We've played better on the road actually than we have at home so hopefully that will hold true.
