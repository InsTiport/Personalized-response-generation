Bradley - 53, Iowa - 60
LISA BLUDER: Well, obviously we're happy with the win, very happy with our defense.  I thought we did a great job defensively tonight.  Our rebounding was much better in the second half than it was in the first half.  The players did a great job with adjustment on that.
But obviously we need to score better and play consistently.  I feel like we had a nice first and third quarter, but our second and fourth quarters were sub-par. We've got to come out and play a 40-minute game. We know that Tuesday night against Drake we're going to have our hands full because you've got to outscore them.  They're an excellent offensive team.
Q. Can you tell us about the decision to make the change at point guard tonight?
LISA BLUDER: Just that we felt like Whitney wasn't playing to her potential, but surely -- I believe it's there.  I haven't lost faith in her.  As you can see, she played a lot of minutes for us.  We are trying to press some kind of button to get her into the player that we know she is.
It's not like Tania has been playing poorly by any means.  Tania has been playing well. We feel like we have two very good point guards and we can go with either one of them. Both of them can play on the floor at the same time, as well.
So I really think Whitney is going to bounce back.  I thought she came in and played a good game.  I thought she did some really good things today.
But we need that consistent play out of both Whitney and Tania.
Q. It's kind of a different week for you guys with finals and eight days in between games.  Do you anticipate maybe some offensive struggles in a game like that?
LISA BLUDER: You know, I don't.  I never anticipate offensive struggles.  I'm an offensive-minded coach, and at the beginning of the game I thought we took some really tough shots.  I thought Bradley was going to set a Carver-Hawkeye Arena record for blocked shots to begin the game.
We weren't taking good shots.  We were penetrating and just trying to shoot over the help instead of finding the open player, and then in the second half we quit doing that, and then we didn't knock down some good looks.  We have to work on our offense and continue to try to improve.
