OHIO STATE  Â– 61
  IOWA - 65

COACH BLUDER:   Well, good victory for us.   I understand this is the first time we've swept Ohio State since about '98, so that's good.   Good for our program.   We withheld when they went up 7, and we kept the faith, and we picked up our defense and forced them into 21 turnovers for this game.   Got us into fastbreak points which we're at our best when we do that. 
But the most important thing was it was Theairra's night.   It was the night for her.   It was a win for the Hawks.   Kept us in contention for a fourth place in the Big Ten, but most importantly, we wanted to honor Thea, and how fitting for us to win for her to have the game high and for her to have a season high tonight.   And she does it in so many different ways too:   Seven rebounds, four assists, four steals.   So I'm very, very happy for Thea.

Q.   You were talking about when you were down 7.   Theairra kind of took over those last 11 minutes.   I think she had ten points, steals, assists, the whole works.   Did you have a favorite moment for her in that stretch? 
COACH BLUDER:   I always love the steals that lead to baskets.   To me, that's a lot of fun.   So she got her hands up and she got her hands in the passing lane and the zone and made some great deflections, and she kept the ball in play.   She was able to find Melissa once on that long court pass, and that was fun.   But any time we get that steal, it's great.

Q.   Coach, talk about how important this win was? 
COACH BLUDER:   Yeah, I think some teams at this time of the year can start to feel pressure and then play not to lose instead of playing to enjoy the experience.   That was the last thing we told them in the huddle at halftime going out, enjoy the journey, enjoy the experience, have fun with it.   We don't just want to play.   We want this season to last as long as possible.   We want to enjoy every moment that we're out on the floor. 
So it was just a good reminder of that is just to not only win the game, but enjoy every moment that we're out there.   We're going to take that attitude into Illinois as well.
