Pepperdine   68
  Iowa - 97

LISA BLUDER:   Well, kind of a slow start to this game, but we got heated up, and I thought the last seven minutes of the first half was pretty good.   Second half, I thought we executed very well offensively.   We shot the ball well, except from the free‑throw line.   Need to improve on that area.   But four people in double figures.   Melissa, I thought shot the ball extremely well, obviously, look at the stat sheet from three‑point range, but tonight she overtakes Wendy Ausdemore, a great three‑point shooter for us, as No.4 on the all‑time list.   Nice to see her climbing up those charts.   But Ally had a double‑double.   That was nice to see.   I thought all of our freshmen played really well.   I think that our freshmen played really well.   I think that our freshmen took another step tonight growing up.   Every one of them.   I thought Chase did some great things defensively for us, Whitney had five assists, zero turnovers.   All of them shot the ball well.   Carly Mohns had seven points or six points in seven minutes including three rebounds, so that was nice to see. 
But now we have the rematch against Dayton tomorrow, and everybody is free to that game, so hopefully we'll have a good crowd. 

Q.   Were you happy with the minutes or would you like to get a little more rest?
LISA BLUDER:   I guess you always want a little more rest when you're playing back‑to‑back games.   I thought our bench played pretty well.   I think we outscored them 40‑12, the bench.   I thought our depth paid off for us today, but yeah, you know, you don't like to play that many minutes when you're playing back‑to‑back games, especially when tomorrow is going to be a race.   It's going to be a track meet tomorrow.

Q.   Are you surprised at the intensity tonight, especially in the first half from Pepperdine?
LISA BLUDER:   I thought Pepperdine came out and played very well.   I thought they played better live than watching them on film the last two games, and they're bigger, too, than they look on film.   So I was very impressed with the way ‑‑ and I think they caught us off guard a little bit to begin this game.
