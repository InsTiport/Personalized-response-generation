COACH BLUDER:   What can I say about Sam that hasn't already been said.   You know, just a great performance out there.   We really challenged our team with rebounding at halftime, specifically offensive rebounding‑‑ well, actually both ends of it.   
But for her to come out and get 17 rebounds in this game as a point guard, that's pretty amazing, a triple double, obviously tonight, she shot the ball well, 6‑for‑7.   So great performance right there.   
But second half, with a nice Christmas present first half, I wondered what was going on for a little bit.   I think we were kind of stuck in a Finals funk or something, but ‑‑ it wasn't pretty the first half, but the second half, I thought we played a lot better.   We dominated the paint, scored 46 points in the paint in this game, and we should have.   
But, you know, we had some good shooting performances in the second half.   
   
 Q.   Did you feel like in the first half, rebounding, I guess second half, too, you guys were playing home, that it presented difficulties‑‑ having difficulty boxing out?  
COACH BLUDER:   You know, it may be a little bit harder to box out in zone but I think it's an excuse.   We like our zone and we want to play zone.   One of the elements of completing the defense is to box out, and so if we want to play zone, we're going to have to box out better.   
   
 Q.   Are you concerned that you only shot four free throws tonight at all?  
COACH BLUDER:   I am.   I am concerned about that.   That's two games in a row that we have not gotten to the free throw line.   You know, we need to get there.   We need to draw fouls.   We weren't even in the bonus in the second half.   So, yeah, it's a little bit of an area of concern.   
   
 Q.   Do you coach any differently this week than last week?  
COACH BLUDER:   You know this week is a lot different because they go home and they don't have to study anymore.   
So I think they are excited about that.   But also for them to have the opportunity to go home is important for them over Christmas, and just hoping and praying that everyone gets home safely.   We'll return on the 26th.   We'll practice the 26th, 27th for our game on the 28th against North Dakota.  
   
 Q.   What do you see in the team before conference play‑‑  
COACH BLUDER:   I just want us to put two good halves executing well together.   Cleaning up a little bit of our mistakes as far as rebounding, and, you know, again, we do need to get to the line more, and that's a strength of ours when we get there.   So we need to get there more than our opponents are getting there and we are not‑‑ that's quite reversed at this point.   
   
 Q.   Any points that Sam could put out there that surprised you?   
COACH BLUDER:   I don't know, 17 rebounds, really, for a point guard, that's amazing.   That's amazing, and 6‑for‑7 shooting obviously is not forcing any bad shots, taking good shots.   I don't know‑‑ every game, though, I get an "oh, wow," moment, where I just stand up and applaud because it's so much fun to see what she did.  
   
 Q.   What was that moment today?  
COACH BLUDER:   I can't remember exactly but I had one.   I was on the bench and I was like, wow.   
   
 Q.   Is that when ‑‑  
COACH BLUDER:   Well, yeah, definitely, but it definitely happened during this game, as well.   
   
 Q.   When you have a tough week, how much do you worry that you're going to come out and struggle on offense or is that something you worry about?   
COACH BLUDER:   You know I really don't have any control over it.   I can't worry about it too much because they are going to go home.   You know, and some of them are going to find time to get into a gym and still shoot.  
And sometimes it's kind of nice to get away from it for a little bit.   It's good mentally to get away from it for a little bit and it's good physically to have a little bit of a break as well.   I actually expect them to come back with a little bit more legs than they did.   
Last year we came back and we played really well after the Christmas and we had that little bit of a break, so I think it can actually go the other way sometimes and actually give you a little bit more inspiration to just get that pep back in your step.
