Iowa   95
  Idaho State   47

COACH BLUDER:   Well, that was a really good second half.   I wasn't real happy with the way we started this game.   Obviously let them get open for too many three‑point shots.   Whether we played man or zone didn't matter, they were nailing their three‑point shots. 
I think it got our players' attention.   We did a much better job of covering them in the second half. 
Again, I thought our offense was good.   We distributed the ball well again.   28 assists on 31 baskets.   We shot the ball extremely well, except for from the free‑throw line. 
I liked the balance.   Again, Beth has a double‑double.   The assist column, the balance in the assist column, is really exciting because everybody is getting in the flow of passing the ball really well. 
THE MODERATOR:   Questions. 

Q.   17 three‑pointers.   New school record.   Team can shoot. 
COACH BLUDER:   Yeah.   We have fun doing it.   They work hard at it.   It's one of those contagious things, too.   Once they start flying in, it's easy for it to seem like the basket is getting bigger and bigger. 
I love watching the points score up like that.   That's fun. 

Q.   Everyone on the team have the green light to shoot?
COACH BLUDER:   Maybe not this one.   But pretty much. 
Our guards, all of our guards, are capable in shooting the three.   We work on it a lot.   So pretty much, yeah, everybody but our fives. 

Q.   Coach, 20 threes in the last three games.   Have you ever coached a player that's gone through a stretch like that?
COACH BLUDER:   I don't know.   I'm not good at remembering things like that in the past.   That definitely has to be one of the highlights.   Definitely a remarkable performance. 
It's just so effortless to watch her shoot, too.   It's fun.   You know, keep it up, keep throwing. 

Q.   When you combine that with Doolittle's inside presence, what can that do?
COACH BLUDER:   It's tremendous.   Because I think people have a hard time playing, in zone, like we've seen the last two games, because do you pack it in or do you stretch it out.   Either way we have an attack.   So I think it makes it very hard to zone us. 

Q.   Coach, there was a stretch during the second half where you had four starters on the bench.   How important was this game to get the rest of your team quality minutes during important times of the game?
COACH BLUDER:   Yeah, we were coming into the game hoping we could get all of our non‑starters some opportunities, some opportunities to get on the floor, get that game experience, to improve.   I think we were able to accomplish that today. 
Also it's good for our starters not to have so many minutes tonight when they're coming off a really tough game on Thursday. 

Q.   Iowa State coming up.   Comment on getting ready to face them again. 
COACH BLUDER:   I think it will be nice to have a day off tomorrow.   We haven't had a true day off for about two months where there's no school and no basketball and no travel. 
For the players, it will be nice to physically and mentally have a complete day off.   But then we'll have three days to prepare for Iowa State.   That's a little bit longer than we usually get to prepare for opponents.   I think that's good. 
I don't have to worry at all about getting our team up to play.   I just have to say Iowa State, they'll show up.
