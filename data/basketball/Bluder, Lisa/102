Michigan State   87
  Iowa   72

LISA BLUDER:   I'm extremely disappointed in the way we played this game, especially the first half.   I need to apologize to our fans that came out tonight.   We had 4,200 people here and did not give them a dollar's worth of entertainment on buck night.   It was embarrassing to get down that much on our home court against a good team.   Obviously a good team, but that's what the Big Ten is all about. 
Michigan State played very well.   They shot the ball well, but obviously we didn't defend that well, didn't rebound well, didn't shoot the ball well.   If you don't do one of those things well, you're in trouble, and we didn't do any of those three things well. 
But again, I thought Michigan State did a great job.   They've got a very quick team, excellent shooters.   They defend hard.   They play with a lot of emotion.   They play hard.   They're an excellent basketball team, and we can learn a lot from them. 

Q.   You mentioned earlier that they were getting healthy, so how big of a difference is Michigan State when they are healthy compared to when they were dealing with the injuries?
LISA BLUDER:   They lose to IPFW.   Do you know where IPFW is?   Indiana Purdue‑Fort Wayne.   That's a lot of initials.   They lose to them, they beat us on our home court. 

Q.   Are you bothered more by the offense or defense tonight or both?
LISA BLUDER:   Both.   I think we were suffering in all areas tonight, rebounds, defense, offense.   It was just the whole picture.   You know, we didn't take care of the ball and gave them a lot of high‑percentage shots, and when you do that, that builds your confidence, and when you get rewarded with good defense and a lay‑up, you just intensify your defense even more.   We were making crazy passes, passes to the green jerseys.   We were just making hope passes out there instead of making logical, good basketball decisions, and we just dug ourselves a big hole.
Obviously at home sometimes you can get yourselves out of those holes, but they're a good team, and again, we didn't shoot the ball well.   If you want to beat a good team, you've got to shoot free throws well, you've got to make lay‑ups.   There's such a small margin of error when you're playing against a very good basketball team.

Q.   When did you start to feel not good about things? 
LISA BLUDER:   You know, when we were turning the ball over so much in the first half.   I didn't feel good about it right then.   And it was crazy turnovers, just throwing into a crowd of people or hope passes is what I like to call them because you're just hoping that a white jersey is going to catch it.   Yeah, I don't know why.   I can't explain why.   I thought that our practices were good coming up to this.   I thought our pregame shootaround was good.   I don't know what happened.   Maybe it was just they were that good defensively, and it just got to us that much. 

Q.   Do you want them to move on or do you want them to feel this for a while?
LISA BLUDER:   It's got to bug you.   I think if you're a competitor, it's got to really tick you off.   That's what drives you.   If it doesn't hurt, you're not learning anything from it.   If you don't watch this film and learn from it, then it's a complete waste of time.   You've got to take losses, and in my opinion you analyze that film and try and get better and better and better from it, and it's got to tick you off so much that you can't wait to get back on the practice floor and use it as a motivation. 
In my mind if you don't attack a loss like that, then you might as well hang it up because you don't have the competitor's edge anymore.   You don't have a competitive mindset anymore.

Q.   Coach, there was a period in the first half, Logic got two fouls and you took her out.   I think she was out for like a minute and a half and they railed off a 7‑0 run.   Do you worry about your team when she's not on the floor?
LISA BLUDER:   Oh, yeah, absolutely, absolutely.   We love to have Sam on the floor.   She's our leader.   She's our floor general, and we need to have her on the floor, so absolutely. 

Q.   Coach, the two freshmen had a nice stretch there scoring in the second half.   I think they scored 16 in a row for you guys.   Is that something you can take out of this?
LISA BLUDER:   Yeah, I think that is‑‑ way to find a bright spot.   I appreciate that.   Yeah, but our freshmen‑‑ you know, and it was kind of out of hand at that point so there was not a lot of pressure at that point.   It would be nice to get them playing like that during crunch time.   But at the same time they still did it.   They still did it, and they didn't give up, so that's a good thing.
