COACH BLUDER:   Really good victory tonight.   I thought we made it a little hard at the end.   We missed a couple of free throws there and got careless against the press a little bit.   But at the same time, Northwestern is a good team, much‑improved team over their past.   I'm thrilled at the five players in double figures, that we out‑rebounded them, we scored very well tonight.   Our defense obviously has a little to be desired tonight, but at the same time we did what it takes to win, and that's the most important thing.   We've got this week off, this important week off to a good start.   
   
 Q.   How tough are milestone games like this?  
COACH BLUDER:   Really you don't think about them once they get going.   You think about it because you guys ask.   But other than that you really don't spend a whole lot of time thinking about it.   You're preparing for Northwestern.   You're trying to get your team ready to play Northwestern, and that's the most important thing.   
   
 Q.   Now that it's over (inaudible)?  
COACH BLUDER:   We're not going to do this next game?   No, there really was no way.   We're going to get it, right, it's just a matter of time.   We just wanted it sooner rather than later, so there was really no wait at all.  
   
 Q.   What do you do to injure adjustment?  
COACH BLUDER:   She is a very difficult match‑up just because she's so athletic and they're playing her out of position because she's really a wing player playing in the 5 position, so it's a very hard match‑up.   She did a great job tonight.   She's a very good player.   
   
 Q.   Coach, what does this milestone mean?   
COACH BLUDER:   You know, when I came here 14 years ago, I was just thankful that Dr.Grant gave me a five‑year contract and that I was going to be around for five years, and that's all I really thought about at the time.   I'm very thankful to her, Jan and Jenni who have been here the whole time, they deserve so much of this because they have been a part of every single one of these victories, and I couldn't think of two better people to go through it with.   So I'm very thankful for their friendship and their loyalty over all these years.   Both of them have had opportunities and they've believed and they've stayed here, so I'm very thankful for them.   Then you think about all the kids, Lindsey Meder came up, that was very cool to see Lindsey on the video board because you really think about all the kids you get to coach, which makes it very fun.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
COACH BLUDER:   Yeah, that was a surprise to see‑‑ well, the whole thing was a surprise actually, but you know, Vivian is just‑‑ she's such a great coach.   She's a Hall of Famer.   She's a person that got this program started in the right direction, and I'm just glad that we have a friendship.   I'm glad that we can‑‑ we share some similar experiences.   We both sat in that seat for a lot of years, and we both love this place immensely.   It was pretty special to have her on there.   
   
 Q.   Sam had a triple‑double last week.   Do you think she was even better tonight?  
COACH BLUDER:   I know, she only had a double‑double.   She's slacking, isn't she?   She's slacking on us.   Yeah, you were a couple rebounds away, I think.   Yeah, two rebounds away from a triple‑double.   You know, Sam to me‑‑ I just have never coached a kid like this before at the point guard, and she's so much fun because I really feel like in every game we're in control.   She does so many things for us in so many different areas, I really consider myself fortunate to be able to coach her.   
   
 Q.   Were you wearing those reading glasses when the streak started?   
COACH BLUDER:   I was not.   I was not.
