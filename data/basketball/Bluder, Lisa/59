North Dakota - 61 Iowa - 83
LISA BLUDER: I liked our second half a lot better than our first half.  But I think we turned it around the second half.  In the first half we were in such a hurry, and we weren't sticking to what Iowa basketball is all about. I'm really happy that we went into halftime, we talked about it, and the team came out and made adjustments. That is outstanding.
