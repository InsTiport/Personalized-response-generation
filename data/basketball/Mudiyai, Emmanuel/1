 Q.  To go in China, was it a very good idea a few months later?  
EMMANUEL MUDIAY: Yeah, I mean, it helped me out.  I don't want to say that's the reason why (indiscernible) at the same time.   
 Q.  It was a good decision?  
EMMANUEL MUDIAY: Yeah, it was a good decision.   
 Q.  How can you see your progress during the few months?  
EMMANUEL MUDIAY: It's grown, it's growing.  Just got to keep getting better, take every day one day at a time and just keep going.   
 Q.  How are you getting used to the weather here?  
EMMANUEL MUDIAY: Oh, it's definitely cold.  It's different.  But coming from Denver now, I'm kind of used to it a little bit.   
 Q.  Have you ever made any friends here?  
EMMANUEL MUDIAY: Where?  In Denver?   
 Q.  Here.  
EMMANUEL MUDIAY: I've got some family out here, but they're in Montreal.  I mean, not friends, but family out here.   
 Q.  Are you excited about this All-Star Game?  
EMMANUEL MUDIAY: Yeah, it should be fun.  Just go out there and have fun with it.   
 Q.  (Inaudible)?  
EMMANUEL MUDIAY: It's just about having fun, go out there and play with some of the best young players in the world, and compete at the highest level.   
 Q.  Do you miss something from China?  
EMMANUEL MUDIAY: Yeah, the fans.  The fans are great.  Actually, they have a big thing to do with this All-Star too, so you've got to be very appreciative of the fans.   
 Q.  How's is your injury recovering now?  
EMMANUEL MUDIAY: It's good, getting better and better.  Just keep rehabbing and getting better.   
 Q.  How are you getting along with your team?  
EMMANUEL MUDIAY: Good, good, everything's a growing process.  It's my first year in the NBA, so as long as we keep growing, it will be good.   
 Q.  Do you have anything to say to the Chinese fans?  
EMMANUEL MUDIAY: I love the Chinese fans.  I miss you guys, and hopefully next year we'll be going to some games.
