CHRIS PAUL:   Early we couldn't keep them off the free‑throw line and I think I got in a nice rhythm.  
   
 Q.   You guys go up by two, what happened at the end there?   Blake has the ball, gets the turnover.   Was there just a lot happening, or if you can explain what happened at the end of the game.   
CHRIS PAUL:   I don't know.   I'll watch it again and see.   I tried to get back on Patty Mills and contest without fouling, and then I missed a shot I should have made there to win the game.   
   
 Q.   Chris, what kind of learning experience do you get out of there?   You're playing the reigning champs and have such a close game, difficult game.   What do you guys take out of that?  
CHRIS PAUL:   We've got to finish.   We've been talking about it all season long.   We had an opportunity here to win a game, go up 2‑0 and didn't take full advantage of it.   We've got to execute down the stretch.   That's on me.   In overtime we've got to defend better, so I've got to do a better job of making sure my guys are ready.   
   
 Q.   What do you tell DeAndre after a game like this where he played so well but obviously the free throw issues?  
CHRIS PAUL:   Nothing.   Tell him to keep doing what he's doing and get ready for Game 3, just like all of us.   We win as a team, we lose as a team.   D.J. is fine.   We'll be ready Game 3.   
   
 Q.   Talk about as far as going on the road and how tough is it playing in San Antonio?   What will you guys have to do in order to come out victorious?  
CHRIS PAUL:   It's tough.   We'll have to be poised.   We won't have the crowd behind us like we did here, but we've shown the ability to win there, but their team is not going to beat themselves, you've got to go out there and beat them, and we've got to come in ready for Game 3.  
   
 Q.   You talked about you've shown you can win there.   You guys have done a good job bouncing back.   During the year you were good on the road.   Can you draw on that?  
CHRIS PAUL:   Totally different game in the postseason.   You've got to go in there and you've got to win it.   You've got to go take it.  
   
 Q.   Is a loss like this a little bit tougher to take when you guys overcome a 10‑point lead in the fourth quarter, catch them, and then you still lose the game?  
CHRIS PAUL:   Yeah, it's tough, but we've got to get past it.   We can't go back there and play it over again, so get past that, it's 1‑1.   We know we've got to win the game there.
