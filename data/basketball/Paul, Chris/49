 Q.  What does it mean to be at this All-Star Game here in New Orleans? 
 CHRIS PAUL:  It means a lot.  Like I said before, I felt as if I made the All-Star team the rest of the time I'm in the NBA, this year is special that I get to share it with one of my teammates in David West, and one of my coaches coaching us. 

 Q.  Do you feel like you're an All-Star this year? 
 CHRIS PAUL:  Man, I still can't believe it, to tell you the truth.  It's such a great group of players, especially in the Western Conference.  So many great guards.  To be selected by the coaches is an honor. 

 Q.  You're having a great season with the Hornets. 
 CHRIS PAUL:  Yeah.  We haven't been healthy the past two years, so it's great to get out there and play with guys like Peja Stojakovic and David West.  Right now I feel like we're playing some of our best basketball, but the real test will be how we do after the All-Star break. 

 Q.  What have you learned living here in New Orleans, about the community?  I know you've been active in it. 
 CHRIS PAUL:  I love New Orleans more and more every day, to tell you the truth.  I tell people a lot of time it's the people that make the city, and not any of the buildings or the streets or anything like that. 
 But the people have been so supportive of our team since we've returned.  They could have easily turned their backs on us, because there are more responsibilities than us winning basketball games, but they haven't. 

 Q.  Why have you felt a commitment to being involved in the community more than the average player?  Do you think you're willing to do more here because they're needed more here? 
 CHRIS PAUL:  I feel like people here in New Orleans are my family.  When I was drafted, I was drafted here to New Orleans, and the storm hit maybe a month after.  So I felt the devastation.  Like I said, I felt like these people are my family.  Just like anyone in your immediate family, you want to help them as much as possible, and that's how it's been since day one. 

 Q.  We're only here for a few days, but do you think some of the stuff that's going on this afternoon and over the weekend has an impact? 
 CHRIS PAUL:  Oh, yeah.  It has a huge impact.  When the storm hit, there was a lot of attention on the city.  And then afterwards, it's one of those things that it's out of sight, out of mind.  People don't talk about it as much, so you don't think about it as much.  But with the All-Star weekend, this is the basketball mecca for the universe for the weekend.  And the day of service that's taking place today will be more impact than the game on Sunday.
