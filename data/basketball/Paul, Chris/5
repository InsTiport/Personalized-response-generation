THE MODERATOR: Questions.
Q. James, can you take us through the injury, how you dealt with it, how painful it was, how difficult it was to get back out there.  What was it like playing with it?
JAMES HARDEN: Sure.  I can barely see.  Just tried to go out there and do what I can to help my teammates.
Q. Are you concerned with it being a problem going forward?
JAMES HARDEN: I don't know.  It's pretty blurry right now.  Hopefully it gets better day by day.
Q. Chris, for a series this tight, is it going to come down to things like offensive rebounds, turnovers, taking care of the ball?
CHRIS PAUL: Look like it right now.  They got 91 shots, we got 77 up.  Obviously we see we got to be better on the glass, take better care of the ball.  That's something we did well most of the season and we haven't done well in the first two games.
Q. How do you handle this going forward, down 0-2?
CHRIS PAUL: How we handle it?  Get ready for Game 3.  You know what I mean?  We going back home.  We understand that's all we need to worry about right now, is Game 3.
Get some rest, get back home, get in front of our crowd and get out there and play Game 3.
Q. Turnovers were a huge issue in the first quarter.  Why do you think you were so sloppy to start this one?
CHRIS PAUL: I don't know.  We just turned the ball over.  You know what I mean?  It happens.  I haven't had a chance to look at the game yet.  When I do, I'll probably have better answers for you.
We just got to be sharper, be better.
Q. Draymond was in here saying all the ref chatter the last couple days was embarrassing for the game.  He felt like both teams tonight cut that out.  Do you agree?
CHRIS PAUL: I don't know.  I was chilling.
JAMES HARDEN: What ref chatter?
Q. That became the storyline of the series.
JAMES HARDEN: There was no chatter.
CHRIS PAUL: Yeah, I don't know.  We was trying to get ready for Game 2, so...
Q. After what y'all went through, you still cut it to three...
CHRIS PAUL: I had a wide-open look right there with just under a minute left.  If that shot goes down, I'm sure we're feeling good.  We go down, not foul.  They doubled James, got a wide-open look, got to knock that down.
Q. What does that say about the team?
CHRIS PAUL: No moral victories over here.  0-2, you know what I mean?  Doesn't say nothing.  We lost.
Q. James, we can tell the lights are bothering your eyes.  Did you have trouble with your vision on the court?
JAMES HARDEN: Can't see nothing.  Barely can see.
Q. I can't hear you.
JAMES HARDEN: Barely can see.
Q. Were you able to get any relief from drops or anything else?
JAMES HARDEN: Yeah, they put a couple drops.
CHRIS PAUL: He whooped out, look like Thriller.
JAMES HARDEN: A couple drops to help it, numb it a little bit.  All the lights was blurry, yeah.
Q. They can't put more drops in because it might damage the tissue, is that either?
JAMES HARDEN: Correct.
CHRIS PAUL: Dang, you're a doctor, too.
Q. Sleeping is really tough, by the way.
JAMES HARDEN: Thank you.  Appreciate that (laughter).
CHRIS PAUL: Whooped out, man.
Q. Draymond said he went over to you after the injury.  He said this is not about hurting somebody out there.  Talk about what he said to you.
JAMES HARDEN: I mean, what you want me to say?  He asked me if I was all right.  I was like, Yeah.
CHRIS PAUL: He's checking on his 'me'.
