  Q.  Can you talk a little bit about your experience tonight playing in the game?   
 CHRIS PAUL:  It was a lot of fun, especially after participating last year as a rookie.  We got beat.  As sophomores, we didn't want to let that happen again.  We felt like we were veterans coming into this game tonight.   
  
  Q.  What's the difference coming in as a sophomore versus a rookie?   
 CHRIS PAUL:  As a rookie you see all the bright lights.  I never played a nationally televised game as a rookie.  I never knew what to expect.  This year we knew what to expect and we knew what we had to do to get a win.
