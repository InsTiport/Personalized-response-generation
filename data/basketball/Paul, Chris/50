 CHRIS PAUL:  Las Vegas is going to attract a lot of people without the All-Star Game.  So when you put it all together this has the potential to be one of the biggest weekends ever in the All-Star history. 

 Q.  Do you have to pick and choose the way you spend your time? 
 CHRIS PAUL:  Well, you don't really get to decide.  You pretty much have a set schedule.  Just about everyone has somewhere to be at all times. 
 And I have my family out here, so I'm just going to soak it all in. 

 Q.  Is there a specific part of this weekend that you're looking forward to the most? 
 CHRIS PAUL:  This Rookie/Sophomore Game tonight.  We lost last year, so this is an opportunity to redeem ourselves.
