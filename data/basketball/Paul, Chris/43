Q.   How much do you have to change your game to play with another guard?
CHRIS PAUL:   I don't have to change that much.   I don't have to change that much.   Kobe is a really good shooter.   He can shoot the ball really well.   So me creating and getting to the lane and kicking it out and stuff like that, he's able to shoot open shots.   It's fun playing off our game. 

Q.   How much do you enjoy playing with (inaudible)? 
CHRIS PAUL:   Man, it's going to be a lot of fun.   I don't think we played much together last year, but now knowing him a little bit better and playing in the Allâ€‘Star Game, especially with all the other guys on the court, you know, if you help him with a dunk, now you're leaving Kevin Durant wide open for a three, so you've got to pick your poison. 

Q.   You brought your son here.   What's it like for you to have him here?
CHRIS PAUL:   Oh, it's everything.   My son is one of a kind.   I'm sure everybody says that about their kids.   But he knows who Kobe is.   I got home during a playoff game last year, and he had a playoff booklet, and he said, "Kobe."   I looked at my wife, like how does he know who he is.   He knows Blake, he knows what number he wears.   He's figured out who Russell Westbrook is now.   It's fun to bring him here to be a part of it.
