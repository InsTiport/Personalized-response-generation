 Q. You picked some stuff up from him?
 CHRIS PAUL: Yeah, I tried to. 

 Q. (Inaudible). 
 CHRIS PAUL: I don't know, man. Sometimes that's why I say the All-Star thing can be overrated at times. You talk about it's progress, it's our fifth year. He's been playing great since we came in the league. I guess here he's a first-time All-Star, but everybody knows that knows the league knows he was an All-Star longer than just this year.

 Q. Can you talk about the value of chemistry?
 CHRIS PAUL: Chemistry is very important, very important. It's more than how you play on the court. It's what your relationships are like off the court. Whatever is going on off the court, a lot of times a teammate will bring it on the court, if you have a strong bond with this guy to make you want to compete for him, with him a little bit harder. 
 Our team is fine. We have a great chemistry with everyone. We've just got to figure out how to do it on a nightly basis.

 Q. Was it difficult after the coaching change?
 CHRIS PAUL: Initially. Initially it was. I had never had a different coach since I had been in the league, so initially it was a little adjustment. I got hurt the first game. Coach didn't coach. So when I came back we had somewhat of a new offense, but it clicked. Everything is working fine.
