Clippers   124
  Rockets - 99

Q.   How did you feel throughout the game?   Did you feel better or worse or how is the hamstring?
CHRIS PAUL:   I got through.   I got through.   This is the point of the season where nobody is 100 percent.   If I could give anything to get out there and help the team, then I wanted to do it and, cool. 

Q.   Conditioning was good?   Was it just tight at all? 
CHRIS PAUL:   I got through it. 

Q.   How much did Austin Rivers' performance tonight take the pressure off you in your series debut?
CHRIS PAUL:   Austin was unbelievable.   I was probably his biggest cheerleader there in the third quarter, because you just love to see that.   He's been working really hard, and I just remember, like Game 2, he was really hard on himself towards the end of the game. 
So to see him bounce back like that, I just kept saying, I don't want to play anymore if I don't have to.   And seeing him do that, it gave me a chance to rest. 

Q.   How would you characterize the fans' energy in the Playoffs?
CHRIS PAUL:   Fans have been amazing.   Like we said going into the Playoffs, we have to give them a reason to cheer, and that third quarter was amazing. 
To see our bench, to see the crowd, to see the energy, that's what it's all about.   It's great to be a part of it.

Q.   There was one point where you told Doc, it's okay to be the dad and not a coach, and he's tried hard not to do that. 
CHRIS PAUL:   Why y'all got to be knowing all that? 

Q.   He's got a mic or you've got a mic‑‑
CHRIS PAUL:   I don't have a mic.

Q.   Anyways, it was on TV.   How important was that just to kind of see him kind of enjoy that moment as a dad?
CHRIS PAUL:   It was cool, because we talk about it as a team all the time.   It's got to be an odd dynamic to be coach, dad, son, all that. 
Doc is hard on him.   I mean, Doc is real hard on him.   To see that during the game, you know, I think about my parents with the game and stuff like that, and that was impressive, 17 in the third, to break away in a big game like that, I just told him, you can put the other hat on for a second.

Q.   How did it feel to be back out there after having to sit out two games?
CHRIS PAUL:   Man, it felt great.   My nerves weren't as bad.   It's actually harder sitting out.   I was stressed out sitting on that bench Game 1 and Game 2, so it was fun to get out there and be a part of the action. 

Q.   At any point did it tighten up or loosen up, your hamstring, during the course of the game?
CHRIS PAUL:   I got through it.
