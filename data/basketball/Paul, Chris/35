CHRIS PAUL:   Just tried to make it as tough as possible for him.   Still finished with 40.   Just tried to crowd him.   
   
 Q.   Chris, you have had some pretty big comeback victories this year.   This is the playoffs.   Where does this rank?   How terrific was it for you guys?  
CHRIS PAUL:   This is one of the best ones yet.   We got off to a very slow start.   Even there in the fourth quarter, we could have relaxed, you know, gave in at any point.   
I think we just willed this one.   It's a really good team.   We found a way.   Darren Collison was amazing today.   If you see us during the game, probably saw me going nuts on him a couple times there at the end.   You take the good with the bad.   
I don't think I've ever had a relationship with somebody like I have with D.C. because we both push each other and motivate each other.   Maybe because I was a rookie with him in New Orleans.   You just got to love a guy like that who plays with so much heart and never gives up.   
Game ball goes to Darren Collison.   
   
 Q.   Chris, you were able to break out there towards the end.   How are you able to do that in the playoffs when everything slows down so much?   
CHRIS PAUL:   That's one thing that Doc stays on me a lot.   Keep the pace.   Keep the pace.   It's one thing we struggled with all season long.   If you see, when other teams score at times, we try to put our head down and see whose fault it was.   
Tonight we kept going, tried to chip away.   It worked tonight.   
   
 Q.   Doc says one of the reasons he doesn't like you on Durant for more than moments at a time is because it takes so much out of you physically.   How much harder is that matchup?  
CHRIS PAUL:   I mean, it's tough.   He was the MVP for a reason, you know what I mean.   Early in this game when things weren't going right, I went onto Doc and said, Might be 48 minutes tonight.   KD is a great scorer.   I don't know.   It's tough at times 'cause you try and defend him as well as trying to be aggressive offensively.   
Same thing I went through last series.   At the end of the day you just got to do whatever it takes to win.   
   
 Q.   Chris, this was your biggest comeback of the year.   What type of momentum does it give you heading into Tuesday's game?  
CHRIS PAUL:   I mean, at the end of the day we're going to start that game off 0‑0.   We're going into their place.   I think we got to bring that same energy and mindset, not the one we started off with, but just understanding that sometimes you just got to impose your will, just play hard.
