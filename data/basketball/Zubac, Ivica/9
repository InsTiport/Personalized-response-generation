THE MODERATOR: If you could start out with an opening statement, feelings about being picked by the Lakers and what you bring to the team.   
IVICA ZUBAC: I'm really surprised.  I didn't hope for this, but this is the best possible option.  I think I can bring my low-post play to the Lakers, and I think I can help them in the paint and protecting the paint and grabbing rebounds, and I think that will help them.   
 Q.  What do you think is going to be your biggest adjustment?  And what do you feel is going to be -- how do you feel that such a prestigious organization drafted you and thinks so highly of you?  
IVICA ZUBAC: From the day I started playing basketball, the Lakers were my favorite team, and Kobe was my favorite player.  I cannot believe this is happening.  I'm so happy right now.   
 Q.  Does it hurt a little bit knowing you won't be able to team with Kobe since he's retired?  
IVICA ZUBAC: Yeah, before this draft I was thinking like I'm coming to the league and Kobe is going out.  I won't be able to play against him or with him.  But I will be on the Lakers, so I think I will meet him.
