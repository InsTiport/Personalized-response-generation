Clippers 130, Mavericks 122
THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Ivica.
Q. Zu, you played a season-high 30 minutes today.  Looked like Doc tried to match your minutes up with Boban.  What worked for you with that matchup?  How did that change the game?
IVICA ZUBAC:   Doc told us before the game, me and Trez, that he was going to try to match my minutes with Boban.  I think I got the size to fight a battle with Boban underneath the basket.  Whatever our coach wants us to do we're going to do it.  Whoever he wants me to guard, I'm going to do it.
I'm happy to play my role, happy to help this team win.
Q. You came out defensively, looked really locked in, set the tone.  Did Doc say anything going into the game?  What changed from last game?
IVICA ZUBAC:   Game 2, they were doing everything with ease.  We weren't physical.  That was a big emphasis going into Game 3, to be more physical, to get them out of their stuff, out of their plays.
I think we did it from the beginning.  We set a tone.  That helped us win the game.
Q. You made some adjustments with your pick'n roll defense today, switching off the ball.  Why was that so effective and why did that work?
IVICA ZUBAC:   I think being on Finney-Smith help us more because it puts me in a low man position a lot.  I can help a lot.  I think that's the biggest reason.  He's in a corner, I get to be in a low man position more.  Rather have him take threes than Porzingis.  I think that was a good strategy for us.
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
