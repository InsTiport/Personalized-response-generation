MAVERICKS   89
  ALBA - 84

COACH RICK CARLISLE:   The game was very competitive.   We really struggled in the game taking care of the ball because of how they played us.   Even though we won the game, they made the game a lot more the way they wanted to play it than we did, so I give their players and coaches a tremendous amount of credit for that.   This is an extremely well‑coached team.   Their guys play extremely hard, and they're very tough‑minded. 
I was very impressed with their team, and I'm very happy that we won the game.   But we've obviously got a lot of work to do.   When you get 27 turnovers, if you're an NBA team that thinks you have a chance for anything, that's an unacceptable number. 
But again, the way Alba played had a lot to do with that, and we've got to do better. 

Q.   Just some thoughts on Kaman and Collison, especially in the second half and how they played in the fourth quarter?
COACH RICK CARLISLE:   Yeah, Collison played a terrific all‑around game, good floor game, got the ball in the basket at key times, and he did the kind of things that we had hoped that he could do for us when we acquired him in the trade with Indiana. 
Kaman got off to a slow start in the game, was out of rhythm, struggled with some turnovers, got him out, and then when he went back in, he worked his way back into the game.   In the second half he was really dominant on the offensive end.   His scoring, very negative few plays and west hitting the shot and some other guys making some plays really carried us. 
I was really pleased with the way Kaman got himself back into the game after a tough start. 

Q.   Was Dirk, do you think, having a little nerves there coming back home, the way he played? 
COACH RICK CARLISLE:   You know, I don't think so.   I just‑‑ they had a really good game plan.   They wanted to scramble the game up.   They wanted to get us playing frantic.   They did a great job of it for different parts of the game. 
You know, when we had to make plays, we did, and when we had to get stops, we were able to do it.   But Dirk is beyond getting nervous.   When his shots were there, they were in the slot.   That wasn't it at all.   We have got a team with a bunch of new guys, and that was evident tonight.   You know, it's my job to get these guys playing together better, and that's what we've got to do in the next couple days before the next game because these games aren't getting any easier.

Q.   Do you think anything yet about Ronny? 
COACH RICK CARLISLE:   Sprained ankle is what I understand.   I do not know the severity of it.   We'll see how he's doing and update everybody probably in two days.   We don't have anything scheduled for tomorrow. 
But the hope is that it's not serious, obviously. 

Q.   Just a quick word on how your rookies performed tonight. 
COACH RICK CARLISLE:   Yeah, there were some real important bright spots in the game.   I thought the way crowder played in short minutes and the way Bernard James played in short minutes were key for us.   We can't play Dirk in 10‑ or 12‑minute stretches.   He plays so hard, he gets gassed, so we have to be able to spell him.   I thought Brand played well, too.   The two rookies showed their poise, and they showed that they're four‑year guys.   In Bernard's case, he's one of the oldest rookies you'll ever see at age 27, and you could tell, he wasn't scared out there, and neither was crowder. 

Q.   Is this the role you kind of see Vince Carter having to play on this team, especially with what they were able to do in the first half off the bench?
COACH RICK CARLISLE:   Yeah, I thought Vince was terrific.   He came in and hit three threes in a row which was huge for us because we were struggling early.   And as far as how we're going to replace Jason Terry, we're going to have to do it by committee.   It's not going to be just one guy.   Mayo is going to have to give some and west is going to have to give some and Vince.   You saw Marion tonight.   Marion was probably the best player on the court in terms of making plays, making timely plays defensively and offensively.   He's the only guy in double figures in rebounds, hit two or three big shots, and so, you know, we're going to have to be a true team to be as successful as we want to be.
