   LUKE WALTON: We're trying to keep it light, keep our minds somewhat free. But we're excited to get going here. Now we finally have the game coming tomorrow, and it's going to be a fun, hard series.   
  
  Q. Do you feel like home-court advantage this year gives you that little something extra that you need?  
 LUKE WALTON: It does. We learned the hard way last year, home-court advantage, how important that is. Ultimately it's not going to come down to that. It's is going to be whoever is playing better basketball. But in a tough series it's proved throughout the whole playoffs that home court definitely helps.  
  
  Q. You've been here before. Is that a factor in your favor?  
 LUKE WALTON: Yeah, it definitely helps, because there's nothing like being in the NBA Finals. And being here before, including last year, sometimes that excitement can be a little overwhelming. I think this year our guys are a lot more even keel going into it and more focused on not just being here but winning the championship.   
  
  Q. How tough was it slowing down the pace? I mean, you guys were playing almost every other night for the first rounds. How tough was it slowing down?  
 LUKE WALTON: It was difficult, because like you said, we were playing every other night, and your body starts adjusting to that routine, keeping that high level of intensity up the whole time. At the same time it was kind of nice because a lot of our guys have some bruises and some nagging injuries that it was nice to have a couple days to let those things relax a little bit. But now we started to ramp it back up and we'll be ready for tomorrow night.
