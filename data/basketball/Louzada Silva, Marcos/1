Q. How would you describe your style of play?
MARCOS LOUZADA SILVA: The best part of my game is defense.  I like to play on both sides of the floor. My shooting has improved really well.
Q. (No microphone).
MARCOS LOUZADA SILVA: I'm grateful to be able to play at the national team.  I also played with [Leandro] Barbosa and Anderson Varejao, who also played in the NBA.  So I got a lot of experience of playing with these guys playing at a high level at a young age.
Q. What is your feeling about getting picked?  You're the 14th Brazilian guy that got drafted.
MARCOS LOUZADA SILVA: I'm speechless.  I speak for my family, especially for my grandmother that passed away a couple months ago.  I'm really happy because my mother is here with me in the USA for the first time.  So I'm really happy.
