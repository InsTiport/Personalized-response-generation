Q.   Both you and John are No.2.   Who's going to wear No.2 tonight?
KYRIE IRVING:   Both of us.   I don't think any fouls are being called tonight, so I don't think the numbers will matter. 

Q.   Are those new shoes?
KYRIE IRVING:   These are the new shoes from Nike for the All‑Star team. 

Q.   What's the most important thing you learned from your father?
KYRIE IRVING:   Just to listen, mainly to him, honestly.   He gave me a lot of criticism when I was growing up, and I needed it to help me grow mentally.   Coach K taught me a lot.   We had a professional program, and I really enjoyed myself. 

Q.   What's the most surprising part about the All‑Star weekend for you?
KYRIE IRVING:   Just the overall atmosphere, the hotel here, everywhere you go, there's a whole bunch of people everywhere.   Like I said, it's overwhelming.
