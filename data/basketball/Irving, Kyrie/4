 Q.  What's it like for you to be a teammate of LeBron again?  
KYRIE IRVING: It's pretty awesome, man.   
 Q.  When you saw him today, what was the conversation?  
KYRIE IRVING: Just normal.  Sorry, I know that sounds like not a lot, but it's just normal.   
 Q.  What's the memory about the last time the Celtics won the title [in 2008]?  
KYRIE IRVING: Well, they beat my favorite player, they beat Kobe [Bryant] in that Finals.  Before I even got to the league I was mad at the Celtics for a little bit just because of how mad and pissed off Kobe was after they lost and seeing him up there.   
Now that I get the chance to play for the historic franchise, you know, it's pretty awesome.  I take full advantage of trying to learn as much as possible about the history because now I'm part of a long lineage of Celtics players.  I have a unique responsibility to uphold the tradition of Celtic pride.   
It's been a learning experience for me, and I'm glad I get to be part of it.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible)?  
KYRIE IRVING: You said my team?  I don't get caught up in that.  For me, it's just about getting as much knowledge about my teammates, gaining experience, teaching each other, learning from each other and trying to prepare for going after things that are bigger than ourselves.   
So it's tough when you're coming in and there is so much newness.  You want to put your identity on a lot of things.  You just have to have a lot of patience.  It's just a real big test for me of being in this unique role here in Boston now.   
 Q.  Is it an overstatement to say that Al Horford has been helping you redefine your position?  
KYRIE IRVING: I think along with Al and along with other guys, we're having the normal, prototypical four-man and knowing the roles and kind of having an idea of what they should be doing.  I think it's changing along with guard play.   
I mean, just the game is getting better in very unique ways.  Guys are stepping away more, playing more perimeter based, creating a lot more opportunities of playing behind the three-point line and being a threat.  It just opens up a lot more spacing for your team.  So Al being part of our team does that.   
 Q.  How does that happen?  
KYRIE IRVING: It creates a lot more space.  So coming off the screen-and-roll, he's able to roll to the rim as well as pop back and shoot the jumper.  He's a threat for me, for our whole team.   
 Q.  What's it like to be on the court with that much talent?  
KYRIE IRVING: Well, I was telling some of the guys that this was, for me, myself, Russ, K.D., A.D., and LeBron, and it's probably one of the best fives I've ever been on the court with.  Just the talent is, wow, man.  And you see how big of fans we are with one another and we're all on the floor together, it's pretty awesome.   
I think that lineup is something that you kind of envisioned in the video game.  For me to actually be part of it is something awesome.   
 Q.  What are some of the conversations that you guys have had about the competition level for tomorrow night's game?  
KYRIE IRVING: We've talked about it.  Like I said, I think it's more individually based in terms of the competitive fire.  But I know that we're pretty excited to be out there and compete and go at one another for a little bit and have a little fun.
