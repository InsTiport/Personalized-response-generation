But I'm just happy to be a part of this prestigious environment.  
   
 Q.   First pick by the Cavaliers, did you impress yourself that you had to be picked first?  
KYRIE IRVING:   There was some goals that I set, but mainly it just came from the amount of hard work I had and trusting my teammates and being in an environment where I can grow.   That's what's been most the most important thing for me.  
   
 Q.   Any particular player you would like to play this year?

KYRIE IRVING:   Yeah, it is.   It is.   For me and my family, coming down here third year, to be named a starter, it's truly a blessing.   It's awesome to be here.   
   
 Q.   In terms of bringing the (indiscernible), is that part of the goal?  
KYRIE IRVING:   Absolutely.   Absolutely.   Sunday is the time to put on a show, things you wouldn't do during a normal game, which is, I don't know, anything that I don't do during the game, which I won't try, but it's a free environment.   
To be part of these guys‑‑ I mean, you just look around.   You got Joe Johnson over there, LeBron, all those guys.   I mean, it's just awesome.
