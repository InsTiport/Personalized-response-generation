Q.   Have you ever had a night shooting like that, 8‑of‑8 from three?
KYRIE IRVING:   No, it's never occurred in my career.   You know, it's kind of unfortunate that it comes in the All‑Star Game.   These stats don't carry over to the season.   But at the end of the day, it was still fun to get out there with those talented guys, so it was a great experience. 

Q.   What does it feel like to get that hot shooting from distance?   And does the fact that it is an All‑Star Game, you basically know there's zero defense, did that help your confidence a little bit out there?
KYRIE IRVING:   I mean, guys just continued to give me the ball.   In the first half I had four threes in a row, I just kept telling them, I'm feeling it.   I'm proud of them for actually having confidence in me, and it was just fun.   It was fun getting hot, especially in the All‑Star Game when millions of people are watching.   Like I said, it was an enjoyable game.
