 Q.  Kyrie, can you comment about the suspension of Draymond Green and how did you see the play that got him suspended?  
KYRIE IRVING: I don't really have a comment on it.   
 Q.  Does this change anything for you in terms of how you approach the game, or what kind of Warriors team do you expect to face?  
KYRIE IRVING: The same Warriors team, just without Draymond Green.   
 Q.  You got off to a strong start for the first three quarters and didn't replicate those offensive numbers in the fourth.  When you look back at Game 4, what do you think occurred in your offensive game in the fourth quarter?  
KYRIE IRVING: I think that it kind of messed up our rhythm when those guys were getting those offensive rebounds.  Those could have led out to a lot of fast-break opportunities for us that we look back on the game.  And fourth quarter, it just swayed a lot, especially in their direction.  I feel like it was in reach for us getting a win.  Just a few plays here and there, a few mistakes that just we couldn't get back over the hump.  They did a great job continuing to attack us.   
We don't want to make any excuses for ourselves.  We just have to get those basketballs and those 50-50 balls and get out in transition.   
But I just tried a few shots I forced in the fourth quarter that I felt like I had to.  They were either late in the shot clock or I felt like I had -- especially in the last four minutes, getting to the basket, there was -- I think it was a seven-point game, and I got the opportunity to hit a floater that I missed that I was really, really pissed off about.   
But those opportunities, they all come from just being aggressive, and I just have to stay in that mindset.
