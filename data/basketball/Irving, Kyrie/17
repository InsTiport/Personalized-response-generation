Q. Give us your thoughts on playing for USA Basketball? 
KYRIE IRVING: To accomplish in the regular season, and with my respective team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, and now the opportunity of USA Basketball starts knocking at your door to be part of an Olympic team, I mean, it's kind of hard for me personally to turn it down. It's been a dream of mine for a long time, and I want to be a part of something bigger than myself again, other than my own team. 

Q. Not a whole lot of guys have the chance to do a double of an NBA title and a gold medal just a couple months later. I want to know what that would mean to you? 
KYRIE IRVING: It would be amazing. But I understand the amount of work that it takes to win. Not just a championship, but the gold medal and playing with USA on your chest, playing for, I don't know how many people we're playing for, but it's bigger than all of us.
