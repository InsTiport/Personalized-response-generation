  JEFF FISCHEL:   We lead off with Virginia Tech.   Ben, talk about your relationship with your coach.  
BEN EMELOGU:   He's a player's coach.   He loves us like our sons.   He doesn't have a family.   He treats us just like his kids.  
Every day he asks us how we're doing.   We know that he loves us.   
JEFF FISCHEL:   Joe, your thoughts on coach?   
JOEY VAN ZEGEREN:   I agree.   When I first met James, he was an assistant coach.   When he got the job, I thought he was right in spot for that.   Knowing him as a person, he doesn't try to be a player's coach.   It comes natural to him.  
JEFF FISCHEL:   Have you seen him change from an assistant coach to a head coach?   
JOEY VAN ZEGEREN:   I have seen him change.   But I think he brings a lot of experience with him from the assistant coach job.   He knows how to deal in certain situations and certain players.   
JEFF FISCHEL:   What are the goals you and coach have set for the team this year.  
JOEY VAN ZEGEREN:   We're trying to get an ACC championship and then get the NCAAs.   
JEFF FISCHEL:   Ben, what are your goals?   
BEN EMELOGU:   Helping my team out, have fun.   
JEFF FISCHEL:   Who is your favorite player?   
JOEY VAN ZEGEREN:   My favorite player at the moment is Kevin Durant.   
JEFF FISCHEL:   Why?   
JOEY VAN ZEGEREN:   I think he's versatile, athletic.   I like the way he's a team player.   
JEFF FISCHEL:   Ben, who do you look up to?   
BEN EMELOGU:   Kevin Durant.   
JEFF FISCHEL:   What is the one app on your phone you can't live without?   
JOEY VAN ZEGEREN:   I'd have to say Skype.   I'm from overseas.   I Skype a lot with my family.   
JEFF FISCHEL:   Do you feel like it's hard being away from home so much?   
JOEY VAN ZEGEREN:   It's kind of hard, but I've gotten used to it.   
JEFF FISCHEL:   How many years have you been away from home now?   
JOEY VAN ZEGEREN:   Five, six years.   
JEFF FISCHEL:   Ben, what do you listen to on your iPod?   
BEN EMELOGU:   I listen to Jayco, Wally, very lyrical rapers.   
JEFF FISCHEL:   Let's talk about Blacksburg.   What has your first experience been like?   
BEN EMELOGU:   The people there are great.   They're very kind and loving.   So I'm liking the city.   I can't miss home at all.   That speaks for itself.   
   
 Q.   Last thing before I let you go and move on.   You're dealing with cameras, is that fun for you or something you have to do as part of the job being a college basketball player?   
JOEY VAN ZEGEREN:   I see it as fun.   
JEFF FISCHEL:   Good start to the day.
