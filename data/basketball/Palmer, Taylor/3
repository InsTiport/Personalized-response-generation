OKLAHOMA   65
  WEST VIRGINIA - 64

COACH CAREY:   Needless to say, it was a tale of two halves.   The first half we were scoring well and they couldn't score.   Second half it was the other way around.   We tried to run, take some time off the clock there when it was time to run a play that we ran against Iowa State, and they called an offensive foul on Fields which gave them their last shot. 
Then we came down and had a good shot, good look to win the game and we missed it.   We blew a 20‑point lead.   And give Oklahoma credit, they came out and played harder than we did the second half.   We were not as good offensively or defensively in the second half than the first half.

Q.   What changed in the second half?   Were the shots just not falling? 
CHRISTAL CALDWELL:   They just weren't falling.   I don't know. 

Q.   Taylor, were they doing anything different do you think in the second half or was it a case, as Christal mentioned, the shots just not falling? 
TAYLOR PALMER:   I think it was a combination of both.   Like our shots weren't falling, and they were just playing a little harder and closer on defense.   But overall, I just think the shots weren't falling.   We had some good looks. 

Q.   The great run you had over the last 7:55, out‑scored them by a wide margin, even with the big lead at the half, did you still feel like you still had to take it to them?   Did you still have the feeling there in the locker room? 
CHRISTAL CALDWELL:   We knew‑‑ we thought that we had the game, and we knew that we couldn't get comfortable because they were not going to stop playing.   It's tournament time and no one is going to stop playing because everyone knows that their future is on the line and they just took it to us, and we ended up with a loss. 

Q.   With the foul trouble, how much did their size give you an issue in the second half?   Seemed like you guys could not get anything down low offensively. 
TAYLOR PALMER:   Getting in foul trouble, that hurt a little bit, because like you said, you couldn't really get the ball in the post as much, because we were a little smaller than them.   Foul trouble hurt us in the second half‑‑ well, in the game in general hurt us. 

Q.   Did you get a good look at Averee at the end?
COACH CAREY:   I'll have a look at it on tape, if it was an offensive foul, I don't know.   They took, what, 37 foul shots?   What did we shoot, 12, 13?   I don't know.   I don't have stats up here‑‑ 16. 
But we fouled 94 feet from the bucket.   We just weren't smart the second half.   And to answer your question, you know, at halftime, I said we still need to be aggressive, be aggressive, be aggressive; and keep attacking, keep attacking, keep attacking, they are going to make runs.
And then the other thing, it's my fault, my staff didn't tell me YaYa had three, when they finally told me that she had three, I tried to get her out to get offensive fouls on the next play down the floor and that really hurt us.   That really hurts us in a close game because we had no post presence at that time, zero. 

Q.   Seems like you were really in foul trouble‑‑
COACH CAREY:   That's the thing, YaYa can score for us in the post and when we go the with other‑‑ that's why we were posting Averee Fields because she can score a little bit.   But you know, it hurts us, and again, I blame myself.   YaYa picking up her fourth right there, I just was not aware she had three. 
And I'm running a play for her at the same time they tell me she has three, and I get an offensive charge so they can get her out and that's her fourth.   When they cut the lead to four, what the heck, it's tournament time, we just had to put her in there and see what happens. 

Q.   When you see them coming, is there anything that you can do as a coach to try to‑‑
COACH CAREY:   God, I wish there was.   You're trying to use all your time‑outs.   You're trying to change up a little bit.   You know, we sagged off a little bit.   We tried to get help on their center.   But they were hitting some shots, and then, you know, they hit six points on out‑of‑bounds plays.   That is unbelievable.   That really just hurt us.   Six points on an out‑of‑bounds play, that never happens.   

Q.   I hate to ask you this, but is this is one of your toughest losses as a coach? 
COACH CAREY:   Yeah, because I think we really needed this for the NCAA, I really do, we are on the bubble, big time.   I think it's really hurt us for the NCAA, and it's a shame.   I thought our girls played hard. 
We just weren't aggressive the second half.   And that's all I stressed at halftime:   Be aggressive, keep attacking, you can't relax, they are a good team, they are going to come back, they are going to make some runs. 
But man, once that starts going, it's just hard to stop and unless somebody steps up and hits some big shots.   And as you can see in the second half, we didn't hit any big shots, we really didn't. 
And you've got to be lucky, too.   We come down, we are down one, we have a wide‑open shot at five, seven feet and miss it.   I mean, sometimes you've got to be lucky.   But we weren't.   And they won. 

Q.   They go up one with five seconds left, were you happy with the last shot‑‑
COACH CAREY:   We told our point guard, you get over to the rim ‑‑ and she made a good play.   Bria Holmes was wide open, five, seven feet, right there on the baseline.   Good look.   Good look.   Just missed it, that's all. 

Q.   Do you feel like you've done enough to get into the tournament at this point? 
COACH CAREY:   I don't know.   Man, I'm frustrated.   You know, we go to Texas, get beat.   We lose Harlee, one of our better players.   And it just seems like we just went down at halftime once she tore her ACL.   And then we bounce back in this game, have a good first half, and do that‑‑ I don't know where we're at.   But we are on the bubble big time.   On the bubble big time.
This is the No.1 RPI league in the country, I mean, I would hope six people would get in.   But you never know.   You never know.   We are going to be really worrying about it.
