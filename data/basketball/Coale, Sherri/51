<p>	Q.  Leah, I think you guys had a 10-point lead or so with 15 minutes.  Dionnah gets her fourth foul and she goes to the bench.  When she comes back, the games over.  You're up by 20.  Can you talk about how you played so well without her? </p>
<p>	Q.  Erin, you guys were up one at halftime.  Talk about what you said?  Any kind of sense of urgency at all? </p>
<p>	Q.  Erin, could you talk about what they were doing differently in the first half?  Last two times they played you, they struggled. </p>
<p>	Q.  Leah, you talked earlier about how you were able to take control of the game with D on the bench.  Coming out of the locker room in the second half was quite a force during the 12-0 run.  Talk about what you did? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about the first half.  Maybe you guys got a little frustrated with some of the baskets you hit in the second half,  layups, close shots weren't going in the first half. </p>
<p>	Q.  Erin, you were shooting layups the whole game.  Somebody was always open.  What was happening to get you guys so open all the time under the basket? </p>

<p>	Q.  You said you haven't scored 86 in a while.  She said things are coming together.  Do you see that, as well, something coming together with the team? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about why you have Brown in the starting lineup and what she gives you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about your halftime assessment.  Did you feel maybe you could keep that pace up better than they could?  That was a real great shooting half for them, which they haven't done a lot this year, especially against you guys. </p>
<p>	Q.  What allowed you guys to run as well as you did, even in the first half, 12 fast-break points, and that's not bad either?  Is Britney part of that? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said you want to get Jackson involved.  Is that maybe why you stay with her with three fouls, there was a risk she would pick up a fourth foul? </p>
<p>	Q.  Apparently it wasn't. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about what you said to Dionnah at halftime? </p>
