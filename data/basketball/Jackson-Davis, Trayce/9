THE MODERATOR: Questions.
Q. Joey, obviously being on a different team in this event, how odd is that for you or different? How does it feel?
JOEY BRUNK: It will be definitely different going in wearing an Indiana uniform. But I'm excited for the opportunity. It's a great, great event. I've always loved playing in it, so I'm excited to be back.
Q. Joey and Trayce, I don't know how many kind of Pacers games you went to growing up, Trayce obviously played there for the Indy-Kentucky game, but playing in that kind of environment, that kind of arena.
TRAYCE JACKSON-DAVIS: It's a great venue, Bankers Life. I've always enjoyed playing in there. For the Indiana All-Star Game, it was fun. We had a great crowd. I'm looking forward to getting back in there.
JOEY BRUNK: I grew up going to watch games there. Went to the Crossroads when I was in high school just as a fan. Playing in the Indiana All-Star Game is a pretty neat opportunity. Getting to play there the past couple years...
I love playing there. I know we'll have a lot of IU people out.
Q. How does that arena play, whether it be the way the ball comes off the court, the sight lines, the sound? What is different about it?
JOEY BRUNK: I feel like there's just kind of an energy when you're there. It's just a little different being like in a pro arena. But we had our scrimmage earlier in the year there. We've all been there quite a bit.
It's something that will be good for us.
TRAYCE JACKSON-DAVIS: Most definitely, just off of what Joey said. Played there for a scrimmage. There were no people in there, so it's going to be a little bit different. Just getting used to the rims, like you have to deal with all arenas, just come out and play your game.
Q. Trayce, you're 11 games in now. Last little stretch of three, four games, a lot of travel. What have these last couple weeks been like, how you're getting acclimated to the college game?
TRAYCE JACKSON-DAVIS: Just got to always remember taking care of your body is a big thing with all the travel, the wear and tear on your body, playing games back-to-back like that. Just really taking care of your body, being in the training room, listen to what your coaches tell you is key for me.
Q. It sounds to be another team that will look to spread you out. What have been the challenges for you when you faced a Nebraska or other teams that have looked to do that?
JOEY BRUNK: When you're playing a team that has everybody that can shoot the ball and spread you out, you got to be really disciplined, be really sound in your principles. I think it's going to be a great, great test for us again. Kind of get out and show what we've been working on in practice day in, day out.
Q. John Mooney leading the nation in rebounding. The challenge of keeping him and some of the other Notre Dame guys off the board, how much are you looking forward to that?
TRAYCE JACKSON-DAVIS: Most definitely. We just got to keep boxing out. He goes after the ball, so we've been doing a lot of rebounding drills in practice to try to get ready for that. Just got to attack the glass really.
Q. Trayce, you've been working out with Joey since the spring even. In what ways does he push you? What have you learned from him in your freshman season?
TRAYCE JACKSON-DAVIS: Joey is probably one of the hardest workers I've ever been around. Always trying to raise your level of play. Great leader, on and off the court. He is always trying to tell you what to do.
Just being able to be around him, a veteran guy with experience like he does, learning from that has been really big for me. It has been really big for me this season.
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thank you.
