Q.   (No microphone.)
KARL MALONE:   I love how much he rebounds.   He's a double‑double guy every night.   And I love that.   Plus he can shoot the 3. 
And I love his grit.   I love‑‑ I just love to see him play. 

Q.   What do you see that you like in Anthony Davis?
KARL MALONE:   I see a young man that just flourishes here.   He's embraced it.   He's worked hard.   I get to see the Pelicans play a lot because they're on TV, living here in Louisiana, watching them. 
But I love to see him play.   He don't get too excited about things, he just goes out and plays the game.   He plays hard. 
And I'll be the first to admit when they first drafted him, I wasn't for sure because I hadn't seen him play.   But you can truly build a great team around this young man.   I love to see him play and I love to see how he plays the game.

Q.   What do you think about Tim Duncan?   Do you think he's the best power forward in NBA history? 
KARL MALONE:   Well, I think Tim Duncan is‑‑ forget the power forward position; I think he's one of the best players to ever play the game. 
That's what always amazed me, when everybody ‑‑ first of all, who started the Top 5 and the Top 4 and all that crap?   Tim Duncan is one of the best players to ever play the game.   He plays center and everything.   To heck with the power forward position. 
And I love to watch him play.   I absolutely love watching San Antonio play.   They remind me‑‑ Coach Pop reminds me so much of Coach Sloan.   And Tony and Tim, those guys just play.   Even the young guys coming in, they just play.   They don't talk, they just go out and play.   So I love their squad.
