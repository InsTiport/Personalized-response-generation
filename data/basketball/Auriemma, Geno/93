<p>	Q.  There is no need to apologize for your success and how well UConn has done.  At the same time is there a problem or perception that too few teams keep coming to the Final Four and winning at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  There are probably some matchup problems with Schreiber and Stephens, pretty good post players. What do you do to come back to rebounding scorers like that. </p>
<p>	Q.  How good are those two?</p>
<p>	Q.  I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit on what you said earlier.  You mention there are a couple of reasons why the same teams keep popping up and you know a lot of people didn't expect you guys to pop up this year at the beginning of this year considering that you lost four starters, but what is it that makes these particular teams seem to be here every year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you discuss Diana's personality.  I think you talked about that during the season.  Is it kind of the way she carries herself, is that unusual for the women's game?  </p>
<p>	Q.  The other day in a teleconference you said when you began you wanted to pattern your program after the Carolina men and Texas women; what in particular did you admire about  Deane Smith's program and what did incorporate into your program that you saw in his program?  </p>
<p>	Q.  For Diana and Jessica, I would like to ask you both how your coach reacted to the loss you had in the biggest tournament.  Did you use that loss to Villanova for motivation or did you get rid of it and concentrate of the NCAA tournament.</p>

<p>	Q.  Diana, this year obviously more than the other two of you have had a different role on this team, I was just curious to know if you can talk about that comfort level that you seem to have and that role.  Not deferring as much, this is really your team, how you found that this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  In the mid '80's you never played Texas obviously, but in the mid '80s, I'm wondering how you followed Texas, was that a team that you aspired to be like and just talk about that a little bit. </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm curious at this level sporting event, I'm wondering as a young girl if you watched Final Four, if this was a goal of yours; what things did you look ahead to. </p>


<p>	Q.  I'm wondering if Gail had thanked you for beating them yet and what you think of Duke since you beat them in  February. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you remember the first time that you brought a team here to the Final Four with all of the media attention and all that goes into it.  Obviously Coach Conradt hasn't done that in a while; do you feel that is a big advantage for your team and is there anything that you do to try to increase that advantage?</p>
<p>	Q.  How important is tradition in a team's performance during a year and also have any of your former players addressed the current team this weekend?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you see 500 people on line for an autograph session like I'm just estimating, but there were a whole lot of people there today, are you still blown away by that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Not everyone gets 500 people to autograph?  Wasn't the autograph session for all four teams?   There were 500 people in for all four teams.</p>
<p>	Q.  Diana, for those of us who don't cover the team regularly we see from year-to-year in these situations Geno and you sit up there and Geno will make these little light-hearted jabs and you smile, I'm wondering though away from the public situations, could you characterize your relationship?</p>
<p>	Q.  My question is how losing the consecutive 70-game winning streak affects your team and you?</p>
<p>	Q.  You seem like you are always emotional, always having fun on the court, I'm just wondering when you get to the Final Four can you take that to another level, how exciting is it to play?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, coming into the tournament there was a lot of concern about the predetermined sites and what affect they might have on the tournament outcome.  Now, as you look back over that situation, what affect do you feel like there was, if any?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you look back over the course of the season what teams do you think did things conceptually good on defense that you guys overcame or persevered through them?    </p>
<p>	Q.  Dallas. </p>
<p>	Q.  Geno, I'm curious, in the media that we don't deal with you all the time, I am looking back in November when you made some comments and all of this other stuff.  We are not there to see how what you are saying, the inflection in your voice, we are not looking at your face, we don't know how you mean it?</p>
<p>	Q.  All we can do is pick up a paper and read the quote.  So do you want to tell us what we should deduce when you are trying to be funny, when you are funny, when you are being sarcastic or being serious; how do we know what's going on?</p>
