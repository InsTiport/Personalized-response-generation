<p>	Q.  Question for Barbara and Willnett.  Can you talk about the presence of McCarville and how you guys overcame that today? </p>

<p>	Q.  Diana, I guess by your standards you had sort of a mediocre night I hate to say it but all of a sudden other players around you step up.  I wonder if you could talk about the weapons you've got beyond yourself on this team.</p>
<p>	Q.  Diana, can you talk a little bit about just the runs that Minnesota kept making every time it look like you were going to take control of the game they kept coming back?</p>
<p>	Q.  Diana, can you talk about the defense that Shannon Bolden played and then did they help a lot on you as well or did she have a pretty good second half defensively it seemed like?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did it add to the excitement at all for you guys to know before the game that Tennessee won and that you would be playing Tennessee if you won against Minnesota? </p>
<p>	Q.  Diana, everybody talks about the growth of women's basketball and the burgeoning popularity, but it always seems to come down to Connecticut and Tennessee.  Do you think that in a general sense that's good for the sport, that you have two dominant programs like the New York Yankees? </p>
<p>	Q.  Diana and Barbara, can you talk about the job Willnett did on the offensive glass and defensive glass, the points she was able to score and the things she was able to do.  It seems like it was probably one of the biggest games of her career. </p>

<p>	Q.  Diana, can you talk about Ann's play and Maria's play, given coming off not scoring and Ann had a key 3 and Maria had some key 3's.</p>
<p>	Q.  D, especially in the second half, how important was Willnett? </p>

<p>	Q.  You played some strong, relentless teams this season, maybe even a couple that beat you.  What seemed different about Minnesota, because there seems to be a bit of admiration in your voice for what they did tonight.</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you address any lingering misconception that you're a one-star team yet so many other players stepped up in the stretch tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about the defense that Minnesota put on and especially with Shannon Bolden and just the history that she had had in the last couple of games of containing the top players and how you saw that tonight.</p>
<p>	Q.  So much talk about parity this year in the tournament, a lot of upsets and good teams like Texas and Duke lost it.  Yet Tennessee and UConn go through this and meet in the final game.  What separates them apart from the other teams, do you think right now?</p>
