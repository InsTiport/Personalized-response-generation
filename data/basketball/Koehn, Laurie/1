<p>	Q.  Kendra, what did it do to y'all when Megan Mahoney went out? </p>
<p>	Q.  How can you explain the slow starts?  Two nights ago, then again tonight. </p>

<p>	Q.  Kendra, could you talk about the way Baylor defended you.  Was it anything different than what they've done before? </p>
<p>	Q.  Would you talk about that 13-0 run y'all went on in the second half.  That kind of was patented Kansas State basketball, was it not? </p>

<p>	Q.  Could you talk about your feelings about what happened to Megan.  I don't know what the condition would be, but if you have to go forward in the post-season without her, what you need to do to make up for that? </p>

<p>	Q.  That stretch of the ballgame when Steffanie and Sophia came back in after sitting a while, just talk about their play during that stretch. </p>


<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the difficulty of covering Sophia down there? </p>
<p>	Q.  Seemed like the run that you had in the second half was keyed by defense.  What did it take to get them to play defense like that?  And have them get to it earlier? </p>
<p>	Q.  A couple times this year Kendra has been below her scoring average against Baylor.  What is it about them that they're maybe able to do this against her?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have any update on Megan, what exactly happened?  Do you know anything at all about how she is? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is Laurie forcing some shots?  You take her in and out it seems like quite a bit.  Are you comfortable with her shot selection? </p>
<p>	Q.  You got closer than you were when Megan went down, you got closer after she went out.  Was that still the turning point when she got hurt, they got the 3-point play at the other end?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk a little bit about the job that Kim has done there coaching them, making them able to win the close games, taking the team from the bottom of the conference to being a contender with K State, Texas and Texas Tech? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can Megan put any weight on the ankle?  Do you think you're deserving of a No. 4 seed? </p>
