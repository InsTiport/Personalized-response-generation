<p>	Q.  Lonny and Juan, the way you guys lost last year in the Final Four, having the big lead, the controversial call at the end, could you kind of address how long it takes to get over something like that and when you start turning that into something creative for the following season? </p>

<p>	Q.  Juan, could you talk about what makes the Kansas fastbreak so impressive, what you think is the key to them getting out? </p>
<p>	Q.  Byron and Juan, at this time of year, the tournament, how important do you think individual player matchups are?  Is it going to be a chess match?  How do you think that's going to play out tomorrow? </p>

<p>	Q.  Lonny, early in your career you were told that you were too small to play center effectively at this level.  Right now do you prefer to play a smaller center who is muscular like yourself or do you prefer to play a bigger, leaner kind of guy like Drew Gooden? </p>
<p>	Q.  Lonny, getting inside, Kansas has been so big on the boards throughout the tournament.  What do you have to do to beat them on the boards? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there a sense that you guys want to win for Coach Williams? </p>


<p>	Q.  How much do you savor the match-up inside?  Have you talked about it with Chris, you two against Collison and Gooden?  Does it get any better than that? </p>
<p>	Q.  On your warm-up there, looks like you have a pretty good pin collection going.  Have you been trying to collect pins here at the Final Four? </p>
<p>	Q.  You guys are kind of unique in modern day basketball, especially for a No.  1 seed, three seniors, two, five-year seniors.  Would each of you talk about your senior experience and how much you think that's helped the overall team? </p>


<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the off-the-court stuff, how that's made you stronger people and stronger players? </p>

<p>	Q.  We see the Gary Williams semi-psycho act on the sidelines during the game.  We don't get to see what you see.  Can you give us a glimpse of Gary Williams behind the closed doors, what he's like?  The Kansas players were talking about how this year their practices have gone from two and a half hours to 45 minutes.  Has there been any change in Gary from last year to this year? </p>


<p>	Q.  Kansas is going to want this game to be as fast tempo as possible.  How open are you going to be to run with Kansas?  How much can you see yourself wanting to slow the pace down tomorrow? </p>

<p>	Q.  Just wanted to ask, how much better of a coach are you now than you were, say, 13 months ago?  How much better of a coach will you be if you win two games the next few days? </p>
<p>	Q.  A long time since any upstart from a major conference or non-power conferences has made the Final Four.  Why do you think that is?  Is it a matter of resources, matter of tradition, getting more players, depth? </p>
<p>	Q.  The combination of the fact that you have the senior leadership on this team and that you clearly made a decision not to duck anyone in terms of your scheduling from Arizona, Connecticut, Oklahoma, et cetera.  What does the experience factor mean?  Is there any kind of situation that you don't think these guys have been in yet? </p>
<p>	Q.  One of those painful losses you were talking about was in the Final Four last year.  The way you had the lead, the game ended, when can you turn the pain of something like that into a positive for the following season? </p>
<p>	Q.  Sort of sticking with the same subject.  Do you see this hunger in the guys on your team?  Can you describe that, maybe they've carried this pain from last year through this season? </p>
<p>	Q.  What have you all been doing to kind of keep the pressure off this week? </p>
<p>	Q.  Gary, is Juan Dixon the toughest player you coached in all your years of coaching?  When, during his career at Maryland, did you get a sense that he could be something special? </p>
<p>	Q.  What is it like to have three of these guys as seniors who weren't McDonald's All-Americans? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kansas has three freshmen playing obviously key roles.  Miles, Langford and Simien.  Is that an area you think you can exploit?  Do you think these guys are experienced enough now and accomplished enough that they fit right in with everybody else? </p>
<p>	Q.  Awesome match-up in the front court with your big guys up against theirs.  Baxter and Wilcox.  Kansas has been phenomenal on the boards all through the tournament. </p>
<p>	Q.  Roy said that he wants to win the National Championship as badly as he wants to breathe.  I wondered if you could tell us how badly or how much it means to you to win it. </p>
<p>	Q.  Byron and Juan have both gone through some difficult times in their personal lives.  Can you talk about how that's shaped them at people? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much have you challenged your players to be the best rebounding team tomorrow? </p>
<p>	Q.  It seems as your fans are trying to turn Atlanta into your town.  There's a couple "Welcome to Garyland" signs here?  Are you feeling comfortable?  Can you use your experience in the Final Four last year? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there any scenario, any style, barring the unforeseen, that these guys haven't seen, haven't experienced? </p>
