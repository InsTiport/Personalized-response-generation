<p>	Q.  You were down 13-2, there was a TV time-out, looked like Coach Williams was coming out at you pretty strong.  Can you remember any of the things he might have said at that point? </p>
<p>	Q.  The experience in the Duke game last year, did that help you keep your composure at all? </p>
<p>	Q.  When they were coming back, talk about what's going through your mind?  When you hit that runner from the left side, talk about that whole series. </p>
<p>	Q.  Such great senior leadership over the past year.  As a senior, do you take this team upon your shoulder purposely and carry it?  Is that your mission every game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the play of Drew Gooden? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said yesterday that you still hadn't forgotten about last year's Duke game.  I realize you only scored four points, but does this help you forget last year? </p>
<p>	Q.  Juan, can you talk about how you were able to find the rhythm in the first half?  I think it was ten straight points you got. </p>

<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the ebb and flow of this game?  This was a wild game.  You're down 13-2; make a terrific comeback.  Then you're up 20 with six minutes to go in the game.  They come at you with everything but the kitchen sink.  Talk about that up and down. </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the play of Chris Wilcox and Holden against Gooden. </p>
<p>	Q.  Tahj Holden. </p>
<p>	Q.  One off-night was sort of a fluke for Steve, but now it seems to have grown a little bit with turnovers and missed free-throws.  Were you worried about him going into Monday night? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you make an early statement about the Indiana game, what you're looking for. </p>
<p>	Q.  How much does the fact that a lot of your key players or upperclassmen helped your team get its composure when you're down 13-2, things aren't looking well at that point? </p>
