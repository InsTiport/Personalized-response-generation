<p>	Q.  Indiana has shot so well from beyond the arc in this tournament.  What are -- trying to slow them down from beyond the 3-point range? </p>
<p>	Q.  Along the same lines of what Lonny was saying, the way you have progressed over the last three, four seasons, do you feel you're a team of destiny? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can we assume you went to the 1966 Championship game in your own gym or did you not?  Any remembrances?  As a young high school coach or assistant college coach, general remembrances about NCAA tournaments.  How big has this tournament gotten since you took your first BC team there in '83, how this has grown. </p>

<p>	Q.  Can you tell me, I'm sure you remember when you were -- when you heard of Len Bias' death?  Did you know how devastating that was going to be to Maryland at the time?  Is this year and last year the culmination of the long comeback from that time? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned earlier how important it's been that you've been able to stay at Maryland for a long time.  Prior to last year's Final Four run, was there ever a point in your tenure where you wondered about that, how long you'd be staying at Maryland? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Chris Wilcox and perhaps how he's come to play so well in some of the bigger games, and other times he's disappeared, why you think that happens. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you imagine what it would be like to be in Mike Davis' shoes, reaching the Final Four after your second year?  Also having gone the longer route, do you think he can appreciate what's involved in that trip? </p>
<p>	Q.  From your knowledge of the Maryland program, some of the great players that have been through there, dating back to the early '70s, any surprise that it took this long for Maryland to get to the final game? </p>
<p>	Q.  You have a situation now where you have a chance to hang a banner in a brand-new building.  This was the last year for Cole.  Is this now where Maryland is going to take another step up and incorporate the building along with that? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you lost to Oklahoma back in December, I remember you talking about how frustrated you were that you kind of got caught up in their tendency to go one-on-one with their athleticism.  They sort of fell into that a bit much last night.  I think they had six assists as a team.  How important is your forte, which is sharing the basketball, going to be in taking this thing home tomorrow night? </p>
<p>	Q.  When did you come to the conclusion that you wanted to be a basketball coach?  Who are some of the people who kind of influenced you in your early years? </p>
<p>	Q.  Having sat behind your bench yesterday   --?</p>
<p>	Q.  -- Do you ever see yourself on tape or hear yourself or are told about something that you said? </p>
<p>	Q.  Even are taken aback by it?</p>
<p>	Q.  At what point did you think in your time at Maryland that this was possible? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've had a similar coaching style your whole career.  All of your teams bear some resemblance to others.  Indiana teams are the same way.  Your record against Indiana teams is 0 and 7.  Is there a fighter  style thing going on there?  Is that a little bogus? </p>
<p>	Q.  What is the match of styles between the two? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you said you were a little jealous of Mike Davis, I was wondering if you're being totally facetious or was there a nugget of truth?  Does that give you perspective?  I asked Mike about it, he said, he thinks it's a lot of luck.  Does that change your perspective? </p>
<p>	Q.  There's another coach in town with some ties to Maryland.  Given all the victories, balanced against the way it ended, what is Lefty's legacy at Maryland? </p>
<p>	Q.  With the growing potential for making money in this game by players, has parental involvement increased over the years?  Is that a challenge to you?  What's the fine line between a caring parent and maybe a meddling parent? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you cultivate chemistry on a team?  Do you even try when you recruit?  Do you not have enough time to meet the kids?  Is it a crapshoot anyway?  Can you possibly know when a chemistry is going to happen? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mike Davis said last night he finally got to bed at 4:30.  Can you describe the scene for yourself.  What was going through your mind?  Have you heard from any Maryland well-wishers, former players, Coach Milligan, since last night? </p>
<p>	Q.  Given what you were talking about a few minutes ago, patience of players, can you see yourself having another team at Maryland with not only three seniors but three talented seniors starting on your club? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said at one time that if you would have known Maryland was going to get hit the way they did by the NCAA, you never would have left Ohio State. </p>
<p>	Q.  I wondered if you hadn't made that move when you made it, what do you think you'd be doing today?  Do you think you'd still be at Ohio State?  Do you think you would have gotten Maryland later? </p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering if a low point for this club was when you went to Norman and lost by double digits?  Juan said a minute ago there were issues on the team at that time that got resolved.  Can you address that? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about how the program has grown since you've been there.  How have you grown? </p>
<p>	Q.  You well know recruiting types and some of your fans over the years have questioned your recruiting.  Could you explain what your philosophy is and why you've been able to get so many players that have been able to grow under you.  What are you looking for when you recruit them, what you do with them that brings them to this level. </p>
<p>	Q.  You've got Dixon and Baxter, two of the great players in the program's history.  Can you talk about what a great reward this is for them to have the chance?  Last game they play is going to be the biggest game they play in their careers. </p>
<p>	Q.  Mike Davis said it was important for him that his players like him.  No matter how much a coach may or may not yell on the sidelines, is it important for players and coaches to have some sort of relationship?  Can you coach on fear anymore? </p>
<p>	Q.  Steve is really down on the way he's playing right now.  Would you talk about whether you think he's playing poorly.  Made a big shot against Connecticut obviously.  Also do you see him as the next leader of the program? </p>
<p>	Q.  With the intensity that you project, how do you balance that with trying to project some stability when a team is making a big run?  In some of the Duke games, you looked fairly calm, for you. </p>
<p>	Q.  After two consecutive Final Fours, your legacy is starting to crystallize at Maryland.  Does getting here this year make you want to coach X number of years at Maryland?  How do you see your master plan right now? </p>
<p>	Q.  How about your legacy? </p>
<p>	Q.  Byron was saying he thought maybe Michael jumping on the press table last year in Cole may have been the defining moment of what happened since then. </p>
<p>	Q.  Yes. </p>
<p>	Q.  There's been a lot of talk about the dues paying process, who pays dues, who doesn't pay dues, what are dues.  Where do you fall on that?  Are you big on a progression?  Do you get what you get when you can get it? </p>
<p>	Q.  How important is it to have, with three seniors going into a championship game, how important is that experience?  Have you pondered how fortunate you are to have three seniors?  In today's game, that's unusual. </p>
<p>	Q.  You've been fortunate to keep these guys. </p>
<p>	Q.  In your last three games, you really had some guys step up.  I think Mouton had a game with one, then a game of 12.  Baxter had a game with four, another with 27 or 29.  How much of that is you seeing who is hot and going to them?  How much is it them having a sense of each other? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you remember that first game you saw Juan play, was it an AAU game?  Do you remember the setting at all? </p>
