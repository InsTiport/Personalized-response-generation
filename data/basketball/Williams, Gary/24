<p>	Q.  Think about a couple of years ago Kansas apparently was the to hire a coach named Williams.   What was that process like when you were visiting them; how close you came to it and just reflect a little on that?</p>
<p>	Q.  How important is stability and continuity among your players?  I am thinking specifically about this year's group; also looking back when you (inaudible) -- how does it affect how you choose to recruit?</p>
<p>	Q.  I am curious, having been to the Final Four last year, what did you learn about preparing both yourself and your team in terms of all the stuff on the outside, tickets, scheduling, media, et cetera, and what, if anything, have you changed then coming into this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  If I can just follow that then, a lot is being made that the Kansas/Maryland game is the more marquis game of the two and your players have been pretty confident and outspoken about the fact that they feel like this is their year.  Any concern on your part that should you win Saturday you need to refocus them for Monday?</p>
<p>	Q.  When did you first hear about Byron Mouton and how was it able to work out that he was to come to Maryland?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) scholarship in high school?</p>
<p>	Q.  Along the lines of Len Robinson's question about preparing for an event like this, if you are on the road during the regular season maybe some of these kids go to a mall or something when they have a little down time.  Here you can't do that.  How do you keep things normal as possible in this environment and still be able to keep them focused on trying to win a basketball game or two?</p>
<p>	Q.  Kids able to still have fun last year in Minneapolis and maintain their focus on the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  The topic of reseeding teams in the Final Four is getting a lot of air time.  What are your thoughts on some day doing that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk a little bit about Byron, how he's handled his off-the-court tragedy with his brother?</p>
<p>	Q.  You didn't win your conference tournament and it really didn't matter;  which is kind of the way it was last year.  Obviously of the four final four teams only Oklahoma did win its Conference Championship.  Have things evolved to the point where a conference tournament is something that in a program of your stature you use it almost just as preparing for the NCAA tournament because you know there are bigger fish to fry so to speak?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk a little /PHREUT about Drew; how he's playing right now; how you see the matchup inside?</p>
<p>	Q.  Up until last year you had gone through the can get to the Final Four thing, and Roy Williams has been through that for a while, and Kelvin  Sampson has gone through that.  Mike Davis has also obviously had a tough time in replacing Bobby Knight.  I wonder among coaches or in your mind is there sort of a feel good feeling about the coaches who made it to the Final Four?</p>
