<p>	Q.  Kendra, what does it mean to you?  What was the first conversation with Nicole like? </p>
<p>	Q.  Megan, you guys have won five straight now with an average of 22 points.  They haven't even been close.  Now you're going to face a Texas team y'all lost to by four on your home court.  Talk about that rematch? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kendra, did you notice the ovation you were getting even while Nebraska had possession, and Nebraska fans joined in during the timeout?  What did it mean to you? </p>


<p>	Q.  Kendra, did you know that was the basket?  Were you keeping track in the back of your mind? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, can you talk about your team's fantastic first half shooting-wise? </p>

<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Nebraska's offensive struggles?  You played them three times now.  What did you see tonight from them?  Obviously, you played good defense.  What did you see from them tonight offensively that made you believe they struggled? </p>
<p>	Q.  Last game with Texas, Tiffany Jackson only had eight points.  Schreiber got loose on you.  Do you take a different approach for this game coming up tomorrow? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the record, what it means to you as a coach?  You've now had two players break it in consecutive years. </p>
