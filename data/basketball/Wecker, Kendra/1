 Q.  Can you talk about the experience being here? 
 KENDRA WECKER:  It's amazing.  I'm having a great time.  I just got here yesterday, but I went through this whole experience last year and to be asked to come back again was pretty exciting. 
 I'm just happy to be here. 

 Q.  Any predictions on this year's competition? 
 KENDRA WECKER:  Well, I hope we can win.  It's tough to defend a title, but I think we've got a good shot this year.
