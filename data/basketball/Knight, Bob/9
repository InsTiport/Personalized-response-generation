<p>	Q.  You have made a lot of stops here in the metro area playing at the American Airlines Center, et cetera, are you seeing a benefit from the recruiting aspect from making these stops?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the process of trying to work 8 new players into a team?</p>
<p>	Q.  The N.C.A.A. ruled that's allowed you guys to practice before the official practice really gets started, how much of a benefit have you found that to be to actually be able to work with them before?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you ever had a team that doesn't have a senior like this one and who will play that leadership role like Ronald did?</p>
<p>	Q.  You got a captain this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Regarding your favorite topic, the N.C.A.A., they purchased the rights to the NIT.  I know you were, I guess, deposed and did -- what did you think about that purchase?</p>


<p>	Q.  Martin, I wondered if you or your family have any Hurricane stories, how they got through all of that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coached talked about something about how your leadership was affecting your passing, he had a conversation with you.  Could you give your version of that and do you see you taking on that leadership role that Ronald had last year? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about not having a senior and where that leadership is going to come from this year? </p>
<p>	Q.  What did you learn so much from last year from (inaudible) that's going to take you into this year to go further?</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys beat Kansas, you got to the Sweet 16.  Yet there were other times when you guys couldn't put it all together?  What did you guys learn with yourselves?</p>
<p>	Q.  If there is a more polarizing figure in the N.C.A.A. other than Bobby Knight, I don't know who it is.  What were your expectations before you played for him and how has that lived when you started playing and practicing under him? </p>

<p>	Q.  Which have the new guys looks good right now and a lot of people I assume are going to think it is going to take a while for you guys to really getting to and get going with so many new faces do you guys agree with that, could you get off hot?</p>
