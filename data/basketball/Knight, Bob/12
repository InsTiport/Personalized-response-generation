<p>	Q.  Ronald or Jarrius, what was the team's thought process, what were you thinking when it's 50 to 42?  Seemed like you couldn't buy a basket in terms of what you had to do to come back and get the win.</p>
<p>	Q.  What did you do to shut Homan down about the last 10, 12 minutes of the game?  He had been getting inside pretty easy the first half. </p>

<p>	Q.  Ronald, you got Oklahoma next.  There were two games that were so different.  Especially with the road team win. </p>
<p>	Q.  It's another Saturday, there's a possibility you are going to be wearing black; does that scare you all because in the past you all had a little bit of a problem with that on the weekends .</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys think that 22 to 4 run at the end of the game was one of your better stretches of basketball this season?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ronald, what was the key to that run, anything in particular that you guys did? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you picked up your fourth foul, still a lot of time to go in the game, did you adjust the way you played at all? </p>
<p>	Q.  Ronald, during that late run it looked like their defense wasn't quite as ferocious as they were early on in the game.  Could you tell if they were getting a little tired maybe?</p>
<p>	Q.  Seems like through most of this season this team, kind of guys as you two go, you take turns of taking control of games.  Is this team going to go as far in the post-season as you guys can take it?</p>



<p>	Q.  As you go into Sunday, selection Sunday, does this conference deserve to get six teams in and where do you think Iowa State fits in?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, what about Darryl starting, what is his status?</p>
<p>	Q.  Not injury-related?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you think Damir did?</p>
<p>	Q.  You got Oklahoma next.  You had two widely different games against them.  What has to happen tomorrow that didn't happen last Saturday in Lubbock?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you like this team?  Do you like your team?</p>
