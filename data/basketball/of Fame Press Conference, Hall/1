  MATT WINER: Thank you all. Gather round, warm up if you can -- f that's possible here in Chicago this weekend. Special thanks to all of you joining on NBA TV today and NBA.com and the NBA app as well. It's a huge day, and we're live for All-Star Weekend here in Chicago, one of the world's great basketball cities. There are just not that many places that can match the Windy City for great players, championship tradition and winter days so cold that you are compelled to go back inside the gym and work even further on your game.   
We're never short on talent at these events, of course, and as always, we have with us on stage an extraordinary group of players, coaches and contributors. Welcome with me these luminaries from the Hall of Fame family, if you would.   
First, from the Hall of Fame class of 1996, of course we have "the Iceman" here. It's George Gervin.   
(Applause.)   
From the class of 2015, Spencer Haywood.   
(Applause.)   
From the class of 2018, Grant Hill.   
(Applause.)   
From the class of 2006, Dominique Wilkins.   
(Applause.)   
From the 1997 class, Alex English.   
(Applause.)   
From the class of 2013, something else you'd need on a day like this, The Glove, Gary Payton.   
(Applause.)   
From the class of 2016, Sheryl Swoopes.   
(Applause.)   
From the class of 1999, Mr. Wayne Embry.   
(Applause.)   
From the class of 2004, Jerry Colangelo.   
(Applause.)   
From the class of 2018, Charlie Scott.   
(Applause.)   
And from the class of 2011, Artis Gilmore.   
(Applause.)   
Thanks, everybody, who came out here today. It is, of course, a bittersweet time for the basketball community. We're here to celebrate All-Star Weekend and specifically today the new finalists for the Hall of Fame, but as you know these early days of 2020 have also brought us heartbreak. The Hall of Fame family and the entire basketball world are grieving the passings of former NBA Commissioner David Stern, NBA legend Kobe Bryant and Hall of Fame coach Morgan Wootten.   
At this time, I'd like to call on somebody who knew Kobe and former Commissioner David Stern very well, Hall of Fame Chairman Jerry Colangelo.   
You told me you met David Stern in the late 1960s?   
JERRY COLANGELO: That's right.   
MATT WINER: Over that 50-year period, what kind of an impact did he have on the game?   
JERRY COLANGELO: He had a tremendous impact. He was a born lawyer, negotiator, who didn't know much about marketing, and he made himself a marketing genius in the technology age. He brought this league to where it is in terms of humble beginnings. Back in the day, there were about 25 people in the league office running the organization. It was a mom-and-pop organization. Not anymore. It's a multibillion dollar industry, and David deserves a lot of credit for that, he and other people he brought along. He developed a lot of people, and we owe a great deal and are in debt to him.   
MATT WINER: What can you say about what Kobe Bryant meant to basketball, not only in this country for a generation of NBA players who grew up worshiping him, but as you know, worldwide as well?   
JERRY COLANGELO: Well, the experiences I had with him started when I was 17, coming out of high school and working him out, thinking that we had a shot at him in the Draft, which we did until the Lakers jumped us by trading Vlade to Charlotte and taking him instead. We ended up with Steve Nash, who was not bad, but it wasn't Kobe.   
I had eight years with Kobe in the Olympics, and that was a wonderful experience. I really got to appreciate him. I saw the leadership that he had when we went to training camp. He was in the workout room at 5:30 working out on weights. LeBron, Carmelo, Wade, Bosh, all the guys with him, followed suit. In the first day of practice, diving for a loose ball -- he set the tone. Watching him in [Beijing], he was the pied piper. That's how big he was. He understood branding. He understood what it was all about. So that was a special thing.   
MATT WINER: Finally, what kind of legacy did Morgan Wootten leave behind?   
JERRY COLANGELO: One of the great, great high school coaches of all time, great coaches of all time. You can tell his legacy in all the players who came out of his program, and he made a great contribution to the game.   
MATT WINER: Jerry, thanks. Jerry Colangelo, everyone.   
(Applause.)   
A few updates now on the Hall of Fame's mission to grow the game. The Hall of Fame held its Hoop Hall High School Showcase and will continue to grow its high school and collegiate programs with upcoming events, including an inaugural December college doubleheader at The 02 Arena in London featuring Michigan and Kentucky. Also, expansive renovations of the Springfield museum are in their final stages. Major upgrades include the digital information centers, interactive features and completely new galleries, including the "Hall of Honor," featuring every Hall of Fame member with state-of-the-art digitized content and history, a unique "1891 Gallery" featuring the birth of the game, and a new James F. Goldstein "Super Fan Gallery," which for the first time allows the Hall to recognize and honor the greatest basketball fans in the game. That's right, Jimmy Goldstein is in the Hall of Fame.   
Speaking of super fans, we have one here today, basking in the glow of the Raptors championship, Toronto super fan Nav Bhatia.   
Finally, on April 4th, there will be a roll-out of historic U.S. Mint Basketball Hall of Fame coins celebrating the 60th anniversary of the Hall. I'm actually taking my pay in Hall of Fame coins today (laughter). Yeah, we worked it out. Be sure to look out for those this spring. For more info, go to the hall's website, hoophall.com   
Time now for the breaking news portion of the day. The Hall of Fame is proud to announce the winner of the 2020 Bunn Lifetime Achievement Award. It's the single greatest honor presented by the Hall of Fame outside of enshrinement. This year it will be awarded posthumously.   
He's best known as the "Father of Accessibility." Following his service in World War II, he began developing accessibility opportunities including wheelchair basketball for returning GIs at the University of Illinois.   
In 1949, he founded the National Wheelchair Basketball Association, and served as commissioner for the first 25 years. His life was dedicated to helping individuals with disabilities as a coach, mentor and tireless advocate. He helped transform the lives of many through the power of sports, focusing on the "ability" in disability. His Wheelchair Development Center in Champaign, Illinois, has grown into a hub that's produced many successful paralympians, and is now the U.S. paralympian training site.   
Join me in welcoming this year's recipient of the 2020 John Bunn Lifetime Achievement Award, Dr. Tim Nugent.   
(Applause.)   
We're pleased to be joined today by the current Executive Director of the NWBA, Mr. Will Waller.   
(Applause.)   
The Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame annually gives its Curt Gowdy Media Award to distinguished members of the media - one for work in print and one for electronic. This year the Hall has added two additional awards.   
The first is the Transformative Media Award, given to an individual or organization that has had significant, fresh and lasting impact on the format, content, fan enjoyment and understanding of the game. And the Media Insight Award, recognizing an individual or organization that brought a unique and occasionally provocative non-traditional perspective to fans and participants. Both awards further represent the ever-changing landscape on how basketball fans watch and enjoy this global game.   
First is the award winner for print journalism. He spent 31 years with The Washington Post, covering college sports and Major League Baseball, the NFL and of course the National Basketball Association. In 2001, he was named the top sports columnist by the Society of Professional Journalists, and in 2009 he earned the Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Association of Black Journalists. He is the editor of two New York Times best-selling books, both in collaboration with Hall of Famer Charles Barkley.   
Though also known today as an ESPN personality, he's elected as the winner of the 2020 Curt Gowdy Award for print media, Michael Wilbon.   
(Applause.)   
Michael is unable to be with us this afternoon. He has a good excuse. He's on TV right now.   
Our broadcast winner is a New York City native, now considered the voice of the NBA. Currently in his 28th season as the New York Knicks lead announcer. In addition to his NBA duties, he has covered college games and the WNBA, along with both men's and women's Olympic hoops.   
In 1998, he was named Broadcaster of the Year by the National Sportscaster & Sportswriters Association.   
One of the great gentlemen of the game, he's noted for his generous support, modesty and appreciation for his colleagues and industry veterans. Elected as the winner of the 2020 Curt Gowdy Award for Electronic Media, bang! Mike Breen.   
(Applause.)   
Now, our first new award winners need no introduction in basketball circles. Oh, I'm still supposed to introduce them? Okay. All right. Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, Charles Barkley and Shaquille O'Neal are a must-see team for NBA fans tuning in to this award-winning show.   
Since its debut in 1989, the show has offered a unique alternative to traditional studio shows, balancing basketball analysis and opinion, social commentary and a steady diet of silliness. Over the years, the show has earned nine Emmy Awards, while Ernie has won four Emmys as studio host and Charles Barkley three more as studio analyst.   
It's one of 12 programs and one of only three sports shows inducted into the Broadcasting and Cable Hall of Fame. Please join me in recognizing the 2020 Curt Gowdy Transformative Media Award winners -- TNT's "Inside the NBA."   
(Applause.)   
As usual, Ernie is doing the heavy lifting.   
Our final Gowdy Award goes to a journalist known for his provocative interview style and versatility in the industry. This two-time Sportscaster of the Year has over 40 years of broadcasting experience, including work in over 25 NBA Finals. Over the years, he's received 11 Emmy Awards for journalism, reporting and producing.   
Please join me in recognizing the winner of the 2020 Curt Gowdy Media Insight Award, Jim Gray.   
(Applause.)   
Ernie and Mike and Jim, if you would be so kind to join us on stage. Ernie Johnson, Mike Breen and Jim Gray, everybody.   
(Applause.)   
Congratulations one and all. First of all. Where are your knucklehead friends?   
ERNIE JOHNSON: I don't know. I kind of enjoy not being interrupted (laughter). They're all so pleased and gratified by this. I'm just so moved by this.   
MATT WINER: 30 years in, what do you hope the show is week to week?   
ERNIE JOHNSON: I hope it is not something that ends our careers (laughter). Sometimes some of the things that are said, you just hope, you know what they say, you're guilty by association.   
You know what, I think we try to show an appreciation for the game. When you work with those three, there's not a situation that comes up in a game that they haven't been ready for.   
At the same time, Charles broke the mold for studio shows and changed the landscape by saying, we don't always have to talk about basketball. We're able to branch out. I think the producers that we work with, Tim Kiely and Jeremy Levin, always said, if there's something that's going on in the world that we want to weigh in on, we're free to do that.   
So it's a basketball show that's mostly about basketball, but there are times when it's not, and we have the freedom and we are encouraged to put that in the show. It's been that kind of a road for 30 years, and to be here today and have the Hall recognize the show, I can't thank you enough.   
MATT WINER: Congratulations, Ernie.   
(Applause.)   
Mike, you spent so much of your career documenting all the great moments from great, great players and contributors to the game of basketball. What does it mean to you to be recognized as one of those?   
MIKE BREEN: You don't even think about it. To me, the job broadcasting these amazing players is the ultimate reward. Some of these gentlemen, some in the stands here, I always thought it was a privilege just to be calling their game. To get an award for it is overwhelming.   
MATT WINER: Who are the people you think influenced you?   
MIKE BREEN: When we got the word the other day, we were told we had to keep it a secret. So I couldn't tell anybody. But I started making a list. I had to make a list of all the people that are responsible for this. I'm not even close to finishing that list. It's very long. I couldn't think to start.   
It goes back to my parents, to my brothers. I grew up in a house of six boys, so I had no choice whatsoever than to be a sports fan. It started early.   
MATT WINER: Mike, congratulations.   
(Applause.)   
Congratulations. I feel like given your style of interviewing, I should really badger you right now.   
JIM GRAY: Go ahead. I've had my turn, now it's yours.   
MATT WINER: What does it mean to you, if you could sum it up?   
JIM GRAY: It means a great deal. Being in the Hall with all of these great athletes, I have to give thanks to all the great athletes. Just so thankful to Jerry Colangelo and all the folks. It's not something you can really put into words. You're overwhelmed. As Jerry Colangelo said, we're all in debt to David Stern. We're an NBA family. To be with this family and be with Ernie and that gang, Mike Breen, who I worked with for so long, and all the people at CBS, just gratitude.   
MATT WINER: Congratulations, Jim.   
(Applause.)   
Congratulations to all our winners.   
Let's move forward now. Onto today's headliners, no offense. The names of the finalists for the Hall of Fame class of 2020.   
Considering this year's unique circumstances and the prominence of the potential 2020 class, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Election Process Committee has suspended for one year the direct election categories with the exception of the International Committee. As a result, this year there will not be a class member from the following "direct elect" committees: the early African-American Pioneers, Veterans, Contributors and Women's Veterans.   
The decision was made to help the Hall of Fame focus on the inductees this year and allow our future direct electees recognition commensurate with their stature.   
The North American and Women's committees have also cut in half the number of finalists being named to again keep focus on the individuals being recognized this year and under recent events.   
The 2020 class announcement, which will include the name of the international class electee, will be April 4th in Atlanta at the NCAA Final Four.   
Now, the critical next step to being named to the Basketball Hall of Fame. Here are the eight finalists for the Hall of Fame class of 2020.   
From the North American and Women's Committees, her career basketball has been defined at every level by a single word - excellence. She began her career as an outstanding player at Louisiana Tech, leading her team to two national championships under Hall of Fame Coach Leon Barmore.   
As head coach of the Baylor Lady Bears, she has never had a losing season. Over 19 postseason appearances, her teams have reached four Final Fours and won three national championships, including last year's, when Baylor beat Notre Dame in a one-point thriller.   
She's the first person in history to win a national championship as a player, assistant and head coach.   
Selected a finalist by the Women's Committee as a coach, Kim Mulkey.   
(Applause.)   
Following an outstanding collegiate career at Michigan, the next nominee thrived as an NBA player with a career that included five All-Star appearances.   
His coaching career was equally remarkable, with over 500 career wins and back-to-back NBA championships with the Houston Rockets in 1994 and 1995.   
One of three coaches to lead a team to the NBA title and an Olympic gold medal, he was named NBA Coach of the Year in 1993 and led his team to seven consecutive playoff appearances, while reminding us to "never underestimate the heart of a champion."   
Named a finalist by the North American Committee as a coach, "Rudy T," Rudy Tomjanovich.   
(Applause.)   
Our next honoree is a Massachusetts native who spent over 40 years of her professional life dedicated to coaching women's college basketball. She began her career at Clark University, moved to the University of Massachusetts and then to her home since 1986, Bentley University.   
She is a five-time WBCA Division II National Coach of the Year and is the fifth coach in NCAA women's basketball history to reach 1,000 career wins. Along the way, she led her Bentley team to the Division II championship in 2014. She is ranked first on the all-time Division II women's victories list and has been enshrined in the New England and Women's Basketball halls of fame.   
Selected a finalist by the Women's Committee as a coach, Barbara Stevens.   
(Applause.)   
The next nominee's impressive coaching career began in the 1960s. By the time he retired in 2008, he'd won more than 800 games, made six NCAA Elite Eight appearances and three Final Fours. He's been recognized by four halls of fame and is the first coach in NCAA history to lead four schools to the NCAA Tournament.   
Named a finalist from the North American Committee as a coach, Eddie Sutton.   
(Applause.)   
This all-time great grew up on the island of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands dreaming of reaching the Olympics as a swimmer. Hurricane Hugo redirected him to basketball, and the rest is a history of understated greatness. His two-way play and poise at Wake Forest made him the national Player of the Year as a senior.   
He then became the first overall pick by the San Antonio Spurs in the 1997 Draft and the 1998 NBA Rookie of the Year. His professional rï¿½sumï¿½ includes five NBA championships, three finals MVPs and two league MVPs. He retired among the top 15 on the NBA career lists for points, rebounds, and blocks, and in 2016 the Spurs retired his jersey No. 21.   
Selected a finalist by the North American Committee as a player, Tim Duncan.   
(Applause.)   
Our next honoree was born in New Jersey but played her senior season of high school ball in Texas, where she earned All-America honors. At the University of Tennessee, she was a four-time All-American and helped lead the Vols to an NCAA championship as a freshman.   
Drafted third overall by the Indiana Fever, she made both an immediate and lasting impact on the WNBA -- as Rookie of the Year, a 10-time All-Star, five-time Defensive Player of the Year and league MVP.   
She spent her entire 16-year career with Indiana, and in 2012 the Fever's do-everything forward helped lead the Fever to its first and only WNBA championship and was named the Finals MVP.   
Named a finalist by the Women's Committee as a player, Tamika Catchings.   
(Applause.)   
The next nominee is a South Carolina native who was named the National High School Player of the Year while attending Farragut Career Academy here on Chicago's West Side. Drafted by the Minnesota Timberwolves with the fifth pick in the 1995 NBA Draft, he would become the first person in 20 years to be selected by an NBA team directly from high school. With his unusual blend of length, skill and intensity, he quickly achieved beyond his years, making the All-Star Game in his second season while leading the Timberwolves to their first ever playoff appearance.   
An All-Star in 10 of his first 12 seasons and a league MVP in 2004. After 12 years in Minnesota, he moved to Boston, and in his first year as a Celtic, became the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year while teaming up with fellow All-Stars Ray Allen and Paul Pierce to lead the Celtics to the NBA championship.   
You know him as "KG" or "The Big Ticket," and selected as a finalist by the North American Committee as a player, Kevin Garnett.   
(Applause.)   
Steady, KG. Steady, KG (Laughter).   
Our last finalist was born in Philadelphia and attended Lower Merion High School, where he was named Parade Magazine and the Naismith Prep Player of the Year. Opting to forego college, he was the 13th pick by the Charlotte Hornets in 1996 but quickly traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, where he spent his entire 20-year career establishing himself as an all-time great.   
Teaming with Hall of Fame Coach Phil Jackson and Hall of Fame center Shaquille O'Neal, he won three consecutive NBA championships by the time he was 23. Later he would lead the league in scoring in consecutive seasons and in 2008 won the league's MVP award. He then returned to three more NBA Finals, winning two more titles and earning Finals MVP awards for both.   
A five-time NBA champion and 18-time All-Star, he also won Olympic gold medals with Team USA at the Beijing and London Olympics.   
Considered one of the greatest to ever play the game and named a finalist by the North American Committee as a player -- and we sure wish he were here today -- Kobe Bryant.   
(Applause.)   
And now if you'd be so kind, we'd like to hear from a couple of our finalists. Kevin, Tamika, can you come up for a moment. Tamika Catchings and Kevin Garnett, everyone.   
(Applause.)   
Congratulations. I listed off a lot of places in your rï¿½sumï¿½. Where do you think of when you think of this moment? Is it Tennessee? Is it Texas? Is it Indiana?   
TAMIKA CATCHINGS: Currently it's Indiana, but I'm so blessed and thankful for all the opportunities. Growing up, my dad played with a lot of these guys. So it's a blessing to be able to travel and be alongside of him and just to see the game. Of course, as you get older, you never dreamed of this opportunity. I dreamed of being in the WNBA, and Sheryl was one of my role models. I wanted to be just like her. I wanted to be like her, and so now to be able to have this opportunity with her sitting back there, gosh, I never dreamed of it.   
MATT WINER: Well done. Congratulations.   
(Applause.)   
Kevin, what would that kid who made the leap to the NBA in 1995 think of this?   
KEVIN GARNETT: He'd probably think this is pretty awesome right here.   
MATT WINER: It is.   
KEVIN GARNETT: The Hall of Fame is something that you don't really think about, don't really dream about; it just happens. It is a tremendous honor. It's one of the more overwhelming situations I've ever been in. Thank you.   
MATT WINER: It comes the day after we learned the Celtics will be retiring your number as well. Double congratulations.   
(Applause.)   
There you have it. Our nominees for the Hall of Fame class of 2020, all well deserved. We appreciate all of you in the room and all of you at home taking the time to share with us this afternoon these announcements.   
A final round of applause for all the 2020 Hall of Fame finalists, everyone.   
(Applause.)   
Congratulations one and all. A reminder, the class of 2020 will be introduced Saturday, April 4th at the NCAA Final Four in Atlanta. Enshrinement 2020 will take place August 29th in Springfield, Massachusetts, at the Naismith Basketball Memorial Hall of Fame.
