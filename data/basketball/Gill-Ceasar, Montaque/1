  Missouri - 54 
  
THE MODERATOR:   We'll take an opening statement from coach and then take questions for the student‑athletes.   
COACH ANDERSON:   Yeah, this may sound crazy, I was real proud of my guys.   I thought we played extremely hard.   Obviously, we made too many mistakes at critical times.   We had a chance to get the game tied.   We had a chance to get it close a few times.   We threw the ball away.   
But by and large, I thought our effort was good, our execution wasn't very good sometimes.   But I think South Carolina had something to do with that.   
We played a lot of zone, which we normally don't, and I thought that helped us throughout the game.   They shot the ball better than we hoped they would.   But that's part of the game, so.  
I'm not happy about losing, but you know what?   I'm proud of the effort from our guys.   
THE MODERATOR:   All right.   We'll take questions for the student‑athletes, please.   
   
 Q.   Obviously you don't like to end your season like this, your first season, but what positives are you taking away from your freshman year?   
MONTAQUE GILL‑CAESAR:   I learned how to play the game in a different way.   I learned how to slow down.   I learned how to read the game a little bit better.   I learned I have to work a little bit harder on different things.   On shooting, on defense, on watching film, just everything.   
So I think that I grew a lot as a player.   I think we all grew a lot as individuals this season.   I think we took a lot away from this season.   
   
 Q.   For both of you guys, this game kind of seemed familiar.   You had some runs and you had a kind of a drought at the end.   How did you feel like you guys played offensively?   
RYAN ROSBURG:   Yeah, it was familiar.   We were close and kind of just needed to make plays at certain times that we didn't.   Kind of just looking to get over that hump and get stops when we need to and get buckets when we need to.   
MONTAQUE GILL‑CAESAR:   I definitely felt the same way.   I think that we didn't convert like we needed to, but we know we got a lot of second chances and we just couldn't get a break, really.   But we played really hard.   
THE MODERATOR:   All right.   We'll excuse the student‑athletes.   You can return to the locker room.   Thank you.   
We'll take questions for coach.   
   
 Q.   What was your message to your guys afterwards?  
COACH ANDERSON:   Well, it was disappointing.   But I said this maybe before you guys got in here, I was proud.   I was proud of their effort.   
It's the same old story, we couldn't convert when we needed to at crucial times.   We turned the ball over too much.   We did a great job on the boards.   I thought we did a pretty good job defensively for a long time until the end, and then we started fouling too much.   We made some dumb fouls.   
But my message to these guys was, especially Keith and Keanau, obviously I appreciate them.   I only had one year with them.   
And to the other guys, I said, Hey, we got a lot of work to do, obviously.   I think that Tekhi maybe said it over here a minute ago is, you got to learn how to play the game at this level.   Sometimes it's a lot harder than it was at the previous level.   
So hopefully we learn something and hopefully we learn how hard it is to be successful at this level.   When we crank it up again here in a few days or maybe in a week or two, then we'll be ready to put this behind us and understand just how difficult it is to play college basketball.   It's not easy.   Not everybody gets to do it.   
   
 Q.   You might have addressed this, but just the change in starting lineup with Keith out.   What was behind that?  
COACH ANDERSON:   Yeah, Keith, I started Tramaine tonight.   Keith, we had a little violation of team rules, and so I decided to start Tramaine with the idea that Keith would play and he did, so...   
By the way, I thought Tramaine played well.   I thought Tramaine did a good job.   
   
 Q.   Did you feel like Johnathan was forcing some things tonight?   He obviously didn't shoot the ball well.   
COACH ANDERSON:   Yeah, I thought he missed some shots early on that were bad.   But maybe at times, he got some shots.   He got some good shots, he just didn't make them.   Maybe there was a few he probably forced, but by and large we've encouraged him all year to be aggressive offensively.   I've encouraged hum to shoot the ball from the perimeter because I think ultimately, now this year's not, maybe not a great example, but I think ultimately he'll be guy who can shoot the ball from the perimeter.  
But if you look at our stats, he's one of our leading 3‑point shooters.   He's in the low to mid 30s.   So, heck, shoot it.   
   
 Q.   Is it kind of your approach to have some urgency to get going right away or do you want to step back and let these guys kind of breathe a little bit before you get going again?  
COACH ANDERSON:   Yeah, we're going to breathe.   You know, this has been a tough year.   Any time you don't win games, it's a tough year.   We have had our share of issues, we have had our share of challenges.   I think that it will be good for us to step away for, not for a long time, but a week or so and maybe get our batteries recharged, both as players and as coaches.   
We'll be out recruiting, but it will give them a chance to step back and reflect on the season and then visit with each guy individually and then get back together as a team and start working for next year.   
THE MODERATOR:   All right, thank you very much.   
COACH ANDERSON:   Thank you.
