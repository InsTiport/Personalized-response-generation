<p>	Q.  Temeka, were you surprised they played as much zone as they did and was it, did you have some trouble executing against the zone? </p>
<p>	Q.  Temeka, were they able to do something specific to limit your transition game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Seimone, it looked like shooting tonight the angles sort of flattened out.  I was wondering, was there some difficulty adjusting to the sense of depth perception out there tonight?  Did you take a while to get used to the arena to shoot? </p>
<p>	Q.  Sometimes with a wide background it's hard to --</p>
<p>	Q.  Both of you, can you talk about the emotion; is it anger, frustration, you know?</p>

<p>	Q.  This is for Seimone and then Temeka.  Did Baylor throw anything at you that really surprised you, such as Abiola Wabara, she's not been known as being a scorer and a driver and she came through with some key buckets late in the game; did that surprise you to see her driving like that or did it not make any difference? </p>

<p>	Q.  Seimone, talk about the defense they played against you; how were they able to keep you out of the foul line area where you hit a lot of your shots and was that some of the best defense you've seen against yourself? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach touched on this a little bit, but she talked about earning it and the fact that you may not have done enough of that tonight.  Can you talk about when things got a little out of sync there in the second half, with the turnovers and so forth, and what was going through your minds after building that 15-point lead? </p>

<p>	Q.  It looked like the transition game was really working for you early.  They called a time-out down 24-9.  Do you feel you went away from it as much as they took some things away? </p>
<p>	Q.  Whitaker's shot right at the end of the first half, you didn't look too happy.  Did you feel your players should have been better prepared for them trying that play and also what kind of momentum does a play like that to end the half give a team? </p>
<p>	Q.  What did you think of Mulkey's defensive game plan and changing defenses and the way she kept Seimone out of that area that Seimone shoots from a lot?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know we asked you a bunch last week about having not been tested enough; is maybe this specifically what you guys hadn't seen enough through the years even though you're a team that did make you play half court and kind of eliminate transition for this many minutes of a game?</p>
