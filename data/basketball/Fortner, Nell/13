 COACH NELL FORTNER:  I thought Tennessee was outstanding today.  They shot the ball extremely well and just absolutely just man-handled us.  We didn't have an answer for it.  It was a long day for us. 

 Q.  For any of the players, can you talk about what they were doing defensively to make it so hard to get shots off and then to make shots? 
 UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  Well, it was a very aggressive denial defense.  They kind of disrupted our offense.  It forced us to try to create shots, not get in a real flow in our offensive game tonight. 
 Q.  Considering they had lost on Sunday, I think Zolman talked about how anxious they were to get out here and get started.  Did you expect that, the way they started? 
 COACH NELL FORTNER:  Yeah.  Yeah, they're notorious for coming back after a loss and getting after you. 
 So, you know, they're really big.  They're very big right now.  Even though Pat is forced to play a different lineup than they started the season with, they're extremely big.  It's hard to see around things.  When you're trying to create some opportunities for yourself, it's hard to see open players 'cause they're very big to pass the ball around.
