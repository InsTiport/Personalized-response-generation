 Q.   One of the defining moments this year was when LeBron dunked on you.   Would you consider asking him to come out and maybe let you return the favor as part of the dunk contest?  
BEN MCLEMORE:   No, I wouldn't say that.   I mean, it's the NBA.   You're going to get dunked on one day.   You're going to get dunked on.   
But at the same time, I mean, it would be cool if he came out to be one of my props or something like that, but it depends on how the routine goes and that.   
   
 Q.   This year's contest is really a star‑studded field.   How do you size up your competition?  
BEN MCLEMORE:   It's kind of‑‑ it is my first year, but at the same time, just seeing other dunkers and seeing what they do and try to do better.   
It's a little different this year.   I'm still trying to learn what I need to do to prepare myself.  
   
 Q.   With the new format, is there a particular guy from the East that you want to go head to head against?  
BEN MCLEMORE:   I don't know.   I'm ready to go up against all of them.   
But it's a team thing.   It's a team effort.   I need my team to win, so there's the battle round, too.   So it doesn't matter who I go up against.   I'm just going to compete.  
   
 Q.   How much around the league do you guys take notice when somebody throws down a big dunk?  
BEN MCLEMORE:   I definitely see it.   But that's it.   You know, I see it, and if it's a great dunk, you know, maybe it's in the Top 10 dunks or the dunk of the night.   And I try to go out there and perform myself.
