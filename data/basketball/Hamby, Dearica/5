Wake Forest   72
  Pittsburgh ‑ 58

COACH JEN HOOVER:   We came here with one thing on our mind.   We've been preparing for this since July, and these two young ladies have obviously been preparing for it for a lot longer than that. 
A lot of credit for Pitt, they are scrappy.   They play with a lot of heart.   We've got a couple ‑‑ they're undersized, but they never really considered themselves out of the game.   Really proud of our team.   We came in with a couple of main goals, one was taking care of the ball, and the other was rebounding, I felt like we did a great job with both of those.

Q.   How important was it to win by 14 points instead of having a game that goes down to the buzzer?   And also were you trying to rest Chelsea and Dearica as much as you could during the game? 
COACH JEN HOOVER:   I think it was important for us to be able to hold on to the lead once we were able to push it out and not have a chance for them to ‑‑ we knew they were going to keep coming back.   We talked to the team about it.   They're not going to go away.   It's March Madness, no team wants to pack their bags and go home. 
Chelsea, she's coming off two days ago being sick and having a bottle and a half of IV yesterday.   We did come in trying to be a little concerned about making sure she was not going to get dehydrated or worn out through her period, so I think we did look to rest her a little bit more when we could.   That's something she's not very used to nor does she like it. 

Q.   Have you noticed, did it change anything early on, the way they were playing [inaudible]?
COACH JEN HOOVER:   We knew they were going to ‑‑ she draws a lot of attention obviously.   We knew coming out of the game that we were able to execute a few plays, particularly in a lot of different ways.   We knew we were going to have to run some different action, and I thought our kids did a great job hitting her on the move some early, which I think was critical for us, not just leaving her down low, and getting beat up the whole game, if you will, but being able to get her on the move.
But they're quick and athletic, and they were undersized.   But I think they played with a lot of heart and Coach Suzie does a great job with them.   We knew it was going to be a battle. 

Q.   How important is this tournament to you, Chelsea?
CHELSEA DOUGLAS:   I wanted to keep playing as long as I could.   And I was playing to win. 

Q.   Dea, how important was it for you after getting named to the All ACC First Tournament to possibly make a statement?
DEARICA HAMBY:   [Inaudible.] 

Q.   What did you do better than when you first played there? 
DEARICA HAMBY:   Moved the ball. 

Q.   Can you talk about the contribution you got on the boards from Kandice and also Jill?
COACH JEN HOOVER:   I thought both of those were huge for us at different moments.   We kind of challenged Jill a little bit halftime.   Felt like she was not giving us as much on the boards and cutting‑wise, but felt she was doing a great job in the back of the zone and in concepts defensively. 
I thought Kandice's rebounds were huge for us.   And the 4‑minute period she put together on the floor.   And again, I think some of it is just the workinprogress as we come along.   She's gotten more and more comfortable.   And against a team like that that's smaller and athletic, she was able to give us some huge minutes, as well. 

Q.   Chelsea, in the first half right after they tied it up you had a couple of 3s in a row, did your eyes sort of light up when you got those shots? 
CHELSEA DOUGLAS:   It was pretty good, it helped give us the momentum.   And, yeah, it definitely gave ‑‑ made my eyes light up.   If I see a few going down, it's pretty much going up. 

Q.   You get to play North Carolina, Coach.   First time you played them you were with them 33, 34 minutes.   What do you need to do tomorrow to stay the whole game? 
COACH JEN HOOVER:   We have to get some rest and get off our legs.   And get a good meal at Pastabilities, one of our favorite places in town.   Carolina has a lot of quickness and athleticism.   We have to play the entire 40 minutes.   We have to earn it and earn it on every single possession.   And I think tomorrow the two big things:   We have to be able to take care of the ball and take care of the rebounds, I think those two will be crucial for tomorrow night.
