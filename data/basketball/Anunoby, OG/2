 Q.  OG, I talked to you yesterday about your workout with the Raptors.  Can you elaborate, did you have a feeling that you'd be the pick and what your feelings are right now?  
OG ANUNOBY: I didn't work out, it was just a meeting.   
 Q.  Yeah, your meeting with them.  
OG ANUNOBY: It went really well.  I met them a couple times so far right now.  We have a good relationship.  I like the front office a lot.   
 Q.  Coming into tonight did you have a good idea that that's where you would end up?  
OG ANUNOBY: I had a feeling, but I wasn't for sure.   
 Q.  The Raptors are just like maybe one piece away from being an Eastern Conference champ.  What do you think you bring to that, and do you think they can overcome Cleveland?  
OG ANUNOBY: I think I bring a versatile wing defender that can defend multiple positions, and on offense hit open shots, cut to the basket, and then just create havoc on defense.   
 Q.  OG, where are you at on your rehab?  Have you thought about life in Toronto?  Have you been to Toronto?  
OG ANUNOBY: Yeah, I was in Toronto a couple days ago.  My rehab, I'm two months ahead of schedule right now, I'm starting to do a lot more on the court, I started running.  I should be back full go October, November.   
 Q.  Have you thought about how you'll fit in with the guys there?  Obviously they have some All-Star level talent and supporting pieces, as well?  Have you thought about how you're going to fit in?  
OG ANUNOBY: Like on the court?   
 Q.  Yeah, they've been looking for a two-way three for a long time, as well.  
OG ANUNOBY: Yeah, just playing hard on both ends of the court, bringing that, and just defensively guarding everyone, being able to switch on different positions.
