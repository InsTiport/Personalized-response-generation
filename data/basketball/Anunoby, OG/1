 Q.  What do you learn from being around and watching Kawhi throughout the year and specifically here in these last few weeks in terms of how he prepares for these playoff games?  
OG ANUNOBY: Attention to detail.  Attention to detail.  He's very serious, very locked in at all times.  He prepares really well.  He takes care of his body, stuff like that.   
 Q.  Do you feel like that's helped you in terms of your career, having a chance to be around him this much?  
OG ANUNOBY: Yeah, seeing it makes me want to do it just like he does.  Stuff like that.   
 Q.  What kind of impact do you think Drake has and how do you feel about him getting the fans stirred up and getting into the heads of apparently one coach?  
OG ANUNOBY: Yeah, I think it's good.  He brings a bunch of energy.  He gets the fans into it, too.   
 Q.  When it comes to heckling is there a fine line between what's acceptable and what's not?  
OG ANUNOBY: Yeah, like you can't like say like bad words.  I mean, I guess you can.  There's a point you can take it too far. I think most people know when it gets too far.
