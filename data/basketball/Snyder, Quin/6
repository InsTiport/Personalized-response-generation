Jazz - 94, Warriors - 106   
 Q.  Those two runs at the beginning of the second quarter and fourth quarter that really changed the game.  What was that, and is there anything that you can do to get that bench play going a little bit better?  
QUIN SNYDER: Yeah, think one of the things about Golden State is just how quick they think.  Just mentally, they're able to get, not just from possession to possession, but within a possession.  During that time, I felt like that was on display.   
They changed ends quickly.  They back cut.  I'll just have to look at the film, but I thought they just were smarter, yes, but just more urgent and quicker thinking, more reactive.  If you have those moments where you're not urgent enough, they just punish you for it.  And that's to me, there were a lot of things in transition defense, not finding Klay Thompson in transition, lot of things like that.  But that's kind of the common theme in my mind is how quickly they think.  How connected they are.   
 Q.  Obviously, tough shooting there for Gordon.  Was that just them taking him out defensively or what did you see from him tonight?  
QUIN SNYDER: I think both teams can shoot better.  I didn't feel like Gordon was hesitant to shoot.  There were a couple he didn't make.  They did a good job trying to limit his looks.  But the couple clean ones he got, he was making those, and I would anticipate him making them.  There's more there than that.  Shooting is a little bit of an equalizer, but we were outplayed.   
 Q.  You talked about not being able to find Klay Thompson in transition.  How costly were those rushed turnovers in the first half to let the Warriors get out and run?  
QUIN SNYDER: Constantly.  It's hard to overcome those.  I mean, you can, but you've got to play really well.  There was pressure on you all the time.  So you're going to have a breakdown in basketball.  People make mistakes.  You just can't have them consecutively or that many of them.  During that time, I mean, he's a great player.  If you give him space and opportunities, he'll make you pay, and he did.   
 Q.  Can you just talk about usually you have one or two guys that step up and play well like Joe or Gordon.  But tonight you just didn't have anybody.  Leading scorer only had 13 points.  
QUIN SNYDER: Yeah, they're, you know, one of the top defensive with the top or second best defensive team in the league for a reason.  They switch a lot, they switch a lot of pick-and-rolls.  They switch a lot of screening actions.  It gets back to what I was saying about how quickly they think and connect.  So if there are windows where you're open, they cover those.  Those are moments, and you have to be very, very ready to make plays or it gets harder.   
So, hopefully we'll continue to get more aware of that and get better at attacking that.  Sometimes good defense has as much to do with anything.  Give them credit.  They're a terrific defensive team, and we've got to be better offensively to attack them.
