Q.   Do you feel like Boris and Matt on Serge tonight kind of pulled him out of the lane and opened up things a little bit more down low for you guys?
TIM DUNCAN:   Yeah, definitely helped.   Boris shot the ball really well and just the threat of Matt being out there I think helped us to keep him out of the lane a little bit and spread him out a little bit.   It was a great move by Pop, a little adjustment there, and it obviously worked out. 

Q.You ve been around a long time and seen a lot of playoff games   five games and really five dominant wins by the winning team   is this unusual?
TIM DUNCAN:   Yeah.   It s the craziest series I ve ever been involved in.     The back and forth, the changes, the leads and the wins.   I don t know how to explain it.     They always talk about in a series about adjustments and both coaches have made some great adjustments and continued to respond and the results are what they are.     We got to hopefully go into OKC and try to get this thing done.

Q.   In warmups you looked so focused coming into this game, and tonight it actually paid off.   Talk about your performance a little bit. 
TIM DUNCAN:   I don't know if it was just focused and anxious and everything else after the two games in OKC, just disappointed with the efforts there.   Just wanted to put a better one on the floor, and obviously didn't want to go down three games in a row.   Just ready to go, and I think all the guys top to bottom were ready to go.   I think we were all focused, all in the moment, and we knew what we had in front of us, and just a great result from everyone. 

Q.   Can you talk about the challenge of going to Oklahoma City now that you've seen the home teams dominate as much and go in with an attitude that you can end it there? 
TIM DUNCAN:   Yeah, we absolutely believe we can.   It's a tough place to play, and we've lost however many in a row there, and they're going to be fighting for their lives.   All those factors altogether is not going to make it an easy game for us.   But we feel we play the right way.   We take care of the ball.   We do the things that we've been talking about all series long.   There's no reason why we can't win it. 

Q.   Was this the way that you guys‑‑ is this Spurs basketball, hitting the three, getting the assists?   Is this the way you guys are used to playing?
TIM DUNCAN:   This is the way we've been playing all season long and how we need to play to win.   We shared the ball real well, we moved the ball real well, we moved our bodies, we took something away from them, and we made them react.   And on top of that, you have a night where guys shoot the ball as well as they did, and it turns into the score that it did.   We don't expect everybody to shoot that well, night in and night out, but we'll take it when it happens. 

Q.   Oklahoma City scored 32 in the first but 57 for the rest of the game.   What did you guys do defensively, especially the second half? 
TIM DUNCAN:   I think we just settled in.   More than anything you change a game plan, you change certain things about a game plan, and you've got to get used to what they're asking you to do.   They came out, obviously their confidence is high after the two wins in OKC, and they're playing at a very high level, and they're feeding off of that.   Took a while for it to settle in, and as I said, we cut down a lot of fast break points.   They didn't have the easy things that they did in the last two games, and then we started hitting some shots and the pressure starts turning up a little bit.   So all that put together, we continued to grind and found a way to kind of make them break. 

Q.   Talk about Boris's effort tonight.   He came in and started that second half and took Ibaka away from the basket and did his thing. 
TIM DUNCAN:   Yeah, he's key for us, obviously with his play making, his passing.   He's been scoring the ball really well.   But just his high IQ as a basketball player is what's really changed the series for us.   He's done great offensively, making moves there, going at Ibaka, going at anybody that guards him.   On top of that, just passing the ball, moving without the ball and making shots tonight, as well, is a huge difference for us.
