<p>	Q.  Congratulations on the big win.  At what point in the third quarter did you just feel it for you, this was your night? </p>
<p>	Q.  Were you aware that you had been shutout for almost 14 minutes of the second and third quarters when you finally got that basket and the three-point play and things began to roll at that point?</p>
<p>	Q.  I don't know if you felt like -- it's not going for me. </p>
<p>	Q.  Your defense seemed substantially better tonight, especially in the second half, the Spurs defense, that is, not you personally --</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you attribute that to?  Was there anything you were doing differently or just a better effort?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you describe the role Gregg Popovich had, and specifically tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  And tonight did he do anything differently? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you please tell me what it's like to have had Manu as a teammate the last three years and watching him grow so much?</p>
<p>	Q.  Along the same line, you're not GM, I don't think you are, but you guys --</p>
<p>	Q.  Everybody comes back, long-range things set up; is that a good feeling and you expect that this is a team that can kind of, with some little pieces staying together?</p>
