<p>	Q. There was a point last night in the first quarter where it seemed where when Pop substituted in Glenn Robinson, you got a couple of bench guys out, seemed to be struggling, can you talk about the play of Glenn Robinson who has not played, because of circumstances with his family, has not gotten a lot of playing time in recent weeks and what kind of spark he gave your team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you get a sense that Coach had confidence to put him in at that stage?</p>
<p>	Q.  Other than the first couple four, five, six minutes, was that the kind of night that you guys need to have and want to have against Rasheed to be effective against him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Were you surprised that for whatever reason they did not keep going to him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Were you at all and the team at all surprised in the fourth quarter in the way you were able to dominate and completely frustrate that team, because the Pistons are not used to being frustrated like you did last night in the fourth quarter? </p>
<p>	Q.  Speaking of Manu, you see him do the crazy things that he does all the time.  Does he do anything that surprises you at all? </p>
<p>	Q.  What's it been like having Robert Horry as a teammate the last couple years after going against him in those battles against the Lakers?</p>
<p>	Q.  Like in the huddles?  What type of things does he say in the huddles?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about Coach Popovich during time-outs.  We get a sense of what he's like during time-outs and how he is in the huddles with you guys, what is your sense?  Was he extra fiery or has he been fiery in the post-season in general? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about the fourth quarter last night but going back to the Western Conference Finals, this team is very efficient in the fourth and closed Phoenix down in that, can you talk about your fourth-quarter execution and has that gotten better since the two games in Seattle?</p>
<p>	Q.  Pop has also talked about how you guys are a chameleon like team and if you need to score like you did in the Phoenix series, you can, and how different is that, because most elite teams it's about imposing their will but you guys seem to go, well, we'll just adapt what's needed and meet you where you are. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you describe your on-the-court personality? </p>
<p>	Q.  Well, you're considered to be quiet, but...</p>
<p>	Q.  Where does that style come from? </p>
