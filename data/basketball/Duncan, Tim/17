Q.   What do you need to do for Game 4?
TIM DUNCAN:   We just need to play better, shoot the ball better, just continue to attack and be more aggressive and try to get to the basket, get to the free‑throw line, just get them on their heels a little bit.   I think we got on our heels too much, and the result was what it was.

Q.   Do you guys feel like maybe you settled for jump shots?
TIM DUNCAN:   I don't know that we settled for them.   We took what was there.   We just didn't make shots.

Q.   Not that it's an excuse or anything, but do you think the 22‑0 free throw differential in the third quarter was a result of their aggression, their being more aggressive? 
TIM DUNCAN:   Whatever you want to call it.   That's a discrepancy that can't happen.   That'll kill you every time.   You've got a situation like that where those are easy points, especially for them, a team that kind of lives on the free‑throw line, and something that we've done a great job of kind of keeping them off of.   That changes the ballgame. 

Q.   How much if at all did you feel like the drama and the energy and emotion of Serge coming back and crowd and all that stuff, did that affect your performance?
TIM DUNCAN:   I don't believe so.   I don't think so.   He played well.   He did.   He did what he usually does for them, and that changed the game for them.   But emotionally wise, I don't think it changed anything for us.
