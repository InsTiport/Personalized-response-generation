 Q.   Tim, is this harder or easier than any end of series where you didn't win a championship?   
TIM DUNCAN:   Finishing the year and losing is always hard.   I don't know if it's comparable from one to the other.   It was a very tough series.   Obviously it was a very good team and an incredible Game 7.   A lot of respect for those guys.   A lot of respect for‑‑ we thought we kind of had them at certain points, they continued to fight, made some unbelievable shots, unbelievable plays, and we thought we had it, but such is life.   
   
 Q.   It's early and this is fresh, but is this the last that you've played in the NBA, or have you put any thought into coming back?  
TIM DUNCAN:   I think it's a little early to think about that.   
   
 Q.   What did you think about Chris Paul's performance tonight and the shot he made at the end?  
TIM DUNCAN:   Just unbelievable.   He was incredible, all around.   Just an amazing competitor.   I know he was a little hurt, I know he was playing a little hurt, and he played through all that, found ways to get it done.   I mean, just an unbelievable last shot over two of us.   He's just a great leader, and it was amazing to watch.   I wish I wasn't on the other end.  
   
 Q.   Pop did say, especially from a money standpoint, he could see you and Manu and himself coming back, not coming back next season.   Would you agree with that?  
TIM DUNCAN:   What's the question?   
   
 Q.   Would you agree with Pop's statement that he expects you and Manu and himself to be back next season?   
TIM DUNCAN:   If that's what he said, that's what he said.   I'm not making any statements thus far.   
   
 Q.   What was your emotion in the locker room afterwards and after the series?  
TIM DUNCAN:   It's obviously disappointment.   We ended the year strong and played well.   Obviously put ourselves in kind of a tough situation with some losses throughout the year.   It could have been a different bracket, obviously.   But we got what we got.   We got a very good team, very hot team, and I think we played our butts off.   
Would have loved to have back Game 6 and played a little better in that respect, but we didn't, they showed up, but we laid it out on the line tonight.   I don't think there's anything to be ashamed of in that respect.   Top to bottom, I think we played our asses off.   They just played better.   Hats off to them, and good luck to them.   
   
 Q.   Doc said that with about two minutes left and there was a time‑out, you went up to him and said can you believe this is a Game 7.   Can you talk about the magnitude of this series and your statement to him about can you believe it's a Game 7?  
TIM DUNCAN:   I don't think I said that.   I said I can't believe this is the first round.   Yeah, I think we both believe that we're very good teams, and for this to be a first‑round match‑up is unbelievable.   As I said, we did some things throughout the season that could have kept us out of that position, but we got who we got.   We ran into a better team, and they pulled it out.   It's a fun game to play and a fun series to play, but they won it, and they move on.
