Q.  It's obvious you went from 15 out of 15 to really fighting it tonight.  Amazing how quick it can turn around?
 
TIM DUNCAN:  Yeah, yeah it is.  Just a tough night all around from the field from the line, just everything.  They played a great game.  They shot the ball incredibly, every open shot they got they hit.  They just put together the perfect game.  And really not making free throws from the line really helped them out, just kind of added to it.  
 
Q.  How much were you rattled by their double team tonight having Joe Johnson on you?  He seemed to be a bit better?
 
TIM DUNCAN:  It worked well for him.  Didn't get the ball quick enough, allowed their traps to work.  And just an adjustment I have to make for the next game. 
 
Q.  Talk about the frustration of not closing it out tonight?
 
TIM DUNCAN:  It's frustrating because we played so badly we still had a chance to win, and we don't get those stops down towards the end.  We have the opportunity, three layups towards the end right at the rim and we blew those, two of them mine and Rob (Horry) lost the ball on the way up.  Just things happen.  We're still up 3-1, still excited about that and we still just got to get one more. 
 
Q.  Does this shake your confidence at all or was this just a good team playing well and winning a game?
 
TIM DUNCAN:  I don't know that it shakes our confidence.  I think they played very well and we played poorly.  So the combination of both really gave them the game.  We helped them a bunch, missing free throws, turning the ball over.  They shoot 57 percent, basically 60 percent from the field, just a lot of factors worked towards their side.  I don't think it shakes us.  I think we regroup, we go in there the next game and try to get it again.
