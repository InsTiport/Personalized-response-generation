<p>	Q.  Are you okay with playing a game on Father's Day? </p>
<p>	Q.  Over these last few games, how much more difficult has it been to create space in the paint and to get more effective passes down the low post?</p>
<p>	Q.  And beyond moving the ball, Robert Horry talked about the quickness of your guards, saying that they needed to be a little more crafty to get around guys, maybe get some better passing angles, what other tangible things can you point to? </p>
<p>	Q.  Have you seen big men this athletic, and to who would you compare them, if you have? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just reflect on the last two games and what you could use from that to maybe help you the rest of the series? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you and Manu, when you have time like this to reflect, sit there and mentally beat yourself up over things? </p>
<p>	Q.  Yesterday Rasheed in describing the differences between you and him, your personalities, he said that you were day and he was night.  How would you describe the differences between you and Rasheed? </p>
