 Q. The importance of the chemistry of any team, one of the issues is getting the chemistry amongst all you guys. You've been on a lot of great teams that have had great chemistry. 
 TIM DUNCAN: It's huge for us. It's been our biggest problem so far, just trying to get everybody on the same page and trying to get a couple wins in a row to get a positive energy, positive vibe in the locker room, all that stuff, and all that stuff lends to chemistry. It's coming. People are rooting for each other, pulling each other along, but a couple wins, a couple things going the right way for a couple games in a row could really kind of have the same impact.

 Q. How important was last night?
 TIM DUNCAN: Very important, very important. It was huge for us to get that win. I know there's that lull before the break, and we didn't have that. We went out and played hard, and we played probably as well as we have all year long. 

 Q. Are you at a point in your career yet where you sort of see (Inaudible)?
 TIM DUNCAN: Yeah, I've been there for a while. (Laughs.)

 Q. Do you have an idea how much longer you want to do this?
 TIM DUNCAN: I have one year this year and I have two years after this, and I think it's time for me to go home after that. (Laughs.) That's what I'm planning on right now.

 Q. If you were to feel physically at a point as good as you do now, would you keep going?
 TIM DUNCAN: I'd love to play as long as I can. I want to play, I want to be effective on the court, not be on the court just to be on the court. I'm a player, I'm a competitor, and if I can do it, do it the way I want to do it, then I'll keep going.
