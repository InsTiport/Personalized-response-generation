<p>	Q. Can you talk about how much the layoff, I assume, has helped your ankle? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you reflect on when you injured it in Detroit, and that was probably the worst. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the problems or the challenge facing two active defenders like Rasheed Wallace and Ben Wallace poses for you. </p>
<p>	Q.  As someone who has been through knee rehab can you even speculate or imagine what it must be like to come back from multiple major knee surgeries?</p>
<p>	Q.  You were talking a minute ago about Ben and Rasheed as defenders, but Rasheed specifically, what's the toughest thing about playing against a guy like that on the floor?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you look at what he's done for that team, how much of an X-factor is he?</p>
<p>	Q.  Losing last year like you did to the Lakers and then at the Olympics, did it make you gain a greater appreciation for the two years that you did win and did it serve as extra motivation? </p>
<p>	Q.  Given the connection with Pop and Larry, how similar are the defensive approaches and philosophies between the two teams?</p>
<p>	Q.  Because of the way Manu and Tony have developed, do you feel more so than the last few times you've been the Finals that if you had a stretch where you don't score or offensively you are not doing it, you are better able to withstand that now because of them?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you think back to when you were drafted here in '97, it probably does seem like quite some time ago, but what were your goals then and could you have imagined that you would be in position to win your third title within seven years?</p>
<p>	Q.  Bruce Bowen had some tough defensive challenges in the playoffs, what do you expect him to bring against Rip Hamilton?</p>
