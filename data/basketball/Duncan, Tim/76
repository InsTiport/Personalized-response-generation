<p>	Q. One word, Ginobli.  Talk about his play in the second half and what he means to you guys. </p>
<p>	Q.  How important was it for you to get off to a great start having a double-double in the first half with both teams struggling offensively and shooting 30 percent field goal-wise?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the difference between Manu from this year, as opposed to two years ago, offense-wise and his game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Pop said he was real polite with y'all in those first two time-outs when you got off to that sluggish start, can you give us your version of it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Chauncey said that they love it when Rasheed is aggressive, and I think he only ended up with six shots in the game.  Would you characterize Rasheed's game tonight on the offensive end as aggressive? </p>
<p>	Q.  It seemed like they had trouble matching your energy level in the fourth, do you think that's when maybe the rest helped you guys? </p>
