<p>	Q. Ben Wallace seemed like he was a man possessed tonight on both ends of the court.  Can you talk about Ben Wallace's play. </p>
<p>	Q.  Did he seem like he played a much more impressive, much more determined, a focused game than the games he played in San Antonio? </p>
<p>	Q.  You guys were tied late in the third quarter, what broke down at that point? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the guard play for the Pistons, especially Chauncey, and the big run that he had that kind of separated the two teams. </p>
<p>	Q.  Seemed like in Games 1 and 2, your ball movement as a team was superior, and tonight, it seemed to be lacking.  Any explanation for that, and did they try anything differently?</p>
