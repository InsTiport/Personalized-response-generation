<p>	Q.  How happy were you with the defensive effort tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there anyway with veteran experience on this team, does that help any chance of the Spurs coming out and figuring they have this thing in the bag on Monday?</p>
<p>	Q.  Has it been fun running and having that wide open 38 points in the first quarter?  Would you say this is a little bit scary?</p>
<p>	Q.  You have been in a lot of situations like this where you try and close a team out.  What is the key -- do you feel that there's a key to closing a team out?</p>
<p>	Q.  Free throw shooting, I know you don't like to talk about it may be because you think you are going to jinx yourself --</p>
<p>	Q.  The reason I do, 15 for 15 is the best you have done --</p>
<p>	Q.  Yeah.  And Pop said that you have done a little wood shed work on finding the cure.  So what is it that produced this performance?</p>
<p>	Q.  If you win on Monday night you will have between eight and ten days off.  Is that something that enters your mind at all as a positive or negative?</p>
<p>	Q.  It's a good problem to have?</p>
