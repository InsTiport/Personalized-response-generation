 Q.   What did they do defensively that sort of discombobulated your offense tonight?  
TIM DUNCAN:   They were physical.   Their shot blockers in the back with DeAndre especially I think affected us at the basket.   But all in all, out of rhythm for the most part.   We got off a lot of pretty decent shots that we usually would make, shooting, what, 33 threes and we only made 10 of them.   Some pretty decent looks there.   But all in all, we give them a lot of credit because they sustained it longer than we did, and they stuck with what they were doing, got up in us and made us do what we didn't want to do.   
   
 Q.   Tim, Doc said that he thought the energy the Clippers played with was the difference.   How did that manifest itself on the court?   Did you sense that?  
TIM DUNCAN:   Yeah, I said they played harder longer.   They played with that energy.   Obviously their crowd was behind them playing here at home with the first playoff game.   
Also when things aren't going right and we were going back and forth there for a while where neither team was playing real well and they started hitting some shots and that gave them that extra energy and let them get away from us.  
   
 Q.   Tim, what do you have to do differently in Game 2 besides scoring?   What are some things you feel like you have to do better?  
TIM DUNCAN:   Just get our flow back, get our motion rolling a little bit, and we're going to make some shots.   We're going to make some shots that have to go in the hole, and that will relieve some of the pressure.   Once we can do that, all of a sudden the whole floor will open up a little better.  
   
 Q.   From a defensive standpoint just to pin it down a little bit, was it their aggressiveness that took you guys out, or was it the fact you just weren't hitting?  
TIM DUNCAN:   A little bit of both.   A little bit of both.   We always give our opponents credit and I think they definitely deserved credit in there, and I just said, DeAndre was a big part of that in the back, affecting stuff at the rim.   But I still thought we moved the ball pretty well.   Our assists were up there, but the shots we did get that were wide open, even some of the contested ones from three, just weren't going for us, so just wasn't our night.   Hopefully we're not going to ditch our entire game plan and start over again.   We're going to go out there and try and execute a little better and hopefully make some of those shots.  
   
 Q.   As badly as things started, you actually came back and took a lead in the second quarter.   Did you think at that point we've weathered the storm and we're on the way?  
TIM DUNCAN:   Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.   That's the feeling that we got at that point.   As badly as we were playing we're back in it, and all of a sudden we take a lead and we hopefully go from there, but from there they turned it back up and got themselves another eight‑point lead going into the half or something like that.   It's just about being a little more consistent with us.   It's been that way all year long.   We know we can do it.   I don't think there's any magic fix to it, it's just about going out there and executing a little better and making shots.   
   
 Q.   Any positives you can take away from this game, and also, talk about the free‑throw percentage that you guys are shooting.   
TIM DUNCAN:   Yeah, we left some‑‑ what did we leave, 12 points on the board there on the free‑throw line?   That was obviously unexpected and not what we would usually do.   Another easy way to try to clean up some points there is to make our free throws.   What was the second part?   
   
 Q.   Any positives you take away from‑‑  
TIM DUNCAN:   Positives?   First game of the Playoffs, kind of knocked that rust off.   We had five, six days off, and at one point we're right in the game and we feel that we're going to turn that corner and we just don't.   Hopefully‑‑ I think there was a period there in the fourth quarter we really got that rhythm going, really got our motion working, and if we can remember that and feed off of that, hopefully starting the next game hopefully play from there.  
   
 Q.   You guys shot under 37 percent from the field today.   Was that more a byproduct of missing open looks or is that a greater issue with trying to figure out the Clippers' defense?  
TIM DUNCAN:   A little bit of both.   I think we kind of touched on that already.   We're going to give them credit and understand that they were physical and they were up in us.   We missed some easy ones.   All those factors together, we put together the game we did tonight.
