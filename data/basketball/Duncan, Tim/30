 Q.   Tim, how much did just being with a guy like David Robinson and the fact that he was able to defer to you once you arrived, how much has having had that example affected you to allow Tony and Manu take on larger roles in San Antonio?   
TIM DUNCAN:   Obviously, it was a great experience at that time to see and have that.   I don't know that there was a point where there was actually‑‑ where we actually said, I'm stepping aside and this is your team or whatever else.   There was kind of an evolution of my game and his game.   It is happening the same way now with Tony and Manu.   I don't think I've stepped aside or anything else.   Our roles have just changed.   And we're all comfortable with that, as long as we're working towards the same goal.   
   
 Q.   Tim, I know you weren't happy necessarily with every one of of them, but there were relatively fewer whistles in Game 1.   How much do you adjust to how a game is being officiated?   And do you have a preference for a lot of fouls, a few fouls?   
TIM DUNCAN:   You don't know how games are being officiated.   And everybody has to kind of adjust on the fly.   And you just hope they're consistent more than anything.   Consistency is all we're kind of worried about.   If you go out there and get a ticky‑tack foul and get beat up on one, those things are frustrating.   
As long as it's consistent and you see it's going to be a physical game, and The Finals are usually a lot more physical, and you get away with a bit more than you do in the regular season.   And I think everybody understands that and I think everybody is okay with that.
