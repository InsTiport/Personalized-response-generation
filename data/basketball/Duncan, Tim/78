<p>	Q.  Your thoughts now on moving on and having over a week to either celebrate some of this and then prepare for whoever is coming next?</p>
<p>	Q.  Now that this series is over, talk about how injured your leg was in this series, how much pain you were in during the series?  Was that much of a factor for you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Pop kept talking about the way you ultra focus after what you consider an off night or not a particularly good game.  Could you feel that in yourself?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the defensive execution from the Spurs in the third quarter and the whole series and also the tip in late?  I think you went up by 4 after that?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you were looking at the scoring sheet in the locker room after the game, what are your thoughts, what sticks out at you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Had you some words for Amare (Stoudemire) very end of the game like for about 3, 4 minutes.  What did you have to say to him?</p>
<p>	Q.  What does it say about your team, you got great performances from guys that usually don't make them?</p>
<p>	Q.  How important was that?  Well, if I am correct, as Mike says, guys who usually shoot about 14 percent and going two for two, two for three?</p>
<p>	Q.  Beno (Udrih)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Pop said that you're harder on yourself than anyone could ever be on you.  I was wondering if you think that's why you are as successful as you are or whether that sometimes is a hindrance that you maybe get down on yourself or put too much on your shoulders?</p>
