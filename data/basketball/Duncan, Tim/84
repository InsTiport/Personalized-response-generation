<p>	Q.  How is your ankle?</p>
<p>	Q.  Tim, if you look at the fourth quarter of this game, looked like roles reversed.  You put up 43 points and took the game to them.  And also hit a lot more threes than they did.  Talk a little bit about that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Were you guys pretty much comfortable the way the tempo was in this game?</p>
<p>	Q.  How important was it to hold Shawn Marion to three points? </p>
<p>	Q.  Any doubt past couple of days that you would be able to play?</p>
<p>	Q.  I wanted to ask you about that he said he didn't want to take you out for fear of your ankle freezing up.  Talk about the irony of you wondering whether you would play and ending up playing more?</p>
<p>	Q.  You are known as a defensive team.  Do you have fun playing in a back-and-forth game like this?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about the running back and forth, maybe you don't like to do it but in those cases in these type of games how important is your bench?</p>
<p>	Q.  Game one, home court advantage.  How great is that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think it threw them off the way you came out and defended them?</p>
