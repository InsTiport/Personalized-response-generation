<p>	Q.  Coming down the stretch in the fourth quarter, you only got two touches in your sweet spots more or less.  Did you feel like in the meat of the basketball game like you were not seeing the ball enough in the halfcourt set? </p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering, I asked Pop the same question, if you can express the obvious disappointment, you had the chance to wrap it up here at home, your team was coming off that win, can you talk about your disappointment in this game and your assumed admiration for Detroit?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did it surprise you that they went to the outside shot so much tonight when they had not before in the entire series? </p>
<p>	Q.  Tim, resilience has been really the name of the game this whole series.  Can you talk a little bit about what you have to tell yourself to get ready for a Game 7 and bounce back after a disappointing game like this?</p>
<p>	Q.  On this other subject of quality shots, three minutes before the end of the game I think you had two consecutive baskets and then you hardly touched the ball, do you have to be more aggressive in getting that position under the basket to receive the ball?  Do you have to be more aggressive in demanding the ball?</p>
