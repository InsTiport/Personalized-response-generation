<p>	Q.  In the first two games, you guys gave up in the low 70s and the last four you've given up almost 100 a game.  Can you talk about getting the defensive focus back for this critical game.</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you agree with Pop's theory that you guys rushed things last night and not let the game come to you in critical moments? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've had your heart broken in games before like Fisher last year, when you see the Pistons do that, does it surprise you or how does a team do that? </p>
<p>	Q.  How do you bounce back from something like that, it was emotional, and you guys were obviously devastated after the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Star players in Game 7s sometimes feel the need to take over games, maybe be extra assertive.  How do you balance that with your teammates, and do you have that sense going into Game 7 for yourself?</p>
<p>	Q.  You never played in a Game 7 before, can you just talk about your feelings going into a game like this? </p>
<p>	Q.  How would you describe the mindset of rest of your team going into a game like this?</p>
<p>	Q.  We're accustomed to see you hit a lot of those bank shots from either wing, have they taken that spot away or has it not been available in this series?</p>
<p>	Q.  After Game 5, you called the fourth quarter like a nightmare or something like that.  How would you describe your play personally down the stretch last night? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned that you guys made a lot of mistakes; what were the biggest ones? </p>
<p>	Q.  Defense more than anything? </p>
<p>	Q.  They single you out more than most teams do, but as you've told us before, they have a bunch of guys playing you with a variety of styles, how would you rate them as post defenders, a good team or great team?</p>
