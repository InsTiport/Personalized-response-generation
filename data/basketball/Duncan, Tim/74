<p>	Q. Could you talk about Bruce Bowen a little bit.  He's relied on so much defensively, how much of a lift does he give your club? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did becoming a leader come natural to you, or is that something that you had to learn how to do?  How has that evolved?</p>
<p>	Q.  If I can follow-up on that, how do you define leadership?  What kind of things do you do to exert leadership here?</p>
<p>	Q.  Since you and Gregg Popovich get along really well, is it that way from the beginning? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel that he is the perfect coach for you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the versatility of your team.  You guys ran when you had to against the Suns and now you can play halfcourt and play defense against Detroit, just the versatility? </p>
<p>	Q.  What will you be able to do to keep Rasheed from being successful in that scenario? </p>
<p>	Q.  What sort of other adjustments do you feel the Pistons will make entering Game 2? </p>
<p>	Q.  You and I were talking earlier about Bruce Bowen's defense and how the team relies on him, can you recall instances in practices over the last couple of years where Bowen was shutting down somebody even in practice and you guys had a joke about that or an anecdote about that?</p>
<p>	Q.  When Pop same down to St. Croix way back when you were drafted, what kind of things did you guys do?  And did you know right away that he would be a good fit for you as a coach?</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys have never given up more than 90 points in an NBA Finals game, why do you think that is? </p>
<p>	Q.  Why would you say that Rasheed Wallace's turnaround jumper is so dangerous? </p>
