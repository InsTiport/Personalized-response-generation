  Q. Why do you think Robert Horry didn't get any playing time? He is usually really big in playoffs with games like this, important games?  
 TIM DUNCAN: You will have to ask Coach. I think Kurt got some time early and was effective with it. In a rotation, there is so many minutes that can go around. I think Kurt did a great job of stepping up and making something happen early on and Pop went back to him.  
  
  Q. It's been difficult for the Spurs to repeat. Can you talk about how hard that is and what you guys have to do for next year?  
 TIM DUNCAN: Just got to gear it up again to go to next year. It is what it is.   
 We haven't repeated and for whatever reason. Luckily enough, we have won four times and had the opportunity to repeat, but have to come in next year. Obviously we'll have to add some pieces to our team and a couple tweaks here and there. Love what we had this year. I thought our team played hard. We just weren't good enough through stretches.
