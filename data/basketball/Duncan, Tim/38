Q.   (Inaudible)
TIM DUNCAN:   It's the competitive nature of all of us.   We've done it for so long, to play at a high level, you can go through every era and pick out a couple of those different guys.   And I'm honored to be one of those guys.

Q.   (Inaudible)
TIM DUNCAN:   Everybody kind of finds their own way.   You ask that question to someone out there in a couple of years, I think you'll find something that works for you, you stick with it.   You decide to work on your game and work on your health, and you get a little lucky or you don't. 

Q.   What's the most important aspect of your health regimen?
TIM DUNCAN:   Up until getting hurt a couple of weeks ago, I've been healthy, and that's been the biggest part.   I don't know if there's any one thing that I've done.   I think there's a combination of a whole lot of things that I've done over the summer.   Losing a little weight, having my brace, being comfortable with that.   I think a combination of a lot of different things.

Q.   Any special conditioning program?
TIM DUNCAN:   No special conditioning program.   It's a little different in that respect.   But it's got nothing to do with one program over another.

Q.   Where do you see the Clippers fitting in in the West?
TIM DUNCAN:   I hope not well at all.   I hope they implode and I hope they're not a problem at all.   That's what I hope.   Their talent level is not going to let them do that.   Chris has been hurt a little while, and I think that's taken a little bit from them.   But playing them early in the year they were absolutely impressive.   Their athleticism, their depth, all that stuff.   So I don't know where they're going to fit in.   I don't know who is going to be healthy or not.   All of those things need to be seen and decided.
