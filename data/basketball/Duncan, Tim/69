<p>	Q. You've been guarded pretty evenly by their three big guys.  Can you just talk about what each one of them brings to the table and does the fact that you've got those three different looks, is that something that prevents you from getting in more of a rhythm? </p>
<p>	Q.  The fact that you've got three different guys to go against. </p>
<p>	Q.  Getting on a roll, getting into a rhythm?</p>
<p>	Q.  After Game 3, you were somewhat critical of your performance and you just said you would have knocked down some shots ordinarily that you didn't.  Yesterday, how would you characterize your play in Game 4 overall? </p>
<p>	Q.  Who in your opinion over the course of your career has defended you best? </p>
<p>	Q.  Pop said last night that he may have talked to you more in the fourth quarter last night than he has over the last couple of days.  We've seen that before in situations through your career where he's talking to you for a long period of time in blowout losses like that.  Can you characterize what those conversations are like? </p>
<p>	Q.  We're used to seeing you being almost automatic out there sometimes where it almost looks easy and these two games, so uncharacteristic for you.  What is it starting to feel like out there as it's getting away from you, even the open shots you mentioned not going in? </p>
<p>	Q.  As much as at this time of the year many players have to play well in order to win, is there a sense that for your team it has to begin with you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you describe why that would be, that a player such as yourself has to sort of set that tone?</p>
<p>	Q.  All week long, so many of your teammates have been talking about how Coach Popovich knows when to light a fire under his team and knows when to pat his players on the back.  What is it about Coach Popovich's relationship with his team that allows the players to embrace that coaching philosophy and that management style so well? </p>
<p>	Q.  Manu is kind of a new NBA star, what advice can you give him when a defense is ganging up on him like that and making him a focus? </p>
