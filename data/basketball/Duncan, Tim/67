<p>	Q. The play of Robert Horry, you were carrying the team, it seemed, about the first three-and-a-half quarters and then he just took over and just had a big game from that point on. </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you think he had enough to get that final shot in, all the energy he expended in that ten-minute span?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did the fourth quarter seem like a nightmare to you with all of the missed free throws and then you missed the tip at the end, and what was going through your mind at the end of regulation?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you ever had a stretch like that from the free throw line in a big game before?</p>
<p>	Q.  We saw in the replay after Horry's three-pointer, a big hug from you, and was that relief we saw in your face?</p>
<p>	Q.  The amazing thing about Rob is that he looked so out of it in the first half, he really could not finish, and you guys have seen that from him before, right?  It's like you can't really put him on the bench because he may suddenly snap into it. </p>
