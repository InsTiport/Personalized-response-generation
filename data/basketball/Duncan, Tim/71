<p>	Q. What do you guys have to do to combat their defensive intensity from last night?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've always had a history of after having a so-called off-game for you coming back really strong.  Is that something that you're concentrating on and make a point of doing? </p>
<p>	Q.  They say that as Ben Wallace goes, so go the Pistons, but he's a defender.  Tim, how do you shut down a defender? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk a little bit about how Antonio McDyess has changed as a player since you played him in your younger days when he was in the West? </p>
<p>	Q.  Last night Ginobli indicated that maybe having a couple of big games, he's gotten swept up with all of the attention and it's kind of distracted him.  You, having been on this stage, do you see a chance where maybe you'll say something to him to calm him down and bring him back to earth? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've had a lot of experience in Game 4's, can you talk about the importance of that 3-1 separation versus 2-2?  Obviously they are all big games, but in order for them to get any more momentum, the importance of this next game?</p>
<p>	Q.  You had the best home record in the league, but you're only 21-20 on the road.  Can you explain that?</p>
<p>	Q.  You say that you don't want to have back-to-back bad games, is there anything specific about yesterday's game that you feel you have to change and is anything specific going into the next game that you feel you have to do?  I mean, is it scoring, is it just defensive --</p>
<p>	Q.  Personally.  You, yourself. </p>
<p>	Q.  Just talk about looking back at the film, did you guys feel there was more unforced errors in last night's game? </p>
