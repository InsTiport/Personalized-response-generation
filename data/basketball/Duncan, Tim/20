 Q.   Tim, was it that easy?   It really appeared easy inside, especially with your domination of the points in the paint.   
TIM DUNCAN:   I don't know if it was that easy, but we were taking what we were given.   We knew them being able to get into the middle and attack a little more than we have, that's kind of what's been there historically against them, and we were just able to make some shots tonight.   
   
 Q.   Talk about the play of Ginobili tonight, kind of a rough series last game but him getting it going tonight.  
TIM DUNCAN:   He was great through a stretch there, did a great job of attacking their bigs and taking them right to the basket in a time and a situation where we really needed it, gave us a boost.   Once he gets that going and gets a couple of those going, now you see him hit the threes and make the plays that he usually does, it just builds his confidence, so a great game for us tonight and we're going to need it from him.   
   
 Q.   How was it with no Serge out there?   You guys had tons of assists, seemed like it flowed well.   
TIM DUNCAN:   Yeah, whether he's there or not we need to move the ball.   It's been something that we've been talking about not only this series but in series past.   We need to move the ball, move defenses, and they still have size in there, so we get it around, we get our shooters open, we get into the middle, we get them to collapse.   Whatever it may be, we need to move that ball and find people.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about the job that Tony did early, feeding you and Splitter and getting both of you going?  
TIM DUNCAN:   Yeah, that's part of our game plan.   He knew that they weren't going to let him shoot the ball like he did in the last series.   They were going to try to take that away from him, so he knew he was going to have to be an assist man.   He knew he was going to have to find the guy in the middle and somebody else was going to have to make plays.   He did exactly that.   I thought he played a very smart game, a very efficient game, made the right plays, and that's what's going to have to happen this series with him.   
   
 Q.   At the fourth quarter you didn't reenter the game until about five minutes to go.   How much of that was the effectiveness of Boris against their smaller lineup?  
TIM DUNCAN:   It was Boris, it was Aron Baynes, those guys stepped up and made plays.   They were playing great through that stretch, and Pop rode with them.   That's kind of what we've done all year long.   If someone is doing well in that position not making mistakes, we're going to go with them.   I got a chance to sit there and kept my minutes down, and we still win, so a win‑win in our situation.   
   
 Q.   Your shots didn't come as easy the first six, eight minutes of the third quarter.   Did they do something different?   Were they more aggressive?   
TIM DUNCAN:   I missed.   I got the exact same shots, I just got out of rhythm there for a second, missed some easy ones, got some in between shots, got a couple shots contested.   But all in all, I just kind of missed the shots that I was getting.   
   
 Q.   When somebody is missing a big player like they are, how much do you concentrate on not letting the other guys‑‑  
TIM DUNCAN:   He still played well tonight, Reggie still played well tonight.   He was somebody that we knew and we had an eye on because he's played so well against us.   But he still did play well tonight.   Obviously losing Serge changes their team a whole lot, and Russell and Kevin are going to score points.   We just have to make their lives as difficult as possible and limit those other guys the best we can.
