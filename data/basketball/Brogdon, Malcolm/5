 Q.  You're the first non-first round pick to ever win this award in the common era, the first senior in 20 years, and you mentioned during your speech about how this is for people who have been overlooked.  Is it kind of special for you to kind of, you know, set a bunch of doubters like that by winning?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: For sure.  I think it's an example for guys that are told they are too short, they are not athletic enough, they are not real point guards, they are not real shooting guards.  I just think it's an important message for people to see, and it can be done.  It just takes a lot.  It takes a lot of hard work and a lot of sacrifice and a lot of good decisions.   
 Q.  You have Jason Kidd as your coach, a former point guard.  How much did you learn from him, and how much was it important in your first year in your success?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: Extremely important.  A lot of my success I credit to him.  He gave me plenty of opportunity.  I wasn't sure if they were going to play me as point guard or shooting guard, but he immediately put me at point guard because he saw something in me.  I really appreciate what he's done for me.  I was actually just talking to him backstage.  I was talking to him on the phone.  This is a testament to him and the whole organization for what we've done the whole year and for what's to come.   
 Q.  For the confidence you had in yourself, did this seem possible for you when you got drafted?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: Absolutely.  I thought I could be good enough and I thought I could play well enough to win this award.  But that wasn't in my mind, winning this award.  I think when your mindset is on the right things and it's not on "I," but more as a team mindset, I think it works out for you.  I think stuff like this happens.  You know, I've been blessed.
