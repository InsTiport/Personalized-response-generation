  Q. So how is your off-season going?  
 COCO MILLER: Pretty good. It's been pretty nice so far. I've been at home doing personal training and stuff like that and it's been good.   
  
  Q. Are you working with anyone in particular?   
 COCO MILLER: No, I've just kind of been actually, me and my sister, we train by ourselves. I started a personal training business so I've actually trained other people, too. It's been fun.  
  
  Q. What have you been focusing on this off-season on improving?  
 COCO MILLER: I have just kind of been focusing on my all-around game, my consistency on my outside shot a little bit, my ball handling skills at the point guard position in case I need to play more of that next year.   
  
  Q. Where did you play overseas last year?  
 COCO MILLER: Last year we were both in Russia.   
  
  Q. So was that a mutual decision not to go overseas?   
 COCO MILLER: Yeah, we were in Russia overseas, so we needed a little break for our minds and bodies.  
  
  Q. Is Kelly here this weekend?   
 COCO MILLER: Yes.   
  
  Q. Have you had a chance to do anything yet?  
 COCO MILLER: No, maybe today.   
  
  Q. Have you been at NBA All-Star before?  
 COCO MILLER: A couple times, Houston and Atlanta.   
  
  Q. Do you have any good memories of those trips?   
 COCO MILLER: They have just been a lot of fun, just seeing everybody, meeting everybody, everybody from the WNBA community coming together. It's been a lot of fun.   
 I'm excited to see everyone, no one in particular really.
