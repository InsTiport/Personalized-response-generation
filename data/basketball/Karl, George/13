Lakers  Â– 105
  Nuggets - 103

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Can you just talk about a game where your team was right there and seemed to have the Lakers on their heels and how it came down at the end?
 COACH KARL: I'm not really going to analyze. They're a great team. They're great in the game, they have the best closer in the sport, and we didn't do enough. We didn't do enough to win the game.

 Q. I believe your team has lost maybe two or three road games in the post-season. I think by two points each time. What does that say about the team playing on the road?
 COACH KARL: The one game in New Orleans we lost we were down a minute and eight and cut it close with one shot. I don't know what you want to analyze. We played a very good game. The only thing we did poorly probably at the end of the game from a close game situation is turn it over on the --

 Q. Did they give you a diagnosis on that play?
 COACH KARL: Preliminarily he hyperextended. I think he's going to be fine. 

 Q. Is it his knee?
 COACH KARL: I think it's his knee, there. 

 Q. From your perspective, what went wrong?
 COACH KARL: Chauncey anticipated really well. AC probably didn't see him and threw the ball with a little loft to it, instead of going down he went up. And I think I'm surprised, you know, surprised at how quick he was and he has great ability to make plays like that and just wish he would have called timeout.

 Q. Did it feel like for most of the night you had the game the way you wanted it, aggressive front court, Carmelo scoring, did it feel like the type of game you wanted coming in?
 COACH KARL: There's no moral victories in playoff basketball. We're going to be -- the next 48 hours are going to be difficult. We're going to try to regroup and reenergize and it will be a lot of good and there will be some things we need to get better at. 
 From the standpoint we did a lot of good stuff, played probably well enough to win. A lot of nights, they made an extraordinary amount of 3s on us that we'll have to evaluate and probably shoot some free throws.

 Q. Coach, 12 missed free throws, only 65 percent, and not too much from J.R. Smith, you think those things hurt your team in this game? 
 COACH KARL: J.R. didn't have a great game. He have a decent game. For the free throws, there's no question in the first half we hurt ourselves from the free throw, second half we did a better job making free throws. But first half we missed, I don't know, nine or 10 free throws that could have given us maybe an eight-, nine-point lead. 
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
