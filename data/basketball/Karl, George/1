NUGGETS   88
  WARRIORS - 92

COACH KARL:   I'd like to congratulate Mark and wish him luck.   A good series for both teams that are young, have a bright future in the Western Conference.   I'm disappointed in the result, but can't be more proud of my basketball team, the way we shot the ball.   We had numerous moments to give in on the game and we never did.   One more layup, one more free throw go in, could have been a miraculous comeback. 
Now I'll answer your questions. 

Q.   Can you describe what happened in the third quarter defensively for the Warriors?
COACH KARL:   You know, they got the three ball in the game.   Curry, I'd like to check his stats for the third quarter, my recollection is every third quarter seems he gets loose on us.   Game3 he got loose.   Game4 he got loose, too.   Got loose on the three ball.   When you miss shot after shot after shot, pretty good shots, I thought most of the time it creates a frustration, it creates an edge that we had to fight through. 
As I said, we did.   But the three ball got loose and we couldn't make a shot to build any confidence or rhythm.   I really don't remember exactly what happened.   I know they had at least three, maybe four threes in that quarter. 

Q.   In the last minute of play, things got chaotic.   What was going through your mind?   What were you saying to your guys? 
COACH KARL:   We were just going after their handle.   We put Wilson as the chaser.   Every opportunity we got to a ball in the corner, we went after the double‑team, created a lot of turnovers.   Got our hands on the ball.   You know, almost got an opportunity to win the game. 
But I think Wilson was probably the guy that creates tremendous defensive pressure for us.   We had some situations throughout the series, maybe we should have done them more, maybe we shouldn't have. 
We didn't lose the series tonight.   This is a proud loss.   We lost the series in Game1 and 2.   We didn't play well enough to sustain some confidence.   In Game1 we won a close game.   Game2, we gave back everything that we worked for 57 wins to get the third seed, we gave back by having a flat game.   And that's on me. 
We have young players.   I don't know what I could have done better.   We didn't play well in Game1.   We played worse in Game2.   Then we came here and fought pretty hard.   Lost the game with an incredible shooting night by Steph.   That's going to happen in a series.   A great player is probably going to win a game, especially on their home court.   Couldn't finish it off tonight. 

Q.   You were missing Gallo this series.   How much did you miss him this series? 
COACH KARL:   You know, every NBA team has kind of a protocol of responsibilities and rules.   I'm sure Gallo, whatever, one, two or three, depending on what coach you talk to on our team, during a stretch of the season he was probably our best player.   But in this series I think we missed him defensively. 
We found our defensive pulse tonight.   But we had too many matchups in the first two or three games.   I didn't really have an answer for them.   I think Gallo is a 6'10", 6'11" guy that can defend ones, twos, threes and fours, our switching and double‑teaming.   We might have been able to be more aggressive.   If he's not our best shooter, he's one of our top two shooters. 
We never shot the three ball very well all series. 

Q.   It always seemed like they were able to break ahead.   Why do you think that is so?
COACH KARL:   I believe it's their personality all season long.   I've seen this team play bad for the first 35 minutes of a game, then they have a five‑minute stretch in the beginning of the fourth quarter that blows people away.   Their ability to make the three, their ability to play fast, they're one team in the league that probably has the ability to run with us.
In general, most teams don't like to run up and down the court with us.   Golden State does. 

Q.   What was your reaction to David Lee playing tonight? 
COACH KARL:   It was weird, I guess, would be my best.   You read he's out for the season, out for whatever, three months, whatever.   I thought he was playing a Willis Reed impression, save the team. 
I'm too old to be shocked by a surprise like that.   I mean, I've had guys in the NBA in Europe, the CBA, pull tricks out of their hats.   We were prepared for David Lee.   I don't think it surprised us.   Even if he would have played 20 or 30 minutes, I think we would have been able to put a scouting report in on how we wanted to cover him. 
But it was weird. 

Q.   Seems like the difference tonight was Andrew Bogut.   How much of a matchup problem is he for you guys?   It seems like tonight it was tough to have an answer to stop this guy. 
COACH KARL:   I'm not worried about him offensively.   I mean, I would think he would be their second most valuable player in the series.   Curry was fantastic.   Jack probably would be third on the list. 
Bogut's ability to clog up the middle, you know, I'd forgotten how good he was at it.   That's what his fortÃ© was in Milwaukee.   He's one of those guys that drops.   I think we were 2‑11 on the jump shot on the pick'n roll.   All of them I think were pretty wide open.   Ty made two I think in the second quarter but never got that jump shot that punishes the defense. 
He's a veteran player that I think showed a lot of professional class tonight. 
Thank you.
