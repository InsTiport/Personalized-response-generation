 Q. Tell us a little about, one of the surprises was that the Heat bench outscored your bench. 
 J.J. BAREA: They did a great job. Chalmers hit big threes in the first half. Yes, they basically played better than us. We have to change that tomorrow. That can't happen again in the series. We'll see what happens. 

 Q. How do you step it up? 
 J.J. BAREA: Hopefully tomorrow I knock down shots, me and Jet and Peja knock down the shots that we have. 

 Q. Is there any concern about Dirk Nowitzki and his finger? I asked Marion if pain can affect his play. 
 J.J. BAREA: No, he'll be fine. 

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 J.J. BAREA: To me maybe a little more attention. Even on bad days, they're a good defensive team. They do what they do. 

 Q. Can you talk about the opportunities you had yesterday. I know there was some frustration with missed shots. You looked at the tape, what did you see? 
 J.J. BAREA: I had good shots, they just weren't going in yesterday. Basically, they were hitting the back of the rim. They just weren't going in. 

 Q. Do you think it had anything to do with the big stage? 
 J.J. BAREA: I don't know. I felt good like any other playoff game.
