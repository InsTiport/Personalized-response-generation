 Q. How big is playing at home for Game 3?
 J.J. BAREA: It's everything. Game 3 is as big as Game 7. We have to come home and use our fans, bring more energy. I think we still have to play better than we played in Miami, from the beginning of the game till the end. We'll see what happens. 

 Q. As far as the momentum can turn, do you think where you guys when you were down 15 compared to how the game finished, is that something you can carry? 
 J.J. BAREA: I hope so. I hope we can carry it all game tomorrow. I think going into the last minutes, we really played basketball. We took care of the ball, we made shots, we moved the ball. We were the more energy team at the moment. I hope that carries over. 

 Q. What can you do better in Game 3?
 J.J. BAREA: A little more energy. Play better defense. We definitely have to take care of the ball. I think we fixed the rebounding problem. Now we have to fix the turnover problem and see what happens. 

 Q. Dirk, has he been vocal? 
 J.J. BAREA: He's never been vocal. He's been vocal this year. It's crazy. The way he works out, the way he gets ready for every game, every practice. That's just -- you have to follow him and keep doing what we're doing. 

 Q. Does it help having him more vocal? 
 J.J. BAREA: Yes. He never talked. When he talks, you know everybody is listening. It's good he talks every once in a while. 

 Q. Is that kind of proving a sense of urgency? 
 J.J. BAREA: He's proven he really wants it. How focused he is and how bad he wants to win. Everybody wants to follow.
