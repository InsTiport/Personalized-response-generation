Oklahoma State  Â– 63
  Texas Tech - 57

 THE MODERATOR: Okay, we're joined by the Texas Tech Red Raiders. Coach Curry, your thoughts and then we will take questions. 
 COACH CURRY: Hats off to Oklahoma State. I thought their second half was very good and they had some folks step up.
 I thought Spears played like a senior should, Hardeman played like a senior should, and it's evident that we struggled and we don't have our inside game or Murphree going. We obviously aren't successful and we missed way too many looks. 

 Q. Can you talk about what changed in that second half at the very beginning, or were they getting better looks, setting better screens? 
 KIERRA MALLARD: I think they came out with more energy, hats off to them. We had a 15-point lead and they came back with more energy. 

 Q. Can you talk about Shaunte', what were they doing inside that seemed to give y'all trouble in the paint? Was it anything in particular? 
 DOMINIC SEALS: Nothing really in the paint, she was shooting jump shots and getting the rebound. 

 Q. Dominic, how frustrating is it, that being your last game and the way that the last half of your last game here went? 
 DOMINIC SEALS: It was frustrating because I feel that I didn't do enough for my team to win, and as a senior that's not the role to play. These underclassmen look up to us and it wasn't the way to be. I thought this was my last game, I wanted it to go differently, and I didn't play hard. 

 Q. Did this mirror the beginning of the second half in Norman last week? 
 COACH CURRY: You know, definitely, I think for whatever reason, you know, it does fall -- I take it pretty hard, how do you juggle your lineup that got you a 15-point lead, but it's inexcusable to come out the way we did to start the second half. 
 At some point, the will to win and be successful you can't give that to a bunch of kids. I think that's the most disappointing about how we started the second half. We seemed to flow throughout it. I thought Maria Moore had a lot about her. She didn't the other night. 
 Our inconsistency all year long is what's hurt us. She has a big night and Seals and Murphree don't, and they have a big night and she doesn't.
 We aren't at the point where we are good enough where we have a bad night and somebody doesn't show up and we can win. At some point in time you have to go, it's one of those nights where it wasn't meant to be, and you stay positive and continue to build. 

 Q. Coach, anymore frustrating because of the way you guys had such a command in the start? 
 COACH CURRY: It's never more frustrating, anytime you aren't successful and you lose it hurts. You always want to finish strong and feel a lot better. 
 Basketball is a game of runs and we were able to make ours early, and they were able to make theirs pretty much through the second half, and your run has to be longer. I think you could ask the same question probably, you know, of our men's game last night. 
 It's the way the game goes, it's a 40-minute game and we talked about that at half, and coming out the first few minutes and establishing ourselves. I've not been around a group of kids -- at some point the best kind of motivation is self-motivation. If I could figure it out, I could probably bottle it up and make a little bit more than a Diet Coke, selling it. 

 Q. Coach, how much -- with all the returners coming back, how much did they learn? You said tournament experience is invaluable, how much did they learn from tonight? 
 COACH CURRY: Hopefully a lot. My concerns come back to Ashlee and Jordan should have learned. So, you know, again, I'm concerned about our leadership a year from now. They have to be your hardest workers, and Jordan and Ashlee's work ethic needs to improve in the off-season. 
 They've got to get themselves in great shape, we've got a bunch of babies coming in, we were able to get the recruiting class and we're excited about who we're about to sign here late and in the direction we're headed. Hop on the plane earlier than we planned and we'll go to work. 

 Q. If the WNIT calls, do you have any decision on that? 
 COACH CURRY: We will not go to the WNIT. 

 Q. Does a night like tonight kind of tell what this whole month and week is like with college basketball? 
 COACH CURRY: Say that again. 

 Q. Tonight is a night where it looks like everything is going to be okay and it ends up differently, does that tell what it's like for this week? 
 COACH CURRY: I think it tells the inconsistency story of our whole year. The most frustrating part is since these kids have gotten here, we've improved and we wanted to take a bigger step this year, and we weren't able to find that consistency. 
 But we asked a group of kids to come in and try to be consistent real quick, and they've had their heart in the right place and tried to do the right things and that's what hurts for me tonight. My heart goes out to those five seniors who have tried to stick it out and do the right thing every day. You can't make 'em have consistency, and I didn't help them to do that enough, game in and game out. 

 Q. The way that the predetermined sites work out, the city has one, the team doesn't make it in, what do you think is going to be important for the City of Lubbock to come out and support that event, even though Tech won't be playing? 
 COACH CURRY: No question, I'll be the first one in the stands to support the event. And we need the Red Raider Nation to rally as we build this back. And regardless if we're playing or not, we need folks to come out and support the event. 
 I know folks will step up, they have been and will continue to, and all we can do is stay positive, and to know the right thing to do on the 22nd and the 24th. And that's what I've tried to do from day one, and that's what I've tried to do to make it back. And now we need everybody to come out and support the event and hopefully they will. 
 THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your comments.
