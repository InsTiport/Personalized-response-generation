LSU - 58, Alabama - 49   
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Coach Kristy Curry and student-athletes Meoshonti Knight and Karyla Middlebrook from Alabama.   
Coach, you're opening thoughts.   
COACH CURRYI think you have to credit LSU on a day like today.  I thought their energy on defense was outstanding.  I thought Alexis Hyder completely dominated us inside.  They were able to knock down shots and that we weren't able to convert and knock down on the other end.   
Hats off to LSU and they deserved to win.   
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for coach or the student-athletes.   
 Q.  Coach and Meoshonti, got off to a very quick start.  I believe at one point Meoshonti scored 11 of your first 13 points, then they started paying a little bit more attention to her.  Did you need other players to kind of fill that void when she was getting doubled a lot?  
COACH CURRY: No doubt.  I think that's a time where we have to have great balance.  That's been kind of an Achilles' heel all year.  We haven't had that third or fourth player at critical times in double figures.   
Today we had two.  We didn't have that third and fourth presence.  You have to do that on a day like today.   
 Q.  Meoshonti, the referees let a lot go.  That was kind of consistent the whole game.  Do you think LSU took advantage of that a little bit?  There were occasions where you did get knocked down, looked like there might have been something there.  They got physical with you.  
MEOSHONTI KNIGHT: They were physical on the defensive end.  But we had to match that on our defensive end, so...   
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.
