 THE MODERATOR:   We are now joined by head coach Kristy Curry.  Questions for Coach.
 Q. Obviously you go down by 20 in the first quarter, never ideal.  You really fought back.  You end up plus eight the rest of the way.  What was the talk in the huddle between quarters?  How did you get them back on track?
 KRISTY CURRY:   I don't know it was necessarily me.  We just tried to encourage them and stay positive.  Obviously we weren't happy in that one timeout I called.  But at the end of the day it's more just about controlling the controllables.  You can control your energy and your effort.  You got to win the battle at your position.
 At the end of the day, I thought our kids really the second, third and fourth showed who we are, what we're about.  We just dug ourselves a really big hole.
 When you miss shots and they make shots, you can't allow that to deflate you on the next possession.  At the end of the day you credit South Carolina.  They really came out and played great.  Tried to call a timeout, then we got to the media and we seemed to be able to restart there.
 Q. You now get ready for the NCAA tournament.  What's the plan over this next week as you kind of reset and wait to find out who you play moving forward?
 KRISTY CURRY:   Well, you know, we'll go into our rest and recovery mode the next two days with our cryo, with their massages, our entire training staff on everything they have planned from rollout.
 There's going to be a plan in place.  It's no different than what we've had in the SEC season.  I will say this:  I know this league has prepared us for what's ahead.  It's a brand-new season.  It's a great opportunity.
 I don't want today to take away from what this team has accomplished.  I'm incredibly proud and excited that we know that we've done something that hadn't been done in a really long time.
 Q. Jasmine Walker, tonight her first time not being in double digits in quite a long time.  Over this SEC tournament, teams have been able to guard her a little bit better than they did in the regular season.  How do you counter that moving forward?
 KRISTY CURRY:   You know, I just think all the little things.  At the end of the day other people have to step up and give her some support.  But Jazz can control how hard she goes to the offensive glass, how hard she runs in transition.  It wasn't lack of effort.
 Credit the defense.  She missed some shots.  Sometimes you miss shots.  You just got to shoot the next one.  I have no doubt that she'll get home and get her feet under her and take a deep breath.  I think you have to, again, just give her some credit.  She has so much respect from the defenses.  Missed some looks.  Sometimes you just have got to keep shooting it.  She'll keep shooting it.  She'll be just fine.
 THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
 KRISTY CURRY:   Thank you for being on today, James.  We appreciate your support this season and look forward to seeing you in the NCAA.
 Q. Appreciate all you guys do, thank you.
 KRISTY CURRY:   Roll Tide.
