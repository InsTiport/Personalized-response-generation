 THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Texas Tech Lady Raider Coach Kristy Curry and her student-athletes. Coach, your thoughts about tonight's game? 
 COACH CURRY: I'm just really proud of my team. I thought we came out and competed. You had two very good basketball teams competing. It was a great game, I'm sure, to watch. We're excited about our postseason. I'm so proud of this team and what they've done to get to this point. We feel like we've got a great opportunity in the NCAA Tournament. 

 Q. Mo, what did you feel was the difference in the game in the end? 
 MONIQUE SMALLS: Just executing and not turning over the ball. 

 Q. What do you guys take away from this one? Obviously, you guys fought right until the end. How do you feel about the way you played and what you've got next? 
 MONIQUE SMALLS: I feel like we should have executed better and not turned over the ball and not rushed into the lane and slow down. But this is not the end. We're still playing. We've got the NCAA Tournament, and that's what we're looking forward to right now. 

 Q. Talk about Mo slowing things down. Did you have those rallies when you were slowing things down? Did you think you were playing your best offense? 
 CASEY MORRIS: Yeah, I feel like we just let them run through us a little too much. We talked about just playing our speed, and they dictated what speed we played. 

 Q. How tough is it to play a team twice as quick a time as you guys did? 
 CASEY MORRIS: It's tough. But obviously we could have won. We just made some mistakes that we shouldn't have made. But we still have more basketball to play and that's what we're looking forward to. 

 Q. Can you expand on running your offense and letting it come to you the way you did in those spurts that you were successful there? 
 COACH CURRY: I don't think it was a lack of effort. The kids at times were maybe trying too hard or going a step too fast. But, again, we outrebound them by four. We score three more field goals, and the basketball game was won at the foul line, bottom line. 

 Q. What did you draw up for that last play? 
 COACH CURRY: We had to get in our four cross press break and wanted to get the ball in to Mo or Chynna. And that was very similar to the Kansas State ending where Chynna hit the runner and scored. 
 Chynna has the ability to get her shot off. And regardless of what you think there at the end, we weren't able to make a play or get a call. So not to criticize anything, but the bottom line was, you know, I thought, good Luck. 

 Q. I know you guys are projected for the tournament like an 8, 9 seed. How do you feel about where you stand? What do you take away from this game going forward? 
 COACH CURRY: I think we put an exclamation point on last night. Obviously to play a top 16, 17 team in Oklahoma, beat them a week earlier. The way we finished the season and the wins that we have, we feel like we're better than an 8 or 9 seed. I don't know how you could explain anything differently right now. 

 Q. You kind of talked about this sophomore class growing up this whole time. How much does this add to that learning process? 
 COACH CURRY: Well, that's a great question. That is one of the teaching points I've made in there. We're going to be sitting in the same position a year from now. We'll have one kid overseas that will be watching on the internet, and there are 13 people in the locker room that can draw upon tonight and know while we don't feel a little better. 
 Again, I'm just -- we've matured so much and so much to look forward to. I wanted them to know I wasn't disappointed in them, and that every step of the way they've learned from their mistakes and learned from adversity and persevered. That's what we've got to continue to do and grow from every experience.
