THE MODERATOR:   We'll begin with an opening comment from coach followed by a comment from the student‑athletes.   
COACH BALCOMB:   I think the obvious:   Georgia came ready to play and worked really hard, dominated us on the boards, was more physical, more aggressive, got a lot more shots.   They put up more shots.   They got more second and third shots.   
They earned this victory.   They did a great job.   
THE MODERATOR:   Jasmine.   
JASMINE LISTER:   I mean, pretty much like coach said, they came ready to play, ready to hit first.   They got a lot of second and third shots which we pretty much allowed them to do.   We weren't as aggressive as them from the jump, neither on defense or offense.   We let them take us out of our offense and not continue.   
THE MODERATOR:   Christina.   
CHRISTINA FOGGIE:   I think coach and Jasmine touched on it.   Just being aggressive from the start and attacking from the start, not being on our heels.   I think Georgia came out with an aggressiveness, and we needed to do that from the start.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions.   
   
 Q.   Coach, what was the difference between the time that you saw them in January and today?   
COACH BALCOMB:   I think mentality.   We've been on a stretch where we haven't finished games and we've gotten behind.   I don't think our mentality was where it needed to be.   
They've gotten more aggressive, more physical, were able to take us out of things that we were able to do against them, especially offensively, last time.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
