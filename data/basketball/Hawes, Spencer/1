 Q.  Spencer, Sacramento, home of Governor Schwarzenegger; any thoughts on the president's race and looking forward to meeting the governor? 
 SPENCER HAWES:  Oh, I was watching Pumping Iron with a couple of my friends, some of those old school tapes, it's going to be fun. 

 Q.  Is he too moderate for you? 
 SPENCER HAWES:  No, I think he's doing what he needs to do.  I think especially in a state like that, you can't get away with that in other places. 

 Q.  Going out to the Sacramento Kings, they are probably in a rebuilding mode playing with a guy like Kevin Martin; what are you looking forward to in Sacramento? 
 SPENCER HAWES:  I think it's going to be a great opportunity with the talent that's in place to improve.  I'm looking forward to playing with Coach Reggie Theus, I've been paying attention to him and what he's done for a while. 
 So it's going to be a great opportunity for me.  I'm thrilled. 

 Q.  Are you excited to stay on the West Coast and stay closer to home? 
 SPENCER HAWES:  I think that's going to be a perk as well, having gone to school in Washington, it's going to make that transition a little bit easier, a one-hour flight rather than a five-hour or six-hour one.
