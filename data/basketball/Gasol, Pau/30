   PAU GASOL: I was able to take the hit and hold onto the rim. If I would have missed the rim and would have fell on my back and broke my head, then I would have been punished. It doesn't make a lot of sense, but it's not my decision to make. Luckily we won the game, and that's what matters. We're in a position with a very good advantage to be able to get to the ring and to our goal, and that's what matters. 

 Q. Derek Fisher came in right after that game and reminded everybody about what happened at Indiana. How do you guys come out with a sense of urgency and not, hey, we'll have three chances to win one. 
 PAU GASOL: Well, obviously it's a challenge, a challenge for a team to come out on the road with an advantage and not be thinking about, well, if we lose this one it's not that big of a deal. But we should make it a big deal, to try to make it our last game. 
 We should try to win it here if we can. We should try to play hard like we want it if we really want it. 

 Q. If you guys get the win, you guys have 15 championships, two away from the Celtics. When you're in Spain, were the Lakers kind of like the NBA team with the most cache, like they're the team that people point to as like --
 PAU GASOL: Definitely the Lakers are a team that most of the world knows and has probably the biggest fan base in all the world, not just in Spain but everywhere. The Lakers are well recognized, and even though you don't know much about basketball, you know the Lakers, you know the Celtics, even the Bulls because they had a pretty good stretch there for a while. 
 So yeah, it's amazing to be a part of it right now. I didn't think that was going to be possible when I was little. But you know, I'm a person that lives in the moment and enjoys it, and it's been working out very well.
