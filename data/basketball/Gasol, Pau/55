  Q. Did you sleep?   
 PAU GASOL: Always the first night after a tough loss, it is not easy to sleep well. We got today to go over some things, make some adjustments, regroup, get yourself back in the right spot and hopefully tomorrow come out with a better mentality.  
  
  Q. You talked after the game yesterday about how you were disappointed that Duncan was able to put up the numbers that you put up. What's the first thing you try to do to stop him from getting those big 20-20 numbers?  
 PAU GASOL: Just make sure you're aggressive and intense the whole time. Don't give him any easy rebounds and don't give up on any easy offensive rebounds and just put a body on him. Make him work. Wear him down a little bit.  
  
  Q. The first time you have been here. You had a decent shooting night, by the end of the night you straightened it out. You missed a lot of shots you don't normally miss. Why do you think?  
 PAU GASOL: I don't know, I don't know. A little bit indecisive, not aggressive enough finishing. I didn't finish strong enough. I was just kind of floating a few shots and they weren't going in.   
 So you got to make sure you have athletic ability to finish the easy passes that I got last night.  
  
  Q. Do you think tomorrow night will be easy or difficult? Just kind of tweaking things a little bit?  
 PAU GASOL: A little bit, a little bit. Adjustments are not always easy. You have to focus and make sure you do it at the time that you need to out there.   
 I think mostly it is going out there and being decisive, being aggressive, being confident about what you're doing and playing with better energy than we did in game 3.
