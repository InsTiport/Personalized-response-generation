PAU GASOL: It's an honor to be here, to be amongst these players and recognized as one of the best in the league.  Obviously it's a great event that a lot of people around the world watch and follow.  A lot of media come here and cover the event, so it positions the game all over the world.  So it's fun to be a part of it.   
 Q.  You're quoted as saying one of your initial frustrations of not being in the game is you wanted to be here for Kobe's last game.  What is it about that moment that's so important?  
PAU GASOL: Well, it's just kind of his last All-Star Game.  It's his last.  It should be more of a celebration about what he's given to the game and all his accomplishments.  That's why I wanted to be a part of it.  It's going to be emotional for me to see him.  I hope he enjoys it.   
I saw him in the back as we were leaving the room and we were coming in, so it's always fun to see him and to share this moment with him, this last dance with him.   
 Q.  What about this season where he's obviously his competitive self, but he seems very at peace when he talks with us.  What do you make of it?  
PAU GASOL: It's just his maturity, his acceptance of the moment.  How well I think he is managing emotionally and rationally this moment where he understands he's had an incredible 20-year career with a lot of success, a lot of recognition, and now he's ready to kind of enjoy the last year, the last season and move on.
