  Q. You slept a little bit, early practice. I guess, however, the win away from home must have made the sleep a little bit more comfortable.   
 PAU GASOL: Yeah, obviously when you go to sleep with a win you sleep a lot better than you would if you would have lost.  
  
  Q. What is it about a player like Fisher that makes him so clutch? Is it in his blood, just a characteristic?  
 PAU GASOL: It's his character, his personality, just desire to win and the experience that he has. Obviously he's been through this situation many times, and he made big shots.  
  
  Q. Kobe said this is the only guy he'll listen to. Can you talk a little bit about that relationship, what you see.   
 PAU GASOL: I mean, obviously they played together for how long, I don't know, 12 years of their career? So that's a long run. That would build a lot of trust and confidence amongst the players.  
  
  Q. How impressed are you with that long run yesterday, 32-8 run, and to do that on the road and take the crowd out of it?  
 PAU GASOL: Yeah, it was huge. Obviously we played a very good collective game, had more ups than downs, and that's always a very good thing. We reacted when we needed to when they made their big run, also. So we should be happy about our effort last night and try to do it all over again on Thursday.  
  
  Q. You won your last two regular season games in here, but how much mentally did you need to get a win here in the playoffs?   
 PAU GASOL: Obviously it's a lot harder to do it in the playoffs, and a lot more meaningful, also. I think it means that we were able to win a crucial game last night, and now there's another crucial game, and every game is pretty much crucial as you go along.   
 So I was happy about the win, just really satisfied about our effort, and it should lead us to do it all over again tomorrow.
