 Q. You've been playing a lot of extended minutes, and you just came off of a grueling road trip. How do you feel?
 PAU GASOL: So far so good. It has been better. I have been able to get a good rest last night. Had a long day in L.A. doing the shooting. So, yeah, I was able to get some rest. 
 And looking forward to have a quieter day. Definitely want to go see my brother play.

 Q. Was there a part of you that said, wow, really? 
 PAU GASOL: Once I got over the first six games, we did a good job there and then we went to Boston and had a big desire of beating them and get a win there because of last year's Finals and we are fighting for the best record in the regular season. It was a lot of motivation to get there and be successful.
 Once we got to play them and got a couple days off in between the games, we were playing much better game, I think, as far as the second half especially. So two great teams. 
 Now we look forward to getting a little bit of rest and go back at it on Tuesday. 

 Q. How hard was the trip? 
 PAU GASOL: The trip was tough. Freezing cities and a lot of games. It wears you down a little bit.
