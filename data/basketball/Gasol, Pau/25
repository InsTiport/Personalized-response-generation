 Q. Two games up like you are now?
 PAU GASOL: You don't want to get too confident, too relaxed, when you have an advantage. You have to understand the importance of Game 3, the importance of winning it, really. So giving yourself a chance mentally to go into it. It's more important especially against a dangerous team as the Phoenix Suns.

 Q. So you expect the unexpected? 
 PAU GASOL: I mean, I don't expect anything. I just expect probably just us to go in there and play as hard as possible and play really -- taking another step forward, trying to give ourselves a way, an opportunity to win the game.

 Q. You're not surprised the way Ron has improved his play throughout the playoffs?
 PAU GASOL: No. Capable, very capable player playing the way he's been playing lately. And obviously that helps a lot. And I hope he continues to play like that.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 PAU GASOL: A little sluggish. We didn't practice yesterday. Trying to get into rhythm. Legs weren't all there. It's good practice to go back to the activity and tomorrow we're going to -- we expect a much sharper practice.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 PAU GASOL: You have to understand what you're playing for here. The Western Conference Final. Two wins away from the Final. That's how you do it. That's how you keep yourself from being relaxed; you realize every game is huge. You don't want to give them confidence or momentum. That's how you keep your head into it.

 Q. When you guys were in this position before against Utah, what was the team's mindset heading into Game 3 in that series?
 PAU GASOL: Understanding what it's going to take, the kind of effort you'll have to put in, the focus that you have go into the game with. And once you do that, you're giving yourself a chance to win that game, which they're going to give everything they have in order to win it, because it's crucial.
