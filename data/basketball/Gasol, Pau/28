  PAU GASOL: It's an honor to be a part of this weekend and just to hang out with great players. I want to be a part of this future event worldwide. 

 Q. (Inaudible). 
 PAU GASOL: No, not for me. I play with him quite often. I think he attracts a lot of attention obviously and he's a world-class athlete, well seen and recognized, and obviously it makes it a little more interesting when he's around. But I think there's a lot, a lot of superstars this weekend. I worked very hard and earned a spot into the game and this weekend, and people will be very excited to watch. 

 Q. How do you feel the season is going?
 PAU GASOL: So far so good. We've been pounded a little bit by injuries, but we've been doing pretty good. We'll just try to stay healthy the rest of the way. That's what matters from now on. 

 Q. (Inaudible). 
 PAU GASOL: It'll be exciting to see so many people in the stadium and a basketball court right in the middle. We'll see. I'm looking forward to that. It's one of the most special things of the weekend, and I think everybody is looking forward to that.
