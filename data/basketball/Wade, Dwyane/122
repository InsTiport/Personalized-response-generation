<p>	Q. One of their goals for Game 3 was to try to limit your touches and limit your looks and really try to prevent you from having the type of game you had in Game 2, but it seemed in the first half you were able to score and shoot pretty much at will.  Can you talk about their defensive effort against you and whether it bothered you at all. </p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously you had 36 points, so you had a good night.  Can you talk about the stretch when Lindsey Hunter was guarding you and what kind of a different look Hunter gives you?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you left the game you guys were down by four or five points, when you came back with 3:30 left in the game you were up by nine.  What did they prove to you picking you up while you were out?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about that stretch in the fourth quarter, what did you guys do to hold them?</p>
<p>	Q.  What were you thinking when you were sitting on the bench watching the team win without you? </p>
<p>	Q.  In the last four minutes, they seemed to start unraveling with the two by Rasheed and Chauncey Billups.  Were you surprised they lost their head?</p>
