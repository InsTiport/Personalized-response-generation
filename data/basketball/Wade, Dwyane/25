Q.   Have you talked to Frank about Sunday?
DWYANE WADE:   We had a small conversation.   We're going to have more as the weekend goes on.

Q.   Where are you right now?   Still day‑to‑day?
DWYANE WADE:   No, I'll play.   I'm going to play. 

Q.   How is the foot?
DWYANE WADE:   It's back.   (Laughter.)   I got to get my doctor to check it a little later on, but... 

Q.   Did you do any treatment for it at all?
DWYANE WADE:   No, I just kind of had to‑‑ I got off the plane, we landed in New Orleans, I started feeling a little better, a little movement in my foot.   And then as I woke up the next day, I had no movement in my foot. 
It's one of those things that it's going to go away on its own, like our trainer said.   You just don't know how much time it's going to take. 

Q.   So you decided yesterday that you would play?
DWYANE WADE:   Yeah, I told them before I left Golden State, before we left San Francisco, that the next day, if my leg come back to feeling normal, then I'll play a little bit.   So I told them yesterday I would play. 
I talked to my coach about how much I'm going to play.   But I told him I'm going to get out there and have a little fun and then, if I have to, sit down.

Q.   How much maintenance do you have to do and how odd of a injury is it?
DWYANE WADE:   Of what? 

Q.   Just the foot going numb like that. 
DWYANE WADE:   Oh, I don't know.   It's just a weird thing.   But I'm not really worried about it. 
But maintenance is part of the program every day, so it's something that I've been doing for years now, having to maintain and make sure that I can‑‑ when I get out on the court, make sure I can still be able to help my team compete for us to compete for a championship. 
So the maintenance program is a part of it.   Things come up and you got to deal with it, and that's all that this was.
