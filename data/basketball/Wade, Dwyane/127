<p>	Q. You were able to roll off eight straight and now you take this loss.  How tough is that on your team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Stan said that they did nothing that you hadn't seen and nothing that you hadn't prepared for.  How did they get you into spots on the floor where you didn't want to be catching the ball?</p>
<p>	Q.  Stan made the point that you have always made adjustments in playoff series when you've had a tough game.  Do you already have a sense for what you need to do in the next game, and how confident are you you can build from this for the next series?</p>
<p>	Q.  You usually don't get easily agitated out there, but you could tell you were arguing with the officials, they were banging pretty good, as well.  What were you thinking and how were you trying to not be frustrated out there</p>
<p>	Q.  It was great to see Shaq start the game.  How did he look out there to you?  Did he look like his old self or were there conditioning issues?</p>
<p>	Q.  They have an unusual combination of four men, what can you guys do to give Udonis some help next time?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does Tayshaun give you any particular difficulty where other people in the league might not, and if so, what are they?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is this the best defense you've gone against all year long, the distance with both Wallaces and the switching?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know you guys obviously came in as the No. 1 seed and the Pistons come in with a chip on their shoulder because they don't feel they get the respect they deserve.  Obviously I don't think you guys feel that way as far as the respect level of this team. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you make a more concerted effort to drive to the hole?  It looked like you were pumping on shots and not being as decisive as you usually are. </p>
