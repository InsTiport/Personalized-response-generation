  Q. (On Shaq:)  
 DWYANE WADE: Nobody thought we would be here, first of all, and every year he gets better and better. Like I said, there's a lot of guys that would love to play with a guy like that.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible).   
 DWYANE WADE: Well, I want the weather to get a little better and I want to make sure that everybody can get in so we can get everybody coming to the All-Star and so it becomes everything we believe it can be. If it all comes together, it's going to be phenomenal.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible).   
 DWYANE WADE: We've been given a great opportunity in life, and we need to make sure that we continue to help others less fortunate than us.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible).  
 DWYANE WADE: Most of the things that are talked about never happened. I don't want to talk about it. I love Amare, great player, good friend of mine, but I can't worry about that. I've got to focus on my own game.
