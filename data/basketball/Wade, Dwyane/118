<p>	Q. Can you just take us through the game and how the injury felt.  Did it get better, did it get worse, how you felt throughout the game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Stan said that you took an injection, can you tell us when you did that and how you felt trying to get going at the start of the game? </p>
<p>	Q.  That third quarter, how do you explain coming in with so much difference and the fourth? </p>
<p>	Q.  It obviously was painful, but at any point in the game did, it hurt as much as it did Game 5? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you describe what it did to your game.  Did it limit your mobility in the mid-section or did it affect your shot at all? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about your decision in the final minute to pull up for that shot when you were going into Shaq on a couple different possessions. </p>
<p>	Q.  You had a pained expression on your face for a lot of the game.  What was it feeling like?  Was it like a stabbing pain or what were you experiencing? </p>
