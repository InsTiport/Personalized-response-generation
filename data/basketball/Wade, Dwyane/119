<p>	Q. Can you just take us through what happened and what you're feeling right now in terms of the injury? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you try to continue playing, is that what happened?  Stan said you made a couple trips up and down the court and decided you couldn't play through it. </p>
<p>	Q.  When exactly did the injury occur?  Was it the jumper to make it a 20-point lead, is that when it happened?</p>
<p>	Q.  And when you took the charge on Rasheed, did that make it any worse?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there any doubt in your mind that you're going to play Game 6? </p>
<p>	Q.  Considering the timing of this, is this kind of frustrating, obviously when your team needs you the most, your situation is sort of in doubt now. </p>
<p>	Q.  Are you in pain now?  What's the pain feel like, and has anything like this ever happened to you before?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is it on your right side? </p>
<p>	Q.  Stan said it felt like, and it was his description, not yours, that it felt like knives were coming into your side.  Is that kind of accurate or does it feel like something else? </p>
<p>	Q.  Considering the location of it, how much does it restrict you from lateral movement or whatever type of movement, considering how athletic your game is? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said you had some semblance of this and missed four games, was it on the right side or was it something similar?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much of a relief is it for you to see that even in tonight's game, your team can hold up a lead and come out with a win with you not having to put up 30 or in tonight's case, 20 points going into Game 6?</p>
