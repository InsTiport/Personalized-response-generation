 Q.  It looked like the first time around you were conserving your energy and the second time you went at it.  Was that kind of your strategy? 
 DWAYNE WADE:  Well, yeah, kind of same as last year.  Kind of same as all the guys did in the first round.  You have to feel it out; and the second time you make it to the Finals if you're lucky you turn it up just a little bit. 

 Q.  Any significance going with you and Kobe head-to-head in the final round? 
 DWAYNE WADE:  It was good.  Everybody, you could tell the fans were excited about it.  It was good, you know, for talk.  Me and Kobe could be in the Finals.  He did a great job the first time around. 
 I thought -- I didn't think my 26 was enough.  The first time around he coasted and got 29.  I lucked out on a couple of things and won. 

 Q.  How does being the first ever back-to-back Skills Champion rank up next to being the NBA Championship? 
 DWAYNE WADE:  The scale is tipping on that, but I'm excited, like you say, that I could be the first.  And I'm sure there will be many, many after me.  To be the first one to do it is really exciting.  I'm just happy that -- more than anything it's a great competition.  It's great fun and I'm looking forward to next year. 

 Q.  Did you practice for this? 
 DWAYNE WADE:  No. 

 Q.  Did you practice last year? 
 DWAYNE WADE:  No.  A lot of it is what I do in games, especially going around the defenders that you have out there, kind of do that in the game.  It's kind of like second nature. 
 I got my money on Dick Bavetta.
