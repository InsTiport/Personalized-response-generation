  Q.  Talk about your party last night?   
 DWYANE WADE:  It was beautiful.  I had an unbelievable experience.  Converse really did an unbelievable job.  The party was great.  We had fun.  Rick Ross and Common came and shut it down.  A lot of people came out and supported me.  I really appreciate that, especially during All-Star Weekend, when there are a lot of things going on.   
  
  Q.  If you had to put together the ultimate All-Star team, who would your five starters be?   
 DWYANE WADE:  I would take the five that's here right now.   
  
  Q.  Can you give us your picks for the dunk contest?   
 DWYANE WADE:  I'm going to go with -- it's a tough one, but I'm going to go with the defending champion, Nate, just because he's the champion, and us champions have to stick together.   
  
  Q.  Have you heard about the race between Charles Barkley and Dick Bavetta?   
 DWYANE WADE:  Yes, I did, I've heard about it.  I'm going with Dick all the way.  Dick Bavetta is going to kill him by a mile.   
 That's for Chuck not putting me in his Top-5.  I don't really appreciate that, Chuck, wherever you're at.   
  
  Q.  Scottie Pippen has talked about making a comeback and he mentioned that he thought he'd be a perfect fit with you and Shaq.  Has he talked to you about that?   
 DWYANE WADE:  No, I haven't talked to him.  But just like I said earlier, Pippen is a great player.  I'm open to anything.  I never thought I would play with Shaq, so I'm playing with Shaq and Gary, guys I used to play with on video games.  If you put Pippen in that mix, it would be crazy.
