<p>	Q. Tell us about the adjustments coming off of the game in Game 1 to tonight. </p>
<p>	Q.  Even your coach Stan Van Gundy and Eddie Jones in the locker room talked about how motivated you were about how the media covered your Game 1 performance and how the Pistons stifled you.  Can you speak to your motivation coming into this game based on what you did in Game 1. </p>
<p>	Q.  Of all the pieces of advice that you got, whether it be from your college coach or Stan, also Pat Riley had a little bit of influence.  Can you talk about what he said about the Jordan effect, if that motivated you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Where did you drive to?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just talk about where your mental strength comes from to have the game like you did and to respond not only what you did the entire game but to come out early and do what you did. </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you get a phone call late last night, and the second one is what were Chauncey and Rip saying to you before the last free throws?</p>
<p>	Q.  Tonight you had 20 points in the fourth quarter.  It's the second time in the playoffs you've had a quarter where you scored 20 or 22.  What goes through your mind when you're in that kind of a groove, to get you to score 20 or more points?</p>
<p>	Q.  Tell us about what you anticipate on Game 3 with Detroit making some adjustments and the chess game continuing. </p>
<p>	Q.  I don't know if you addressed this already, but Shaq said that he called you late last night at 3:00 in the morning or something and both you guys were up.  Just talk about that conversation. </p>
