<p>	Q.  Dwyane, as you look back what is the most satisfying thing about last night's win?</p>
<p>	Q.  What's been the big difference in your being able to score in Game 1, you were frustrated, now it seems like you're being able to get to the rim at will?</p>
<p>	Q.  Those guys were saying earlier today that right now when you're hitting that 18-footer it's almost impossible to stop, and they're going to live and die hopefully with you taking the long jumper and hopefully you cool off. </p>
<p>	Q.  They've made a lot of adjustments on you, different defenders and that sort of thing.  Have you had to in turn adjust or are you just kind of playing your game?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you adjust between when Prince defends you as opposed to Lindsey Hunter defending you?</p>
<p>	Q.  What would it mean to go up 3-1 on this team getting them again on their home court tomorrow night?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you feel that now there's maybe not so much pressure on you knowing that the guys can actually pull the game off, for example, when you were on the bench yesterday with five fouls and down five?</p>
<p>	Q.  Detroit said they had a meltdown last night.  Were you surprised to see that in the final minutes?</p>
