<p>	Q. It seemed like they tried to face-guard you when he didn't have the ball and when you did have the ball they were just swarming you.  Can talk about what they tried to do with you tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  The defensive effort today, they changed obviously, put Hamilton on you, did the fact that he's faster, did that affect your game, as compared to the previous game when Tayshaun was the primary defensive man? </p>
<p>	Q.  There were certain times when you seemed to be a little frustrated.  Were you frustrated with the lack of cause, defense or just missing shots or what was going on?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel like you had sort of a missed opportunity here after taking Game 3 and not being able to take Game 4, and how much of that do you sort of pin on the team defense allowing Detroit to get to triple figures? </p>
<p>	Q.  Seems like a must-win at this time of the year.  So, you know, Game 5 is a must-win, and they probably think the same way.</p>
<p>	Q.  How does your defense need to change when Shaq's not on the floor? </p>
