Q. Can you start off with describing your play and what you'll bring to your new team?
KEVIN PORTER JR.: My style of play is kind of versatile, really.  I'm a combo guard who can play on and off the ball.  I'm really good at making decisions off the pick-and-roll and I can shoot.  Very aggressive, high intensity on defense.  I feel like I've got a lot of work to do, but I can bring a lot of things to the team.
Q. Just regarding your jacket, what has your dad meant to you on your journey to this moment, and what are you thinking about him tonight?
KEVIN PORTER JR.: My dad has been there since day one, the start of my journey.  So he means everything, the world to me.  I wish he could be here, of course, but I know he's smiling and everything.  I love him to death and he loves me to death.
Q. Can you just talk about how exciting it is for you to play with Giannis and how your game complements his?
KEVIN PORTER JR.: Well, I just heard I might be going to the Cavs.  But if it stays, definitely it would be a blessing.  He's an MVP candidate.  Just to have that on a mentor level is a blessing.  Being able to play with somebody like that, you can definitely learn from them.
Q. If it is Cleveland, then what do you foresee your role being there?
KEVIN PORTER JR.: I see my role coming in just playing really -- it's just a young team, and they're in the development stages.  I feel like I'll fit right in.
Q. I can't help but ask, coming out of USC in a year that the college was really rocked by scandal about college admissions and students getting in who were supposedly athletes who turned out not to be athletes and here you are an actual athlete.  Did that cross your radar or that of your teammates, that drama?
KEVIN PORTER JR.: No.  We were always out of it.  The basketball team, we were doing stuff the right way.  We were never in any of that admissions stuff.
