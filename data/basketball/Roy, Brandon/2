  Q.  Talk about having the event in this city?   
 BRANDON ROY:  Man, this is huge.  I was talking about it on the ride over.  To have an All-Star Weekend in my rookie year in Las Vegas.   
 This is the city that never sleeps.  You mix a great All-Star Weekend with it, words can't explain how big this is.  I'm just happy to be a part of it.   
  
  Q.  How tough were the injuries early?   
 BRANDON ROY:  It was tough.  Any time you miss 19, 20 games in your rookie season, it's tough.  I was able to play a lot in preseason.  I was looking forward to a big year, but the biggest thing is I just tried to put it behind me and overcome it.  So far I'm doing that and I'm going to try to continue for the rest of the year.   
  
  Q.  Are you surprised by how well you've done, how quickly you've adjusted?   
 BRANDON ROY:  I'm a little surprised, but at the same time I'm just playing my game.  I'm not really doing anything special.  I'm just going out there and coach is putting me in position to make plays.  And right now the ball is falling for me, so I'm going to try to continue to work and to continue to make plays for the team.   
  
  Q.  It seems like you have a really good nucleus of young guys in that locker room.   
 BRANDON ROY:  It's a fun place to play.  We've got a really good team right now.  We've got a lot of young guys, guys we can grow with, and I just think the atmosphere is positive right now.   
 As long as we continue to play hard, play with effort, I think the fans will continue to support us and we can slowly start turning things around in Portland.
