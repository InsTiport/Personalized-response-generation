Q.   Who are your top five international players right now at the moment, if you had to start a team? 
RUDY GOBERT:   Start a team? Tony, I probably forget some.   Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol, Joakim Noah, the big men.   Nicolas Batum. 

Q.   How do you think the international game has evolved over the last couple of years? 
RUDY GOBERT:   Got more and more international players being drafted, and playing   in the NBA.   I think the NBA respects the international players.   The teams try scouting‑‑ knowing the world.   We get more and more good players from around the world. 

Q.   When you came out you said you wanted to be a top seven or eight pick.   Do you feel like you're proving wrong some of the teams that didn't take you? 
RUDY GOBERT:   Of course.   Of course.   I have a lot of pride.   SoI got drafted 27, but I knew I should have been drafted higher.   Every day I'm trying to make them regret not drafting me.
