THE MODERATOR: Congratulations, Rudy.  How does this feel to win this back-to-back years?
RUDY GOBERT: It means a lot. I never thought I would be able to do that when I started basketball, you know, playing in France.  I didn't know an NBA player, I didn't know nothing about basketball, really.  I was just having fun.  And, you know, then I started to become more competitive, year after year, and eventually, you know, I made it to the NBA, and I'm standing here today, so just very grateful.
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Rudy.
