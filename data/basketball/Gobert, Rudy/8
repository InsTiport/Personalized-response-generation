RUDY GOBERT
  Denver, No. 27

THE MODERATOR:   Please start with an opening statement about your feelings about getting drafted. 
RUDY GOBERT:   I feel great.   It was my dream since I'm a kid.   I feel great. 

Q.   Rudy, we talked I guess it was almost a month ago now.   You felt you were going to be going a lot earlier in the draft.   How does it feel to be drafted?   And what do you think you can bring right away to Utah? 
RUDY GOBERT:   I think it's the same.   It will be great.   I can bring defense, block shots, rebound, and bring my offensive game to help the team to win.   Getting better month by month. 

Q.   Rudy, Denver is a team that has a lot of young talent.   But they can be injuryâ€‘prone with the front court.   So talk about how you can possibly have an opportunity to get minutes as the season goes along. 
RUDY GOBERT:   I mean, just keep working and try to show I can play and getting better on my game.   I'm going to have some opportunities, I'm sure. 

Q.   Rudy, talk about how big a change it's going to be from playing in France to banging with bigger guys every night.   By bigger, I mean heavier guys. 
RUDY GOBERT:   In France I played against heavy guys.   They were like tall.   6'9", 6'11".   Not 7'2" or 7'1".   Just need to get better.   I think I'm going to be good.

Q.   Just to confirm, do you know if you've been traded or not? 
RUDY GOBERT:   I don't know.   I don't know yet. 

Q.   Because there's rumors saying you've been traded to the Utah Jazz. 
RUDY GOBERT:   Okay. 

Q.   Quick question.   If you do stay in Denver, how excited would you be to have a French connection with Evan Fournier?   As well as how much do you know about Brian Shaw? 
RUDY GOBERT:   It would be great to stay with him.   He's my friend.   I know him for like six or seven years.   I played with him many times on the national team.   So it would be great. 
And for the coach, I don't really know him.   (Indiscernible).   I'm going to get to know him. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
