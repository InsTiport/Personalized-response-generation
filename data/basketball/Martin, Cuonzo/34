Duke   77
  Tennessee   67

COACH MARTIN:   I thought both teams played hard.   They did a good job shooting 48% from the field, executing the offense.   They did a good job of attacking off the bounce, especially in the second half.   I thought it was a good overall effort from both teams.   Missed a few around the basket, but other than that I thought it was a good effort.

Q.   Can you talk about the outside shooting you guys have been seriously hot from behind arc.   You're taking away those open shots today with the scouts?
COACH MARTIN:   I think they did a good job of taking away those shots from the perimeter.   I thought we did a good job getting the attack off the bounce.   Not necessarily set up the threes.   I thought we did a good job in the first half getting to the basket off the dribble.   We did it in spurts in the second half.

Q.   Coach, can you talk about the way the guys hung tough and hung with those guys for as long as they did?   Battled really well it seemed like?
COACH MARTIN:   For us, the game plan was to come in and try to win a ball game.   That was the plan.   They played well.   I thought our guys competed.   They just made plays down the stretch and really executed.   I thought we had a couple of quick shots, but it was tough.   Trae Golden was in foul trouble, so he couldn't in the fold.   He is always an aggressive attacker to the back. 

Q.   You guys have struggled a little in the paint coming into this game.   Can you explain their success today against a bigger team like Duke? 
JERONNE MAYMON:   I think we missed a lot of open bunnies right around the rim.   I don't know if we were putting it too hard off the glass or too soft up there, but we missed a lot of them.   We were just trying to battle and carry our assignments as best we could.

Q.   Coach Martin, can you talk about your team's toughness?   It seemed clear from the start they weren't intimidated by the stage or playing against Duke and all of that; and talk about getting that across to them?
COACH MARTIN:   I don't think that was the case at all, being intimidated by great teams and great programs.   It was a matter of playing great basketball and carrying out the necessary assignments to win the game. 
Our guys played with a level of toughness.   I didn't think we did a great job in the second half where we were making moves to the basket.   We didn't do a very good job in certain ball screen situations, but other than that I didn't think it was a factor.

Q.   You guys get Memphis tomorrow.   How big is that for an in‑state rivalry like that? 
COACH MARTIN:   I think it's great, but for us to just try to win a ball game is the most important thing.   We'll get back and watch Memphis and try to put together a game plan to win the ball game.

Q.   Jeronne, could you talk about the difference in that second half?   Like Coach Martin said, did Duke make some adjustments that closed things off or would you put it back on missing some easy shots on the inside like you said? 
JERONNE MAYMON:   They obviously did a good job on chesting us up, keeping their hands high without fouling.   We've got to focus on finishing more around the basket.   That's mostly on us.

Q.   You've played in this Memphis rivalry before.   Can you give us an idea what you expect to happen when the teams play tomorrow? 
JERONNE MAYMON:   It's going to be a tough, physical game like it was today.   The best team's going to win.

Q.   Coach Martin, you talk a lot about individuals, about playing defense without fouling.   Did you think your guys had a tough time adjusting in the second half?   It looked like maybe what was a foul changed as the game went on.   Did you think that was the case, and if so, did your guys adjust to that? 
COACH MARTIN:   The thing we talk about all the time is being at arm's length.   I thought the officials did a good job of officiating the game, but we talk about arm's length.   There was a lot of contact on our part and the officials made the calls.   It's just part of the game.   If you're arm's length, you don't have to worry about getting fouls. 

Q.   Coach, you played a long stretch without Trae.   Can you talk about the way the team responded and the job Wes Washpun did? 
COACH MARTIN:   I thought it was great for Wes Washpun, as well as the other guys that rotation.   Wes did a good job of distributing the basketball, running the team.   Solid on the defensive side of the ball.   Made a couple of big drives.   I thought he did a good job, especially since he played the last game.   I thought it was good for him.
