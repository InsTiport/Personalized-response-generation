THE MODERATOR:   Coach, an opening statement. 
COACH MARTIN:   Once again, a well‑played game.   A lot of points scored.   I thought both teams played extremely hard, especially in the second half.   And they just made just enough plays to win the ballgame. 
THE MODERATOR:   Questions? 

Q.   Just the way you guys battled down there, toward the stretch, you were just killing them inside and Maymon was giving you everything he had?
COACH MARTIN:   I thought he played well.   I think the key with his game is when he's making free throws, he's tough to defend.   He can go off the dribble, he can score around the basket.   And he's a solid defender.   But when he's making his free throws, he's a tough guard. 

Q.   Was the game plan there, once you got their bigs out, just to keep going at them?   I mean, you had such an advantage in there. 
COACH MARTIN:   Initially for us it was going inside.   We like to go inside out of the gate, depending on the competition, just to get guys in foul trouble, get our big guys going. 
They played with some confidence.   They made some shots, got some offensive rebounds, we thought just to roll with them. 

Q.   Coach, can you just speak to the nature of this game and you guys, in‑state rivals, coming so far to play such a hard‑fought, excellent game overall?
COACH MARTIN:   Well, you know, for us it's just playing an opponent.   It just so happened to be Memphis tonight.   And a great team.   A lot of talent, a well‑coached team.   And, once again, two teams that played really well.
I didn't really focus on the fact that they were from Tennessee, which was obvious.   It was more just about trying to win a ballgame.
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
