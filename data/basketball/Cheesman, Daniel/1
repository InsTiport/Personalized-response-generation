<p>	Q.  Either one of you two, was there any similarities to the other two games with Utah that crept into this game today? </p>

<p>	Q.  You got a lot of the inside baskets especially in the second half.  Utah will normally give you the 3-pointer.  To what do you attribute the success inside?</p>

<p>	Q.  Jeff, if you don't mind, if you do, just say no, could you give a couple of keys for championship games?  Who has to do what?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is your team mentally intimidated by Utah?</p>
<p>	Q.  Your best player Julie plays twenty minutes of that game.  Was that because of mostly fouls or other things?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just real quick, on the three-point shooting, they got 11 of them, you get two.  And they have all the open shots there.  And that was the kind of difference in the game; they have 11 out of 24.  Just talk about the three-point shooting and how key that was. </p>
<p>	Q.  Considering the difference between this year and last year, are you satisfied with the progress this group has made?  Do you feel like you are an element away from competing with Utah or is this the group that can get it done for you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you already have a gift in mind for Shauna (inaudible) when they are gone?</p>
