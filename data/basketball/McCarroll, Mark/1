<p>	Q.  Can you talk about their defense.  They weren't giving you an inch it seemed from start to finish. </p>
<p>	Q.  Does it feel strange not playing for the tournament championship first time in five years? </p>
<p>	Q.  Chevy, it's a different experience for you not going back to the final.  Could you talk about that, also the pressure they put on you defensively?  They kept you off the board. </p>
<p>	Q.  There's a lot made this week about you trying to guard them better as opposed to the first time you played.  Did you know they were this good defensively?</p>
<p>	Q.  You say they caught you off guard.  What in particular did they do? </p>
