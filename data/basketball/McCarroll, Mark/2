<p>	Q.  Did you guys talk at half time about taking advantage of some transition baskets, trying to get more points off of rebounds, blocks? </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) trouble with zone in the first half?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Toree's contribution tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  How bad is Jaron's ankle?  How much pain was he in when he rolled it? </p>
<p>	Q.  One more for Jamie.  How difficult is it to get to four straight title games in the BIG EAST tournament?</p>
<p>	Q.  Syracuse, once. </p>
<p>	Q.  Your team seems to finish games making big shots and big stops.  Is it experience, you think?  Especially on this floor here. </p>
<p>	Q.  Carl, you didn't have your best shooting night.  Your mentality is to keep shooting right till the very end? </p>
<p>	Q.  You hit the big one at the end there. </p>
<p>	Q.  Was this game reminiscent of the one you had at Pittsburgh in terms of the tenor, the pace of it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Carl, being from The Bronx, when you come back here, do you have any particular memories of Madison square Garden?  Does it feel special to have a performance like that here? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about hitting the three at the buzzer?  How hard was it to defend Smith tonight, Mark? </p>
<p>	Q.  Were you aware of the shot clock? </p>
<p>	Q.  Carl, based on what you've seen from BC, how do you think they're going to do in the next tournament, and particularly their rugged style? </p>
<p>	Q.  Carl, that play at the end of the first half where the drive didn't work, that's as visibly upset as I've seen you all year.  What was going through your mind and how did you guys snap out of it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously, you don't know who your opponent will be yet in the final.  Talk about each of the teams and what you have to do to beat those teams. </p>
