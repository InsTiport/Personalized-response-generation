  Oregon - 91, Arizona State - 73
 Q. You guys scored, I think you guys shot 70 percent in the second half.  Offensively what clicked for you guys in the second period?
 AMAURI HARDY:   I think when we get stops and then we were able to run out, it gives us offensive momentum.  And I think that we was really able to feed off that and obviously we had a lot of guys on the board today, it feels good when you're getting stops, and guys who doesn't usually get on the board, get on the board.  And then we just feed off each other's energy.
 Q. I know your role has changed a little bit throughout the course of the season, but obviously now with March and getting a chance to play, tops in the PAC-12 tournament to make a run here in March, how much this experience at Oregon, just how much of this have you enjoyed being apart of a winning program since transferring from UNLV?
 AMAURI HARDY:   I've enjoyed it a lot.  Just being on a winning team and just embracing the opportunity of being able to play here, embracing the journey, just being selfless in this whole experience and just enjoying each and every day.  Each and every day presents its own problems, its own opportunities, and I went about it in a positive way, just uplifting my teammates and just staying positive throughout the whole season.
 Q. How cool is it just to be back in Las Vegas and have a game like you did today?
 AMAURI HARDY:   It felt really good.  Like especially when we landed, like I felt pretty much at home.  Although I'm not from here, I spent a good deal of time here when I was at UNLV, but it felt good.  I played in it this arena a couple of times since I was in college.  So although there wasn't a lot of fans I feel like we brought great energy and it just felt good to be back in Las Vegas at all.
