Q. What was the message today just in practice, you guys get a day off and refocus for Game 3?
STEVEN ADAMS:   We were just trying to just forget the last two games, learn from them and move on.   That was the main focus of today.

Q.   What more than anything do you guys need to change going forward defensively?
STEVEN ADAMS:   I think it's just staying focused for the whole game.   You know, we'll be focused for say a quarter and a half and then‑‑ San Antonio is a team if you ain't focused, you ain't locked in, and they'll make you pay for it.   We have to stay focused for the whole 48 minutes. 

Q.   Talk about the spacing and ball movement on offense against this team.   Seems like they really are able to clog the paint against you guys. 
STEVEN ADAMS:   Yeah, definitely you always want to make a team move and make extra passes, make them work to find the open guy.   That's what we've been focusing on today, as well. 

Q.   When did you hear the possibility that Serge may or may not return, and what was your reaction? 
STEVEN ADAMS:   When was this? 

Q.   We heard this day.   When did you hear it? 
STEVEN ADAMS:   I don't know.

Q.   He's listed as day‑to‑day and not flatly out now. 
STEVEN ADAMS:   Then you guys probably know more than me.   I'm a rookie, I just do (inaudible).

Q.   What does that mean to the team?
STEVEN ADAMS:   I mean, it's good.   It's awesome that he gets better, but it's like‑‑ I mean, I feel like he's doing everything that he can kind of thing.   I'm not sure if that's even true, though.   I see him every day and he's just doing his rehab and all that sort of stuff.   He's looking good, but I really don't know if he is.
