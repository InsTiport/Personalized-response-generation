COACH DREW:   Obviously, there's not much time to work on anything.   But I'm pleased with our players, how they battled pleased with the leadership of Cory and Brady and Gary.   I was pleased with the rebounding tonight for the most part.   He either got his turnovers or points off turnovers with 24 to 8, and that is an area hopefully we can work on and improve.   Syracuse is a great team; Coach Boeheim does a great job,   think C.J. Fair down the stretch was really big.   
I know the toughest thing is not having enough time to really prep and come up and prepare with things that I wish I had prepared better on the offensive end for the zone but down the stretch, you've got to give them credit.   C.J. made the jumpers.   He's a good player.   As a coach, you can lose to guys and improve.   Syracuse is a great team.   Coach Boeheim does a great job.   
   
 Q.   Coach, I want to congratulate you guys and your team on such a great run in this tournament.   You've proven that you're one of the best teams in the nation.   But for the players, you guys, how do you feel you can build on this experience?   You lost a very good Syracuse team, but you beat some very good teams throughout this tournament as well.   How do you feel you can build on this experience?   
CORY JEFFERSON:   There's always room for improvement.   Win or lose, no matter what happens, we just need to go back and watch film of the game over this whole tournament, and the things that we did wrong, go back and improve them.   I think one of the greatest things about this team is we adjust pretty well.   
COACH DREW:   Thank you guys for a great tournament.
