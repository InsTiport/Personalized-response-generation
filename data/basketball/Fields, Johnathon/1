Q. Say your name, your position, your team.
JOHNATHON FIELDS: My name is Johnathon Fields.  I'm a point guard, and I play for the Washington Wizards.
Q. How long have you been playing NBA 2K?
JOHNATHON FIELDS: I've been playing 2K for 18 years.  First one came out in 2000. I've been playing since then, so it finally paid off.
Q. What was the tipping point?  When did it go from something fun after school to a competitive thing for you?
JOHNATHON FIELDS: 2K16, I lost the Xbox Road to The Finals by three.  It broke my heart.  It was the worst thing ever.  But ever since then, I knew it.  I knew that my dream was to go pro.
Q. So that was a pivotal moment for you.  What's it like to be on a real NBA franchise now?
JOHNATHON FIELDS: I'm still shocked.  I'm a pretty passionate guy, but to have me at a loss for words is huge.  I'm shocked.  I'm blessed.  God got me -- I have my family now.  I have a new family now.  I'm just ready.  I'm really ready.
Q. Do you have any advice for someone that wants to make the transition from just playing for fun into the competitive scene?
JOHNATHON FIELDS: Complacency.  Never stop grinding.  You have to always want to get better every day.  Be your own biggest critic.  If you can't be honest with yourself, you'll go nowhere.  You have to always want to do what you need to do to be that next man up, always.
Q. When not playing NBA 2K, what do you play?
JOHNATHON FIELDS: Basketball in real life or -- are you speaking of a video game?  More so Call of Duty.
Q. Are you good at that one?
JOHNATHON FIELDS: Yeah.  Call of Duty and Madden.
Q. How has it been to see the growth of the NBA 2K community over the years?
JOHNATHON FIELDS: It's been amazing because I remember, I used to be a guy who was on Twitch being passionate and screaming and getting like 20, 30 viewers, and that was two years ago, and that was big time.  But now you have this year where I play Dimez, and it's 1,500 viewers.  If I play FAB, same thing.  So to really watch that has been amazing, because it's like I chased something, and it paid off.
