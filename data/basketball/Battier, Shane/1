Q. Final series of your career?   Excited? 
    SHANE BATTIER:   Quite possibly.   Well, I mean, NBA Finals, if you're not excited to be in the NBA Finals, then something is wrong with you.   It's been a great 13 years.   This is why I came to Miami, to have a chance to do something like this.   I didn't think I would be able to do it, honestly, three years in a row.   But I'm here, going to end joy it. 

Q.   It's like dÃ©jÃ  vu.   It's kind of nice to ‑‑
    SHANE BATTIER:   It is, well, for me, in particular, I was going through the math and I think I've played the Spurs more than any other team in the NBA.   After 10 years in the Western Conference with the Rockets and the Grizzlies, it's my fourth playoff against the Spurs, I know the fine people of San Antonio notice pretty very well.   Good city, though. 

Q.   Having played them that much, what would you describes them as? 
    SHANE BATTIER:   You know, if you had to ask me, pretty consistent over 13 years.   The way they play, their style, their culture.   They've run the same plays for 13 years. 
    I was laughing with some of our coaches, some of the same sets they're running now are some of the same sets I was learning as a rookie, so amazing continuity.   One thing that's been consistent is their excellence.   It's rare that you see a SanAntonio team beat themselves.   When you play this team, you know you have to play a good game and you have to go and beat them. 

Q.   In the playoffs the game slows down and the defense picks up, but this is the two most efficient, offensively top‑rated teams.   What's your take on that? 
    SHANE BATTIER:   Both teams like to get up and down, both teams thrive off turnovers and both have great three‑point shooting.   So this game will‑‑ the series will be marked by the team that can make less defensive mistakes.   If you make a defensive mistake you're going to pay for it. 

Q.   Are you surprised to see them back here in The Finals? 
    SHANE BATTIER:   No. 

Q.   Why not? 
    SHANE BATTIER:   You're never surprised to see SanAntonio near the top of the standings.   You would be more surprised if they weren't here. 

Q.   This is your swan song, getting sentimental at all? 
    SHANE BATTIER:   No, I've never lived my life that way.   I've enjoyed the moment, done the best I can, given the hand of cards I've been dealt and move on to the next thing.
