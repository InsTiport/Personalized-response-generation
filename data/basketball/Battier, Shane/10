		  SHANE BATTIER:   After watching film, I'm always left a little salty because you see all the things you could have done better.   It was fortunate we won Game 2, but we made a lot of mistakes.   After watching the film, the good news is we can play a lot better.   I think we can play a lot better, especially on the defensive end.   That's why we're excited to get to Game 3.

Q.   Why have you been so successful offensively?
SHANE BATTIER:   Well, shots are there.   I don't think I'm a priority on other teams' scouting reports.   Coming into the series I knew there would be looks; got to make them count.

Q.   You've waited a long time to get to the NBA Finals.   Were you just saving it all up?
SHANE BATTIER:   I wish, I wish.   This is amazing.   You feel fortunate just to be in the NBA, and you feel even more fortunate to have a chance to play in The Finals, something every little kid dreams about.   Now that we're here, we just want to make the most of the opportunity.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
SHANE BATTIER:   We just haven't done a very good job on Durant.   And Westbrook, despite his criticism, he's scoring over 20 and giving us all sort of problems.   So there's a lot of room for improvement on the defensive end, and that's what we have to do, just keep building.
