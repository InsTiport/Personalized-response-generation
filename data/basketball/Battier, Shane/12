Q.   Talk about how talented their team is. 
SHANE BATTIER:   The way they play, their enthusiasm and just their bounce, you can say, is what makes them so great.   We know we are going to have to limit their enthusiasm as much as possible.   I think this is one case where they're inexperienced, and obviously their youth is an advantage for them. 

Q.   There are a lot of odds makers that have them as the favorite.   Does that surprise you a little bit?
SHANE BATTIER:   No, actually I'm sure there's some mathematical formula that that's based on.   But no, they have home court advantage, they've played great at home, and they're arguably the top team in the league from start to finish this year.

Q.   Is this a good situation for you guys, playing an underdog role?
SHANE BATTIER:   Well, for this team, where we are right now, I don't think it really matters.   When you get to this level at this point, you have to have a game.   You can't have a conditional game where you only bring your game at home.   You have to have a game, and you have to have a game that travels.   That's been our mantra from day one, and we've just tried to get better and better and better and build, and I think that we're playing our best basketball.   But the good news is I think we still have another level to go to.
