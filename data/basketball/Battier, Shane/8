Q.   (Question on LeBron) 
SHANE BATTIER:   He's one of a kind.   He's one of a kind. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
SHANE BATTIER:   Well, it's not like we stay up at night‑‑ we've got to produce, we've got to make shots.   No, we're basketball players.   All of our guys work hard every single day, and they're ready for the opportunity.   That's pretty much every guy in the league.   We're all role players, every last one of us.   Some players just have a bigger role, and their role is to sell millions of dollars worth of shoes and do commercials and get all of the pretty girls.   But we all have roles here, and it's to be professional about it and go about doing your role.

Q.   All the pretty girls?
SHANE BATTIER:   No.   My demographic is 50 and above and 13 and below.   Very underrated demographic.   They love me, though.   They love me. 

Q.   LeBron playing last night with the cramps, telling you guys to leave it all out there and then doing it himself, does that have any carryover for Game 5?
SHANE BATTIER:   Not really.   Every game is different.   Game 4 seems so long ago.   No, hopefully we'll all be better hydrated.   It's a good lesson in hydration and nutrition.   But we know we'll have to exceed our effort in Game 4 to win this next game.
