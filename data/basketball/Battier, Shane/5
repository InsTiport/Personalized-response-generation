 Q.   When you're a game away from where you want to go, how tough is it to remember that there's still one more game to win?   
    SHANE BATTIER:   It's not difficult, because you know the closeout game is always the toughest, especially on the road.   We were in there last year.   We're going up to Indiana expecting a really, really tough game.   
   
 Q.   Your view on what went on with Juwan and LeBron I guess in here last night at halftime was what?   
    SHANE BATTIER:   You know, that was veteran leadership.   Every team searches for veteran leadership, and there's a reason why it's important.   For moments like that.   
    Sometimes you need something to get you going.   You need a swift quick in the pants in different subtle ways.   That's what both of those speeches were.   
   
 Q.   Going into Indiana's hostile environment, how important is a fast start going to be for you guys?   
    SHANE BATTIER:   Well, in Game 3 we had a great start, we were able to keep the crowd out of it.   Obviously they play well when their crowd gets rowdy.   And so we need to just control the tempo, shoot a lot of freeâ€‘throws and deny them from making big runs.   
   
 Q.   Last night during the second half you guys were shooting more over them instead of driving to the basket.   Was that a conscious effort you guys made going into the second half?   
    SHANE BATTIER:   I think we took what they gave us.   They're a good defensive team, so they do a good job of taking away some things.   But we made the proper reads in the second half last night.
