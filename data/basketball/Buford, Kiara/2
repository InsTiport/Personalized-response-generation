THE MODERATOR:   Joined now by Minnesota head coach Pam Borton as well as Rachel Banham and Kiara Buford.   
Coach, an opening comment.   
COACH BORTON:   Yes, it was a great win.   Great win as a collective group.   I thought we had great balance offensively.   When we can get our post players to score, we usually win and win pretty big.   And that's probably been one of our weaknesses all year.   
I thought our starters really got us off to a great start.   I thought Kiara really set the tone for our team with her defense and her attacking, and just really our team really fed off of her tonight.  
Great team effort and gives us one more day to play together.  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions for the student‑athletes.   
   
 Q.   Kiara, you played a great game, 19points, 0 turnovers.   Tell me about your mindset going into the game knowing it could have been your last game.   
KIARA BUFORD:   I think just leaving it all on the court.   There's nothing‑‑ we had nothing to lose going into this game.   I had a lot of goals at the beginning of the season, and this is one of them that I wanted to accomplish.  
I wanted to make sure before I went out as a senior that we had a good game here at the Big Ten Tournament.  
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
