<p>	Q.  What did you think of Shaq's comment that, "you're Defensive Player of the Year, show me"?</p>
<p>	Q.  Some of your teammates have been concerned about you, it seemed like you've been a little down the last couple of days.  Have you been, and how do you feel right now? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about your mentality going into Game 7  Monday night. </p>
<p>	Q.  Were you more motivated because of Shaq's comments? </p>

<p>	Q.  We've always talked about the experiences that this team has been through to help you guys in each situation in the playoffs, but this team has not played a Game 7 on the road.  In fact, the Pistons haven't since 1988, so where do you draw on the experience for this game?</p>

<p>	Q.  Where did the intensity come from?</p>
