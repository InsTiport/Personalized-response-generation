<p>	Q. Obviously you played in The Finals before, but have you ever been in a game with that kind of nip and tuck, all the way to the end that had that kind of an atmosphere?</p>
<p>	Q.  What was the feeling out there?  Can you describe just how tough it was to get separation?  I mean, you guys did open up some leads, but it was just so close all the way through. </p>
<p>	Q.  What happened on the last defensive set with six seconds to go or nine seconds to go and you were up by two and Robert Horry got free for the 3-pointer?  Something Larry Brown just said, it was a miscommunication?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel like losing a tough game like this undoes all the momentum you had after Games 3 and 4?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much fight do you have?  How big a hill do you have to climb?</p>
<p>	Q.  You haven't won in San Antonio like for ten games in a row, is there something special about playing against their crowd or in their arena? </p>
<p>	Q.  On Robert Horry, he's done this so many times on the biggest stage, can you just talk about his performance and his energy in the end.  He really picked them up in this game. </p>
