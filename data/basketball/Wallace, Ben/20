<p>	Q. How much of Shaq did you see tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are you going to sleep well?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you give us an idea of what it's like?  You get like no help in trying to guard Shaq. </p>
<p>	Q.  After a while does it seem like you're bouncing off him a little bit?</p>
<p>	Q.  Rasheed was huge tonight with the charge and the rebounds and the full court, just a real special night. </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about setting the tone in this series and getting a win on the road right off the bat. </p>
<p>	Q.  As much as Shaq did, like you guys dominated defensively the last five minutes of the game, what happened there?  Was defense taking over at the end?</p>
