<p>	Q. Rasheed, down 3-2 going back home, one game left.  What happened tonight, 16 points combined?</p>




<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the level of frustration trying to get into some sort of rhythm offensively and have the fouls called on you guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  Larry was telling you guys, try to play through the officiating.  How tough was that?</p>


<p>	Q.  Obviously you wanted to play real well. </p>


<p>	Q.  You were in a similar situation last year, you went to New Jersey and won the series; do you draw on that come Saturday night?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is it frustrating to play the game when there's so many whistles and you can't get any rhythm on the offense or the defense? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is that maybe the most disheartening thing about this is that you guys could not come out and match their energy in a big game? </p>
