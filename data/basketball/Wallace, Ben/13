<p>	Q.  For you dealing with Shaq, this series must have felt like a month long and three heavyweight fights in there. </p>
<p>	Q.  How satisfying is it to win against all of the odds in their place? </p>
<p>	Q.  McDyess to get here to the Finals after what he's been through, what does that mean to you guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  Now that you've gotten past Shaq, you have to face Tim. </p>
<p>	Q.  But it's an even bigger test in the middle there, what do you expect? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think Duncan is an easier challenge for you guys?  He's a different player, nobody can compare. </p>
