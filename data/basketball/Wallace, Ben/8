<p>	Q. Your bench has been under the microscope throughout the season and I just want you to comment, clearly Lindsey is the story tonight but also Antonio chipped in, can you talk about how that lifted you. </p>
<p>	Q.  Looking at the box score, first thing I see, all of the other stuff we're talking about, Tim Duncan, 5-of-17.  What are you guys doing differently to shut him down and he's so hard to contain?</p>
<p>	Q.  Everybody knows about the defense this team can play but two days ago nobody had ever scored 90 points against the Spurs in a Final game, and you have guys have done it back-to-back, what's working well for you offensively?</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously the Spurs looked unbeatable in the first two games, you guys have looked unbeatable these last two games, what do you expect in Game 5 and how important is it for you guys not to become complacent? </p>
<p>	Q.  Would you expect it to be the closest game?  They have all been so lopsided, are you expecting a more closely contested matchup?</p>
<p>	Q.  The series is tied 2-2, but do you think you guys have gained any psychological edge with the way you've blown them out the last two games?</p>
<p>	Q.  No matter what, you still have to go back to San Antonio.  Do you believe you can play with the same intensity and aggressiveness there that you have shown here these last two games? </p>
<p>	Q.  Even after the last win, you said you felt the team could play better.  Do you think the team can play better than what we saw tonight, or is that the effort that it's going to take to carry you through these next three?</p>
