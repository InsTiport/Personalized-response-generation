<p>	Q. Can you talk about your role in helping stop Ginobili after those first two games, just keeping him out of the lane.  What is it you're doing? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think the day will ever come where a defensive specialist like you will get the attention, and more important, the money, the glory that the big-time scorers get? </p>
<p>	Q.  Tim Duncan has obviously been a Finals and regular season MVP and he's looked ordinary, at best, the last two games, do you feel like you guys have done that to him? </p>
<p>	Q.  He's been known to be so steady and consistent, but even his open shots last night he's missing.  Do you see him getting flustered? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about coming to the Washington -- I guess there were Bullets back then, what your expectations were, how hopeful were you and how fearful were you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Were you expecting anything?  I mean, you're an unusual player, most players come in, most of them they are offensive players, most defensive players playing big-man positions are bigger than you.  Did you worry that you just didn't fit here? </p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously the home crowd energy obviously helps, but what is it specifically the past two games that has turned you guys into this Herculean team? </p>
<p>	Q.  So there's no specific adjustment then that you guys make?</p>
<p>	Q.  What determines which way you're going to wear your hair for a game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Now that you've had two games with it up, do you have to stay with it up?  Is that pretty much it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is she the one that does the braiding? </p>
<p>	Q.  How long will you get it cut? </p>
<p>	Q.  Are you guys fronting Duncan a little bit more than you would normally front others, and did you make any suggestions to Larry about how to guard him differently after the first two games? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned shot clock, what from your standpoint, what's an ideal time for him to catch the ball for you defensively? </p>
