Q. How do you feel the morning after banging against the Big Fella?
 
BEN WALLACE:  I'd feel good if he'd get off my toes (laughter).  No, I'm good, I'm good. 
 
Q.  Where did you see him struggling the most?
 
BEN WALLACE:  Who?  
 
Q.  Shaq. 
 
BEN WALLACE:  Did you see him struggling?  
 
Q.  You didn't?
 
BEN WALLACE:  Uh-uh. 
 
Q.  You didn't see him hesitant at times?
 
BEN WALLACE:  Oh, you thought that was a struggling Shaq?  For what, the first five dunks?  No, I didn't see him struggling at all.  He was probably a little bit winded because he took some time off and didn't play as much, but I didn't see no struggling. 
 
Q.  Would you say he was similar to what he's been in the past going against you?
 
BEN WALLACE:  Yeah. 
 
Q.  How could you compare how you've seen him in the past to how he was last night?  Do you think he was back to his old self?
 
BEN WALLACE:  Shaq is going to be Shaq. 
 
Q.  How are you guys going to be able to hold them about 20 points below their scoring average for the playoffs?
 
BEN WALLACE:  Because we're artists.  We don't allow guys to come down and just get shots.  We're not going to triple team or double team anybody unless we really have to, but for the most part, we just don't allow guys to come down and just walk over us and make shots. 
 
Q.  In terms of confidence, how important was that first one for you?
 
BEN WALLACE:  You know, it was important.  Every time you step out on the floor in a playoff, you try to come up with a win, so it was very important confidence-wise.  This team has never lacked confidence.
