<p>	Q.  Can you relive your first meeting with Oakley (Charles) at that summer camp way back when, and I think you guys had some elbow battle going on when you played one-on-one, just what he's meant to your career, from helping you get to college to how you play now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did he tell you something along the lines to forget about the stuff that comes along with being an NBA player and just concentrate on the game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Any details from that summer camp when you played one-on-one, the battle that you had?</p>
<p>	Q.  I see you have the cornrows on today.  Now, when you got that 'fro in full bloom, it seems like you have some aerodynamic drag in transition.  Are you faster when you wear the cornrows than when you are when you have that big 'fro? </p>
<p>	Q.  How do you defend Shaq? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much double team and triple-teaming  -- do you think you need much help with Shaq?</p>
<p>	Q.  The fact that they are more of a halfcourt team, as opposed to a real up-and-down team on the floor, like a Sacramento, does that help you at least get some rest and conserve some energy or is there a trade-off by what you have to do to play halfcourt?</p>
<p>	Q.  What have you seen in these playoffs so far that other teams have done and as far as how to and how not to defend Shaquille?  Have you seen any one kind of defensive alignment, a set-up that you feel like it's worked better than others? </p>
<p>	Q.  Joe Dumars brought you into Detroit and built this team to what it is right now.  Can you just talk about Joe Dumars, how he's run this organization and he's affected you personally, you and your game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Joe Dumars said he's trying to make a point not to talk about the Bad Boys' experience and the championships, but still, is there some knowledge to be gleaned of what they have gone through to help you guys with this series? </p>
