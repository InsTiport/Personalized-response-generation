<p>	Q. Ben, you guys are not in an unfamiliar position, down in the series, you were down the previous two series but you showed a lot of resiliency.  Just talk about your team's resiliency and the way it bounces back. </p>
<p>	Q.  Is it possibly because you've got a collection of players who, you know, are resilient themselves, a lot of organizations that kind of gave up on you, a lot of players like that? </p>
<p>	Q.  You're a pretty mellow fella and you don't get too many technical fouls, bad call the other night --</p>
<p>	Q.  I believe so.  You're Defensive Player of the Year three times, how much of your anger results in the fact you don't get the respect due you as an award-winning veteran?</p>
<p>	Q.  They dominated you guys on the boards in Game 1, why was that and how do you turn that around for Game 2?</p>
<p>	Q.  You said something just happened in the course of the game, and the game seemed to turn on that, do you tell yourself afterward that that won't happen again?  Can you pretty much say that that's something you'll try extra hard to avoid? </p>
