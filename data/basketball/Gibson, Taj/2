		   TAJ GIBSON: Right after I had the comeback, it was a late night flight back to L.A.

 Q. Were you complaining? 
 TAJ GIBSON: No, just happy to get out of there just in time to get some rest. 

 Q. Looking at the season with Chicago, what are your goals and what are you talking about in the locker room?
 TAJ GIBSON: Our goals are just to take one game at a time. Coach has us in a right state of mind and he wants us to get better and better and have a late playoff run and win a championship one of these years. 

 Q. How do you feel going into the break in terms of momentum?
 TAJ GIBSON: Basically he just wanted us to finish strong. He said, don't worry about the breaks. He said normally guys tend to go on the break already with the state of mind that most guys are in. He just wants us to focus and he's a great coach and he has us in the right state of mind and we were able to take care of business.

 Q. Has Carlos been able to help you?
 TAJ GIBSON: Yes, since the beginning of the year, he's been behind me the whole time working on my game, even on days off we have worked out and we shoot almost every drill we do, we do together. He's just been a great attribute to this team and he's helped me as far as my growth.

 Q. You guys have just continued to stay confident and pile on the wins?
 TAJ GIBSON: He gets us better every day in practice and he doesn't take any shortcuts. He has that championship mind-set that you can feel every time you go into practice how hard we are going to come and there's really no days off. He expects us to bring it every night and you saw it last night the way we played. Going into the break in the mind-set that we are in, we really wanted to get that win.
