 Q.   You know Kevin Garnett probably better than anybody.   When he says this is his final All‑Star Game, how does that hit you?  
SAM CASSELL:   Well, he's going to make the All‑Star Game next year.  
   
 Q.   So you don't believe him?  
SAM CASSELL:   No.   Kevin has been telling me he's done for three years.   And the performance he put on the playoffs last year, you know, not amazing to me because I know Kevin, and I know the things he can do on a basketball court.   He's my all‑time No. 1 forward that played the game.   Everything he gets he deserves.  
He's a great friend of mine.   We do talk a lot.   The day comes when he does retire ‑‑ I don't believe him.   I just don't believe him.   The guy is amazing.   I'm glad I had an opportunity to be his teammate and win a championship with him.   
   
 Q.   Did they break the mold when they made him?   I can't think of anybody else coming along and being quite like him.   He's a unique guy.   
SAM CASSELL:   Well, he played at a level in the early '90s, mid‑'90s where the game was a battle.
