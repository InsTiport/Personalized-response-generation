<p>	Q.  You got their big guys in foul trouble because your small guys penetrated.  That seemed, to me, to be a big part of the win.  Can you talk about penetration? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about not making anything work against the zone.  Then Gary ignited things for you. </p>
<p>	Q.  Jay, second half you scored the first basket.  They didn't score anything for six minutes.  What turned it around for you guys?  What was going on? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you guys went down 23-10 in the first half, you almost looked nervous.  Did you feel tight out there? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jay, you talk about Gary making plays.  Can you talk about the charge he took on Williams, how big that was and that seemed to change the tenor of the game at the end. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you mention that play, what it did for the rest of the game. </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm sure part of the appeal of the Villanova job was a prospect of playing in the Big East tournament at The Garden.  Here it is, first game, big win.  How do you feel about that? </p>
<p>	Q.  They seemed to be getting the rebounds in the second half.  What did you do differently? </p>
<p>	Q.  Gary, could you talk about what your mindset was at 23-10.  Did you feel like it was up to you to take over?  That stretch was in a hurry. </p>

<p>	Q.  Did it seem pretty quick, you went from 23 to 10 to 23 to 18 in a snap.  Did you realize how quickly you kind of erased that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jay, I know it's just one win here.  I mean obviously, there's so many teams in this tournament on the bubble.  You guys are obviously on the outside of that bubble.  Do you think winning this tournament at this point, I mean, is that part of the mindset still?  What do you think your prospects are?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the possibility of playing UCONN again. </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) it seemed like it was to your advantage to lengthen the possessions. </p>
