  Q. How are you feeling?  
 ANDREW BYNUM: I'm doing okay, just finished treatment, got a lot of the swelling out. Going to do another one in about three hours. I'm going to be playing. I will be playing.   
  
  Q. What's it been like for you to be able to make such an impact?   
 ANDREW BYNUM: It's been great. You know, I worked out in the afternoon, and it's feeling really, really good.  
  
  Q. What do you expect from the Celtics in Game 4?   
 ANDREW BYNUM: They're going to be fighting for their life come Thursday, so we've got to be ready for that. Ray Allen is going to come out and obviously make shots. We're going to have to be a lot better in our offense, not turn the ball over.  
  
  Q. Can you describe how much pain you're playing with?   
 ANDREW BYNUM: But it doesn't really -- it's hard because it doesn't hurt the whole game, it's just when I do certain movements, like quick twist stuff. If I come down after a tip and I try to jump up again, I feel that, running and stopping, running really hard and stopping. It's just something I have to deal with. It'll hurt every now and again and then go away.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible).   
 ANDREW BYNUM: No, you know, it was swollen after the game yesterday, but it's come back down to normal, so I'm good, ready to play.  
  
  Q. At one point you were limping pretty badly and had to come out of the game. What happened there, and how fast or slow did it recover?  
 ANDREW BYNUM: I think that happened at near the end of the third quarter, and by the fourth quarter it was better.   
 I will play tomorrow. It feels better.
