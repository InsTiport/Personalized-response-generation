  Q. (Inaudible).   
     ANDREW BYNUM: It was either not play or do the draining.  
  
  Q. So unless you got it drained there was no chance to play?  
     ANDREW BYNUM: Exactly. Just too much swelling in there.  
  
  Q. But the draining really helped? ANDREW BYNUM: Yeah, I'm going to do more treatment tonight just to be sure and be ready for Sunday.  
  
  Q. How frustrating is it for you having to do this over and over again?  
     ANDREW BYNUM: It is frustrating, especially during the series. But I'm doing okay. The draining worked, and on Sunday I'm going to be ready to go.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible).   
     ANDREW BYNUM: Yeah, it's encouraging because the injury is not getting any worse. When I'm playing or when I'm doing things, activities, it tends to just be certain things that causes the swelling. As long as I can take it out without affecting other parts, I'm going to be all right.
