 Q. Talk about how Kobe played last night. 
 ANDREW BYNUM: It was ridiculous. He was going crazy last night. 

 Q. What do you expect different from them Sunday night, adjustment-wise?
 ANDREW BYNUM: Adjustment-wise I think they're going to do spacing and I think they're going to try to find Dwight even more so than they did, to try to force us to rotate the ball. 
 And they're going to try to get up shots. I don't think they shot too well from the three-point line. 

 Q. Does that put the pressure on you guys to try to react more? 
 ANDREW BYNUM: Yeah, exactly. It's going to be rebounding, beating everybody to the boards. We know we can put up 100. If we can hold teams to under that, then we should be good.

 Q. Kobe seems so focused, so locked in, people are saying that he's like Dirty Harry or Don Corleone. 
 ANDREW BYNUM: He's the same. That's him every day. He's always being focused, always watching film, always trying to learn. That's who he is. That's every day.

 Q. But he smiles a little bit more. We haven't seen him smile once during The Finals. 
 ANDREW BYNUM: I don't know. I think he's very focused. He looks to be the same to me. He's out here just playing, playing great basketball.
