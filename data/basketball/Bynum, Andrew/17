		   ANDREW BYNUM: Getting the ball and attacking.

 Q. In the second half, when Fisher called everybody together and talked to them and said this is the moment, this is kind what teams that win championships are made up, was that a pickup?
 ANDREW BYNUM: Definitely. Energy picked up. Everybody went out, 4-point lead or something like that. The game was really slow. I think both teams were looking for errors. And he was like you gotta take this game and they're not trying to take it from us. We gotta go out here and step into the moment. And that's what we did.

 Q. Did you feel that was kind of almost a coaching move by a player?
 ANDREW BYNUM: It definitely was. It excited everybody because they were out there.

 Q. Do you feel the rust shaking off in between rounds, do you feel more and more comfortable; is that fair?
 ANDREW BYNUM: That's definitely fair. I feel more and more comfortable each and every game.

 Q. In Game 7, the previous games, when you're still trying to get running and in shape?
 ANDREW BYNUM: I don't think I played any differently. I think I've shot the ball six times and got some opportunities. Six times yesterday. Six go in like they did in Houston. It's a different area. That's basically it.

 Q. In January, when you got in that role offensive, do you think you're finally starting to arrive big time in the NBA?
 ANDREW BYNUM: Kind of happens twice. I was playing well, the same thing happened this year. So hopefully just keep building. And I've had my injuries for my career.
