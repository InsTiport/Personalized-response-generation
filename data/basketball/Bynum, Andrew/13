  Q. How come he didn't dunk?  
 ANDREW BYNUM: That was part of our game plan, just keep him away from the basket and make him shot shoots.  
  
  Q. How do you guys come back from a great defensive effort when you hold them to less than 30 percent from the floor? How can you get better defensively after a great night?  
 ANDREW BYNUM: We need to come out the same way. We need to get better. They missed a couple of open shots. I think we can be better, but as far as the intensity, we're going to have the same level as the other night.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 ANDREW BYNUM: Try to do the same thing. They're going to have to double-team me, kick the ball around, and we'll get open shots the same way. Just got to put your body in front instead of trying to reach.  
  
  Q. How do you guys get more involved and not just rely on Kobe to score for you?   
 ANDREW BYNUM: I don't know if you can take that away from Kobe. That's what makes him great. If he's going to get the ball, he's going to put it in the basket. I just think for us it's a lot more on the defensive side. We've just got to hold them under 100 points, that's the way we look at it. Obviously on the offense we can get guys cutting through the lane, being more productive. But keeping a team under 100 points gives you your best chance to win.
