   ANDREW BYNUM: Trying to get some treatments before the game tomorrow, so hopefully it'll be a little bit better.  
  
  Q. How long does it usually go?  
 ANDREW BYNUM: About an hour to an hour and a half.  
  
  Q. Each one?  
 ANDREW BYNUM: Yeah.  
  
  Q. Is it painful?  
 ANDREW BYNUM: Treatment?   
  
  Q. Yeah.   
 ANDREW BYNUM: No, no. Ice, stuff like that.  
  
  Q. How important is it that you're out there just for keeping other guys in the rotation and Pau at the 4 spot?  
 ANDREW BYNUM: You know, it's important for me especially to go out and get easy buckets for us and just protect our rotation and really understand how I can hurt this team going out and getting easy buckets, getting in an open position, shooting over the top. Defensively taking up space, clogging the lane and being able to help out like that.  
  
  Q. Talk about what you have to go through in therapy to get into the game, or is it you're just going to play no matter what?  
 ANDREW BYNUM: I'm going to play no matter what. I've made that decision already. I'm ready to carry out, and I think on Sunday we're going to come out focused and be able to really withstand the energy that they're going to come out with because they realize that going down 2-0 is going to be catastrophical (sic). That's our goal tomorrow, just get that win no matter what.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible).   
 ANDREW BYNUM: I am, but it just depends on how much swelling is in there. When I'm limping it's because the muscles aren't firing correctly, which is why we want to get this done as quickly as possible, also.  
  
  Q. Is it getting worse?  
 ANDREW BYNUM: It's getting a little bit more swollen day in and day out. But like I said, the treatment kind of suppresses it and keeps it to a level of where we can handle it.
