		   ANDREW BYNUM: I'm definitely going to play. It hurts. I need to get surgery done. But I'm going to hold off.

 Q. Any idea what you can contribute tomorrow?
 ANDREW BYNUM: I'm just going to try to play as hard as I can given my current condition.

 Q. At this point it wouldn't make any sense for you not to play now, would it?
 ANDREW BYNUM: Exactly. I'm going to go out there and just give the best effort.

 Q. Because of that could you maybe even push a little bit harder knowing that there's no game after this?
 ANDREW BYNUM: For sure, definitely. I'm going to try to stay out there as long as I can and go through as much pain protection as I can.

 Q. Is there a noticeable difference (Inaudible)?
 ANDREW BYNUM: Similar difference. It hurts, rotation, everything. It's a bummer, but it's unfortunate, but it's part of the game.

 Q. From a guy who's been through this, how tough is it to watch a guy go down?
 ANDREW BYNUM: Extremely tough. I just wish him the best.

 Q. In one word how do you describe Game 7 of the Finals?
 ANDREW BYNUM: It's going to be aggressive.
