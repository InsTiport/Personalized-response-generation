 Q.   Did you ever think you'd make it here?  
ANDREW BYNUM:   It's been tough for me.   I think I had the opportunity to make it a couple years ago, and I got hurt.   That's never fun.   It takes a lot of time.   But I'm just happy that my injuries have been ones I can recover from and come back and get strong again without any lingering effect.   
   
 Q.   The rivalry with the Clippers is heating up this year.   All the acquisitions.   How is the relationship between you guys?  
ANDREW BYNUM:   It's great.   It's fun when we play against those guys.   You know how each other plays.   
   
 Q.   What does your gut tell you is going to happen in March?   Are you in the dark like everybody else, as far as will you be here?  
ANDREW BYNUM:   I think I'm going to be here.   
   
 Q.   When you say here, what do you mean?   You mean LA?   
ANDREW BYNUM:   LA.
