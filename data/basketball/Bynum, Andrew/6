 Q. Can you talk real quickly about you guys as the defensive unit and --
 ANDREW BYNUM: I'd say yesterday we definitely played the kind of defense we require, ran them off the three-point line. That's what this team needs in order to be able to put up 100 points. If we continue to do that, we're going to be tough.

 Q. Do you appreciate the impact you have? You have to know the game to know how huge it is. 
 ANDREW BYNUM: Yeah, it's great, but at the same time I think (indiscernible).

 Q. Your psyche, what kind of gets you going, 20 points or 15 boards?
 ANDREW BYNUM: For me it's more just coming out and playing hard. We have scorers on this team, Kobe and Pau. As for everybody else, we just go out there and play defense, get the ball back. That's what we do.

 Q. (Indiscernible).
 ANDREW BYNUM: Kobe and Ron are both certainly big parts of the game. Ron was huge late in the game, also. They're both good players, and Ron is really focused as far as an opportunity to actually compete and go for a championship, he's there.
