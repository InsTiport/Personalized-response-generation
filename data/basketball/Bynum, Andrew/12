 Q. That 62 percent shooting from the field, was that just a once-in-a-lifetime thing for them?
 ANDREW BYNUM: Definitely not. That's how they got here. They're known for getting hot and staying hot. We've got to do a better job of rotating out to people and then not allowing Pietrus and Rafer to get 20 points apiece. 

 Q. How was the atmosphere different here than it was back home? Has it changed your approach to the game?
 ANDREW BYNUM: Of course it's loud here. They're Magic fans. We had a couple of key mistakes last night. Even though they shot 62 percent, we were still right there.

 Q. Do you feel like that's one you should have won, though, they shoot 62 percent and you're still only down 2 with 0.2 seconds to go?
 ANDREW BYNUM: Exactly. We missed ten free throws, turned the ball over three or four times down the stretch.

 Q. Was there anything wrong with Kobe down the stretch? He didn't look as involved in the offense as he was in the first quarter. 
 ANDREW BYNUM: There wasn't anything wrong with him, we just kind of started to try to get everybody involved, and basically at the end of the game we turned the ball over. A situation where a guy falls down, called time-out, shoot away, free throws, everything.
