 Q. What did you think about Fisher's three-pointers the other night?
 ANDREW BYNUM: Trevor's three three-pointers before that really got us back into the game. In that third quarter is really where the game changed. We were down 10, and we really came out and fought back into the game and put a lot more pressure on their team, and every mistake they made, the crowd's energy got sucked away, and it just got really heavy on them. 
 We were able to come out, and obviously Trevor hit those three threes, Fish's three put us into overtime, which was huge, and we were able to go from there.
