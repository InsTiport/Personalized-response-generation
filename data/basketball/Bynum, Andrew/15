  Q. First real minutes in the playoffs, are they still there at all?  
 ANDREW BYNUM: It's definitely enjoyable. You're a little bit nervous. For me it's going to be crazy playing in The Finals. Not everybody gets a chance to be there, much less have an opportunity to win it.  
  
  Q. I know one of your goals has been to get a 20-20. That's something that Howard has done many times. You may not yet the opportunity in the playoffs, but how far are you away from getting back to that guy?  
 ANDREW BYNUM: Getting back to that guy, like I said, I'm just going to do the best I can and go out there and play.  
  
  Q. How do you explain the difference between the Laker team this year and last year knowing that you weren't there, knowing that Trevor wasn't healthy?  
 ANDREW BYNUM: I know the difference is we're just going to be a little bit deeper. We're planning on going out there and really playing well. I think we're a little bit deeper and a little more focused.  
  
  Q. You have home court, is there a pressure with that knowing it's two-three-two format?  
 ANDREW BYNUM: Of course. You have to win the first two games. You just have to. There's not really any other way to put that. You've got to get the first two. That's where you get the advantage. If you win the first two, it's hard for any team to beat a team three times in a row. You're probably going to get one over there and two here to close out. You have to win the first two games.
