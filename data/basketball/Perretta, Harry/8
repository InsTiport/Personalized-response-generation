Villanova   70
  Butler - 49

COACH PERRETTA:   I thought we played pretty well today.   I mean, we ran our offense pretty well.   We got the shots we were looking for, and we got a boost.   Caroline didn't score today, who was our leading scorer, but we got a boost from Alex, who came into the game, and I think she had five threes in the game today, which really helped us. 
But again, I thought we played relatively well, but Butler was without two of their top players.   We know what that's like.   We were without two of our players, I think, almost in ten games this year, so we know the feeling.   It's not a good feeling.   But I thought we played pretty well overall.   I obviously think we have to play better tomorrow to have a chance to beat DePaul. 

Q.   Alex, as a freshman, your Big East Tournament debut, you really turned it on.   What were you trying to do out there tonight? 
ALEX LOUIN:   I was just trying to keep my feet set and my teammates around me, and I was able to knock down the shots.

Q.   How did that feel to step up on a stage like this?   Didn't seem like you had any jitters really. 
ALEX LOUIN:   It was good.   I'm happy we got the win.

Q.   What does it say about your team that Caroline is your leading scorer, yet tonight she's scoreless and you guys are balanced really in the grand scheme of things.   How important can that be for this tournament? 
ALEX LOUIN:   I think it's very important.   We definitely showed our depth tonight, so I think that was helpful.

Q.   Katherine, as a junior on this team, you look at this team, what makes this one special, to have the potential to really make a run here? 
KATHERINE COYER:   Well, I'm a little biased so I think a lot of things do, but I think both on and off the court we just get along so well, just from a chemistry standpoint we all really like each other, we all get along really great, and I think that carries onto the floor.   We're not a selfish team at all.   Like Alex was saying, we have a lot of depth so it doesn't matter who's getting those points.   As long as someone is, we're going to find that person, and that really helps us.

Q.   In the first half you assist on every single basket that you had. What was it about the ball movement tonight that made it so good? 
KATHERINE COYER:   I think whenever we're moving the ball well, we're going to get a lot of good shots and a lot of open shots and easy shots just because that's the nature of our offense.   Luckily we hit some shots early, which kind of opened up the lane a little bit for us.   But yeah, as long as we're making those quick passes and finding the open player, we tend to be pretty successful.

Q.   What do you do against DePaul? 
KATHERINE COYER:   I don't know, DePaul is one of those very versatile teams.   They do a lot.   They're not just three‑point shooters, not just drivers, they have a lot of depth.   I think the key is going to be defense, try to slow down the game a little bit, play to our advantages. 

Q.   Alex, thoughts on tomorrow night's game? 
ALEX LOUIN:   Just defense, focus on defense, and I think we'll be okay. 

Q.   Coach, you take a look at this performance tonight, and like you say, you've been in this role where you've been short‑handed.   How much has that helped you in the long run?
COACH PERRETTA:   It did help us a lot in the long run because kids like Alex Louin could develop when we were shorthanded.   When Katherine was out, she played a lot more and she got more experience and she got more confident.   Emily Leer was out, we had to develop Taylor and Kavunaa, and then Samantha was able to come in and play.   So those kids got a chance to develop, kids like Jordan Dillard.   So they had a chance to develop early in the year. 
Now, it wasn't fun for them because we were 3‑7 when they were playing, but it's paying off now because we can get players into the game that can help us.   You know, it gives other kids a break, and now their experience is helping us later on in the season.

Q.   The approach to this one, there's never a guarantee, but when you're facing a team that is very, very short‑handed in this match up it seemed like you were pretty hard on your players tonight?
COACH PERRETTA:   I was, because we have to learn that each game is different.   Look, they're shorthanded, we know that, so we have to be able to‑‑ when we know we're going to win the game, we have a big enough lead, we have to practice for the next game, and that's one thing that I don't think players understand how important it is to use even a victory, even when you're up by a lot of points, to develop and to get better for the next game, especially when you're going to play a team like DePaul who's so good on offense.   You saw us tonight in the second half.   We were having trouble guarding them off the dribble. 
You know, DePaul is a lot better than they are taking it off the dribble.   If we don't practice, DePaul is going to take it by us like we're statues tomorrow.   That's why I was so hard on us to focus on the things we can do.

Q.   Seemed like, as well, tonight you were trying to get the ball into the post to Emily.   One thing DePaul has had issues with at times is that post defense.   How important will that be tomorrow?
COACH PERRETTA:   Well, it'll be important because they're going to double her, I think.   Every time we threw the ball to her the last game at DePaul, they doubled her.   The bottom line is we were trying to practice getting the ball inside, and if she gets doubled, then she has to make the right pass.   So we were actually at points trying to do things that we were actually going to try to use tomorrow. 

Q.   When you face a team like DePaul, what's the one thing you've got to do?
COACH PERRETTA:   You have to slow the game down for us.   We physically cannot score as many points as they do if the game is fast paced.   We just can't.   We're just not good enough and we know that.   We're not going to sit here and pretend like we are.   So for us to beat them, we have to‑‑ the game has to be low scoring, and the funny part was, the one game we did win wasn't low scoring.   That was kind of weird.   But the second game was low scoring. 
I just don't think you'll beat them many times in a fast‑paced game, and we have to not turn the ball over, either.   They're going to double us a lot.   I think we had 13 or 14 turnovers at DePaul, which is actually okay.   If we can keep it under 15, it's actually not bad.   We're not going to go through the game tomorrow with three, I'll guarantee you that.   It's just not turning the ball over, slowing the pace of the game, and just trying to guard them.
