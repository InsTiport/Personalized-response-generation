<p>	Q.  The Final Four, especially in the past few years, there's hardly been one of those up-start, low-seed team to come through.  Is that simply because there's more resources at a school like Kansas, Oklahoma, Indiana?  Is it just a matter of having more money to go out and do more things, build a program that way? </p>
<p>	Q.  Freshman point guards are rare in the Final Four.  Can you talk about how Aaron has handled the pressure all year, what he's going to have to do tomorrow against the Terps? </p>
<p>	Q.  In recent games, you've used Aaron defensively on the opposing team's highest-scoring back-court guy.  Is that going to happen tomorrow?  Is he going to see some time? </p>
<p>	Q.  Rebounding has been so big for you guys throughout the tournament.  You run up against a very big and solid frontline in Maryland.  Talk about that, if you would. </p>
<p>	Q.  Somebody said something like 32 of your former players are going to be here.  Are you aware of who is here?  What does it mean to you?  The good luck question, what are you guys going to do here in Atlanta? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk generally about the impact that the three freshman, Miles, Langford and Simien have had on the team?  Also, did you think going into the year they could have that kind of impact? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about tradition, your past success.  Do you think you and your program had any more pressure put on you to be here and be successful here?  If so, how have you kept your team relaxed? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned the other day that you always liked to play fast.  Obviously with Drew and Nick, you have the makeup of a team that can get up and down the court.  I'm curious in the last couple years, did you change anything in practice?  Do you do anything different to try and get a pace that other teams really just can't copy? </p>
<p>	Q.  There have been volumes written on Juan Dixon, all the intangibles he has.  When you watch the guy on film, what is it that makes him so effective? </p>
<p>	Q.  How important are matchups this time of year?  Tomorrow will be a bit of a chess match.  You start with the three guards.  They have a traditional team more.  How important do you think that's going to be? </p>
<p>	Q.  How important is winning this to you?  Do you ever feel like the best golfer who has never won a major? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think the tournament has lost any of its appeal because of players going early to the NBA? </p>

<p>	Q.  Both players, your coach has taken some heat over the years for being the successful coach that hasn't won a championship.  What does it mean to you guys to go out and get it for him? </p>

<p>	Q.  Drew, do you find it more difficult to go up against a big man more similar to you in terms of tall and agile or a shorter, more muscular guy like Lonny Baxter? </p>
<p>	Q.  What scares you about Maryland? </p>

<p>	Q.  Drew, you do match up so well inside, but you dominated against Illinois and Oregon.  What's the challenge now against a bigger frontline? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jeff, in your time at KU, have your players ever gotten together and had a, "We have to win this for Coach Williams meeting," and if so, when was that? </p>
<p>	Q.  After watching the tapes on Maryland, is there any one weakness that you think y'all are best equipped to kind of open up? </p>
<p>	Q.  Drew, what do you see as the key to winning the rebounding battle tomorrow? </p>
<p>	Q.  Matchups are pretty even, like you say.  One advantage they may have is Final Four experience.  Can you talk about that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Drew, what makes a West Coast guy with all the attractive options you have out there to Kansas, where you're fully aware of the Kansas tradition? </p>

<p>	Q.  Jeff, what is it like playing on this team which gets up and down the court so well, so quickly, and has the ability to put so many points on the board in such a quick amount of time? </p>
<p>	Q.  Drew, earlier this year you said that you and Nick were Tim Thomas like.  Could you comment more on Tim Thomas, how you complement each other, what makes you unique as   -- ?</p>
<p>	Q.  Drew, you talked about having not played Maryland.  You only see it on the film.  Do you run into that with other teams who haven't seen you guys and don't realize how good you are, how fast you run? </p>
<p>	Q.  You guys have been so dominating on the boards in this tournament.  What has been your key to success in rebounding? </p>
<p>	Q.  Earlier you mentioned the adjustments you made since coming in as a freshman.  How did you make those adjustments?  What were they? </p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of people are saying that Maryland and Kansas might be the two best teams here, trying to make this into an early championship game.  Your thoughts on that, what the implications might be for the winner of this game Monday night? </p>
<p>	Q.  There's a theory, guys, I don't know if you agree with this or not, there's a theory that one of the reasons Kansas wasn't as successful in the NCAA tournament in past years as it wanted to be because that Coach Williams was so intense, the practices are so tough, you guys are just emotionally burned out.  Do you agree with that theory?  Has he changed anything? </p>
