   DREW GOODEN:  They're a great team.  They did everything they were supposed to do for Game 1.  That's why they won.  This is our first time playing in The Finals.  We know what to expect now that the first game jitters are out of the way.  We've got a game under our belt, so we'll see how it goes in Game 2.   
  
  Q.  What was even tougher about them or this setting than you thought it would be?   
 DREW GOODEN:  It's always tough playing on the road, first of all, and to open up Game 1 against a team with the experience they have in The Finals and not losing a Game 1 when they have home court advantage.  I mean, we knew what we were coming into.  We knew what to expect.  But we didn't come out on top, we'll make adjustments and be ready for Game 2.   
  
  Q.  People who were watching you guys for the first time ever last night came away with a pretty low impression of the Cavaliers.  How do you say that we're not as bad as we look?   
 DREW GOODEN:  I think that's probably the worst basketball we've played this whole playoffs, as far as getting in a rhythm offensively and defensively, and especially rebounding the basketball.  It wasn't just LeBron James that had an off-night, it was the Cavs as a whole.  We will bounce back.   
  
  Q.  Is that because of their play, or because of you guys' first time in The Finals?   
 DREW GOODEN:  I don't want to make excuses.  They won, plain and simple.  They scored more baskets than us.  I don't want to get into details.  We have to make adjustments, and that's it.   
  
  Q.  What did Bruce Bowen do that was maybe aggravating for you guys last night?   
 DREW GOODEN:  I don't know, he never guarded me so I can't tell you.
