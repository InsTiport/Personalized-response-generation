  Q.  First game, tight game, second game, they win.  How do you balance things out on offense with your shooting opportunities?   
 DREW GOODEN:  I think that's something that's a coach's decision.  It's something we're going through, and that's why (Inaudible).   
  
  Q.  You were so close twice, does it help your confidence knowing that you were so close in both games or does it hurt your confidence that you were right there and didn't get it done?   
 DREW GOODEN:  It doesn't hurt my confidence because until like -- it was like a measuring stick, those two games.  Actually the first game, it lets you know where we're at, and we do have confidence coming into -- having two home games, so I think it'll carry over.   
  
  Q.  Will you change anything for these next two games coming up?   
 DREW GOODEN:  Yeah, I mean, we made counter moves, but again, the game played out at the very end, it was just Game 1.  So we'll probably have to make some more changes, but other than that, I think possessions are very valuable and I think we're going to find that out.   
  
  Q.  What do you do in the third quarter?  I mean, you guys have tried to shake it up a little bit.  What can you do?   
 DREW GOODEN:  Like I said, it's a lot of things.  I can't say we did anything wrong, but one thing is valuing possession of the ball.
