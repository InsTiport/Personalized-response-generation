<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the difference for you between the first 10 minutes of the first half and second half?  Also, how many people did you have in the crowd tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  Royal, can you describe what it was like trying to contain Anthony. </p>
<p>	Q.  Brandon, talk about how special it is to come home, play in the Louisiana Superdome on a national stage. </p>
<p>	Q.  TJ, would you talk about the game in general, the things you feel like you didn't do, maybe reflect on the season just a little bit, too. </p>

<p>	Q.  Would you talk about, did you think your defense was particularly sharp tonight overall? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've played both of these teams this year.  Talk about what we can expect from your point of view on Monday night. </p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of teams  -- a few teams here have a lot of seniors they have to worry about.  It looks like you have most of your nucleus back next year.  You mentioned the free throw shooting.  Is that the most disappointing thing about the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there anything you could have done to try to take the ball at Anthony in the second half to get a fourth foul on him?</p>
<p>	Q.  What did Brandon mean to your program? </p>
