<p>	Q. Did you detect a difference in the flow of this game?  I mean, it's two very close games, two three-pointers at the end, one goes in, one doesn't, or was there something throughout the game that you saw that was different? </p>
<p>	Q.  Are you content walking out of here with a split of the series?</p>
<p>	Q.  Going into overtime the way that you did on their last-second shot, what was the mood of the team as you broke the huddle? </p>
