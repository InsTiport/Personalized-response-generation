Q. Yesterday you said you expected your team to come out and play.  There was just nothing other than that.  Simple as that.  Did they come out and play tonight? 
 
YOLANDA GRIFFITH:  Half the game.  I still think when we have a lead on a team, you have to close the door.  You can't give them opportunities.  We had a 12-point lead, they cut into the lead and we were only up by two with maybe six and a half, five minutes left in the game.  That's giving a team the momentum to shift.  We're playing at home, even though we're playing at home nothing is guaranteed.  You got to stay focused, you got to execute offensively, you got to shut players down defensively.  And I think that tomorrow we're going to review the tape and refocus and get ourselves ready for Tuesday's game.  Tuesday's game is a must win.  Even though we're home, I know their backs are against the wall right now, even though we're up two I should be happy.  Am I?  I don't know.  I mean, I'm just not satisfied.  Because I know we can play better ball and Tuesday I hope it's the game we're waiting for everybody to step up and bring it.  
 
Q.  For the second time this series you guys set a new Finals record for --
 
YOLANDA GRIFFITH:  Turnovers?  
 
Q.  Yeah. 
 
YOLANDA GRIFFITH:  We were just talking about that a few minutes ago.  We, Mya and Ticha.  Normally in the regular season we have been averaging 16, 17 turnovers and we know if we control the tempo of the game, have less turnovers, we have a pretty good chance of winning the game.  Tonight we had six; at Connecticut we had 7.  I think in the overtime we had more than the whole game.  So it's important to cherish the ball.  That's the money ball. 
 
YOLANDA GRIFFITH:  You all have a beautiful night.
