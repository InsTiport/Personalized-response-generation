 Q.  Can you start out with an opening statement about what you're going to bring to your new team, please.  
THOMAS BRYANT: I feel what I'm going to bring to any organization is my passion for the game, you know, the love that I have, the passion for the game, the ability to talk out there on the offensive and defensive end, and the versatility that I bring on the offensive end, as well, and continue to gain the more versatility that I can on the defensive end, as well.   
 Q.  What do you know about your team, players, Coach, management?  What do you know about your new team?  
THOMAS BRYANT: I know a lot about them.  I watched them throughout the playoffs.  I remember going to the games the last playoff series when they played against the Clippers, Gobert and Gordon Hayward, they've got Iso Joe also over there, so I feel like it'll be a great fit.
