 THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Vanderbilt head Coach Balcomb, and student-athletes. We'll take an opening comment from Coach Balcomb and then take questions. 
 Coach? 
 COACH BALCOMB: You know, I just think today we lacked focus. We missed assignments defensively. We gave too many open looks to their great shooters and didn't defend and rebound, which is how you win games right now. 
 It's tough because we know each other so well, and they played like Tennessee and we didn't take their strength away. They did a better job taking our strengths away. 
 THE MODERATOR: Questions. 

 Q. Jence, in the first two games against Tennessee, you really hurt them from three-point range. They seemed more committed to taking that away today. Was that kind of the case? 
 JENCE RHOADS: I think so. I think that was definitely one of their focuses. They probably worked on that. Coach Summitt probably talked about that in their practices and preparation. 
 So I'm sure that was one of their focuses, and they were pretty successful at it. 

 Q. Hannah, had 12 points tonight; great defensive effort. I wanted you to comment on the crowd's reaction when you got the fifth foul. 
 HANNAH TUOMI: I mean, no comment (laughter). 
 I mean, fouled out. What are you going to do? Can't change it, so... 

 Q. Can we talk about the defensive effort against Tennessee. Was it a matter of two games in two days? Tired legs? Obviously No. 4 in the nation, but... 
 JENCE RHOADS: That's not an excuse. I know playing two games is hard, but that's not an excuse we can use for this game. 
 Like coach said, we weren't focused. We had some lapses, and Tennessee took advantage of those lapses. 
 HANNAH TUOMI: Came down to whichever team showed up with more focus and better game plan and executed all of it, so... 
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.
