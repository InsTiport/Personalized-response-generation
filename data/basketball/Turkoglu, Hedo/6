  Q. How much do you take from the first two games you guys played in the regular season and you obviously won?   
 HEDO TURKOGLU: I mean, we take a lot because we just talk about it, we watch a lot of film, just watch how we play as a group and what we did to get to this point. We talk about it and just going to try to play our game and our system throughout The Finals. We need to play with more desire, more energy, make a final pass to a final guy, play from the inside out.   
 The sixth game at home against Cleveland, it was huge. We need to just be ready, taking shots, making an extra pass.   
  
  Q. How much do you welcome Jameer playing?  
 HEDO TURKOGLU: He'd be huge for us. But like I said, just going to be happy to see him out there. I know the goal is going to be the same, to do our best to win the championship. If he's ready, I'm sure he'll be a help in any situation, so we'll see what's going to happen.   
  
  Q. How tough of a match-up do you think the Lakers are going to be, especially in the post?   
 HEDO TURKOGLU: Like I said, just going to stick with it and play through it and just going to really see how the Lakers are going to react and just stay on them all night, double-team and kick it out and find an open man, and we're just going to read the situation and play it like that.
