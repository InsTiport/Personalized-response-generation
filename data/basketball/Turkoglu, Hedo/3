  Q. Are you guys a lot more relaxed today after that?  
 HEDO TURKOGLU: We can't be relaxed. It's just one game that we won. We're happy about it, but we're not really satisfied. Two more home games, and we started with a win, so that's kept us in it, and hopefully another win tomorrow will even the series.  
  
  Q. Does this team feel like they can go out there at any given time and break records in shooting every single night?   
 HEDO TURKOGLU: We don't really go out there to break any records in shooting. We just try to go out there with the mindset that we need to play defense the best we can. It takes defense to win the game, and it starts with rebounding and creating open shots for ourselves and our teammates.   
 As long as we're helping each other, making an extra pass, finding an open guy, all we've got to do is just rely on our guys to make shots.   
  
  Q. How big was Rafer last night and how much of a catalyst was he for you guys?  
 HEDO TURKOGLU: He was huge for us. He was making good decisions and he was finding open guys. Him getting it going helped us to get going, too. Hopefully we'll do the same stuff like we did yesterday and on Sunday, too.
