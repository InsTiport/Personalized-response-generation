 ALEC BURKS (No. 12)
  UTAH JAZZ 
  
  Q. Alec Burks, your thoughts on getting drafted by the Jazz.   
 ALEC BURKS: I'm just glad to be drafted, coming from where I come from in Missouri, not a lot of people make it out. Just happy to make the Utah Jazz a stop on my journey.   
  
  Q. You were more confident than people thought; what did you know and how did this unfold that you are now playing for this team?  
 ALEC BURKS: I had a great workout, I showed my complete game, an improved jumpshot and at the Draft tonight, I saw the way the picks was going and I felt there was a chance the Utah Jazz was going to get me, and it happened.   
  
  Q. Talk about this journey, how this process has gone, all of the teams, everything that's been said; to finally be drafted in the NBA?  
 ALEC BURKS: It's been great but a grind at the same time. It's been a long month of June it seemed like. But I just worked hard. It's been a blessing. I'm just glad I finally know who I'm playing for.   
  
  Q. Have you watched any Jazz games last year and if so, what do you think of the pieces in place?  
 ALEC BURKS: I really didn't watch that much. I was a state over in Colorado, but they have good players and a good coach, so I feel like I can't wait to be a part of it.   
  
  Q. You're a slashing guard, but what do you still have to do to take it to a NBA level?  
 ALEC BURKS: I feel like it's getting better every day and more consistent than people give me credit for. I'm going to keep working hard to get to that level where my slashing game and driving game is.
