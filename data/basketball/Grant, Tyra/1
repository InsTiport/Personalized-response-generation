Iowa  Â– 82
  Penn State - 75

 THE MODERATOR: We'll go directly to questions for the student-athletes. So raise your hand and we'll get a microphone to you. 

 Q. Tyra, how is this Iowa team different than the one you played back in January?
 TYRA GRANT: They're a very competitive team. They had a bye. So they had fresher legs than we were able to have. They hit some open 3s. We just didn't execute our defensive game plan as well as we should have coming into the second half. 
 But I think we played fairly well against them in the first half. Just maybe the fatigue took a to on us, our legs going into the second half.

 Q. Alex, you played in here the state finals a few times in your life. Coming in here you had to have a good sense of the facility and how to shoot. Did it help your confidence? Because you had a pretty good shooting day. 
 ALEX BENTLEY: I think it did help my confidence a little bit being familiar with the court and familiar with the rims. So I think it was an advantage.
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions now for Coach Washington.

 Q. Coach, you just seem like you were looking for a third shooter all day. And it never happened. You had a lot of people shooting the ball. Talk about how important it was in the sense of this game to have had that third shooter and how that affected the outcome of this game?
 COACH WASHINGTON: I think it's always better when you're a little more balanced in your offensive attack. We certainly were yesterday a little bit more balanced than we were today. And certainly I think that would have helped our fortunes had we had a third scorer out there. 
 But I think, I mean, we scored 75 points. It's not so much what we did or did not do offensively as we just gave them too many points. We didn't defend as well as the second half as we did the first half. We gave them too many open 3s. And put them to the free throw line too much.
 So I think it's more a function of us not executing defensively more so than offensively.

 Q. Coach, when Iowa has a number of different scorers, how hard is it to keep track of a player like Kelly Krei?
 COACH WASHINGTON: Well, you know, Iowa's a tough team. They've got shooters that can also put the ball on the floor and get to the basket. That's what makes them really, really tough is you have to get out and guard them and then they'll put the ball on the floor and go by you. And they did that to perfection the second half. We struggled to guard them in either man or zone. 
 And I think they got into a rhythm. They got into a flow offensively. Their confidence was high. And when your confidence gets high, everybody can make shots. Everybody can make plays. And it kind of had that effect for them. They had their key people, Wahlin and Printy made some plays and Alexander made some plays, and I think that gave their entire team confidence offensively that they could make plays.

 Q. Tyra Grant, best I've seen her play in two years was today. Talk about how her on the floor talking to her teammates, keeping her everybody involved, the best defense I've seen her play in a long time today, talk about how important she has been to this program and has been for the last four years?
 COACH WASHINGTON: Her compassion and her competitiveness have been top-notch. And she did her best to will us to victory today. She would not go down quietly, and she constantly tried to pull her teammates along with us or with her, I should say. 
 Her impact on this program is incredible. She's going to go down in history as one of the statistically one of the top five players to ever wear a Lady Lion uniform. That's saying a lot because there's been a lot of great players that have come through this program. 
 So I'm just really thrilled that I've had the opportunity to coach her and I'm not surprised that she would have one of her best performances ever when the stakes were highest for her.
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.
