  Q.  Are you bracing for Shaq a little bit?   
 KEITH VAN HORN:  You know, I don't think it's going to happen so much, but, hey, you never know, and I think you obviously need to be ready for anything.   
 We're going to be -- you know, we need help on him anyways.  If guys get into foul trouble and they need me to do it, I'll go out there and try my best.   
  Q.  Talk about the difference with the Nets and the fan reaction as you sit here?   
 KEITH VAN HORN:  I think in New Jersey, it's almost like it's a suburb of New York City in way.  You know, a lot of the fans in New Jersey are Knicks fans and grew up in New York and whatnot.   
 I think here, you know, it's a city and you get great fan support from the city.  People are really into this team.  There really isn't any other team around here.   
 You know, I think that's just been the biggest difference in my eyes, when we land, when we drive around town.  It's just a little bit different feel.   
  Q.  How great is it to be back in The Finals?   
 KEITH VAN HORN:  Well, I think it's great to get The Finals, but losing in The Finals is hard.  It's a difficult thing.  You know, so to get here and get an opportunity to win it this time around feels great.
