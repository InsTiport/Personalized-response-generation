		   UDONIS HASLEM: Obviously we got a series as opposed to one game. Big stage. Everybody watching. Bright lights. Ultimate goal NBA Championship. A lot of similarities. On a whole different level and huger stakes. 

 Q. What are the mistakes that need to be cleaned up from Game 1 to Game 2? 
 UDONIS HASLEM: We had some defensive lapses that we usually don't have. We scratched -- you don't worry about the offense. We've been able to hang our hats on defense. The breakdowns we had on defense, it's not us. 

 Q. Can you elaborate specifically what they were doing. 
 UDONIS HASLEM: Getting open shots. Dirk got an open three. Certain things like that he made it tough. Contest every shot. Those situations, very uncharacteristic for us. 

 Q. It seemed like Dallas adjusted, there were three things they wanted to adjust from Game 1 to 2, offensive rebounds, more production from their bench and being able to hit the open shots. What goes into a team's success?
 UDONIS HASLEM: I don't know how much changes, we do what we do and do it for 48 minutes. We did have a 15-point lead. We were doing some things right. We just didn't sustain it for the whole game.
