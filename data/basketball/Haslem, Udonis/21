  Q. How much will that affect him putting the ball on the floor?   
 UDONIS HASLEM: You understand about those types of things. The adrenaline is going, you don't feel the pain. You just go out there. I'm not expecting him to be affected by it. I don't know. I don't really think it will affect him. I don't think it gives us an advantage. Letting everybody know the situation -- I don't think it matters at all.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).   
 UDONIS HASLEM: I think he's had a lot of shots throughout the season. Mike hasn't been totally healthy. I'm not even healthy 100% right now. We haven't had our minutes during the season. (Indiscernible).
