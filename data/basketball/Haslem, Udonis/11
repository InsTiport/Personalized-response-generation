Q.   Would you say it was one of his (LeBron) best moments?
UDONIS HASLEM:   Yeah, it was an impressive performance, coming out and knocking down those two or three big shots without actually being able to run and jump and do the things that he athletically can do. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
UDONIS HASLEM:   You know what, we don't think about it at all.   For us we're not getting excited.   We're not counting anybody out.   We understand that they're going to come with unbelievable force tomorrow and play extremely hard.   They're very well coached, and we've got our hands full tomorrow.   We understand that.

Q.   What do you think it will mean to LeBron if he finally is able to win a ring?   He's one game away obviously. 
UDONIS HASLEM:   It's a big deal for him.   When you've got a guy who's probably achieved all the individual accolades that you can probably achieve at the highest level of basketball and doesn't have a title, it's kind of like‑‑ it's just not complete, not whole.   For him, it gives him an opportunity to close another book, another chapter in his book.
