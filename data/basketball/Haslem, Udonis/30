 Q.  What did you see from Sheed yesterday? 
 UDONIS HASLEM:  I don't know, you'd have to ask Rasheed that.  If you're asking me, are they tired, how is Rasheed's ankle injury, I don't know.  I'm focused on the Miami Heat.  We were banged up last year and I don't know if anybody really cared about us.  My focus is just to go out and play basketball and help my team win. 
 Q.  Do you expect a different Pistons team tomorrow? 
 UDONIS HASLEM:  They've lost games before and they know how to react.  They're going to come back and play ten times harder, and we've got to play ten times harder. 
 Q.  Do you guys feel like you're playing with house money right now having taken Game 1? 
 UDONIS HASLEM:  No, no way.  New Jersey jumped out on us 1-0 and we came back and took four in a row.  We can't take it for granted just because we got one game here in their home that it's going to be over with, especially with this type of team.  They didn't accidentally have the best record in the league.
