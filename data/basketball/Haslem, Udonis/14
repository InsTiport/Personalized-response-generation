 Q.   What did you see, anything different from Durant and Westbrook?  
UDONIS HASLEM:   No, I mean, I think each of those guys got about 10 points in transition, which when a guy gets 10 points in transition, it kind of gets him in a good rhythm, and obviously the basket gets a little bigger and they start knocking down shots.   The biggest thing is just focusing in on getting back on defense.   
   
 Q.   There's been some panic about Dwyane Wade and his performance.   What do you say to that?  
UDONIS HASLEM:   I don't buy into that, man.   Dwyane is fine.   He's still our guy.   I don't think he played bad at all.   As a team overall, we just think we're looking to get it done.  
   
 Q.   The criticism is not that he's playing badly, it's just that he's not playing spectacularly.   
UDONIS HASLEM:   I don't know.   I don't think nothing is wrong with him at all.   I don't think he's not playing well, I don't think he's not playing how people think he should play.   It's a team effort.   There's five guys on the floor.   We don't win, we can't say it's Dwyane, you can't say it's LeBron, it's the Heat didn't win last night, simple as that.  
   
 Q.   Chris says you need to attack the rim more.   Is it that simple?  
UDONIS HASLEM:   Yeah, we've got to get some more points in the paint.   We dominated the points in the paint area, and we've got to do something about that.
