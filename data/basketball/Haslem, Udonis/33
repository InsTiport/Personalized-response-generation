Q.  Did you feel they had more intensity to start the game? 

UDONIS HASLEM:  Started out hard but we have nothing to do with their intensity.  All we can do is worry about how we come out and how intense we are and that's what we've got to focus on.

Q.  The first half and no turnovers, almost perfect it seemed like offensively. 

UDONIS HASLEM:  They are a great defensive team and when they get it going offensively, they are just that much more defense dangerous. We didn't play team defense and the things that we usually do and the things that we talked about tonight.

Q.  Do you feel good about getting a split knowing the next two-out-of-three are at home?

UDONIS HASLEM:  We wanted to win both but it's better than going home winning neither game, going home 0-2.  We got a split and we go home and move on to the next game.
