 Q.   What Finals stood out to you most as a kid?  
UDONIS HASLEM:   You know, I always look back to the Heat and the Knicks.   I'm from Miami, so just playing that back over and over in my mind obviously.   Those match‑ups, punch by Alan Houston, throwing the punch in the air after he made the shot, and Charlie Ward and PJ Brown, and those things that really stood out in my mind just from Miami, always watching the Miami teams growing up in Miami.   So those things always stand out to me.  
   
 Q.   What do you think of what's being made of LeBron and Kevin and all the story lines there?  
UDONIS HASLEM:   Oh, it's huge.   You've got to understand, these are right now the top two guys in the game, so it's going to be a huge match‑up.   The other guys can't find themselves watching.   We've got to get involved, we've got to help those guys out.   But I'm sure there are going to be points in the game where all eyes are going to be on those two guys, and I'm sure it's going to be a heck of a match‑up.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
UDONIS HASLEM:   Well, they're so versatile that they can rebound because those two guys are great rebounders off the rim and they can push it themselves and start the break.   Any time you can get a guy that can take it off the rim and start a break, that just eliminates having to make a pass, it makes it even tougher to get back.   So we're definitely going to have to have good balance, make sure our point guards don't crash the points, and we'll probably have to bring guy back to keep those guys from getting easy baskets in transition.
