 Q. Have you guys had a chance to go over what took place in the fourth quarter? What did you see? 
 UDONIS HASLEM: A couple of mistakes that are very uncharacteristic of us defensively. Offensively had a couple of missed shots. Had a couple of bad possessions. In the NBA Finals against a good team like that, you have to play as close to flawless as possible. 

 Q. Do you think the team is getting tight in the fourth? 
 UDONIS HASLEM: No, I don't think that's it at all. I think they've kind of taken us out of our rhythm offensively. Regardless of what they do, we have to continue to get stops. And also keep them off the free-throw line down the stretch, giving up easy buckets. We got them shooting 30-something percent from the field. Putting them at free-throw line. Dirk is like 90-something percent from the free-throw line. The other guys make free throws. In a close game, when both teams are defending each other the way they are in the fourth quarter, you don't want to give anybody any easy free throws. 

 Q. How tired are you guys of the wounded warrior with Dirk? 
 UDONIS HASLEM: I don't pay no mind. There ain't no warrior out there more wounded than me. You guys should feel for me. Write a story about me. 

 Q. Udonis, Game 5 alone is a must-win for both teams then? 
 UDONIS HASLEM: Every game is a must-win. Nobody wants it to go any longer than it has to go. Everybody understands how things can change so quickly. It's definitely a must-win. I think we play our best in these types of situations with our back against the wall. I'm expecting the same effort and energy and mentality coming into the next game.
