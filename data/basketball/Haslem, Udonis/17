   UDONIS HASLEM: Think about the three-point line as well. Not going to say every shot they made was bad defense on our behalf. You have to give them credit. They did knock down some tough shots. Three or four are shots at the end of the shot clock, sometimes a little demoralizing. You have to give them credit. They made shots. 

 Q. Looks like you were out here laughing and smiling and having fun. 
 UDONIS HASLEM: You can't come out here with our heads down. We have to continue to come out here and have confidence and play together, give our best effort tomorrow and let the chips fall where they may. 

 Q. It's a strange place to be. You haven't been in this position all season. 
 UDONIS HASLEM: No, we didn't expect it to be easy. Nothing has been easy for us this year. Had to work for everything. 

 Q. You guys have a great record at home this year. 
 UDONIS HASLEM: Home crowd, energy, a lot of emotion, a lot of passion. I'm expecting that again tomorrow from our guys. 

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 UDONIS HASLEM: Yeah. I do think so. We have to be tough down the stretch. We have to contest the three-point line and we have to get key possessions and rebounds.
