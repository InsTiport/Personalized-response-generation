 Q. Coach talked about having amnesia for Game 4 in terms of forgetting about the win and moving forward. 
 UDONIS HASLEM: We continue to approach every game like we're the more desperate team. Like we need to win. When we play with a desperate sense of urgency, I think that's when we're at our best. 

 Q. How important is it for you guys to get out to those early leads in these three games, having them come behind the eight ball? 
 UDONIS HASLEM: It's important to kind of get out to an early lead. Especially on the road, you kind of quiet the home crowd. We have to find a way to sustain those leads and not make it as tough on ourselves as we have made it down the stretch when we've gotten big leads. 

 Q. How badly did you want Dirk on that last possession? Since you didn't get him in Game 2. 
 UDONIS HASLEM: I'm a competitor. He's a competitor. I'm sure both of us look forward to an opportunity like that. I was just fortunate enough the shot didn't go in. He's made that shot dozens of times. An awkward shot is a good shot for him. 

 Q. Going back to November, just to be in that position, broken foot, didn't know if you were coming back till the end of the season, all of a sudden the spotlight play of The Finals at this point, how gratifying was it that you had a chance to be in that? And honestly a month or six weeks ago did you think you could be in that position? 
 UDONIS HASLEM: No, I didn't know what I would be able to give, be able to contribute. I figured I would be able to come back maybe five, ten minutes a game, some leadership, some toughness. Myself being in that position, it's been a blessing. My teammates have stayed behind me. Coaching staff is encouraging me. It's been a work in progress.
