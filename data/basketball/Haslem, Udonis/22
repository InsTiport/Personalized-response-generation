 Q. The fact you and Mike are playing on the same team for a championship together (indiscernible). 
 UDONIS HASLEM: We fell short in college. Our careers took different paths. He got drafted to Orlando. We stayed in contact throughout all that time. (Indiscernible) looked like we had an opportunity. Financially we didn't know if it was going to work out, and it did. 

 Q. There was a time this year where it didn't look like this was going to happen this year. Did you ever doubt it? Did you ever wonder if it was going to come together? 
 UDONIS HASLEM: I figured I would be back. I just didn't know when. I wanted to get back before the playoffs to get my feet wet a little bit. But now we're back now, 85%. Right now I think that's good enough to contribute and kind of help this team and give us something. 

 Q. Mike was talking about your transformation after going to Europe. I was watching '06, the replays, you've changed defense, physically -
 UDONIS HASLEM: I came to work. I lost weight going to Europe. Came back and I'm in the best shape I've been in up to that point. I continued to work. I don't think I should be complacent because of a championship. I still want to change my game, improve my body, change my habits, eating habits. (Indiscernible).

 Q. You're such a Miami guy. What do you think of the way this town has rallied around the Heat? They've embraced that "us against them" mentality.
 UDONIS HASLEM: I love this team, I love the fans, I love this challenge. I really feel like the support I got from the fans, the support I got from the team, my family really helped me to get back after going through my injury.
