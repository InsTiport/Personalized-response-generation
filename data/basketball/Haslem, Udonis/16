  UDONIS HASLEM:   51% on their home court.   We re just not giving ourselves a good chance to win the game like that.   
   
 Q.   So limiting KG isn't just about size versus him, it's about other things?   
UDONIS HASLEM:   Yeah, I mean, he had a pretty good game.   I think he had about 20 points last game too.   So the difference is they had three guys with about 20 points.   And Ray also chipped in 10.   So you can't let everybody get off.   You have to kind of take away something.   
I think last night we just gave them everything.   
   
 Q.   How strange is it to look up at the boxscore and see no free throw attempts for Dwyane?   
UDONIS HASLEM:   I really didn't know until after the game.   But we'll figure it out.   We'll figure it out.   
   
 Q.   Do you still feel like you're in the driver's seat?   
UDONIS HASLEM:   Yeah.   We're up 2‑1.   Obviously we have another opportunity to try to win another game tomorrow.   I don't feel any pressure.   We don't feel any pressure, I think.   Not time to push the panic button.   
We know why we lost, and we know what we have to do.   So it's not a big mystery.   We have to get stops.   We didn't get stops.   They shot over 50% last night.   And like I said, that's just not a good way for us to try to win games, letting them shoot high percentage like that.   
   
 Q.   UD, you've gone against size in all three rounds, but different size.   Chandler not much of a scorer, a shot‑blocker.   Hibbert, huge and long, but not necessarily as agile as KG.   How different is it this kind of size you're facing with what KG presents?   
UDONIS HASLEM:   I mean, it's really not that different, because it's not like he's pounding us in the post.   He's a jump‑shooter.   The size doesn't really play that huge of a part in it.   You know, a lot of his shots that he did make‑‑ it didn't make us like, oh, we have to get a W, we got to do this, we got to do that.   
I mean, he made open shots, and we gave him a lot of open shots.   We have to try and contest those shots and, like I said, rebound.   We can't just give him open shots like that and let him shoot 51%.   
   
 Q.   As much as you guys want Chris back, they've been wanting Ray to get healthier.   Do you see him maybe looking more spryer in the game yesterday?   He said that dunk was sort of a sign that he was feeling better.   
UDONIS HASLEM:   Yeah, I mean, he's a big part of what they do.   They need him to knock down some shots.   And yesterday he was able to do that.   
   
 Q.   Points in the paint, everybody made a big deal about the most you guys have given up all year, 58.   How much is that a black eye when you guys take a look at that stat?   
UDONIS HASLEM:   We want to defend the paint and close out shots.   We gave them everything last night.   We gave them points in the paint, we gave them perimeter jumpshots.   They beat us in the rebounding game, and they just beat us overall in the game last night.   
For us to try to win games, we can't give them all that.   
   
 Q.   UD, one of the surprises your big two had 36 free‑throws in Game 2 and only five yesterday.   Dwyane did not shoot a free throw yesterday.   How do you explain that?   
UDONIS HASLEM:   No explanation for it.   It is what it is.   We played the game the way we played the game.   We leave the calls and the free‑throws and all of that to the refs.
