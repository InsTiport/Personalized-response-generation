Q.   Do you ever see the final minutes, sort of you sense their vulnerability?   Do you feel like they're in any way vulnerable coming into this game? 
UDONIS HASLEM:   No, not at all.   Like I said, they've shown that they can do well after losses throughout these playoffs.   They're 5‑0, 6‑0, something like that, after losses in these playoffs.   We just can't come in and think, just because we're home, we're going to win the game.   We have to protect being at home.

Q.   Have you ever played with a concussion before? 
UDONIS HASLEM:   No, I never have.

Q.   You guys don't have a single guy that matches up with Hibbert size‑wise.   Has it been kind of a process of learning collectively how to deal with him? 
UDONIS HASLEM:   There's not a team in the league that matches up with him size‑wise.   We've got to take advantage of the the things we do have.   We have a quickness advantage.   I think we've got a strength advantage.   Those are the things we've got to take advantage of.

Q.   Has it been a process, though, as far as defending him?   Have you guys gotten better at cracking that code a little bit over the last two years or so? 
UDONIS HASLEM:   It's something we've got to continue to work on.   We're not going to get everything perfect.   We've got to make him work.   We can't give him nothing easy and got to contest the shots and live with the consequences and results.
