Q. You've been in this position before.   Talk about having it at home, middle three games.   What do you guys focus on?
UDONIS HASLEM:   The next game, making adjustments, making improvements.   We've got to establish the type of force that's coming in here tomorrow.   It's not time to relax.   Look at the film, try to make adjustments and get ready for an even more tough, more physical and up‑tempo game than we've already played.

Q.   The first two games you guys have started out really well, fast starts, unlike some of the other series.   What has been the difference for you guys?
UDONIS HASLEM:   We've just been getting off to good starts.   We can't say one thing.   We've just been getting off to good starts.   The key is maintaining those starts, though.   Obviously in Game 1 we weren't able to sustain that level of play for 48 minutes.   Also in Game 2 they made a push toward the end.   Even if we get off to good starts, we have to try to sustain those starts for a 48‑minute span.

Q.   The Thunder, they present obviously a big challenge.   They're going to come in here and they have started slow, they've been the opposite.
UDONIS HASLEM:   We understand what type of team we're dealing with.   We don't expect that to be the case all the time.   We understand it's a very explosive team offensively.   Defensively they can force turnovers and rebound the ball and turn them into transition points in the blink of an eye, so we understand what type of offensive team we're dealing with.   We can't expect that to be the norm every game.
