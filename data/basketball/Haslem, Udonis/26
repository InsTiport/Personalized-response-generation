 Q.  It seem ironic at all that when you guys were here in February that was kind of the low point in the season for you; that this is where it all kind of comes together and you've all come back to four games away from winning a championship? 
 UDONIS HASLEM:  You know, we probably want to thank those guys because they helped us grow up, that night, it helped us grow up a lot, real fast.  We had to get away from everybody doing our own thing.  We had to play as a team, we had to trust each other and we had to come together. 
 Q.  With the way they dominated you guys in the game and in the two games you played them, how much does that play into this Finals? 
 UDONIS HASLEM:  Nothing at all right now.  Last two teams we beat so far coming in to this point where we're at now is New Jersey and Detroit, which are teams that dominated us during the season, too. 
 We're not the same team that we were back then.  We've grown a lot since then. 
 Q.  What changed? 
 UDONIS HASLEM:  We've been through it all, suspensions, injuries, losing streaks, criticism.  Been through all that and we never pointed a finger at each other; we stuck together.
