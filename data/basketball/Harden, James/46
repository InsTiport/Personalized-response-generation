  Q. It's only been a couple hours, but what was the mood like today in practice?   
 JAMES HARDEN: Just tried to have some excitement. We had a tough one last night, but just tried to smile and just kind of tried to let it go and move on and worry about the next game.  
  
  Q. How do you bounce back from a game that's that brutal?  
 JAMES HARDEN: Just go to Dallas and play hard. We've beat them in Dallas before so we know what we have to do, just go out there and play our hearts out.  
  
  Q. Does it feel better or worse or not as bad with a night to sleep on it and just kind of get back into practice and the swing of things?  
 JAMES HARDEN: Yeah, like I said, we just came out here, laughed, had fun, put some shots up and had to regroup, and like I said, just get ready for tomorrow's game. We still have a chance.  
  
  Q. How frustrating was it for you fouling out and then having to watch what happened?  
 JAMES HARDEN: I think it was my first foul-out since I've been in this league, so it was tough, especially in that type of game. You know, I wasn't scoring the ball well, but just my defense and energy that I could have used, it was tough to watch the guys and you can't do nothing about it. But that's what it is.
