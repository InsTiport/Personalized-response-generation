Q.   Can you talk about the defensive effort in the second half last night, and what changed from the first half to the second half?
JAMES HARDEN:   That's the way we're supposed to play.   Came out kind of sluggish.   I don't know if it was being our first time we were in The Finals, but we picked it up in the second half, started being more physical, getting to the ball and getting down in transition and getting a lot of easy baskets in transition.

Q.   Ball movement a key in the second half, as well?
JAMES HARDEN:   Oh, definitely.   Ball movement has been a key throughout this entire postseason, moving the ball, getting our bigs involved, guys knocking down shots, just having confidence and trust in one another to make plays, and we did a phenomenal job last night.

Q.   Talk about Kevin's fourth quarter performance.   He lit it up again. 
JAMES HARDEN:   Usual.   Kevin is being Kevin, scoring, putting us on our back and really taking the game over, making shots, doing a pretty good job on LeBron, and just impacting the game, which he knows how to do. 

Q.   What's the expectation for tomorrow? 
JAMES HARDEN:   Just to do the same thing we did last game.   Obviously the slow start kind of messed us up a little bit, but just play Thunder basketball defensively and offensively, just attack and make the right play every time.
