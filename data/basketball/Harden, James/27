 Q.   James, they did a really effective job in Game 3 of preventing you from getting to the basket.   In your mind what was different early on tonight in terms of you establishing a rhythm offensively?   
JAMES HARDEN:   Combination of just moving my body, setting screens, cutting, coming off when I got an opportunity, coming off hard to attack, and ultimately just being aggressive, taking my shot when I had it, and mixing it up.   
   
 Q.   What was the key to y'all getting off to such a good start, and how big was that after the last game?   
JAMES HARDEN:   Defense.   You know, we got stops.   Early in the game, we got off to a big lead because we were defending.   Second quarter we let up a little bit.   We gave them 37 points, I think, in the second quarter, which is too many.   Luckily we were up in that first quarter pretty big, but we've got to sustain four quarters of really good defense against this team.  
   
 Q.   Coach McHale said if he told you you were frustrated all about the last game to take it out on the Warriors tonight.   Was there any of that going on tonight with how aggressive you were being?  
JAMES HARDEN:   I mean, that's how it always is.   I always want to take it out on my opponent in a good way.   Just being aggressive, like I said, taking shots, getting to the basket, not really forcing anything and allowing the game to come to me.   
   
 Q.   You said in that last series after you guys won here in Game 5 that that could have been a game changer.   Does this feel kind of the same way or are we still way too early for that?  
JAMES HARDEN:   Right now our mindset is take one game at a time.   One game at a time obviously is going to be in a hostile environment, but we've been there twice and we've had opportunities to win Game 1 and Game 2.   We've got to play the same way.   Obviously they're going to make a run.   They're a really good team, a really good shooting team.   The faster we can snap out of it and not allow them to get 11‑ or 12‑point runs, we'll put ourselves in a good position to win the game.  
   
 Q.   The Rockets start off well when you start distributing.   Can you talk a little bit about Josh Smith's play in the first quarter?  
JAMES HARDEN:   Man, he started it off for us, knocking down shots, being aggressive.   That's what we need.   We need our 4 man, Josh and TJ, to be aggressive and attack the basket.   He kind of got it going for us, and then the other guys kind of picked it up.
