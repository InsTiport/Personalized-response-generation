Q.   The shooting in the previous games, did that affect your confidence in last night's game?
JAMES HARDEN:   No.   Yesterday I had a great practice where I shot the ball very well.   Pregame I shot the ball very well.   Like I said, my mechanics and everything looks good, feels good.   Even when I shot the ball last night, a couple threes and it rattled in and out, I think one hit the back rim, they felt good, they just didn't go in.

Q.   How did that feel different from Game 2 when you were shooting really well?
JAMES HARDEN:   Same thing.   Same looks I got in Game 2, I had them here, I just didn't make them.

Q.   Frustrating for a shooter because you know you can shoot?
JAMES HARDEN:   Yeah, I have a lot of confidence in my shot.   Just by talking and putting the work in every single day.   It's definitely frustrating when those shots get open and don't go in, but you've got to continue to play.   Especially for a player like me, I rely on more than just shooting, on just scoring the basketball.   Obviously that aspect of my game has to be picked up in order for us to win games.
