 Q.   How is the season so far?  
JAMES HARDEN:   First part of the season is pretty good.   We're in the playoff hunt.   The games after the break will be very crucial.   
   
 Q.   Are you feeling better?   
JAMES HARDEN:   A lot.   I can move a lot better.   Hopefully with the ice and the treatment and massage it will get better.  
   
 Q.   What's it like having this in the city where you're playing?  
JAMES HARDEN:   It's great.   Especially this being my first home.   It makes it that much more special.   I'm enjoying it and having fun with it.  
   
 Q.   Is it a sign with you and Chandler and Jeremy, a sign of things to come for the Rockets, being in this?  
JAMES HARDEN:   Yes, definitely.   We're a young team, we're all new to the situation, all of us never really started before, and basically the whole entire season together.   We're just going with it.   We've been talking each other through it.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible).   
JAMES HARDEN:   Smiles, jokes, memories, all of the above.   We're just having a good time.  
   
 Q.   When you first got that call that you were going to be in your first Allâ€‘Star Game, what was that like for you?  
JAMES HARDEN:   I just went crazy.   Just to hear my name called, I saw it on the TV, as well, it was a great accomplishment.
