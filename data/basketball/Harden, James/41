  JAMES HARDEN:   We're preparing and getting our bodies healthy and making sure we're ready for Miami.   I think we're ready.   We're excited to play tomorrow, just to get back on the court and ready to get it going. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JAMES HARDEN:   Yeah, that team is very talented.   I think that's why we're both in The Finals.   I think their team is very good.
Kevin and Russell are getting most of the attention, but you've got Serge over here, Perk, these guys, Fisher, who's been there.   We've got a lot of good guys who have been in situations like this and are ready for it.

Q.   You mentioned you have a couple of guys who have been here before, but they were here last year.   Is that an advantage for them?
JAMES HARDEN:   It's still basketball.   We've been through so much, the Mavericks, and then playing the Lakers and playing the best offensive team in basketball in the Spurs.   I think we've prepared ourselves to be in this situation and to play well.   We're ready for tomorrow.
