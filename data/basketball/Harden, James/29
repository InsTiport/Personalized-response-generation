Warriors   110
  Rockets - 106

Q.   James, how did you handle tonight in terms of initially maybe the first two quarters, kind of a point guard situation kind of getting everybody involved and then turning it on in the third and fourth.   Was that because Dwight was out?
JAMES HARDEN:   That's just kind of my game, kind of getting a feel for the game.   It's Game 1 so just kind of getting a feel for it and just making the right passes, easy passes, taking my shot and taking lanes when I had opportunities. 

Q.   James, how did it change so greatly in that second quarter after you guys were up 16, and also, how difficult was it to sort of regroup knowing Dwight wouldn't be right or wouldn't be back?
JAMES HARDEN:   Yeah, that was on us in that second quarter.   I think the first quarter we did a really good job defensively.   Offensively we made it easy, we shared the basketball.   Second quarter they went on a run.   You can't give a really good shooting team easy lay‑ups, confidence, and that's what we did in that second quarter.   We turned the basketball over.   That was definitely on us. 
I mean, I didn't even remember that Dwight had got injured.   I was just so focused on the game and trying to rally the guys together.   But hopefully he's all right. 

Q.   You always want to be a playmaker, but in that fourth quarter did you just try to say, you know what, I've just got to take this game over in some fashion?
JAMES HARDEN:   Yeah, just get to the rim, be aggressive.   They went really small, really small, and so the rim was basically wide open, so I just tried to attack and see opportunities and just be aggressive. 

Q.   What are the challenges in terms of letting this one go?   You guys had a great opportunity and couldn't finish it off.   How do you let that go?
JAMES HARDEN:   I mean, we've done a great job of letting games go.   It's all about Game 2 now.   Game 1 slipped away from us.   We had several opportunities to win the game, didn't happen, and so I think we'll look at some film, we'll go out there and correct some things basically that was on us, and just be better in Game 2.
