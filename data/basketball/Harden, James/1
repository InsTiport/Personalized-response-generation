 Q. Hey, James, how's it going?  Obviously, a big part of tonight for the NBA was putting a focus on HBCUs.  Just wanted to know what's your knowledge of these universities growing up, and just how your knowledge of them has evolved over the years and what value they bring to the community?
 JAMES HARDEN:   My knowledge of them growing up wasn't very high, but over the years, just the culture that they embrace in that they don't really get a lot of recognition.  So it's great that the NBA and the world is kind of getting to know them a little bit more and what they stand for and the great things they're doing in their own communities.
 Q. James, I know it wasn't a typical All-Star experience you're used to as far as the whole weekend, but how was it to get back on the court with the All-Star level guys, and how did you enjoy your experience tonight?
 JAMES HARDEN:   It's great.  Obviously, some of the best talent in the world.  Getting the opportunity to share a court with them and have fun.  The shot-making is obviously elite, ball-handling talent.  So, it felt great.  Kind of a little upset we didn't come away with the win, but those guys got hot, and they made some big-time shots.
 Q. James, there are reports out that Blake Griffin has agreed to sign with the Nets.  What do you think he could add to your team?
 JAMES HARDEN:   Is it official?
 Q. I mean, the reports are everywhere that he's agreed, that it's done.
 JAMES HARDEN:   I can speak on that more once it's official.
 Q. James, I'm going to follow up on that.  I'm just saying that I've had it totally confirmed to me that he's agreed to come to the Nets from a really good source.  I mean, a top NBA source.  I hate to do this to you, but it's certain.  I'm absolutely certain he's joining you.
 JAMES HARDEN:   All right.  You got me.  Yeah, I'm sure he wants to win.  If he passed up more money to obviously stay in Detroit, he wants to win, and he wants to have an opportunity to play meaningful minutes.  I'm assuming that's one of the reasons why he came.
 Obviously, we know the athletic and high-jumping Blake, but I think as of these last couple years, he's knocking down the three ball a little bit better, ball handling is a lot better, and he can be a great contribution to this team.  So, if your sources are correct, then we'd be more than welcome and excited to have him on our Brooklyn Nets team.
