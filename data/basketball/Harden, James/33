 WEST   163
  EAST - 158  
 Q.   James, you looked like you were looking for your shot right off the start.   Were you able to kind of get in a rhythm?   And how do you feel offensively about what you were able to do?   
JAMES HARDEN:   I think I played pretty well.   Guys were looking for each other.   There's a lot of guys that's unselfish in the West.   
It was a pretty good game.   I think we shared the ball really well.   I just got some shots to fall tonight.   
   
 Q.   Anything extra special to be out there again with KD and Russ?   
JAMES HARDEN:   It's always special.   Those are my brothers.   Whenever we're on the court together, we just have fun.   We know how to play with each other.   And we just enjoy each other's company.   It was pretty cool to be out there with those two especially at MSG.   
   
 Q.   Were you aware that you were close to a triple‑double?   And were you guys aware how close Russell was to breaking Wilt's record?   
JAMES HARDEN:   No, we had no idea.   We were trying to go out there and win the game.   It's all about bragging rights for the West.   And so we just try to go out there and play hard enough in the fourth quarter and come out with the victory.   
   
 Q.   Now you have a new role in a team.   You are the leader and you have to share that role with a center.   Now what is your next step in order to take your team to the next level?   
JAMES HARDEN:   I think for me just playing at the level that I'm playing at right now.   Being a leader vocally and going out this and showing how hard I can play on both ends of the floor, and just doing what I've been doing.
