Q.   What does it mean to play in this game?
JAMES HARDEN:   It means a lot.   Since a kid watching the All‑Star Game, watching Kobe, and now just to have the opportunity to start, it's a great honor. 

Q.   To have the Rockets back in contention again, what's that like?
JAMES HARDEN:   We're doing something special in Houston.   It's going to take some time, but people are starting to recognize now that me and Dwight are the leaders. 
And we have to set an example, so we're fit and ready for it.

Q.   How far away are you?
JAMES HARDEN:   To be honest, I'm not sure.   We're feeling pretty good about ourselves.   We're on a winning streak right now.   And it may take us another step or two, but we're going to play hard and we're going to figure it out as soon as possible. 
Second half of the season is when the teams start to place themselves for the playoffs, and we got to make sure we put ourselves in a good position.

Q.   How long did it take for you and Dwight to really mesh both on and off the court?   Was that right away?
JAMES HARDEN:   Yeah, yeah.   He's a very likeable guy.   On the court, I'm a very likeable guy, give the ball up.

Q.   Not off the court?
JAMES HARDEN:   (Laughter.)   No, we're just trying to make it work.   Something's got to give.   So we're‑‑ we work with each other to make it work somehow, some way.
