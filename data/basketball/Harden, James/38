Q.   Can you talk about Shane Battier's role for them. 
JAMES HARDEN:   Well, he's very active on the defensive end, very good three‑point shooter.   He's made an impact, especially in these first three games, of knocking down threes. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JAMES HARDEN:   Oh, he's been solid.   Like I said, he's active on defense.   He can guard positions one through four.   He even guards Perk.   Very good player. 

Q.   How much do you think winning is a process, and the fact that they went to The Finals and lost last year, maybe they learned a lot of little things that you guys are now learning by being in The Finals for the first time?
JAMES HARDEN:   I don't know.   All I know is that we had an opportunity to win a game yesterday, or last night.   A couple mistakes, a couple missed free throws, not necessarily turnovers, but a couple possessions, we fouled two three‑point shooters, and it's a different ballgame.   They made six free throws and we missed six free throws in that time span, so that's a 12‑point difference, and that's the game right there. 

Q.   It was a great series with the Spurs.   Are you a little disappointed in your outing so far?
JAMES HARDEN:   Not at all.   I'm not just a scorer.   Obviously I had six assists, six rebounds, pretty good defense.   That's what my role is, not just scoring the basketball.   Whatever it takes to help us win, guarding LeBron in the fourth quarter, and trying to find ways to impact the game, not just scoring.
