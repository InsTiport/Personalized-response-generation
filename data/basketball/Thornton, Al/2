 Q. Obviously a pick from a different Florida school.  Tell us how you feel about competing on the next level and when you decided that you were an NBA-ready player? 
 AL THORNTON:  I feel very confident about my abilities.  I feel I can come in and play right away.  I've been in school for four and a half years under a great coaching staff that had experience in the NBA. 
 I think that I'll be able to contribute right away. 

 Q.  Your cross-state rival Corey Brewer is going to be freezing up in Minnesota.  How fortunate do you feel to be in the balmy climes of southern California being a Florida guy? 
 AL THORNTON:  Oh, man, there's going to be no change.  I think I'm kind of used to that weather and I think it will be a great fit. 

 Q.  Are you going to tease Corey if you see him in the green room after this? 
 AL THORNTON:  Definitely. 

 Q.  At what point did you think that the Clippers were a really legitimate possibility to take you, or were you looking at other teams?  What kind of feedback were you getting? 
 AL THORNTON:  You know what, I really didn't know.  I thought I was between the 7 and 12 range, but sometime you never know.  You never know with the Draft. 
 Like I said, I think the Clippers, they are a great fit for me.  They have an open offense and they have some veterans and they have some young players and they are an up-tempo team and I think that's a great fit to showcase my skills. 

 Q.  You're going out to the Clippers and arguably they were a team last year that was in the playoffs maybe a player away; are you that player? 
 AL THORNTON:  I think I can be.  We'll see.
