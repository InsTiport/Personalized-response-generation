 Q. What are your thoughts about All-Star weekend? I know it is early. 
 AL THORNTON: I'm enjoying it so far. I was able to get out with some of my fellow teammates. I'm just soaking it all in. Can't wait for the game to kick off. 

 Q. What is it like to be playing on a team with guys your age that you have been playing with pretty much your entire career? 
 AL THORNTON: I have no response. It is something that I know we'll never forget. We all want to come back and hopefully be All-Stars. Try to soak it in and enjoy it.

 Q. How good does it feel? 
 AL THORNTON: It feels great to be here. I felt I should have been here last year. I guess I had to get better. It feels good. 
 It feels good to be here.
