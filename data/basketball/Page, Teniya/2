Penn State - 83, Illinois - 57
Q. You reset your own Big Ten Tournament scoring record.  What is it about the tournament that you play so well?
TENIYA PAGE: I don't know what it is, but I know my teammates have a lot of confidence in me, so that's kind of the reason why I keep shooting, and they motivated me throughout the game and before the game and after the game.  That's pretty much it.
Q. Does playing in this tournament atmosphere, does that get you more excited or kind of hyped up for the game?
TENIYA PAGE: It does.  Win or go home, so I think everyone's competitive spirit is really high.  For me personally, knowing that it's win or go home, I think I'm a little bit more focused.
Q. This being the 25th Big Ten Tournament, what does it mean to be a part of this milestone to you?
TENIYA PAGE: To know it's been around for 25 years and to be able to consistently play in the Big Ten Tournament, and I'm just a junior, so I'm happy to be afforded this opportunity.
