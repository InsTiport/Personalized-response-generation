<p>	Q.  Are you disturbed by what happened at North Carolina and the eventual ouster of Coach Doherty? </p>
<p>	Q.  All of the above. </p>

<p>	Q.  With the academic reforms, is the goal to get coaches to recruit athletes who are better prepared to get through college academically? </p>
<p>	Q.  Student athlete opportunity fund, in some ways that's being portrayed as a step towards "pay for play."  I'm wondering if you could address that, how will that fund be administered or distributed?  The other thing we're hearing is competitive equity, who is going to get more, who is going to get less.  Could you talk about your hopes for that? </p>

<p>	Q.  Your friend Professor Sperber said that while he was impressed with some of the things you did at Indianapolis, he said, "Don't look for a lot of major reforms because your an establishment figure."  How do you react to that?  Should we look for major reforms under your tenure?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was hoping to get your thoughts on the appropriate relationship between beer companies in terms of sports marketing and college sports in general?  Certainly there are some who feel there should be a severance, a total break in that relationship.  What are your views and do you see the NCAA taking any role or looking into that? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said earlier there should be opportunity for both men and women proportionate to their interests.  It's my understanding that that's not how opportunity is gauged at this point.  Is that something you're interested in pursuing?  If so, how do you propose to gauge interest? </p>
<p>	Q.  At each of the NCAA basketball games I've attended, prior to the tip-off, they read a statement attributed to you, your name is mentioned.  Would you clarify whether you or the NCAA is endorsing or is supporting our fighting men and women?  Since many of the 360,000 athletes oppose the war and also feel great concern for victims who are non-American, innocent victims, might you consider altering this statement that will be read in Atlanta and here? </p>
<p>	Q.  Back on the question about beer ads.  What is your attitude about institutions that sell beer and wine at their athletic events on campus? </p>


<p>	Q.  Tom Osborne recently introduced legislation in the House regarding a new betting ban bill in Nevada.  I want to get your thoughts on that.  Also if you would clarify your position from the NCAA's standpoint on trying to eliminate legalized sports betting on college events in the state of Nevada?  Given the recent information about a Florida State football player betting online on his own games, do you feel that's an area that really is more of concern in the long run to the NCAA rather than legalized betting? </p>

<p>	Q.  In light of the recent academic fraud scandals, is there any concern that by giving rewards or punishments, based on graduation rates, that it could put more pressure on coaches and almost encourage coaches to take shortcuts or you could see an increase in academic fraud that way? </p>
<p>	Q.  At the end of the year, certainly the end of the basketball season, we had a number of schools that were self-reporting violations, taking early action on themselves.  In your position now, is that something where you're applauding that action or are you concerned it has to be taken even in the first place?  Second part of that question is a number of CEOs have stepped in and taken some action, but also some CEOs have been involved on the athletic side in actions they should not have.  What is your concern there? </p>
<p>	Q.  As a devil's advocate to your semi-endorsement of the Georgia and Fresno situations, isn't it also factual that those two presidents were responsible essentially for the hiring of people who had had a great deal of difficulty with NCAA regulations at their previous school, and particularly Dr.  Adams and his relationship with Jim Harrick who had been in trouble every place he'd ever been? </p>

<p>	Q.  I think it's 42. </p>
<p>	Q.  Your response to the presidential response to academic fraud, you had said it is not easy to stand up and be counted, and you applaud those presidents for doing so.  My question is, when you are the president of a university and the CEO, why should it be difficult to stand up and be counted?  Does that not raise any concern about what's going on in college sports? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just address how the tournament has gone so far, how do you think this year in particular has been a success, whether it's gotten better?</p>

<p>	Q.  Talking to some of the players during this tournament, they're very impressed with the opportunity to play in a great tournament, but they also are impressed with the commercialism that surrounds with this event.  They keep sort of over  -- I keep hearing louder and louder of players saying, "Are we getting our fair share?"  I'm wondering, getting back to the opportunity fund, is that a way to sort of quiet those voices somehow without actually having to pay everyone who participates?  I'm sort of asking this in the context of the T-shirt sales, $100 million to the New Orleans economy coming in. </p>
<p>	Q.  We've been seeing these public service announcements running through the games making the point that you just did, about athletes, how they're going to be professionals, go on to great glory.  Yet at the same time I've been getting e-mails every other day announcing a new corporate partner program, companies like Cingular and Coke have been aggressive about marketing their ties to the NCAA during this tournament.  Do you see any irony between those two messages, any disconnect? </p>

<p>	Q.  I was speaking today with Todd Turner, I believe the chair of the incentive, disincentive committee.  I asked him, "Is there a danger that you can try to create a rule that is supposed to fit all, to fit a square peg into a round hole, that you are discussing institutions, urban institutions, which may have overall graduation rates in the 20 and 30%, up to private schools that are over 90%?"  How are they moving in that direction? </p>

<p>	Q.  In your time as president of the NCAA, perhaps before, what is your take on the attitude of the school presidents towards the establishment of a I-A football playoff? </p>
