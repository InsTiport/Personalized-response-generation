<p>	Q.  Chauncey, can you tell me where this team gets its mental toughness from, because it's really hard to come back after this game you lost in Detroit and play the way you played tonight. </p>
<p>	Q.  Just to follow-up on that, can you talk about the satisfaction of doing it tonight, it was a must-win situation, and this team has come through in must-win situations before; can you just talk about the satisfaction of forcing this Game 7 ? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you also talk about forcing a Game 7 , what that means? </p>
<p>	Q.  I know you guys didn't blame Rasheed for the Game 5 loss but he told us this morning that he felt responsible for that.  Can you talk about what he went through the last couple of days and how he personally reacts when he feels he has not done well and how he wanted to come out tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about how emotional he was tonight and how involved he was even when he wasn't on the board?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ginobili had five turnovers tonight, you had none.  Can you talk about what you're doing to protect the ball so well? </p>
<p>	Q.  Chauncey, were you at all surprised that Tim Duncan did not get any touches in the last few minutes and did you think Manu was forcing a little bit at the end?</p>
<p>	Q.  You often talk about picking your spots with your shots, how much of that space on the score board and the emotion that can sway the Game one way or the other by hitting one? </p>
