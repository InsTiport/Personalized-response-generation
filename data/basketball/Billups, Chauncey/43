<p>	Q. Can you just talk about Rasheed?  Did you look at this coming in as a match-up that you could make exploit the way he did?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just talk about -- have you guys received, in your mind, the respect that a champion should receive, and what does this win against a team who hasn't lost in the playoffs on the road say?</p>
<p>	Q.  And the win?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the defensive effort you did on Wade. </p>
<p>	Q.  What does that say for your team to come in here and snatch Game 1 when Miami is favored?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about Tayshaun defending Dwyane Wade.  What did you see in Dwyane that showed maybe his frustration building a little bit throughout the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  You alluded to the fact that Miami had a lot more rest than you guys did, so therefore, do you feel in an indirect sense that that obviously worked to your favor because you were able to just put the other series behind you much quicker?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the poise you guys showed down the stretch to hold them off. </p>
