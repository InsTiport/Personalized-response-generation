<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the morale of the team after Game  2 and the way you responded tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys controlled pretty much the majority of the minutes in the three games this series.  Do you guys feel like you guys are the better team thus far?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the big guys, Wallace and Wallace, and the job they are doing in causing that kind of confusion for Shaq and some of the other players up front for the Lakers.</p>
<p>	Q.  You seem to be striking a balance now between when to shoot and when to pass.  Do you feel like you're in your groove that way now as a point guard? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Brown said he was not happy with the number of assists you guys dished out on the first half.  What did he tell you at the half?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the challenge the next two games, knowing if you can do it here possibly?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've been around the league, you've had a lot of coaches, Pitino, a big crew, you guys are in unbelievable shape.  What did Larry Brown do differently throughout the season that other coaches didn't do?</p>
<p>	Q.  I wanted to ask you about Tayshaun Prince, a young guy playing against Kobe Bryant, a guy he admits was his idol.  Do the veteran players talk to him about settling him down or do you just come to this Finals with a mature attitude?</p>
