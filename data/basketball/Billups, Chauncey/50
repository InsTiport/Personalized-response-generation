<p>	Q.  How important was it to control the tempo of the game in Game  1 and how integral will it be to keep that for Game  2?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you expect to have a big change from them for Game  2 on that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ben Wallace said you and Rip have been essential in regard to team defense by making the opposition play the entire court.  How much pride do you take in that?</p>
<p>	Q.  How has playing the point for Larry different from some of the various coaches that you've played for over the years? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is it uncomfortable at all? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about just how it feels to dominate a Hall of Famer like Gary Payton the way you did last night or would you expect he'll come out extra fired up tomorrow?</p>
<p>	Q.  Early when Shaquille and Kobe and Phil were in here, they were saying that what happened last night was more them, not doing certain things and you all maybe taking them out of their sets and making them a little uncomfortable, could you address that because that seems to be their mantra through the whole post-season whenever they have fallen behind, and how does that make you feel in terms of maybe not getting the just due in earning the victory last night?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much of a mentor has Joe Dumars been for you, and also, how much of your game is just straight out patterned after Joe's game? </p>
