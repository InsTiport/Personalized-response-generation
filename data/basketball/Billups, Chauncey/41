<p>	Q. Shaq, he's been getting away with a lot of stuff.  What do you guys have to do to kind of neutralize him?</p>


<p>	Q.  Why was this different from being down in 2-1 in Miami to being down 2-1 to Indiana or New Jersey?</p>


<p>	Q.  Is your confidence bruised after losing last night?</p>
<p>	Q.  This situation, going back a few years, you guys were at your best when your backs were against the wall, so to speak, and maybe you guys don't play well when you have things going well in a series or whatever. </p>
<p>	Q.  You guys are known for your defense.  What broke down defensively last night to allow them to get 113 points?</p>
<p>	Q.  Should Miami gain any confidence from the fact that they were able to frustrate you guys and you did kind of lose your cool at times?</p>
<p>	Q.  Hasn't it been a mark of this team that you guys have been able to keep cool and stay poised under pressure?</p>
