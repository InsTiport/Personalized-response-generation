<p>	Q. When this series started, these were two defensive-based teams, people thought the games would be played pretty close to the vest, and all three of them have kind of blown up in the fourth quarter.  Do you have a theory or an explanation why that may be happening? </p>
<p>	Q.  Antonio McDyess was giving you credit as being one of the guys that helped kind of talk him into coming out here and playing again.  Knowing that he was so close to quitting, how tough was it to kind of help convince him and how glad are you now that he finally could take that offer to come here? </p>
<p>	Q.  Has he always had that positive attitude?  The other day he was saying that had he not been injured, he would still be an All-Star, but he could not be playing for a championship.  So he can always find the good in everything. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you breathe a bit easier today now that you've finally got the kind of game out of the way that you guys know you're capable of playing? </p>
<p>	Q.  The way the point guard position has evolved over the years, how do you describe the way you approach it, the way you do it?  And how do you balance the things that you do with some of the responsibilities that haven't changed? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you still have to do, particularly last night, things that steady your team, especially offensively, keep things organized? </p>
<p>	Q.  You're the type of point guard that against whom generally Tony Parker has problems, how would you rate your head-to-head so far in these Finals?  I would say it's pretty even, but I would like to have your opinion. </p>
<p>	Q.  Would you say that he has improved defensively compared to the previous seasons? </p>
<p>	Q.  There's so many potential emotional ups-and-downs in the course of the playoffs, how much that's Rasheed's personality, sense of humor helped you guys avoid those?</p>
