<p>	Q. I was wondering if you could just talk about personally how maybe this Finals is different from last year and how much experience did you gain from last year?  Do you feel maybe more relaxed just having it under your belt from last year? </p>
<p>	Q.  I was talking to your mother and she said that last year, I guess you wanted like a hamburger every day, can you talk about that and do you have any superstitions? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk a little about Rasheed Wallace and the enigma that he is.  Is he as hard to read as what he seems?</p>
<p>	Q.  Why do you think that is?  Why won't he allow everyone else to see this other side?</p>
<p>	Q.  How important have Lindsey and Dyess been in getting you guys back in this series?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know we're at the halfway point, but if you had to vote for the MVP right now, who would that be and why? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think the day will ever come where a defensive specialist like him will get anything close to the attention, the adoration, and more importantly, the pay, that the glorious scorers get? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there any easy way to explain how you get two really good teams but you end up with four games with a lot of lopsided final scores, and do you think that hurts the interest in The Finals at all? </p>
<p>	Q.  We're here at the NBA Finals, but the talk of labor issues is also in the air.  How optimistic are you as a player that there won't be a lockout? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just talk about your growth as a point guard under Coach Brown, and how was it when he first came here last season?  Was it frustrating?  Can you talk about some of the specific ways you think you've grown and some of the frustrations and emotions that went into getting there. </p>
