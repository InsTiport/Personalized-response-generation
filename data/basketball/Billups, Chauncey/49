<p>	Q.  The shot Kobe hit, did it take a lot out of the team, and especially going into the overtime? </p>
<p>	Q.  Rip, on the shot by Kobe, did you feel like you were guarding about as well as you could in you looked like you were right up on him there. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think it changed the flow of the game when Campbell got his third foul in the first half? </p>
<p>	Q.  Rip, when Kobe was dribbling the ball, that's a time that the foul could have been done immediately, and that's just a two-shot foul?  And Chauncey, the last shot at the end, right before that play, could have been better, could have gone farther, deeper in. </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you feel a foul? </p>
<p>	Q.  Rip, what about when he was dribbling the ball? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just talk about the advantage that you guys feel you have in the backcourt in terms of both of you had big scoring nights tonight.  </p>
<p>	Q.  Guys, after all of the hoopla, the series is tied 1-1, you guys go home for three, how confident are you guys going back home? </p>
<p>	Q.  While you were standing right outside, Kobe made mention to the shot he hit to beat your team in high school, could you comment on that briefly and on your gamesmanship with him in this series.  </p>
<p>	Q.  How do you come away from these two games?  Do you feel like the Lakers had to kind of scramble just to get a split or do you feel as though your chance to really seize control of this series slipped away? </p>
