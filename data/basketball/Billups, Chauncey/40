<p>	Q. Chauncey, talk about the first half.  You guys came out, 17 assists, no turnovers, you seemed to handle the adversity of the 2-1 deficit flawlessly. </p>
<p>	Q.  It's unusual for a guy to play nine minutes and get two standing ovations from his teammates when he comes off the court; would you comment on Elden Campbell's role for that? </p>
<p>	Q.  With all of the talk about your coach and Cleveland and all that, what does it say about this team that that didn't seem to be a factor at all tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  Your offense seemed much better today, on penetration modes you guys were getting to the basket almost every time. </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about you guys going into the fourth quarter, they had made a run at you and cut the lead in the third quarter. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about your long-range shooting from the 3-point range and also your floor game.  You had seven assists, no turnovers and the Pistons as a whole had 27 assists on 57 baskets. </p>
