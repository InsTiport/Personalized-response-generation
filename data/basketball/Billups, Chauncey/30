<p>	Q. Is it starting to look a lot like last year with you guys dominating at home and with the way you're playing, who knows, you could be heading for another Playoff MVP?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are you seeing any similarities to the way last year you were dominating at home?</p>
<p>	Q.  How were you able to pressure them so effectively all over the court tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  Was there something specific in the first quarter where you forced seven turnovers against them tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  These are two evenly matched teams and the four games have been very decisive, why do you think when one team gets it going the other team doesn't seem to be able to do anything about it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there anything specifically that you're doing differently to guard Ginobili as a team? </p>
<p>	Q.  There's something you heard around the league this year, people would say, when the Pistons lock in on you defensively, they are really hard to score against you.  What does that mean, "lock in on you defensively"?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you feel that when you're locking in, can you actually feel that?</p>
<p>	Q.  After getting punched in the mouth a couple of times in San Antonio, does it feel pretty good to punch back and land a couple of these?</p>
