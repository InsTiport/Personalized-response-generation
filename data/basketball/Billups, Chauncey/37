<p>	Q. Chauncey, can you just talk about what it was like, being on the line, making those two free throws what was going on through your mind at that time and the end result that came from that. </p>
<p>	Q.  Just talk about what it is about you guys that enables you to get so many contributions from so many different players and how tough it is for the opposing teams. </p>
<p>	Q.  The contributions from so many players. </p>
<p>	Q.  Dwyane obviously had a big third quarter, 12 points, but his 20 points in a game ties it at 60 when he doesn't score any more, did you change anything?</p>
<p>	Q.  Your whole season really came down to the last few minutes of this game, how validating is this for you guys?  And No. 2, do you think your experience in these situations will kick in during those last few minutes?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you reflect on the whole season, all of the ups and downs of the season.  And also, second question, can you just talk about the Spurs. </p>
<p>	Q.  And the Spurs? </p>
<p>	Q.  Rasheed has had all sorts of foul trouble in the series and he had foul trouble in this game as well, but when it was on the line and you guys needed him, he was there to make big plays.  Can you just discuss his resiliency. </p>
<p>	Q.  Did winning this game on their court give you a boost in confidence to go to San Antonio, and thoughts about Bruce Bowen as a defender and do you think it's possible that he might end up on you some in the series at some point, you and Rip both? </p>
<p>	Q.  Dwyane didn't look to be 100% tonight, what did you guys see from him as far as his explosion and everything like that and what was your strategy, if any? </p>
<p>	Q.  Because of everything that you've gone through this season, the scene in the locker room, was that even more satisfying to you this year because of everything? </p>
<p>	Q.  What were you guys doing in the locker room?  Antonio was saying hugging and shouting, he was just taking it all in, what were you doing? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about what you learned from the Finals last year that you personally will bring back this time around?  And also, I wanted to see what you thought about your nickname, Mr. Big Shot? </p>
