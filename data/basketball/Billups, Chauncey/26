<p>	Q.  Can you just talk about in each of the last two Finals, your ability just to step up, you were the MVP last year and could be again this year, you raised your scoring average three points from the regular season, can you talk about that? </p>
<p>	Q.  No team that has advanced to The Finals has ever lost its last two home games, and they have been so fantastic here at home all season, do you think that the pressure to win might be a little bit more on them than you all? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think it started to show a little bit last night with Tim Duncan missing free throws, etc., turnovers in the last quarter? </p>
<p>	Q.  In these types of situations, you've always been able to -- it seems been able to kind of slow down the moment and just focus and play.  Can you tell us what that's like for you and what kind of joy you get out of playing these kinds of do-or-die situations? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you put out of your mind the ramifications, where this will put you in terms of NBA history and all that other kind of tough? </p>
<p>	Q.  Derek Jeter of the Yankees and Tom Brady of the Patriots always come up big in the post season and make others big around them, how do you compare to guys like Jeter, Brady? </p>
<p>	Q.  By now it's certainly well established that you guys are a really resilient team and you've been asked about this, but you've had more happen to you this season than a normal team would have in about 10 years and you're 23-18 mid-season, was there a point where you were getting a little concerned? </p>
<p>	Q.  Chauncey, you've played roughly a couple hundred games for Larry Brown.  A, how would you define him, and B, if, in fact, for whatever reason it's over after tomorrow night, how will you remember him? </p>
