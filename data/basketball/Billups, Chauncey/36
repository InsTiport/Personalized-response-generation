<p>	Q. How does Rasheed make a difference on this team and can you give an example of something that he has said or has done during the playoff that has made a difference for you guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can he be too unselfish? </p>
<p>	Q.  Even though the first one is supposed to be the best one, would winning this year be even better, just considering everything you guys had to go through this season with Coach's illness and everything? </p>
<p>	Q.  Just want to ask you, you guys talk about the inherent toughness you had, would you compare it to how you were last year and this type of toughness, how much tougher you have to get to go through the season and get through the rest of the stuff?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned a lot of things about Rasheed and being selfless and stuff and a lot of those same things can be said about you, you're a scorer who has to play point guard and distributing the ball and you picked your spots in the last series to shoot, can you talk about the balance that you constantly have?  A lot of times you pass up shots and you could score more and maybe make the All-Star team, stuff like that and you give it up for the team. </p>
<p>	Q.  You didn't make the All-Star team this year, because you were playoff MVP and obviously you take the Championship ring over the All-Star team and stuff, is there a certain quiet pride you have about that and knowing in your own mind and your teammates know, maybe you could score and make All-Star teams and you're giving it up maybe for others? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you guys, no matter what sort of adversity you guys face, you guys seem to overcome, does this team almost like having their backs against the wall and just "us against the world" mentality?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about your road:  1997 you're drafted in the same class as Tim (Duncan), and you guys have taken very different roads to get here.  How did you persevere through all the stops and did you think that here you are, you'd be going for your second championship? </p>
