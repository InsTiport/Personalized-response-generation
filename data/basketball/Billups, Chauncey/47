<p>	Q.  Is Larry Brown by far the most demanding coach you've ever played for?  And now that you're at this level here in the Finals, do you kind of see the method to his madness and it kind of pays off now? </p>
<p>	Q.  It seems, though that he's harder on you than mostly than anybody else on this team.  Has it ever been difficult for you to deal with this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach said you'd like to have your best game in the series in the next game because they are going come out so fired from the game last night.  What do you expect from them in the ensuing games?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the evolution of the pick-and-roll on this team and how there's some problems earlier in the year, what those problems were and how you had to get through them as a team.</p>
<p>	Q.  Lindsey was talking about necessity for the team to play desperate coming off a victory, that it's more challenging to come back after a win than perhaps the loss in Game  2. Can you talk a little bit about that.</p>
<p>	Q.  Back to the pick-and-roll again.  Do you expect that they are going to really jump on you in Game  4, really try to hit you hard and maybe pressure you further up the court like they did at the end of the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Certainly the series is far from over, but you read all season about how the Western Conference playoffs and Western Conference Finals will determine the champion and East was sort of a JV.  Were you offended by that and do you feel you have opened eyes about the play in the Eastern Conference?</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys look like you're playing with an unbelievable energy and hunger out there, where does that come from?  It's been talked about because of what different pieces, discarded pieces  -- is that part of what's driving you guys right now?</p>
