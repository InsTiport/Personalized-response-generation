   CHAUNCEY BILLUPS: It's a special one, a real special one, having our coaching staff here to coach the game and having 'Melo, who is one of the best players in the world be on the starting team and being able to be out there with him I think is just special for me, especially me being in my hometown, giving me an opportunity to represent my city on a huge stage.

 Q. (Inaudible). 
 CHAUNCEY BILLUPS: When Allen does leave the game, he will be known as one of the players kind of that changed the face of the game. I think that Allen brought the playground, he brought hip-hop, he made everybody love just the playground aspect of the game, him being able to run around out there and score a lot of points and do it in the way that he did it is great. He's going to be looked at as one of the greats. 

 Q. He always wanted to win the All-Star game. 
 CHAUNCEY BILLUPS: The one thing about Allen is anytime that he's on the floor, he's going to give 110 percent, and he's trying to win the basketball game, whether that's the All-Star game, whether that's summertime picking up playing ball or a regular season game. That's one of the things that made him so great. 

 Q. Would you describe media day?
 CHAUNCEY BILLUPS: Media day to us is a lot of -- it's a chance for media from all over the world to spend five or ten or 15 minutes with their favorite players. For me it's a lot of fun because you don't get that that often with so many cameras. NBA Finals is the only thing that's similar to this. But it's a lot of fun. It can be a little overwhelming if you're not prepared for it.
