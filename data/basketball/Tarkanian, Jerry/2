<p>	Q.  What do you feel towards Felix knowing how far he's come and how much he's had to work on his confidence and to see that happen to him at the end?  </p>
<p>	Q.  Why didn't you put Felix in that last defensive stop?  </p>
<p>	Q.  I guess that's what you're saying, that's the toughest thing, bad first half, have the kids fight back like that that last second tip was -- </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you do anything differently the second half to spark the run?  </p>
<p>	Q.  This lost the way it took place.  It was like San Francisco won overtime last year, took long time to get over.  Is this going to take a long time, too?  </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you think the tip in could have been offensive goal tending?  </p>
<p>	Q.  Listening to what you had to say about the first half and your team's development down the road, it sounds like what Tom Izzo said about two and a half hours ago.  His team's first half was not what he was looking for, young team.  You see any parallels?  </p>
<p>	Q.  Are you comfortable now with him handling the ball at the end of the game like he did?  </p>
<p>	Q.  When you talk about your inexperience, is (inaudible) an experience a college player as you're going to find.  That's got to be tough.  </p>
<p>	Q.  Michigan State three straight final fours. </p>
<p>	Q.  What was the difference between the two halves?  Obviously Dave jumped out -- </p>
