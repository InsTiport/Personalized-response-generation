 THE MODERATOR: Now joined by South Carolina, Coach Dawn Staley and Lakeisha Sutton, she had 9 points and 5 assists in tonight's game. We will open it up for questions.   
  
  Q. Coach, can you talk about how nice I guess it was to start out with the 18-0 lead, and at that point did you tell your team anything? You know, just continue on or what?   
 COACH STALEY: Yeah, yeah, at that point we were hitting shots, and obviously we wanted to open up as big of a lead as possible, because we knew we couldn't shoot that way the entire game. We knew they weren't going to shoot that way the entire game.   
 You just have to ride it until it stops. We knew it stopped, just didn't think it would come that abruptly.   
  
  Q. Was it something that Mississippi State did on defense? Or was it just something else?   
 COACH STALEY: No, I mean, I think for the most part we struggled to score the basketball. To come out and score 18 points in the first 12 minutes, 8 minutes of the game, that was kind of a foreign thing for us.   
 For us, we had people scoring that didn't score all night for us that scored throughout the year, and you want that, because I wanted us to share the ball and we wanted people to shoot open shots and we got on a roll.   
 Mississippi State were missing easy shots and we knew they would have some kind of a run at us, we just didn't have enough bodies to sustain, and rebounding the basketball. We lost the game off rebounds, to be quite honest.   
  
  Q. Lakeisha, talk about the second half, the shots weren't falling, talk about when they started hitting shots.   
 LAKEISHA SUTTON: The second half our shots weren't falling, but we kept shooting, trying to get the ball to the shooters and we kept trying to get the ball in but it wasn't falling.   
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.
