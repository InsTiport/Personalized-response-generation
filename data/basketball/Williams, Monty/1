 Q.  If you could make a brief comment about the honor tonight.  
MONTY WILLIAMS: Obviously it's an award that, you know, I received this award and I'm honored to receive the first [Craig] Sager Award.  Craig and I had a relationship that was built when he got sick, and although I've known him across my career, I didn't really get to know who he was until he was sick.   
And so he just inspired all of us, and obviously the way he lived his life, the way he treated people, was an inspiration and also the way he treated me in private was an inspiration.  I would text him when he was going through a lot of chemotherapy and other treatments, and he would text me right back, and it was such an encouragement to me.   
When I was with the USA Basketball team, we had an exhibition game in Houston, and he was there, and he went out of his way to seek me out.  I just thought that was the coolest thing.  He's just a really, really cool person, he was, and I know he and Ingrid are smiling on us in Heaven right now, and it's a blessing to be able to receive this award in his name.
