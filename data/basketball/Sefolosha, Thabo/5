 Q.   What do you think of the defense that you were able to play, especially on LeBron?   
THABO SEFOLOSHA:   I think it was decent.   You know, I got a lot of help from Nick underneath the basket from LeBron disrupting the shots, so that was good.  
   
 Q.   Did you know going into the game that that was going to follow you?  
THABO SEFOLOSHA:   Not really.   We didn't really talk about it.   I knew at some point I could be matched up against him, but we didn't really make it a point for me to guard him in the fourth quarter, but that's just the way we felt like doing it.
