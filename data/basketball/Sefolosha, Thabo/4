  THABO SEFOLOSHA:   They've been doing a good job.   I mean, I think attacking the ball, putting it all over the floor, and we've seen a lot of things I think that we can do better.   I'm sure we're going to correct that. 

Q.   How tough a call is that to make correctly, though? 
THABO SEFOLOSHA:   It's very tough, very tough, between the flops that we've been seeing and the regular charges, I think it's a tough call to make.   But sometimes it goes that way, sometimes it doesn't. 

Q.   Do you think possibly tomorrow you'll be coming out angry or just more determined?
THABO SEFOLOSHA:   I hope so.   I think we don't like that team, and we've got to play angry, and I think that's what we're going to do.   We're going to come out and play better, play smarter, but also with a little bit more passion and just a little bit more fired up, I think. 

Q.   What is it about LeBron James that makes him so different from guarding other players, other big stars around the NBA? 
THABO SEFOLOSHA:   I think he has the speed of a guard, a point guard, and he has the strength of a power forward, so I think that's what makes him tough.   He can take you off the dribble and basically push you out of the way.   So you've got to be really physical with him.   He's just a very good player.
