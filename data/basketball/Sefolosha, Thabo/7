 Q.  What did you feel when you heard your name and you knew you were going to play with Allen Iverson in Philadelphia? 
 THABO SEFOLOSHA:  First to play with Allen Iverson in Philadelphia, it's a great feeling.  I heard a little bit after that I was going to Chicago. 
 So I'm happy to go there, and I think it's a great team, with really good talent and a great future, so I'm happy to go there. 

 Q.  I grew up in northeast Philadelphia.  It's a town that's known for giving its athletes a hard time.  They have a famous line of booing Santa Clause.  It's a tough fan base and media down there.  Is that something that's on your mind and your agent has spoken to you about? 
 THABO SEFOLOSHA:  Not at all.  I cannot control this.  I just try to give my best on the court and whatever goes around there, I just let it go. 

 Q.  Who were some of your favorite players when you were growing up, either NBA players or local guys where you lived? 
 THABO SEFOLOSHA:  Of course, Michael Jordan, and Chris Webber, I liked Chris Webber.
