Q.   How do you feel after a night like that? 
THABO SEFOLOSHA:   Very good, very good.   It can be better though.

Q.   (No microphone)?
THABO SEFOLOSHA:   It's up there, definitely.   (No microphone).

Q.   Where was your focus today in practice and leaving it on the game floor? 
THABO SEFOLOSHA:   Basically, see what we did well, what worked for us and see what we can improve on.

Q.   You guys switched a lot more on the screens.   Perk said it didn't matter who it was.   It was more shot clock.   What are your thoughts? 
THABO SEFOLOSHA:   Yeah, basically, whenever they feel like switching (No microphone), and they did a great job.   They took tough shots.

Q.   Was it easier for you and is it more effective when you have that little more room to operate at the top? 
THABO SEFOLOSHA:   I don't know.   I think, again, the bigs did a great job helping with the pick‑and‑roll.   They went up for the pick‑and‑roll.   (No microphone).

Q.   You're not asdemonstrative as Perk is, but did you feel the same way?   He seemed like his pride was hurt at the defensive performance in San Antonio.   Did you feel the same way? 
THABO SEFOLOSHA:   We all did.   We all did.   It's two losses (No microphone).   We have to just play better. 
We have to play better, and we have to step up.

Q.   (No microphone)?
THABO SEFOLOSHA:   I think so.   You know, we can do it on both ends of the floor.   We've got guys that can play with the best of them, and we've got a team that are mentally tough.

Q.   Offensively, how important was it? 
THABO SEFOLOSHA:   I think it was big for us.   They did a great job (No microphone) giving us shots.   And we've got to find that (No microphone).

Q.   Were you guys feeling desperate in Game 3? 
THABO SEFOLOSHA:   I wouldn't say desperate.   But definitely desperate to come out and play better.
