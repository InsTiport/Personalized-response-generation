Q.   Last night that was a huge play when you stripped Wade.   That kind of full‑court pressure, is that what you guys need to ratchet up?
THABO SEFOLOSHA:   Yes.   I think that's something good, but I think the energy will be big for the game, and we're going to have to need good energy for 48 minutes.

Q.   You guys held them to about 38 percent shooting from the field.   I think they were maybe 3 of 21 from the perimeter.   They really mauled you guys on the inside.   Do you feel like you guys let a game get away?
THABO SEFOLOSHA:   A little bit.   We've been saying that every game we lose, of course.   We know we can beat this team, and we're confident we can beat this team.   So every time you lose you feel like you let one slip away.   We've got to see what we did well, see what we didn't do so well, and keep working.

Q.   16 seconds to go, you guys are down by four coming in from an out‑of‑bounds play.   Seemed like there was a miscommunication between you and Westbrook.   Can you talk about that play. 
THABO SEFOLOSHA:   Yeah, I mean, probably my fault.   I was inbounding the ball and didn't make a good pass, miscommunication, and I take the blame for it.   But it happens.   It's unfortunate at the time, but it happens.
