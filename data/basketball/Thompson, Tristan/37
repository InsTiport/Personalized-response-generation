Q.   I remember we talked before about playing Garnett the first time, but now that you're here, who have you seen that you say, man, this is really something? 
TRISTAN THOMPSON:   Who have I seen?   Well, obviously not a lot of the All‑Star guys.   I've seen mostly the rookies and sophomores.   Blake is playing in all these events, so he's another big target guy that I wasn't able to play against him. 

Q.   Can you take a little momentum coming into this event. 
TRISTAN THOMPSON:   It makes you feel good.   Coming off injuries, what you want to do is be in shape and have a little mojo going for me.   We won those games and I played pretty well.

Q.   Is there anybody you want to see this weekend?
TRISTAN THOMPSON:   Yeah, my mother. 

Q.   Talk about being around All‑Star weekend.   Is there one guy, I want to talk to that guy or I want to see this guy?
TRISTAN THOMPSON:   No, there's a list too long to name.
