Q. What was your reaction when you heard about Draymond?
TRISTAN THOMPSON: It is what it is.  The NBA made a decision.  It doesn't really matter to me.
Q. Before Game 5 of the Raptors series, you talked about the need to be more physical and knock them off their spot a little bit.  Since then, it seems you're more aggressive.  Is that the case?
TRISTAN THOMPSON: I feel like that's my job.  That's what I bring to the team -- my energy and my toughness and my aggressiveness.  That's all positives for our team.  I need to bring that from the opening tip.  That helps us establish it better as a team.
Q. LeBron said Draymond said some things he shouldn't have said.  Are there boundaries?
TRISTAN THOMPSON: At the end of the day, I'm rocking with whatever LeBron says.  It's a level of respect.  If a man on the court says something to be disrespectful, out there challenging you as an individual, I might react a little differently.  At the end of the day, it is what it is.  The NBA reviewed it and they made a decision.
Q. Are there things that shouldn't be said in trash talking?
TRISTAN THOMPSON: Let's put it like this:  If you're going to trash talk, you better back up whatever you say.  If you open your mouth, you better be prepared.
