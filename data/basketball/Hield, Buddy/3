BUDDY HIELD: I know what to expect now, so going to practice and everything, but it's been great.  It's a fun event.  We've come to embrace it.  I'm lucky to be here, blessed to be here.  Just soaking up my teammates, and enjoying every second I get.  Whether it's the Junior NBA or the NBA fans, giving autographs and stuff like that, it's fun.
It just makes you motivated to get to the All-Star Game because it brings more attention to you and shows how hard you work, too.
Q. You were the winner last year of our NBA radio annual spelling bee each year.  Do you want to defend your title right now?
BUDDY HIELD: Spelling bee?
Q. Absolutely, the New Orleans spelling bee.  You knocked it out of the park with jambalaya last year.
BUDDY HIELD: With the names?  I'm a bad speller.
Q. It gets harder as we go along.  Spell LeBron.
BUDDY HIELD: L-e-B-r-o-n.
Q. Spell Kuzma?
BUDDY HIELD: K-u-z-m-a.
Q. Spell Dwyane Wade?
BUDDY HIELD: Dwyane Wade.  D-w-a-y-n-e, Wade, W-a-d-e.
Q. Close enough.  You spelled Dwyane wrong.  Lauri Markkanen?
BUDDY HIELD: Lauri Markkanen, L-a-u-r-i.
Q. That's good.  You got Markkanen?
BUDDY HIELD: M-a-r-k -- Markkanen.
Q. Markkanen.
BUDDY HIELD: E-n or...
Q. You were close enough.  Are you ready for the last one?  Giannis Antetokounmpo.
BUDDY HIELD: I had a feeling that was coming.
Q. Now you're rolling, baby.
BUDDY HIELD: A-n-t-e...
Q. I've got to look even.
BUDDY HIELD: What is the last name again?
Q. Antetokounmpo.
BUDDY HIELD: C-o-m-p...
Q. No, it's okay.  You know what?  You did a great job anyway.  Thank you for playing along.  Fantastic.
Q. Did you watch Trae Young play much?
BUDDY HIELD: For sure, yeah.
Q. What do you think of him?
BUDDY HIELD: Special talent.  Great kid.  High-character guy.  Likes to work.  Likes to get better and craves results.
Q. [Oklahoma Sooners coach] Lon Kruger gives the green light right away?
BUDDY HIELD: Yeah, that too.
Q. Did you feel like you had to work your way to getting there with him?  What was that process like that?
BUDDY HIELD: With Coach Kruger?  I just think we come at different times.  Different times we came in.  We came in there and we had guys who were seniors, guys who were ahead of us, and they just kind of paved the way for us, and we had the respect.  We had to pay our dues until they gave us the green light.
Q. What do you remember last year from the All-Star Game?  Do you remember how hectic that weekend was for you and everything going down?
BUDDY HIELD: Yeah, it was a busy weekend.  We wanted to soak up the New Orleans love.  Then, bang, you get traded after the All-Star Game.  I know it's All-Star and I won't be getting traded, so I'll be good.
Q. What do you think of your teammate Bogdan Bogdanovic?
BUDDY HIELD: He's great.  He's competition.  But you don't want it to be easy for you.  You want to work for your own and work for yourself.  But me and him have a good relationship, he starts, I start, it doesn't matter.  We have a job to do.  It's competitive out there, but we're on the same team, and our goal is to win each and every night.
