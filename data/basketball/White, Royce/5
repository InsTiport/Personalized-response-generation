THE MODERATOR:   We're joined by Coach Fred Hoiberg, student‑athletes Scott Christopherson and Royce White.   
Coach, your thoughts on tonight's game.  
COACH HOIBERG:   It's disappointing to go out in the first round down here, especially with all the fans we had in attendance.   It was great to see all the cardinal and gold out there, and to walk away after one game is very disappointing.   
I thought the key to the game was a nine‑minute stretch in the second half.   We go up 11 right away in the second half.   About 18minutes to go, and you look at the nine‑minute mark, and we're down eight.   So they outscore us by 19points in that 10‑minute stretch and that's the ballgame.   They made big plays.  
I thought we put our heads down a little bit as a team.   And then we regrouped and found a way to get back in the game.   But they made big plays down the stretch and we didn't.  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions for the student‑athletes.  
   
 Q.   Scott, what were they doing defensively to the perimeter shooter guys?   Looked like they were playing fairly tight on you guys.   
SCOTT CHRISTOPHERSON:   They did a good job of getting to our perimeter guys and contesting 3s.   I think Texas is a pretty good defensive team, and you've got to give them credit for the way they performed tonight on the defensive end.  
   
 Q.   How did you see J'Covan Brown's game‑winning 3‑point play?  
SCOTT CHRISTOPHERSON:   He made‑‑ kind of drove left and Babb cut him off.   I thought he was going to spin back.   I didn't do a good enough job getting my entire body down there in front of him.   And I reached in.   The ref made a call and he made a great shot.  
   
 Q.   Royce, can you talk about your performance, 17points, but in a loss, first‑round quarterfinal down here?  
ROYCE WHITE:   It means nothing.   My performance was not good enough, especially when you think about the first five minutes is the most important and I came out and turned it over.   
It just wasn't good enough.   I'm going to have to get better even here in the next week if we're going to make a run in the tournament.  
   
 Q.   Royce, you now have a few days before Selection Sunday.   What are these next few days going to be like for you and the team and what are you going to do now to get past this to look ahead to the tournament?  
ROYCE WHITE:   Just prepare.   Just prepare and try and get better each day.   Not knowing what opponent you're going to draw is definitely different in terms of preparation.   
But you just prepare yourself mentally for whoever you draw and work on yourself more as a team than trying to prepare for an opponent that you don't know.  
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.   Questions for Coach.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk about Chris Babb's defense in spite of what J'Covan Brown did, he shot 7 of 19 from the field.   Hit big shots but they were all contested?  
COACH HOIBERG:   He's a big‑time player.   He's the leading scorer in our league.   Gotta give him credit for making big plays down the stretch.   
I thought Chris made him take tough shots.   I didn't think our awareness to him the entire game was good enough.   It was good at times.   We ran at him and made him give up the ball.   But there was other times where he split our defense, and you can't do that.   You can't allow a great player to have those opportunities getting to the rim.  
Listen, Chris has done a great job all year.   He's as good a defensive perimeter player as there is in our league.   But that kid, he's a load.   He's a big‑time player, made big‑time plays tonight.  
   
 Q.   You talked about that run that they made after you were up 11.   Was it more about what they were doing on offense, or was it mistakes or turnovers from you guys?  
COACH HOIBERG:   It was a combination.   We came out and got four baskets right off the bat, off of great ball movement.   Really got out and ran and got rebounds.   And that's how we attacked.   
And once they started getting offensive rebounds, they get 16 offensive rebounds against us tonight.   That's way too many.   
We're not able to play in transition.   That's where we've been at our best.   We've been a very good rebounding team this year.  
They came in minus one of their top rebounders and won many, but they still found a way to control the glass.   That slowed us down.   We weren't able to get out in transition.   We had to play in the half court.   They do a really good job in the half court as far as sitting in and making you beat them from the outside, which we didn't do tonight.  
So a little bit of both.   We didn't get the boards, and then they did a good job going out and attacking and getting the game and the tempo where they needed it.  
   
 Q.   A loss like this can be tough for a team to overcome, do you imagine the kids are going to have a tough time getting past this one with what's ahead of you now?  
COACH HOIBERG:   It will bother them, that's for sure.   It's a group that goes out and plays with pride.   We've done that all season.   We've accomplished a lot with this group.   And it's a testament to them.   Going back to all the hard work that this team has gone through, the two‑a‑days going back to July.   A trip to Italy for ten days.   And we put a lot into this season.   
And they're a very disappointed group in there right now.   We've got some things to correct here.   We've got one more chance to go out and to try to do something, to try to make a run.   And I believe this group will do that.   We'll come in, we'll have good practices, and hopefully we come out and get a good draw and play well.   
It's a learning experience, when you play in a setting like this, where you've got neutral court.   You've got both bands.   You've got both sets of fans in attendance and you learn from it.   And hopefully we'll be better the next time.  
I thought we came out a little bit tight.   Once we started playing I thought we got better and that second half run was the key.   That ten‑minute stretch was the key to that game.  
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, Coach.
