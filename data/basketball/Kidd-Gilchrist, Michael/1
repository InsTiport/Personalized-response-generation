 Q.   What are your first impressions of All‑Star Weekend?

 Q.   Do you have any family out here?  
MICHAEL KIDD‑GILCHRIST:   Yes, my mom, my sister.  
   
 Q.   I don't know if you've had an opportunity to look at the rosters for the three‑point shootouts or the Slam‑Dunk Contest, what are your predictions for winners?  
MICHAEL KIDD‑GILCHRIST:   My predicted winners for the three‑point contest is Kyrie.   For the Slam‑Dunk Contest, I'm not sure about that.   
   
 Q.   For the future, will you ever consider yourself entering into the Slam‑Dunk Contest?  
MICHAEL KIDD‑GILCHRIST:   Of course.   
   
 Q.   You've been thinking about that?  
MICHAEL KIDD‑GILCHRIST:   Yes.   
   
 Q.   And the dunk you will perform?

 Q.   What was like when you first met Michael Jordan?  
MICHAEL KIDD‑GILCHRIST:   He's a regular person.

MICHAEL KIDD‑GILCHRIST:   He did one time.  
   
 Q.   And?  
MICHAEL KIDD‑GILCHRIST:   And it was hard for me.   
   
 Q.   Could you give us the information you want to give us about that?  
MICHAEL KIDD‑GILCHRIST:   About the one‑on‑one?   I lost.   He's the best man that ever played the game.  
   
 Q.   He's still got game then?  
MICHAEL KIDD‑GILCHRIST:   Oh, yeah.   He's good.   
   
 Q.   Did you know him as a kid, as a little kid?   Can you remember him as a player on television?  
MICHAEL KIDD‑GILCHRIST:   I can't.  
   
 Q.   You were too young?  
MICHAEL KIDD‑GILCHRIST:   I was too young to remember.  
   
 Q.   Maybe your family members told you what he was like?   How did you find out how good he was?  
MICHAEL KIDD‑GILCHRIST:   Everybody was talking about him, that's how I really found out about him.   That's about it.   I don't remember how I found out about him.
