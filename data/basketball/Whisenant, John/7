   COACH JOHN WHISENANT:  I don't really have anything to say except we just got beat by a team that was more committed tonight than we were.  They obviously came emotionally prepared to stop the streak that the West held over them.  They shot the ball better.  They ran the floor better.  They rebounded better.   
 Tonight, our Western team was not nearly as cohesive, obviously.  I think at least part of that was Coach Thibault had four of his own players there, so they had a foundation to kind of feed on, a system that they practice and were familiar with each other.  Our team did not have that with 30 or 40 minutes we were together yesterday.  I thought it showed.   
 So with that said, I just congratulate the East team for playing as hard as they did.  Katie and the whole East squad played with the determination that they wanted to win.   
 Thank you.
