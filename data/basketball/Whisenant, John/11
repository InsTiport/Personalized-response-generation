<p>	Q.  Could you talk about those first few minutes of the second half.  The Monarchs came out 15-5, a great run, then they kind of melted down and let the Sun come back on a 14-2 run.  Can you talk about that.  It just seems like they fell apart there offensively and defensively?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is the first year where we have a best-of-five series and in the old format you would have already had it wrapped up.  What do you think about the best-of-five now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a bit about your team being able to limit the mistakes so far, whether it's turnovers or making free throws.  It seems like that's making a big difference in the series right now. </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk a little bit about Yolanda and the intensity that she has out there on the court.  She's just been playing phenomenally this whole series. </p>
<p>	Q.  You're on the verge of a WNBA championship, obviously it's just two wins, you need a third, but just talk about Tuesday and everything going into that contest Tuesday night. </p>
