   THE MODERATOR: Questions.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about your excitement being here at All-Star weekend.   
 MONIQUE CURRIE: I'm very excited to be here. It means a lot. It's an honor to be an All-Star, recognizing the hard work that you've done individually.   
 It feels good to be here.   
  
  Q. Specifically this All-Star setting with the WNBA stars versus USA Basketball, what can we expect?  
 MONIQUE CURRIE: We talked about it a little bit. It won't be like usual games where it's just more fun and games, just playing around. I think it will be a very competitive game. Players over there on the USA side are trying to fight for a spot.   
 So we'll be ready. It will still be fun, but I think it will be very competitive.   
  
  Q. Is there anything you're looking forward to this weekend? The game, skills competition? Anything in particular you enjoy most?   
 MONIQUE CURRIE: The skills competition will be fun especially since I'm shooting in the three-point contest. I've never done that before, so it will be interesting.
