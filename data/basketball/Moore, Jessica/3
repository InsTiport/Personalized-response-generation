<p>	Q.  Ann, is it 19 years old; is that right?</p>
<p>	Q.  How is it somebody 19 years old can show up in a situation like this and do what you did tonight, hit those free throws in the end?</p>
<p>	Q.  Diana, the Connecticut people can probably attest to your exploits in big games more than everybody here but can you talk about maybe relishing the opportunity to play Tennessee in the title game and to play like you did tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  Also for Ann, were your surprised how many open looks you got from 3-point range after you hit a couple?</p>


<p>	Q.  Congratulations to you all on a great season.  Diana on Sunday, Sue Bird presented you with the State Farm trophy, can you tell me how much that meant to you?</p>
<p>	Q.  For Diana, I know you had a lot of confidence in your team from the start of the season, but after losing everyone and looking at the team and before the season started, even in your wildest dreams can you imagine sitting up here?</p>





<p>	Q.  For Jessica Moore, Gwen Jackson was having a good first half, controlling the middle.  What did you decide or talk about at half time to bring her back under some contro? </p>
<p>	Q.  Diana, nobody is graduating from this team; can you talk about how that is a different feeling and what it means for next year?</p>



<p>	Q.  Diana you said the babies grew up, when did you see the maturity during the season and what was their demeanor coming in tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  Geno, was there a point when you felt that you did not still have control of this game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, before the Final Four you said that Diana's accomplishment of carrying a team this far was Larry Byrd, what can you compare it to now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Geno, this goes along to the Larry Byrd question but does this performance tonight cement her status as one of the all time great college women players like Cheryl Hiller (phonetic), Lieberman, that group?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, I understand there is a lot of chapters to be written here, but at the same time is there some historical perspective tonight, is really the sky the limit for your program?</p>
<p>	Q.  Looking at the three freshman that had a very solid game tonight, from our perspective it didn't look like they were nervous hitting big shots and getting rebounds, what's your perspective on their performance. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you remember who you were and what you hoped for when you took this job?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, when you lost that game to Villanova, knowing you have the young team, did you think that you can be here and win it or were you doubting your team?  And also one other quick question, you can just talk about the rebounding, how you guys got thoroughly dominated but still won the game?</p>
