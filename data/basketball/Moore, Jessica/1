<p>	Q.  I'd like to ask Miss Moore, you came out in the second half, four quick lay-ups, not only sort of blunting Tennessee's momentum, but sort of keeping the spread.  Was that something you exploited in their defense or were you told to be a little more active offensively at half-time? </p>
<p>	Q.  For Diana, Tennessee's pulled out so many games this year and particularly this tournament.  They cut a 17-point lead to 2.  At any time did you think about that old destiny thing or that kind of stuff? </p>
<p>	Q.  Barbara, talk about late in the game, Jessica got hurt a little bit and it seemed like when that happened you really had a spark that really seemed to come out and help the team. </p>
<p>	Q.  Diana, at what point did you feel like you guys had this game?  Was it early on in the half, in the first half when you guys were up 30 to 13 or was it later?</p>
<p>	Q.  For Diana, can you talk about the legacy of this senior class, three straight championships and also just the level of success the program has been able to achieve and sustain. </p>
<p>	Q.  Diana, can you just talk about Willnett's three-point play at the end and the fact that she's Miss April for this team? </p>
<p>	Q.  Diana, can you discuss or describe the elation after the game and do you think that after your pro career in basketball you can make it as a pro NFL punter?</p>
<p>	Q.  Pretty far.  You've got work to do though.</p>
<p>	Q.  Your feelings?</p>
<p>	Q.  Diana, speaking of tingling, your guys winning last night and now you guys, could you talk about the double wins, something that's never been done before?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jessica, can you talk about the injury and what happened?</p>
<p>	Q.  Question for D and Barbara, when things got tough in the second half, you went inside a lot, I think you had 22 points in the paint in the second half.  Was that by design? </p>
<p>	Q.  Diana, for decades Tennessee was synonymous with the top of college, women's college was basketball, I believe you finished 8 and 1 against them in your career, including three years in the Final Four.  Could you just talk about that kind of success against that kind of program? </p>

<p>	Q.  I didn't remember exactly when Battle came in there, but when Zolman got started hitting there on that streak in the second half, did you put Battle on her?  It seemed like she came in and kind of shut her down. </p>
<p>	Q.  I know you said coming off the floor when they had that run in the second half, I didn't think they would go away.  At the same time, they have had difficulties scoring and sustaining scoring.  Did you feel at any point they could continue scoring?</p>
<p>	Q.  They seemed a little disappointed on TV after the game, they said in '95 you seemed like a little boy out there and you've gotten more reserved over the years.  Can you talk about that?</p>
<p>	Q.  I don't know.  Whoever was back in the studio, I guess.  But can you talk about the emotional differences of winning the first one and then sustaining it and winning this one?</p>
<p>	Q.  How about the performance of Ann Strother, you get down on her every now and then but she came through in the big game.</p>
<p>	Q.  Just looking at the adjustments you made from the first half to second half, they always say that rebounding wins games.  Not this year and not last year.  What happened?  You were widely outrebounded in the first half and then balanced it out in the second half. </p>
<p>	Q.  I asked Diana about her 8 and 1 against Tennessee, three in the Final Four, it seems you would have to be more than just a good player to be able to do that, you would have to be really a champion.  Will you talk about that accomplishment for those seniors and when you recruited her.  I'm sure you thought she was a very talented player, did you see that champion's heart, for lack of a better term, in her?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about when you first came that Tennessee was on top of the mountain top, do you agree with Diana that you guys are now on top and you're the prominent program?</p>
<p>	Q.  Before the tournament started, you were talking about the regular season and you said maybe the team kind of wanted to get to the beach and maybe they wanted to skip the car ride on the way to the beach.  Can you talk about the resolve that they showed, not just tonight but in the last three weeks, the Santa Barbara game, the game Sunday night and how they took the car ride here in the last three weeks. </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you just talk about the inside play of Jessica and others in the second half, when you really took it inside and went right at Tennessee. </p>
