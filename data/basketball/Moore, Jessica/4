<p>	Q.  For all of the players, can you sort of talk about at the end of a game when Diana is putting up the shots; were all of you convinced that it would go in?   What is your feeling about her when she is taking the shots, important moment, do you always think they are going in?</p>
<p>	Q.  Barbara, you sort of have had a little bit of an up-and-down freshman season but you came up big in games when Diana has struggled, the few games she struggled; what is it about you that you are able to step up.  </p>
<p>	Q.  For all of the players except Diana I have been interested in hearing on how your coach has talked about your growth as a team this year, how do you all feel you have grown as a team this season? </p>



<p>	Q.  Diana, what is your mindset going into this game with Gwen Jackson playing the game she is playing. </p>


<p>	Q.  How would you describe your role on this team? </p>
<p>	Q.  At this time for Diana, how do you keep the weight of the Connecticut tradition from burdening your play?</p>
<p>	Q.  The coach asked how they planned to stop you, is that extra pressure going to the games and is this something where you may look for your teammates early and look for your shot maybe later down the clutch?</p>
<p>	Q.  Barbara, Coach said you all have been suffering and that good teams need to suffer before they can win, is the suffering over. </p>
<p>	Q.  Are you ready to win, do you deserve to win if you haven't really suffered yet?</p>

<p>	Q.  For any of the players, the game last night proves to everyone that has ever played any sport or watched any sport that you play a full game, you play a full 40 minutes, and you guys proved that beyond a shadow of a doubt, can you talk about, not just for tomorrow night or for anyone watching people could have turned it off, down 9, five minutes left, people said, the game is over, you go out and said you really do play a full 40 minutes. </p>
<p>	Q.  Diana, could you talk about what Maria brings to the team; she is the only starter not in double figures?</p>
<p>	Q.  Diana, what makes this team so special?</p>
<p>	Q.  For Diana and Maria, are there things you can point to for Barbara and Willnett that show that they have grown up this year, things they are doing differently now than they were doing at the beginning of the season?</p>

<p>	Q.  Geno, last night with Diana at the end, is that still standard operating for her to win a game like that for you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Geno, at times this season Barbara has stepped up when you needed her scoring high teens or even into the 20's a couple of times, can you talk about offensively what she brings to the team you need her most?</p>
<p>	Q.  Geno, last night you talked about how -- this is the matchup that everybody wanted:  Tennessee, Connecticut.  Is this rivalry good for the women's game in your opinion?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, do you take anymore pleasure in beating Tennessee than maybe someone else particularly in this venue, this atmosphere?</p>
<p>	Q.  Geno, after Nicole's injury, that's when Maria stepped into the starting lineup, has she given you everything that you expected out of her?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you know the needle that you sometimes like to apply, do you think it maybe got to Pat a little but she is immune to it now?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you all first started playing each other?</p>
<p>	Q.  High coach.  Let's talk about the atmosphere in practice, practice isn't is the most fun place to be; was that different at shoot around?</p>
<p>	Q.  Geno, where does this willingness by Diana take over or be so confident; does it have anything to do, you are overachievers, does any of it have to do --</p>
<p>	Q.  Does it have anything to do with being the children of immigrant parents and that kind of thing?</p>
<p>	Q.  Geno, could you comment on your relationship with Pat; some ups and downs that you have had over the years and where things are currently?</p>
<p>	Q.  I don't have statistical data to back it up, but I suspect teams shoot better the second game inside of a big dome; do you expect both teams will shoot better tomorrow night just in general?</p>
<p>	Q.  Geno, I know when you take the team on the road you like to give the girl's a perspective of their surroundings like you took them to Ground Zero in New  York.  Is that possible in Atlanta, have you looked around or does being in the championship tournament preclude any extracurricular activities?</p>
<p>	Q.  What made you want to recruit a player who had that wonderful combination of shorted and slow when you watched them?   Most people were saying there is no way she can play at UConn, what were you seeing?</p>
<p>	Q.  Being from New  York also, I wasn't there when you made the evil empire remark, and I don't know your sense of humor that well.  Base on your comment today, as I understand it, is it to say you were kidding when you said it a week ago?</p>
<p>	Q.  With that being said when you spoke to her 15 minutes ago did you guys arm wrestle, did you place a bet, did you congratulate each other, what did you all say?</p>
<p>	Q.  Basketball?</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously the statement doesn't apply to you, but as you look around the women's basketball game there seems to be fewer and fewer men's coaches every year, are men a dying breed as far as coaching in the women's game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, in the past few weeks it seems like you spin the TV dial and all you see is the war or basketball, whether it's the men or women's tournament, do you get a sense, that when I talked to so many people, they say hey, I never really watch basketball but I can't watch the news anymore.  You guys are kind of a nice distraction to what is going on in the world right now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, everybody talks about Diana on the court and how great she is, one of the things that seems to strike me this year is how she taken the roll as leader especially with the younger kids, can you talk about how she has gone about that and also what you have seen them pick up from her or what they gained from being around her?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, how would you compare Diana's impact on the team to what Sue Bird's impact was last year?</p>
<p>	Q.  The three times that you have won your semifinal wins have been by somewhere 20, 20 and 20.  Are you concerned that last night's game was so -- was the way it was?</p>
<p>	Q.  Going back to a year ago at this time you had 4 players up here that were not up here a year ago, when you walked out at 39 and 0, at the start of the season did you say enjoy all of this, it might be a couple of years before we get back?</p>
<p>	Q.  Geno, you are trying to talk to Harry before the game tomorrow and what would you get from him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, earlier you talked about you didn't bring out the needle in the UT rivalry until later, so is there a conscious concerted effort to maybe get at Pat a little bit?</p>
<p>	Q.  If Tennessee is the evil empire, what would you call UConn?</p>
<p>	Q.  Geno, I wonder what you remember of Kara Lawson from having seen her in high school how hard you tried to recruit her and what you see in terms of her leadership that she brings to the floor?</p>
<p>	Q.  I think a lot of people perceive you as sort of a regular guy.  What do you think it will take to get more regular guys to love this sport?</p>
<p>	Q.  You can talk about how this Tennessee team changed since the January game and the Tennessee team that you see now, do you see a different team that when you all won an overtime game back in January?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you recruited Diana could you have seen her ability to come through repeatedly in the clutch the way she has, is that something that you can identify in a player?  And kind of the second part of that, if you were having to coach against her right now would you be almost fearful of her in what she might do in the last couple minutes of a close game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would you be fearful of her?</p>
<p>	Q.  Loree Moore, do you think she is a silent threat for Tennessee? Loree Moore, yesterday, she was pivotal; do you think she is silent?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is a selfish question, I have to pick a couple of keys to this game for the Atlanta paper?</p>
<p>	Q.  I think some of the people are.  I'm not speaking for myself.  Any way I want to do it in an educated way.  All I hear is defensive rebounding and I know that's great, but for you to not lose by 30, what sort of things do you think you guys need to do to beat Tennessee?</p>
<p>	Q.  Geno, in hindsight has the switch from playing them twice during the regular season been good or bad for your program and then has it been good or bad for women's basketball in general?</p>
<p>	Q.  Geno, I want to follow up a question I asked you about an hour ago, the men's coaches in the women's game.  Why is it that you said a man can't get a head job at a major program anymore?   What about the fairness of that, what do you think about that?</p>
<p>	Q.  You are a well rounded sports guy, is there a parallel that can be drawn between yourself and Steve Spurrier?</p>
