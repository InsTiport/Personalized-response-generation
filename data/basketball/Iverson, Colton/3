UNLV   75
  Colorado State   65

THE MODERATOR:   We're joined by Colorado State.   Coach, some remarks on tonight's game. 
COACH EUSTACHY:   I think there were times when we were out‑determined and we reverted back to some old ways. 
Give UNLV a ton of credit.   That's as well as I've seen them play.   They had players step up and make plays when it counted. 
Got to digest it and move on. 
THE MODERATOR:   Questions for the student‑athletes. 

Q.   Colton, you were so dominant in the first few minutes of the game.   Were they doing anything different in the second half to close you out? 
COLTON IVERSON:   No.   I don't think they changed their game plan at all.   We knew what they were going to do, what they were capable of.   Like Coach said, we just got out‑worked today, plain and simple. 

Q.   Wes, they didn't hit any three‑pointers in the second half, seven in the first.   Did you do anything to change that defensively?
WES EIKMEIER:   Not really schematically.   I don't know, we just got to them because of how they hurt us in the first half.   I mean, I don't know, we were just a little more conscious. 
Like Colton said, we got out‑determined.   They got more loose balls than we did.   That was it. 

Q.   Wes, they started hitting all the threes.   A 16‑3 run.   How difficult was that out on the floor?   It seemed like they were in a good rhythm, crowd gets going. 
WES EIKMEIER:   Yeah, I mean, part of that was we just weren't aggressive enough, dictating the pace more, setting the tone defensively. 
Coach said give them credit, they played well.   I think at times we beat ourselves, reverted back to some habits that aren't characteristic of our team.   When you do that, you end up in a situation where you're fighting for your life at the end instead of being up. 

Q.   Wes, what did you think of having Dorian back?   Obviously he wasn't 100%.   What did you think of his play?
WES EIKMEIER:   I mean, showed a lot of guts.   Obviously he's not even close to 100%.   But he's been the heart and soul of our team ever since he stepped on campus. 
I think he wishes more than anybody that he would be 100%.   It probably kills him more than the rest of us that he's not out there.   But, you know, it is what it is, so... 

Q.   What are your thoughts going into Sunday?   Have you thought about what type of seed you might deserve at all? 
WES EIKMEIER:   No.   I mean, we don't really look a whole lot into that.   Obviously a lot of people talk to us about it. 
Whoever they give us, probably going to be a really good team, we're going to have to put out a better foot than we did today.   I think Coach is going to get us ready, get us playing Colorado State basketball, be at our best.   I think we can be very dangerous down the stretch here. 

Q.   Colton, you and Coach both talked about you being out‑determined a little bit.   Any particular reason that might happen in this game. 
COLTON IVERSON:   I mean, they just came out and out‑worked us.   They were grabbing all the loose balls, especially in the first half.   I don't know, we didn't come out with a lot of energy, I felt.   We let the crowd get into it.   They made a little run.   That's unfortunate 'cause we fell short of our goals definitely this weekend. 
THE MODERATOR:   We'll continue with questions for Coach Eustachy. 

Q.   I know you fell short of your goals this weekend.   At the same time on Sunday you are going to get your name called for the NCAA tournament.   The second time for you as a coach, which is an accomplishment.   Can you reflect on what this means for you as a coach. 
COACH EUSTACHY:   Well, this is the toughest coaching situation I've stepped into.   First year.   It's extremely satisfying.   I think expectations were false, a little bit too high.   I think we even exceeded those. 
We've got a lot of basketball left.   Our guys were a little bit out of gas tonight.   Again, UNLV is a special team when they're playing like that.   But we're excited about Sunday obviously.   Like Wes said, we're not worried about who we're playing.   It's always about us, not the opponent. 

Q.   It looked like they were pretty determined to keep Pierce off the boards, boxing him from both sides at times.   Is that why maybe he wasn't quite as effective on the boards? 
COACH EUSTACHY:   I didn't see that.   I saw, like Wes said, we did change at halftime.   We decided to stay on Bennett on the pick'n rolls and not let him roll.   That's what we were supposed to do. 
We were very uncharacteristic tonight as far as taking it from the timeouts to the game.   Pierce was very uncharacteristic.   One offensive rebound. 
Give UNLV all the credit, absolutely.   But like one of the players said, we reverted back to what we've been reaching as opposed to taking the charge.   Our rotations were not great.   Again, it's who you play and where you play 'em.   It was a very tough, difficult situation. 

Q.   Could you talk about what you got from Dorian tonight.   How close do you think he can get to 100% by the time the NCAA tournament starts?
COACH EUSTACHY:   Two things.   I don't know when I've had an effort, let alone a performance, like Colton Iverson.   For his size, his effort ‑ I'd have to think long and hard when I've had somebody do that.   That was the bright side tonight.   I thought Dorian was fine.   It started to bother him at the end and we took him out. 
But, you know, he exploded on that one cut and laid it up.   He has no choice but to be fine.   He's out of time.   I thought he showed a lot of guts wanting to play tonight.   So I think we'll have no excuses like that.   I thought that was very, very encouraging what I saw from Dorian tonight. 
THE MODERATOR:   Coach, thank you for your time. 
COACH EUSTACHY:   Thanks.
