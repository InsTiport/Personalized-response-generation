<p>	Q.  Was Abrams injuries something that might linger for a while or will it be better in time?</p>
<p>	Q.  Dion Harris, I know obviously he's led you guys in scoring so far, but how do you feel overall about his all-court play?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is Sims getting used to his extra weight?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much can you use this, because you played well the other day to be able to -- it came down to maybe one or two plays to try and get a win and that didn't happen.  How much can you use that to motivate the team to keep them on a certain level to keep them trying on a certain level? </p>
