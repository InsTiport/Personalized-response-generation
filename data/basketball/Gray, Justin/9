<p>	Q.  Coach, no scholarship seniors on this team. </p>
<p>	Q.  Speaks a great deal for the youthful leadership. </p>
<p>	Q.  In the broad view, what does it mean to any program to reach the Final 16?  In the narrow view, how have your kids handled this experience to this point?</p>
<p>	Q.  His name is freshman Chris Paul.  Was there a point this season where you dropped it or you realized he wasn't a freshman anymore the way he was playing?</p>
<p>	Q.  You're in the one regional where the Top 4 seeds have held true.  What was your reaction when the two number ones and two number twos go?</p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of people say Saint Joseph's come out on the floor in lay-up drills, say this team was No. 1 in the country.  What do you see once they get to playing?</p>
<p>	Q.  How has Chris, he doesn't look physically like a real strong kid, how has he held up physically?  Does he avoid getting bumped?</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys are obviously very comfortable playing in the 80s.  Do you imagine Saint Joseph's would be happy with that kind of tempo? </p>
<p>	Q.  Last week in Raleigh, you were talking about your first game as a freshman coach.  Last year there was the possibility you would leave.  How fortunate do you feel to be here with Wake Forest now? </p>
<p>	Q.  Any particular memories of Phil or Saint Joseph's?</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you anticipate seeing from Jameer, Chris Paul match-up? </p>

<p>	Q.  I don't know if you saw the local paper this morning, but it was a couple of big stories about how excited everyone is in Philadelphia for the success of Saint Joseph's.  Do you feel like y'all are coming here like potential spoilers of a good story? </p>

<p>	Q.  What does it mean to the program to the University, to get this far?  How do you think you can handle it tomorrow night? </p>

<p>	Q.  Have you in the past at camps played against Jameer or Delonte, anybody from Saint Joseph's?  Could you share any experiences on that? </p>

<p>	Q.  Eric, with everyone focusing on the guard play, Jameer versus Chris, what do you feel like your role is in the post?  They're not the greatest rebounding team.  How do you look at your role in this game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Justin, Coach Martelli suggested when all the attention has been paid on the guard match-ups, he thought it would be somebody else that would probably decide the game, somebody we might be surprised by.  Do you agree with him on that assessment? </p>
<p>	Q.  What can Jameer expect to see from Chris Paul? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Chris coming in as a freshman, he has to be a leader on the team as this a point guard?  What is it like for you guys being older guys to listen to that freshman? </p>
