 Q. Talk about what you need to do to get ready for Game 4.
 RAY ALLEN: Just trying to get my body together and just get everybody on the same page, just moving forward.

 Q. (Inaudible).
 RAY ALLEN: Just if we would have won the game. But it's great to just have one day.

 Q. (Inaudible).
 RAY ALLEN: Did anything hurt? My thigh. I took a knee to the thigh.
 
 Q. You said before Game 2 it felt like (Inaudible). Did it feel differently going into Game 3?
 RAY ALLEN: No. I mean, again, I give them all the credit in the world. You know, a couple shots early I missed, and I think after that they got it back out to my shots very quickly. Maybe four or five shots they got their hand on. They had an outstretched arm in front of my ball all night.

 Q. Did they cause some of that instead of just you missing shots?
 RAY ALLEN: You know, defense is defense. It's one thing if you're spot blank missing wide open shots. You sit there and start to think about it. But I look at the film and I seen mostly shots that I took, and there were shots that I've made before, there are shots that I make, and then just a couple of them didn't make it to the rim.

 Q. Was it because of the blow or you just didn't have your legs?
 RAY ALLEN: You know, I don't question it, I just move forward. I just move forward and just focus on getting good rest today and being ready for tomorrow.

 Q. What do you expect tomorrow from your team?
 RAY ALLEN: You know, everybody just focus, moving forward.  We've always done well with our backs up against the wall.
