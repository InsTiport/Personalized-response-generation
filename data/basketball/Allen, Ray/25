   RAY ALLEN: I think the most important thing for us is to disconnect with what's going on. We watch enough film and we're around each other enough. Whether you're up, you're the team in favor, you just always have to be humble. 

 Q. Guarding Kobe, what did you see out of him that you need to adjust for in Game 2?
 RAY ALLEN: Just the overall team defense, his positioning. Same thing we talked about yesterday. 

 Q. There's a story out that Tibs is getting the job in Chicago. How happy are you for him?
 RAY ALLEN: He deserves it. He's done a great job, being able to be recognized for what he's done over the last couple years, in his career, not just here, he definitely deserves it.

 Q. Talk about his work ethic, spending hours in the gym, in his office. Is he pretty much high up there, a workaholic?
 RAY ALLEN: Yeah, most definitely. It'll be interesting for him as a head coach because you've got to give some of those hours away. You can't just go full steam like that all the time because you have to get rest and make sure that you don't overenervate yourself with too much work.

 Q. What kind of quality do you think he'll bring as a head coach? 
 RAY ALLEN: Just tireless work ethic, being able to make sure he doesn't leave any stone unturned, being a guy who always keeps his players prepared. 

 Q. (Inaudible). 
 RAY ALLEN: I don't think I ever got in the flow. That was -- again, it was like being on the outside looking in.
