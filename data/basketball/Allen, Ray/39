 Q. Iâd like you to talk about the importance of Game 2 because the Lakers, in order to win the championship, they have to win one game here, and they don't want to go back home 0-2, so does that make Game 2 even more, maybe we don't want to use the word "critical," but even more important?
 RAY ALLEN: Well, I think throughout the rest of the series, the games that are left, every game is going to get bigger and bigger in stature for both teams. On this floor we want to protect it and they want to steal one, so I think both teams are going to look at it with equal importance.

 Q. Both teams have admitted that in Game 1 they didn't play their best, so in Game 2 you want to play better obviously than in Game 1, so what will be the determining factors? 
 RAY ALLEN: It's tough to say. I think you just know when there's things out there that you can improve on. Ultimately I think both teams in one game, they haven't played their best basketball throughout this whole year, so it's just important to win. You can work on the things that you need to work on to get better. It's hard to put a finger on it, but ultimately you want to win, and winning is what we're here for. 
 You do whatever is necessary. There's no more rounds after this, so everybody is all in.
