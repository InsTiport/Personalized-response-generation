  Q. Talk about the feelings this year compared to 2008.   
 RAY ALLEN: It's pretty much the same. I don't think we're trying to make this situation too big where it's too much magnified for us. We know it's big as usual. The toughest thing for us was having four or five days off. But we've had good practices, and we're looking forward to tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Are you a better team than you were two years ago with some of the young guys like Big Baby and Rondo having matured?  
 RAY ALLEN: Hard to say. I think that that argument is always made about teams over the years like who's better and individual players, old school players, who's better. But I think as the league changes, whether a team is better or not is really irrelevant. Having success, that's what's important.  
  
  Q. Talk about having the layoff.  
 RAY ALLEN: It's a great opportunity just to enjoy. You just kind of rest. You blink and it's over with, so just having four or five days to sit back, it's great to enjoy.   
  
  Q. One of the things Phil said that he thought one thing that made you successful in The Finals last year was them not protecting their home court. You won a game on their home court last year, but now you have to win a game on their home court.  
 RAY ALLEN: That's playing basketball. If you don't have home-court advantage -- that's something that we talked about the whole year that year, and we did that by having the best record in the NBA and winning games on the road in the playoffs we didn't do early, but in The Finals we did and then coming here and winning a game. So you have to. If we want to do what we want to do, we have to win.
