<p>	Q.  Ray, can you just talk about the difference of playing with Shaq in past All-Star games and now playing without him? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did it seem like maybe more of a team, I know you had a couple of passes off the backboard but did it seem like a more team-oriented All-Star Game than normal? </p>
<p>	Q.  This whole weekend was about the young generation and D-Wade and LeBron had a good game.  Do you feel like yourself and AI are like the older generation, and can you talk about the younger guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  You're very familiar with Allen, what's your take on his performance tonight? </p>
