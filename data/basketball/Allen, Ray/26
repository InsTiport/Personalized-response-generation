		   RAY ALLEN: It was frustrating. For sure it was frustrating. I've anticipated this moment since the last time we were here. So you figure, last year losing in the second round, wanting to get back here, thinking about the summertime and then playing the whole season and having a great playoffs, playoffs as a team. And then getting into the game we waited six or seven days. So it wasn't my intention. 
 But I always have faith in my teammates knowing they'll get the job done when they get out on the floor. I knew a long time ago you get in foul trouble, minutes get added onto the game, and you just have to find a way to have an impact. 

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 RAY ALLEN: I think what makes him more dangerous is having the guys around him that play the way they've been playing this year. It does allow him to be more efficient.

 Q. The Lakers were very physical in Game 1. How do you think they're going to take that momentum? And what are you guys going to do against them?
 RAY ALLEN: It's not my job to figure out what they're going to do. It is my job to make amends for the physical aggression that we lacked. I think we, tendency-wise, we got early fouls, and it put us on our heels a little bit more than we would like. But those fouls, we just play through it, but we've got to keep our aggressive nature. 

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 RAY ALLEN: I don't know. That's a good lesson that I need to learn real quick here because even a couple of calls I thought were -- I tried to read the referees and how they called the games. They establish it early. So trying to figure that out but without being asleep on defense. Right now I've got to make that adjustment going into Game 1.

 Q. What does Kobe do that he's able to draw fouls?
 RAY ALLEN: He just attacks. But I think primarily if he's attacking that means he sees gaps.
