 Q.  Do you think Vegas would be a good city to have an NBA franchise in? 
 RAY ALLEN:  I think so.  I think Vegas is one of, if not, the fastest growing cities in this country.  There are a lot of markets that we can grow to in the NBA, and I think this should definitely be the front runner for the NBA. 
 Because you talk about this game and there are so many great players and now we're talking about the international market, the game has grown and before too long 30 teams might not be enough to fill the level of basketball competition that the world possesses. 

 Q.  Considering that you've made so many All-Star teams, what was the feeling like when you arrived in Vegas to participate this year? 
 RAY ALLEN:  It's like when you have that sense of home, when you arrive at the airport and you're picking your car up from the parking garage and you know you're going home and you feel relaxed. 
 It's somewhat the same feeling because you've been here, you know the people who you're about to encounter from the NBA side, from your peers that you play with -- from the peers that you play with.  You know where you're going, you're in a comfort zone and that's a great feeling to have.
