 Q. Is the key defensively not taking away guys but to make him take everything difficult?
 RAY ALLEN: Well, that's somewhat been our philosophy all year. We have so many great offensive players in this league that it would be foolish to think that you're going to keep them off the ball because there's so many different ways for them to have an opportunity to score. It's just important that if he's shooting a five-footer, make it a seven- or eight-footer, try to make him a little bit more uncomfortable on the offensive end.

 Q. Some teams throw everything they can at Kobe, but you guys seem to guard him straight up, but still not give him a lane and everybody is ready for him if he puts it on the floor. Is that a different balance than other teams?
 RAY ALLEN: It's definitely a balance. I think the first three series have prepared us for these moments here because we had Joe Johnson, LeBron, and then with Detroit we had Rip Hamilton and Tayshaun. You have to worry about those guys because they're definitely capable of putting up big numbers. But you can't lose sight of who has the ball. You can't lose sight of them getting easy lay-ups or getting rebounds. So we definitely have learned a lot of lessons. I think we'd just like to continue to make our men make tough shots. Like I said, we learned that from the first round all the way to this point.

 Q. What did you think of his contention, or did he just miss? 
 RAY ALLEN: I hope he keeps missing (laughter). 

 Q. How important is it to win Game 2? 
 RAY ALLEN: I think coming out with a loss is a terrible feeling, so really play well and win, it's a great feeling, but you have to continue to do it so you can't rest on it and think that the next game is going to be the same way. You have to work twice as hard to get the same results.
