 Q.   Talk about the honor of being one of the few chosen people to be invited.   
MARKIEFF MORRIS:   It's a great honor.   I didn't know if I was going to be chosen.   Every day I just tried really hard, and I'm happy to be here.  
   
 Q.   Any bragging rights between you and your brother that you're here and he's not?  
MARKIEFF MORRIS:   No, no, especially because he hasn't gotten to play yet.   Next year maybe there might be some bragging rights.  
   
 Q.   Are you going to do anything fun on your off day, Disney World, Epcot?  
MARKIEFF MORRIS:   No, I'm actually leaving tomorrow to go see Kansas versus Missouri.   That's what I'm doing tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   What's your prediction for that game?  
MARKIEFF MORRIS:   Come on, man.   Kansas by 30, 35, something like that.
