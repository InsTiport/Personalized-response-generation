Q. Markieff, you are one win away from the championship.  How do you handle this situation?  And also, tomorrow you will wear the Mamba uniform.  How special is this uniform for you personally?
MARKIEFF MORRIS:   It's perfect for me, man.  Growing up in the Philadelphia area, a lot of us idolized Kobe being from Philly.
As far as the game, I think we go in there with the mindset of, this is not the close out game.  We go in there as, this is a must-win, like we had last game.  We stay uncomfortable until the clock hits zero and they say Lakers win.
I think we go in with the mindset of a must-win and that'll be key to us winning.
