COACH WILLIAMS:   I didn't realize so much of our West Coast media came back here to Lawrence.   It's good to see everybody.   
We played a very good team.   I watched (ESPN analyst) talk about the fact that he picked them in the Final Four.   
And so the team that's picked in the Final Four and you're playing at their house, I thought our guys found a way to scrap and stay in the game.   That's the best you can say when you don't shoot the ball well, and you put a team at the free‑throw line 18 more times than you.   Those two things are a recipe for getting your rear‑end handed to you by about 25.   
So the fact that we played them to 10, in some realms, is pretty good.   
The other realm, we were just disappointed with things we had worked on very hard in terms of taking care of the ball better, we didn't go a very good job of that.   And we just did not shoot the three‑ball well.   That made it awful difficult on us.   
They are ‑‑ they have a chance to be really, really special.   Obviously, you guys all know this.   
Their length, their athletic, they defend, their physical, and there's really not a whole lot of weakness on the defensive end of that basketball team.   They're really good.   
So, I don't know if we'll play anybody the rest of the year that defends the ball quite the way they do or defends as well as that.   What I am pleased about is, I think our big fellow showed that he can play.   I'm pleased with that.   Just like he showed the last year and the year before.   Having 22 and 13 going against two big guys most of the time.   And with us not knocking down threes, it allowed them the luxury to play even more off on to him.   
So there is pressure on to us knock down threes, to help spread the floor.   We tried different ways to get the floor spread, really didn't do a very good job until later in the game.   Giving him some good isolation looks where he got to play a little bit.   Outside of that, Bill Self does an awful good job, something you guys know too well.   
  
 Q.   On Devonte  Graham s game?  
COACH WILLIAMS:   He did a really good job.   He's an awful nice player.   I thought him making shots really helped them.   He started knocking down a few shots for them and it really helped a great deal.   
He's got such a nice feel for the game.   He got the crowd definitely into the game.   I thought they capitalized when the crowd got into the game both halves.   
They did a good job, at the same time, I like the fact that we regained our composure and cut back down the lead.   But Graham's a very special player.   They knew that when they got him.   
   
 Q.   What type of things could you improve on from tonight?  
COACH WILLIAMS:   I thought we turned the ball over and that led to some easy buckets and that hurts.   
We didn't rebound the ball very well in the second half, so they got several second shots.   It is pretty tough to consistently defend when you don't make shots.   
I thought we wilted a little bit when we couldn't make shots.   You saw our guys  heads drop down, and I thought they capitalized on that.   So we made some turnover mistakes that gave them quick transition buckets and then they capitalized on some offensive rebounds and put-backs.   
  
 Q. How did you adjust to KU s defense?  
COACH WILLIAMS:   I'm relatively pleased with our shot selection.   Some weren't so good, but for the most part, we got pretty good shots.   
I thought they sped us up with the ball and we made some mistakes.   I encouraged our guys to get further from the basket.   
I wanted to actually spread the floor even more with the hope to get some penetration, or if they're really going to chase us that far, to hope to give Alan a little more room to go to work.   They're just awful good.   I mean, they're good.
