  THE MODERATOR:   If you'd just start with an opening statement, T.J., about getting drafted by the Suns.   
T.J. WARREN:   Getting drafted by the Suns means a lot.   It's a truly blessed situation.   I'm excited to get out there.   Looking forward to it.  
   
 Q.   T.J., can you talk a little bit about the role David West had in your development and what it felt like to have him here to support you today.   
T.J. WARREN:   David has been a mentor to me at a very young age.   Since I was 10 years old, just learning from him from the game.   It means a lot to me.  
   
 Q.   T.J., we spoke yesterday in the elevator.   We said maybe this range.   Now you're going to Phoenix.   What was it about the workout process that brought you to this level and ultimately got you drafted?   
T.J. WARREN:   I felt like I had strong workouts.   The Phoenix Suns was one of my best workouts.   I did a lot of great things there, and it showed today.   I'm very fortunate to be in this position.  
   
 Q.   Are you going to keep dunking on everybody?   
T.J. WARREN:   Yes, sir.   
   
 Q.   Any qualms about leaving the Research Triangle for the very hot desert of Phoenix?   
T.J. WARREN:   Not at all.   I'm excited to get out there.   It's going to be a different environment, but I'm going to adjust very well and be ready to play from day one.   
   
 Q.   T.J., Phoenix, the offense is very wide open.   Talk about how your versatile offensive game can be able to contribute to their offensive prowess.   
T.J. WARREN:   I think my style of play fits very well.   I like to get up in transition for easy baskets, running the floor very hard.   Their style of play matches my style of play.   So it's a perfect fit.   
Thank you.
