<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about those two three-point shots that you hit, extremely huge and kept the momentum going for your team? </p>
<p>	Q.  You guys have been pretty up and down all season.  You've had some really great moments and not so great moments.  What's the difference?  What do you do better when you're playing well and winning? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could either one or both of you talk about the rematch you're going to have with UNM? </p>

<p>	Q.  Ladies, what was it about the zone that had you guys kind of off there in the first half when they switched to it? </p>

<p>	Q.  Coach Miller, Ashley Elliott, the last shot she took in the last five minutes was the three-pointer that rimmed out at the buzzer, did you do anything special, really try to limit her touches?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the strides that Wyoming has made under Coach Legerski?  Obviously they seemed to be going in a real positive direction. </p>
<p>	Q.  Your team has not been a great free-throw shooting team, but not bad.  Tonight you really shot lights out from the line.  Is there any explanation as to why?</p>
<p>	Q.  I just wanted to ask you about the match-up with New Mexico, and I guess what it takes to beat them.  Obviously there have been some close games this season. </p>
<p>	Q.  Your kids thrive off the UNM crowd.  They seem to be the only team in the pit that can take it for 40 minutes.  Usually teams come in and love it for 30 minutes and hate it the last ten. </p>
