  Q. Talk about being in The Finals again.   
 SASHA VUJACIC: Well, obviously it's a very exciting thing to be part of the team, second year in a row you made it to The Finals, and I'm very excited for it. This year we've just got to do a better job at winning.  
  
  Q. How are you going to stop all the wing shooters?  
 SASHA VUJACIC: Playing good basketball, playing good defense and playing smart as a team. Individually you can't stop anyone in basketball, you've got to play good team defense, and if we are ready for that challenge, it's going to show tomorrow.   
  
  Q. What do you bring to the Lakers' game?   
 SASHA VUJACIC: We'll see. Whatever I'm asked to do. If I'm asked to play defense, I'm going to play defense. If they ask me to be more aggressive on offense, I'll do that. But whatever I do, I know it's going to be in the team's interest.
