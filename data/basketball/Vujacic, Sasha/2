 Q. Do you feel like you found a rhythm? 
 SASHA VUJACIC: I think the thing we have, every time somebody is going to come up like that. Yesterday I had the opportunity to fill in the game a little bit better than other players. My teammates gave me open looks, and I just felt like I was involved. When you're involved in offense, good things will happen. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 SASHA VUJACIC: Most definitely. I mean, we've been working hard. We have to play hard for 48 minutes, never give up against them, and that's the important thing.

 Q. On a night when all your teammates were struggling other than Kobe from the field, why were you able to have great success last night? 
 SASHA VUJACIC: I think I just kind of -- every single time when I came into the game I was involved on offense, and my teammates did a great job giving me those open looks, and we moved the basketball on offense very good last night. We didn't play good, but we played collectively good, so I think that was the key, passing the ball. 

 Q. Do you feel you have to do that again, or is it there for Jordan or for someone else?
 SASHA VUJACIC: I think our team is very deep, so we don't care who's going to score 10, 15 or 20 or 40 points, we just care to win. What we have to do in the next game probably we've got to play a little bit smarter and take advantage of their defense. Any night someone else is going to step up and help out the team.

 Q. You're still down 2-1. Do you feel pressure there? 
 SASHA VUJACIC: Not at all. Yesterday was a great feeling being back at Staples Center having our home crowd behind us, and they were there for 48 minutes. They didn't want to give up, we didn't want to give up. We didn't play great basketball, but we were fighting. Whenever you fight, obviously people appreciate that and that's why we don't want to give up.
