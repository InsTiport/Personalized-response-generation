Q. You guys are going up against Matt Haarms who is 7'3".  How often do you guys play guys who are over 7 feet and what kind of mismatch does that present for you guys?
PHIL BOOTH: We play a lot of guys like that.  I mean, last game we played against Hunter from St. Mary's about 6'11".  In the championship game, we played against Seton Hall, Romaro Gill is about 7'2".  We played a lot of guys over 7 feet.  Michigan has someone that's 7'1".  So we still learning how to deal with guys with that much height.  Haarms bring a lot of skill to it as well.  He'll present some challenges.
JERMAINE SAMUELS: Going off what Booth said, you now he's a really, really big guy.  We'll discuss as a team how to deal with that and execute on the defensive end.
Q. You had a lot of big buckets down the stretch yesterday.  What do you need to do to start off the game hot and continue that momentum tomorrow night?
JERMAINE SAMUELS: I would just say, just staying confident, staying ready.  My teammates and my coaches are always going find ways to put me in positions to score and make plays.  And as long as I look to score, be aggressive, the rest should take care of itself.
Q. Phil, what is it that you've seen from Purdue that would concern you especially on the defensive end?
PHIL BOOTH: They do a lot of great things offensively.  So many shooters.  Of course, Edwards is averaging over 20 a game.  He can really take over a game.  They have, between Cline and Eifert, great shooters, and inside they have Haarms, and they have a guy like -- No. 20, I can't remember his name.  Eastern who can do it all.  He handles the ball, finishes, does a lot of good things for them, passes the ball very well, they have a lot of different guys can beat you.
Q. Phil, you mentioned Carson Edwards.  He's such a high-volume shooter and high-volume scorer, and you've seen a lot of those guys.  And without giving away your game plan, which I don't expect you guys to do, I mean, how do you guys like to contend with a guy who has that possibility of going off and changing the game all by himself?
PHIL BOOTH: Those type of guys are very dangerous.  Between Markus Howard this season, Miles Powell and now Carsen Edwards, those guys can take over a game and dominate, go for 30 or 40 if you let them get in a rhythm.  Just trying to make everything difficult on these shots.  He's the type of guy that can get going no matter what the defense is giving him.
