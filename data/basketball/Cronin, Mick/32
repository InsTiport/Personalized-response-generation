St. Joseph's - 78, Cincinnati - 76   
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with an opening statement from coach and then take questions for the student-athletes.   
COACH CRONIN: I feel terrible for my team.  They played extremely hard.  They fought back from being down early, playing with one of our best players on one leg, Clark, from an ankle injury suffered last week.   
Quadri Moore played the best game of his career for us for eight minutes and then blew his ankle.   
And Shaq Thomas has got a torn groin.  That being said, we still had a chance to win against one of the hottest teams in the country.  Kids found a way to battle back through playing four guard offenses that we haven't played all year, four guard lineups, I meant.  We haven't played that way all season.   
So, I'm just really appreciative of my guys' effort.  Congrats to St. Joseph's, I just feel really, obviously, feel bad for my team right now.  Especially my seniors.   
THE MODERATOR: Questions?   
 Q.  Troy, can you describe what you're feeling right now?  
TROY CAUPAIN: Yeah, I'm not happy.  I'm very upset the game ended the way it ended.  As a player, I feel the same way as you would feel if you lost a game like that.   
THE MODERATOR: All right.  We'll dismiss these two gentlemen if there are no more questions.  Thank you.  Take questions for coach.   
 Q.  It didn't appear the refs made a call on the floor of whether the dunk was good or not.  Did you have a problem with that and --  
COACH CRONIN: I have no comment on officiating.   
THE MODERATOR: All right.  Thank you.
