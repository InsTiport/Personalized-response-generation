 Q.  How were you guys able to pick up your momentum in the second half?  
KAMARIA MCDANIEL: We came in here at halftime, and we said we wanted to keep pushing.  In previous games, we always got up and things like that, and then the team would make a run.   
We wanted to make sure that we didn't let that happen today, and just us playing as a team, playing unselfish, playing team defense and staying true to our team principles on offense and defense, that really led us to keep pushing and increase our lead.  It just felt good.   
 Q.  Do you feel good going into your second game with Michigan?  
KAMARIA MCDANIEL: Yes, we feel very good.  I am excited.
