THE MODERATOR:   Coach Anderson, your thoughts?   
COACH ANDERSON:   Sure.   I was really proud of our guys.   We came out and I thought we played really hard.   We got some buckets early.   We played some different defenses to see if we could slow them down a little bit.   They're a great team, so it doesn't work forever, but it worked for a while.   
I thought we kind of had the game speed where we wanted it.   We didn't feel like we could run up and down, and we wanted to try to shorten the game a little bit, but then we obviously turned the ball over way too much and made a bunch of points off that.   
But I'm really proud of our guys.   We're a young team.   We're a new team.   Came over here and we battled.   We battled all the way to the end.   So looking forward to getting back and getting a few hours rest and put this one away and play again tomorrow early.  
   
 Q.   Montaque, just how tough was the last three minutes of the first half in terms of the momentum?   You guys were tied and they made a little spurt there?   
MONTAQUE GILL‑CEASAR:   I just think we gave them a little bit too easy buckets.   I think we played a little soft on defense, so that was something we talked about when we went into the locker room.   That's just something that we as players need to take a mental note of.   We can't leave a half like that.   
   
 Q.   Keith, the turnovers tonight, how much did you feel like that was Arizona's defense, and how much was it you guys just not being able to set?   
KEITH SHAMBURGER:   I think it's just a little bit of both.   We didn't make the correct passes and the pressure.   So I mean, we can't really blame one thing.   I think it was both.  
   
 Q.   Keith, can you just talk about your first game back here on the islands and how it felt being over here, man?   
KEITH SHAMBURGER:   Yeah, it felt good to be back and just go out there and compete with my team.   We found a lot of things that we need to find out today.   I'm glad we found out this is a hard‑nosed team and we're going to give it our all every minute of the game.   That is going to get us a long way.   As long as we keep playing like that, we're going to keep getting better and better.   I mean, that was the number two team in the nation, and we really did our thing out there.   I think we're just going to keep getting better and better every day.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach Anderson.  
   
 Q.   Coach, Arizona's noted for their defense.   How much was that pressure?   How much trouble did it give you tonight?   
COACH ANDERSON:   I thought as the game wore on I thought it was really good.   We did a good job early of trying to keep the game shorter, trying to make the court smaller.   They're a very athletic group.   We have good athletes.   They have great athletes, and they have a bunch of them, so we were going to try to force them to make jump shots.   It worked for a while.   But like any good team, they came back and did a great job.   
Their defense was good.   It put pressure on us.   It forced us to be uncomfortable.   You look at the stats, they had, what?   24 points off turnovers, and basically that was the difference in the game.  
   
 Q.   As much as you want to come here and win the game, how curious were you to have your team compete against a number two team in the country?   
COACH ANDERSON:   I was really‑‑ like I said, I was really proud of them.   Arizona is better than us.   I'm not going to sit here and say, hey, we're better than Arizona.   We're not.   I knew coming into this game that we'd have to play perfect to win, and I think we had a good game plan.   But when it got down to it they exposed us a little bit.   We were zoning some, and we don't zone a lot.   They were getting over ball screen, making shots, and making plays.   I think their big guys are really good too.   There were times I thought we had them guarded, and they jumped up and shot over us.   So I congratulate them.   
Again, I'm proud of the way our guys played.   We have competed in every game.   If we keep doing that, then we'll have some success.  
   
 Q.   What kind of challenges does Purdue present from what you saw today?   
COACH ANDERSON:   Big time.   Play really, really hard.   I didn't get to see the whole game, but the part of the game I saw I thought was really a physical game.   So we're going to have to match that physicality on a short turnaround.   They've got the same deal.   They've got two and a half hours more rest than we did, so good team.   Got a couple of good shooters.   Strong inside game.   It will be a tough game for us.   I think it will be a great game.   I'm excited about playing them.   I think they're a good team.   They're well‑coached.   That's why we're here to find out about our team and find out what we need to do to get better.   I think we're still young, we're still new, we're still trying to find each other.
