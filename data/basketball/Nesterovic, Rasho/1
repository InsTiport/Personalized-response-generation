<p>	Q.  What about Ginobili, the story about him, the controversy? </p>
<p>	Q.  Rasho, are you worried about the long layoff?</p>
<p>	Q.  How frustrating is it over the last couple of series to play not as much as you're used to playing?</p>
<p>	Q.  With their front line as big as it is, you know, there will be some fouls and stuff out there, do you expect you'll get more playing time in this series than the last couple? </p>

<p>	Q.  It's not just the teams but you feel you're a big part of the teams, because you've made some big shots over the years. </p>
