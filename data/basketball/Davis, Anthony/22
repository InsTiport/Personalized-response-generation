Q. Anthony, you've been in the league for a while.  What's been one of the craziest bets you've seen on or off the court?
ANTHONY DAVIS: Craziest bet?
Q. Any bet you've made with your teammates?
ANTHONY DAVIS: No, I don't make bets during the game.  I bet we'll win, but that's really it.
Q. Talk about the tight race in the West.
ANTHONY DAVIS: I think three to tenth or ninth or something like that in the West is like three or four games, so just got to go out there and play.  I think it will come down to the wire.  Guys just got to go out there and play.  Each team is good.  Each team is going up, dropping each and every week.  So it's up for grabs for sure.
Q. With or without Kawhi Leonard is it too early to count the Spurs out?
ANTHONY DAVIS: No, never.  You'll never count the Spurs out.  They're third in the West.  How can you count them out?
Q. What's on your pregame playlist as far as music?
ANTHONY DAVIS: Everything.  I switch it up.  I go hip-hop, R&B, '90s music.  It just depends on how I'm feeling that day.
Q. Do you have a favorite artist, maybe someone you have on repeat?
ANTHONY DAVIS: No, I just kind of put it on shuffle and let it go.
Q. Who is your favorite rookie in the league?
ANTHONY DAVIS: Frank Jackson.
Q. This is an exciting rookie class this year.
ANTHONY DAVIS: Yeah, for sure, all these guys.  Dennis Smith, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, all these guys have been playing out of their minds.  [Lauri] Markkanen and them, all these guys are really hooping right now.  Doing it for teams that are fighting for playoff spots.  They've got big roles, so it's been a great rookie class.
Q. Who is your Rookie of the Year right now?
ANTHONY DAVIS: I don't know.  I mean, it's going to come down to the wire, though.  There's a lot of guys that are playing well right now.
Q. What is your earliest memory of the NBA?
ANTHONY DAVIS: Oh, probably Shaq dancing with the Jabbawockeez and all that.  Him and LeBron dancing at half court.  It was always something with Shaq, though.  He was trying to make sure his presence was felt.
Q. Thoughts on Dwyane Wade going back to Miami?
ANTHONY DAVIS: Yeah, it brings another vet to the team.  A guy who is loved in Miami, who loves Miami.  I think he can get them into that playoff spot.
