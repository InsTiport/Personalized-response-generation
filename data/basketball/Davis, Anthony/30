Q.   Do you have a lot of people looking for tickets?
ANTHONY DAVIS:   Not really.   They have nowhere to stay.   All the hotels are taken. 

Q.   They could stay with you?
ANTHONY DAVIS:   Oh, no, man.   But they love basketball.   They came down for a game, so they know they will have more opportunities to do so, and so they definitely understand that.

Q.   What did you dream about if you didn't dream this high?   If you weren't dreaming this high, what were you dreaming about?
ANTHONY DAVIS:   I wasn't sure.   There was one point where I didn't even think I was good enough to make it to the league and one point where I didn't know whether I even wanted to play basketball just because going into my senior year I wasn't getting any college looks. 
I didn't know what I was supposed to be doing.   So there was just a lot going through my head.   And then my uncles and my dad came in and they said keep playing, keep pushing it.   And now I'm here. 

Q.   Were you thinking of another career?
ANTHONY DAVIS:   Oh, no, I don't know.   I'm not sure what I would be doing or what I would have been doing, but probably a coach maybe.   Somewhere around basketball, because I love the game. 
I didn't know if I was good enough to ‑‑ everybody doesn't make it, you know.   And I thought I was going to be one of those guys. 

Q.   Are you surprised you're this good?
ANTHONY DAVIS:   Well, this is all hard work and dedication.   I stayed in the gym last summer trying to get better, and I'm doing the same thing this summer.   And I have a lot to work on. 
And to be selected in the All‑Star Game and the numbers that I'm putting up is amazing, but I know that I have a lot to do.
