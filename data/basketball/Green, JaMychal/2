  Q. Obviously families are coming into the bubble now; who are you expecting from your clan, and how much is that going to mean to you?
 JAMYCHAL GREEN:   I've got my kids and my girlfriend coming down once it gets closer to Conference Finals.  We just want to be about business right now.
 Q. Have you sensed maybe a renewed sense of energy as friends and family are entering the bubble?  I know it's been a trying last week for you guys.
 JAMYCHAL GREEN:   Yeah, you see a lot of smiles on the players' faces when they come back to the hotel now.  Kids tend to do that for you.
 Q. You and we all know that there's not much to do here.  Did you have any reservations about having your kids come in, given that?
 JAMYCHAL GREEN:   I kind of pushed them out just for that reason.  I didn't want them to come here and get bored.  My kids like to play, like to go outside, so there's really not much here to do.
