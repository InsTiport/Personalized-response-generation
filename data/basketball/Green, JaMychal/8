THE MODERATOR:   We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then take questions for the student‑athletes.   
COACH GRANT:   It's obviously a difficult loss for us.   Really, really proud of the effort our guys gave us tonight and over the course of the year.   I think this was a basketball team that grew over the course of the season and it was really, really important for this team I think in our maturation to get to the NCAA tournament and to try to have some success.   Today wasn't our day.   
You've got to give Creighton credit; they made the plays that they had to make to put themselves in position.   But in my mind it doesn't diminish what this team was able to accomplish over the course of the season, extremely proud of the efforts of our entire team.   It's been an honor and a privilege to coach our only senior, JaMychal Green, obviously would have liked him to experience success in this tournament, but unfortunately for us our season ends here today.   But again, just proud of what our guys have accomplished over the course of the year.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions first for the student‑athletes.   
   
 Q.   Take us through your view of that final play.   
ANDREW STEELE:   We got the ball to Trevor and he tried his best to get an attempt up, and I guess on the way up he lost the ball and he couldn't get a clean look at it.   
JAMYCHAL GREEN:   I agree with him.   Coach drew up a good play, but they packed it in on the inside and we was forced to take a jump shot and Trevor just didn't get it off.   
   
 Q.   For both players, just talk about coming down the stretch when they made a‑‑ from about the six‑minute mark, y'all really struggled to score for four or five minutes there.   What were they doing particularly to you inside, JaMychal?   
JAMYCHAL GREEN:   They were doubling me, big on big.   So I just tried my best to kick it out to the open player.   
   
 Q.   McDermott did a good job in the post tonight.   Was there any special game plan aspect for you that didn't go really the way you wanted to in tonight's game?  
JAMYCHAL GREEN:   I think we did a good job of guarding him.   They just ran some good plays to get him free, and he just got it up quick.   
   
 Q.   Was that play originally going to you or how was that play, final play designed?   
JAMYCHAL GREEN:   It was drew up to look at me on the inside and for Trevor at the top.   But they clogged it up on the inside so I wasn't able to get it, so we tried to get it to Trevor so he could make a play.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thanks, guys.   You guys can head back.   We'll take questions for coach.   
   
 Q.   On the inbounds with 4.7, you got it in and called a timeout.   What did you see?   Did they switch to zone or what did they do?  
COACH GRANT:   They switched to zone and we had a man play on, so I tried to get a quick timeout to give our guys something to go with.   
   
 Q.   Same question, can you take us through your thoughts on that final play?  
COACH GRANT:   We were looking to go inside with the play, they did a good job.   They were man‑to‑man coming pack out of the timeout.   They went zone and we figured they were going to go zone, so we tried to overload a corner, tried to pop Releford to the top hoping that maybe we could be able to throw it inside as they got extended.   But they did a good job, they closed out on the ball and affected the shot.   
   
 Q.   Did it look like there was any contact on that shot from where you were standing?  
COACH GRANT:   I can't judge that right now; I would have to go back and look at it.   
   
 Q.   In the broadest sense, didn't you feel like you got the game you wanted, held them to 58, well below?   Isn't this the game you wanted even though it didn't quite turn out at the end?   
COACH GRANT:   Well, I thought in the first half our defense really set the tone.   I thought the second half kind of played to their tempo.   They turned it up, their intensity, their aggressiveness turned up.   You look at the numbers they shot in the second half as compared to the first half, probably told the difference there.   Then their ability to shoot the 3‑point shot, we had breakdowns on a couple of possessions where they were able to knock down threes and that's what they do.   So from the standpoint of what we wanted to do defensively, it's never about how many points they score or anything like that, but it's more in terms of making sure we limit the opportunities they get, making sure that we do a good job on the offensive end finding quality shots.   They did a good job in the second half defensively limiting some of the things that we were able to have success with in the first half and early in the second half.   They really did a good job of turning up their intensity.   
THE MODERATOR:   All right.   Thank you, coach.
