 THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and have an opening statement from Coach Ryan and then take questions for the student-athletes.   
 COACH RYAN: Well, I realize the time, so I'll let the student-athletes get their opportunity to answer any and all questions that you might have. Because they performed so well tonight and stuck in there and hung tough when things weren't going very well. So I'm very excited for them that they still get to keep playing.   
 And I'll let you guys ask them whatever you want to ask them.   
  
  Q. Trevon Hughes, this is for you, you and Jordan were guarding Mr. Douglas so actively tonight, and really working hard to defend him and just wondering what it was like for you then to work so hard all that game and then hit that shot at the end and what did that feel like?   
 TREVON HUGHES: It was just throughout the whole game I wasn't myself. I was making bonehead plays and Coach put me in with the ball in my hand at the end, and it meant a lot. It meant he had trust in me to keep me on the floor and put the ball in my hands. I owed it to my teammates, I didn't want this to be the last game. I told myself, Attack, attack. If I got stopped, look for my shooter J-Bo, if he was open, but I got the foul and the one.   
  
  Q. Jason, kind of take us through that deep three that you had back in regulation. I think the shot clock was winding down and Joe found you.   
 JASON BOHANNON: We were working the shot clock looking for a good shot and we ran ball screen and we kicked it back out to Joe and Joe pump faked and made two dribbles. And I just kept moving, trying to find an open spot and if they found me, great. If not, if we got a better shot, it was even greater.   
 But Joe made a great play, pump faking, drawing two defenders and kicking it out to me. I didn't even realize how far out I was. I was just catch and shoot and just getting in rhythm.   
  
  Q. Trevon Hughes, talk about what the plan was on that last play and sort of what you saw and how that play developed.   
 TREVON HUGHES: Basically come off the screen from my big man, either me or J-Bo, and they left me open and they let me get it and they let me make a play. Basically I got in the lane and did what I had to do and that's get the W.   
  
  Q. Joe and Marcus, talk about the way you guys battled back in the second half after going down 12.   
 JOE KRABBENHOFT: We had a good talk in the locker room before Coach came in and then he came in and got us even more fired up to go out there and just give it our all. It was 20 minutes that was guaranteed to us and nothing after that. And we said, Hey, let's take advantage of those 20 minutes and on both ends of the floor and every loose ball has got to be ours. If you got the shot, shoot it. Knock them down. Smile, have fun. Go out there and just have a ball.   
 And man, we played with such emotion that we really willed ourselves to that victory. And of course, you have to make shots and these two guys did a great job of doing that. Other guys did. But no, it was a lot of heart and desire out there and I'm just proud of -- proud to be part of this team.   
 MARCUS LANDRY: Well, the whole game it was something that was really sticking to me after the end of my sophomore year after losing to UNLV, I had a coaches meeting with Coach and he told me something that's been sticking with me for a long time, he said: It's half time, sophomore going into my junior year. And time goes so fast and it is my fourth quarter here and I'm just trying to make the best of it.   
 I didn't have the best game, but my teammates really picked us up and we're a team, we play together. And I just went out there with a desire to grab some rebounds, do something to help this team. Because my guys, my teammates -- I wasn't pleased with my performance in the beginning, but I just stuck it out and tried to get over the hump and just grab some rebounds, do something. And my teammates really came through. It was a big battle. They have a lot of big guys down low, but we fought all the way through.   
  
  Q. Jason, talk about just being able to put some of those shots out of your mind. I think you had two air balls, but you also came back and drilled about three or four of them in the last ten minutes of the game. Just a shooter's mentality?   
 JASON BOHANNON: Yeah, I didn't really let it bother me at all. They didn't come off great. The ones that went in came off good and they felt good. As a shooter you just got to keep shooting it and hope -- you know, it's all feel and my teammates did a great job of finding me in rhythm. Trevon Hughes found me and Joe did and Jordan had a great one on the baseline too. Right with him, I went up, and they felt great going up.   
  
  Q. Jason and Marcus, describe in a little bit of detail what the locker room felt like at half time and if anybody said anything particularly memorable?   
 JASON BOHANNON: Half time, we didn't play a great half of basketball. And we came in and we knew we needed to start playing how we know how to play. Joe was talking to us and told us we got to keep playing, they want to keep playing, it's 0-0 right now. And Coach came in and said the same thing, he said it's a new half of basketball and it's 0-0.   
 And that was our mentality, keep working every possession, getting our points every possession and holding them each and every possession. Because one possession came down to be the difference in the game and that really paid off with that mentality.   
 MARCUS LANDRY: In the locker room it was great. I found myself coming into the locker room thinking about what happened the first half. But Joe got up and talked and said some things and it really got my spirits lifted. And he told us, Hey, we got one more half to play, we got 20 minutes of basketball. It's not over. And like they said, Coach came and said the same thing, you know, 0-0. He pointed out some things we needed to do better and we came out and first five minutes we got off to a great start and the way we finished the game was tremendous.   
  
  Q. Joe or Marcus, talk a bit about watching Trevon Hughes make that big play there at the end of the game and sort of stepping up in that situation.   
 MARCUS LANDRY: Well, he got the ball and I was trying to find like a little open spot because I kind of figured that my man would go and double him, which he did. After he turned around and he like kind of did the spin, I saw J-Bo, so I was like, Okay, he's getting ready to pass to J-Bo. And I know J-Bo is going to put it up, but Trevon Hughes saw a little hole to the basket, drew the contact and it went up. And all I was thinking was to try to get on the glass and get a tip in if it doesn't go. But thank God we got the foul and the one and it was a great play. He was really strong with the ball on that particular play.   
 JOE KRABBENHOFT: We have been through so many situations in practice, I'm sure there was 8.3 seconds up there at some point this year and Coach said, Make a play. And so it's -- we do those type of things. So guys are ready. Guys know we got to get a shot up, don't settle for a step back jumper like they do in a different league and just get to the rim, make a play. Players make plays. Put the ball in Trevon's hand and he did a great job and I knew something good, I just had a good feeling. I think everybody did. We were excited we got that ball and Trevon did a great job.   
 THE MODERATOR: Okay. We'll excuse the student-athletes and take questions for Coach Ryan.  
 COACH RYAN: Actually what Marcus said was he was due. Trevon was due.   
  
  Q. What did your team do better offensively after half time?   
 COACH RYAN: Let's go to -- take a look at those shots we had in the first half, how wide open -- we were actually surprised that we had that many open looks after either penetration, a kick, a skip pass. We actually had some pretty good looks. So it's not -- you're not in a panic mode knowing that defensively the guys are committed.   
 They worked at it, a couple things early, that I'll tell you how ingrained our guys are. We have been playing ball screens a certain way for the last 10 games, 12 games, because of certain reasons. But right away on the first couple possessions they got two drives to the rim. So you noticed I subbed immediately and then had to remind them, Guys -- just, you know, habits were formed, we were doing things a certain way, but against these guys we have got to do this, this and this. And then after that we made it a lot tougher for them to get to the rim.   
 But offensively for us, I thought we did pretty well. We didn't turn it over. Couple shot clock things, but we weren't even trying to run the shot clock down. We were trying to get good looks.   
 The guys are actually lying. I only said one thing. My motivation at half time was, Jon Leuer, you got to hit a couple shots here in the second half. Jon was 0-7 in the first half. So my half time talk didn't do any good at all. I'm just kidding. Jon's a good kid. Jon's going to come out on Sunday and he's going to knock some shots down. He'll be fine.   
  
  Q. Talk about the six-game losing streak and all those close games. You had so many close losses, did that play?  
 COACH RYAN: We had some close wins too. We had some, if you check those scores as you go down, everybody only wants to look at one side of the ledger. We won a lot of games five or less points as a differential, which usually means two possessions.   
  
  Q. Did that play a role tonight, the fact that you've been in so many close games?  
 COACH RYAN: Absolutely. But, you know, in the Big-10 you're going to be in a lot of those grinders. That was a grinder. Then there's probably going to be more.   
  
  Q. First off, great game, congratulations. You guys are down by one, nine seconds, eight seconds, you're pushing the ball up the court. Can you walk me through that last timeout.   
 COACH RYAN: Yeah, what we do is there is one left. So we got it in. And what I do is I always look right away if there's people in the paint because we're going to push it. Sometimes teams get ahead or they relax and they spread out defensively. But the way that they got back, Florida State got back, it was okay, timeout. Then we'll have to run a half court play. In transition if they're not in position we attack and then I'm the one calling the timeout. They know our rules.   
 And so, you know, J-Bo waited until -- or somebody, after the timeout was called, and then he shot it again. He did the same thing at Ohio State a couple years ago. I think it went in both times. He just wanted to practice.   
  
  Q. Talk about what you wanted to do with that last play.   
 COACH RYAN: Oh, that was the mindset on the timeout. Now, we got to play again. It could be somebody from Xavier again. I can't -- I can't tell you everything. But every coach knows and every player knows when he's out there on the floor, somebody's going to make a play. If you have two guys out there that can make a play, J-Bo got the ball in his hands and made the great pass out to Jordan Taylor, who was wide open. That shot almost went down and then we don't even have to worry about the overtime.   
 But we have some guys that are capable of making plays and we either go flat, we either go cross screens, we either -- there's a rub screen at the top, depending upon what we have seen in the scouting report what other teams do, and then they might change up. So then there's what we have in our mind to do, Okay, if they don't do that, here's the counter. And we do situations; five seconds on the clock, eight, ten, two seconds. You didn't hear about Devon Harris telling everybody that's why he made that shot that game? Because we practiced those last second situation, you probably didn't catch that.   
  
  Q. Talk about what Keaton gave you tonight .  
 COACH RYAN: He drew a charge. The guys were carrying him around on their shoulders in the locker room. You know how long we have been trying to get Keaton to take a charge? One of the coaches took him in the training room and had him fall backwards, keep practicing falling backward on a mat. He never took a charge in high school. Never took a charge. You can't play here and not take a charge, not for me.   
 He was tough. Knocked down some shots. Got some confidence going. I think he was even talking to himself when he went down the court a couple times. Did you see the lips moving? He wasn't trash talking, that's Keaton getting himself going. We knew we had him ready then.   
  
  Q. What did you do differently in the second half defensively to slow them down? Because they were on fire in the first half.   
 COACH RYAN: You know, to keep emphasizing about Douglas, to contain him, we stopped giving up the easy ones around the rim. The one put-back where the guy got the follow-up, dunked it, pulled himself up and smacked the back board, they got a lot of momentum right after that happened and we had to cut into that. That's when they kind of separated.   
 So what we did was we tried not to let them get any of those kind of plays that motivates the other team to play even harder and do even better and fire them up. So I thought we did a good job in not giving them any of those opportunities.   
  
  Q. There was talk about being aggressive offensively, but on defense I know Douglas had five turnovers, you guys scored 24 points off turnovers. Can you talk about just that mentality of the defense, how well that worked for you tonight?  
 COACH RYAN: We didn't just come into this game and say, Okay, let's be aggressive. You have to understand that. Are you from -- have you seen us play?   
  
  Q. I know about you.   
 COACH RYAN: Okay. So we're trying not to give up easy stuff. It might look like it some games, but we're trying not to. But the fact that we turned it over only nine times against a very athletic team like that and the way they were denying the ball and Douglas, Douglas is so tough defensively on Hughes he really kind of took Trevon Hughes out of a lot of things. And fortunately at the end he had at least one good one in him as far as finishing around the rim.   
 But defensively that's how we -- we do try to play that way all the time. Helps when the ball goes in at the other end for us too. So 50 percent in the second half, 60 percent in overtime, that makes a difference.   
  
  Q. Trevon Hughes mentioned that he wasn't too impressed with how he played tonight, but I noticed he still had 39 minutes, of course. Talk about how important it is for him to be on the court and to lead the team.   
 COACH RYAN: Well, because he has the experience. He's been in these situations. And I've never had a young man play for me that didn't get better, that didn't make himself better. Not talking about me, as the only motivator, but trying to give direction, and Trevon Hughes at times has struggled getting a lot of attention from the other team, maybe forcing something here or there. But if I didn't think he could play, would he have played 39 minutes? No. So we still believe in him. But we still have to keep teaching. I call it that. I don't know what they call it.   
  
  Q. I was noticing in the second half things were getting pretty physical between Joe and 32, Alabi, forearms and things like that down the court.   
 COACH RYAN: Was there?   
  
  Q. How do you keep your team from not losing their cool and staying plugged into the game situation like that?  
 COACH RYAN: We're always talking to them about how that will hurt your team. How it doesn't help. How it -- I mean, you can't get pushed around. Physically you have to stand your ground, move your feet. But if you're worried more about trying to bump somebody here or getting a shot in there or whatever, then you're not playing basketball.   
 It's like I've always said about on the playground, when guys start wolfing, and something breaks out, my theory was, I always went after the guy that was talking the most when we had to go after. In baseball, guys go after the guy that was talking the most. You're usually safer. So if there was talk going, I don't know. They were playing. I didn't see anything. Maybe you had a better seat than I did.   
 THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, Coach.   
 COACH RYAN: You bet.
