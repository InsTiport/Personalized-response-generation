<p>	Q.  Now you kind of have the waiting period before selection Sunday.  What is this next 48 hours going to be like; a little uneasy, confident? </p>
<p>	Q.  This is again for both players.  Perspective from the floor about what happened in that last ten minutes, you got six points; what is your take?  What was happening out there? </p>

<p>	Q.  You never got the outside shooting going today.  Great outside shooting yesterday.  How big was it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jared started out, I think you had 12 of the team's first 18 points; did it kind of wear on you over time or was it their defense more that kind of slowed you down? </p>
<p>	Q.  Was fatigue a factor?  I know you guys have played obviously yesterday and seems a lot of energy obviously has been expended, minutes all that; how did that play a factor in the last few minutes?</p>


<p>	Q.  Coach, Tech had 12 turnovers at halftime, only three turnovers in the second half.  Can you talk about how well that you thought that they handled, countered your defensive pressure in the second half compared to the first?</p>
<p>	Q.  How proud are you of this team from being 8 and 8 to being where you guys are right now and being talked about as being an NCAA team?</p>
<p>	Q.  If the NCAA selection committee only picked 5 teams from the Big 12 you think you are more deserved than Texas to get that fifth bid?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about your team.</p>
