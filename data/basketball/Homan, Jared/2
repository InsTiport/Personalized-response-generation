<p>	Q.  Rahshon and Jared, is it hard when you are up 21 to 1 and it is a game like that to keep that intensity level up or because you know what is at stake with this tournament you can let it ride it through? </p>

<p>	Q.  I know it's kind of a broken record now; how do you feel about your N.C.A.A. chances; does this kind of sew it up you think a little?  What is your best guess at this point?</p>

<p>	Q.  Do you have initial thoughts on matching up with Texas Tech again?</p>
<p>	Q.  Baylor hadn't played in a tournament in two years.  You got on 'em  pretty quick.  Do you think they might have been a little shellshocked when you jumped on them 17 to nothing? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about that opening three you get; how big was that for your confidence just getting off to a career-high game?</p>
<p>	Q.  I noticed as you came out in the introductions, kind of get together, your teammates -- Curtis had to remind you, hey you have got to go out and shake hands.  Then you come out and light it up.  Take me through maybe the opening minutes a little bit and the atmosphere and your reaction. </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the challenge and importance of keeping Bruce in check?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can it be difficult for a team to keeps its concentration after you got the big early lead?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk a little bit about Texas Tech and how difficult it might be for you guys to turnaround less than 24 hours and play back-to-back games?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does this do it for you as far as getting to the big dance?</p>
<p>	Q.  The first eight minutes, was this just another case of how your offense kind of fuels your defense and vice versa?</p>
<p>	Q.  When a game goes like this when you are standing over there, what are the things you are looking for and looking at?</p>
<p>	Q.  You like that this game was a little bit -- obviously you guys got a little bit ahead, be able to rest a couple of guys before tomorrow's contest?</p>
<p>	Q.  In that first game against Texas Tech what do you recall that worked so well that you need to have work just as well for you tomorrow?</p>
