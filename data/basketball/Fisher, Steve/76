<p>	Q.  Marcus, when you guys came out in the second half, Brandon had two steals, you had one.  You are going to win or lose forcing your tempo, playing your way.  Can you talk about the defensive intensity forcing them to win the game?</p>

<p>	Q.  Did your recent history change the way you guys played the last few minutes of the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did the toe bother you?  It looked like you banged knees for a little bit.  Can you talk about your health and your game on the inside on the boards against them?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Fisher, Walton and Sharper came out for five shot attempts.  Was this more of a symptom of their denying the ball or Brandon and Marcus basically taking over?</p>

<p>	Q.  You probably haven't thought about it.  You have to play tomorrow night against a team that beat you guys twice.  You start believing if you win a game.  Obviously you hope your kids have that going into tomorrow night against that team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously it is going to be something you have to take a closer look at, twelve turnovers between Marcus and Brandon.  Can you consistently win when that happens?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is that something that comes with maturity over the years?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know Coach Mooney thought it is on the officiating, I heard them the whole time.  Any thoughts on that?</p>
<p>	Q.  With the officiating, Coach Mooney was complaining about the officiating going your way. </p>
