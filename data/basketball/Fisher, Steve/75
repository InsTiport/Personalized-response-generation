<p>	Q.  Something you guys mentioned last night was Air Force's, I guess, inability to capitalize SDSU turnovers.  It doesn't go back and forth.  Tonight it seemed like New Mexico did a better job of taking advantage of the mistakes, besides the obvious one that you had letting the game get too close.  It seemed like they controlled the tempo.  There was only a point where they would catch a steal and then catch a foul and convert something. </p>

<p>	Q.  For either Marcus or Brandon, are you guys able to take some solace in finishing the way you did in the last two nights after the way the season went down the stretch?</p>


<p>	Q.  Coach, what do you tell your players when you are trying to defend a guy like Granger who seems to be able to do everything everywhere he is on the court?</p>
<p>	Q.  You kind of want to expect Granger to have a game close to that.  Alfred Neale coming off of a couple of those threes, can you talk about his performance?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, it is amazing to me the job you did in this tournament.  It was really just two sophomores leading the way, not developing a third consistent player.  Have you thought about what this could have been with a healthy Chris Walton or even going back to Stokes in the line-up.  He was a great point guard. </p>
<p>	Q.  The same question that Mike had for the players, are you happy that the guys moved away from the tendencies later in the season with a different spirit and different attitude?</p>
