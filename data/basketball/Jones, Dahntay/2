		   DAHNTAY JONES: Yeah, we just have to be tough with our pressure and make them rotate the ball and pass the ball to other people. Make sure they haven't made a lot of shots. Continue with that.

 Q. What do you do at home?
 DAHNTAY JONES: We make other people make shots and make sure our defensive pressure is good. Our energy and enthusiasm is good.

 Q. This is your first time facing a possible elimination. Any thoughts? 
 DAHNTAY JONES: We gotta come out like we did for the game before and get ready for a win.

 Q. Your first three quarters you had the exact same score. Fourth quarter, you had some shots. What were you doing differently in that fourth quarter?
 DAHNTAY JONES: They were on the run. They were at home. They had the ability to go off with runs. We didn't have the offensive runs like they did.

 Q. What do you mean that type of run on the road?
 DAHNTAY JONES: I don't think so. I think the home team has an advantage. You get more runs and the crowd is behind you and pushing you through tough times.

 Q. When Lamar and Pau are so active on the board everywhere, how much more difficult is it?
 DAHNTAY JONES: It's very difficult. When Lamar and Pau are rebounding like that, that makes it tough for us. If we can somehow find a way to keep them off the boards and keep them out of the point paints, we'll be all right.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 DAHNTAY JONES: I don't think we're in that mindset of elimination. We have to win a game at home. We're confident we can win a game at home. We've been winning games at home. We're going to come out and play extremely hard and get right to them.

 Q. What do you think is the X factor for this game?
 DAHNTAY JONES: X factor for this game is how hard we play. If we play harder than them, we'll get a win.
