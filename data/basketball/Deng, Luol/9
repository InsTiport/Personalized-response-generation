Q.  The people were worried about whether this would be a genuine, competitive affair.  I don't know whether you saw last year's game on television or not, but were you satisfied with tonight's game?  Was it a genuine competitive game? 
 
LUOL DENG:  I thought it was.  It was pretty decent.  I think the second half, everybody picked it up a little bit, especially just coming out right in the second half.  I think the Sophomores must have spoke about it in the locker room because they came out pretty intense, and we could see that.  
 
Q.  You had a pretty good game, and the thing that was rather obvious, you and your teammate, Ben (Gordon) had a balanced game.  You not only looked to score but you looked to set up other teammates.  Were you happy to display that all-around? 
 
LUOL DENG:  Yeah, when we came out here, we wanted to get everybody involved.  We spoke about it in the locker room.  We just wanted everybody to have fun, and I thought we did that as a team.  Everybody was satisfied with what happened out there.  But yeah, we're just looking just to have fun and just make plays.  Yeah, didn't want to look greedy out there.   
 
Q.  What did you learn here?  When you leave and go back to Chicago and you have to put your finger on something, what did you learn?  What was the best thing that you take out of this? 
 
LUOL DENG:  I mean, just being around each other, we just kind of get a sense of the competitive nature of those guys.  I mean, it's just good to be around these guys.  It was a lot of fun.  That's the one thing, I just got closer to the guys and I got to know them personally.  I got to know them better than I did before, so that was a good thing.  That's the main thing out of this one.
