<p>	Q.  The people were worried about whether this would be a genuine, competitive affair.  I don't know whether you saw last year's game on television or not, but were you satisfied with tonight's game?  Was it a genuine competitive game? </p>
<p>	Q.  You had a pretty good game, and the thing that was rather obvious, you and your teammate, Ben (Gordon) had a balanced game.  You not only looked to score but you looked to set up other teammates.  Were you happy to display that all-around? </p>
