  Q.  (Were you concerned with how poorly you shot in Game 1?)   
 MICHAEL FINLEY:  To be honest, I just missed, simple as that, shots that I usually make.  My coach told me he was more upset about the shots that I didn't take than the shots that I missed, so I'll be okay.   
  
  Q.  Can you just talk about what this whole thing means?   
 MICHAEL FINLEY:  It's a great feeling.  It's a great feeling to finally experience something that as a player coming into the league everyone dreams of being a part of, and I've been blessed to be a part of a great team, and we have an opportunity to do something historic here.  And like I said, I'm very, very blessed.   
  
  Q.  Everybody was talking about LeBron James for the first game.  You guys defended very well.  What do you think for the second game?   
 MICHAEL FINLEY:  Well, I think he's going to be more aggressive.  He talked about leading his team by example, so I'm expecting him to come out from the jump ball and be aggressive, attack the basket more aggressive and not waiting until the second half of the fourth quarter.   
  
  Q.  Did you watch the last series?  Was there a vast difference between LeBron's Game 1 and Game 2?   
 MICHAEL FINLEY:  Just going off last series against Detroit, his Game 1 and Game 2, his Game 1 wasn't spectacular by any means, but he turned it on 4, 5 and 6.  He's that type of player that he can turn it on when he wants to, and I think tomorrow he's not going to wait until they get back to Cleveland to turn it on, he's going to turn it on tomorrow.
