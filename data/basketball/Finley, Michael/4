   MICHAEL FINLEY:  I didn't have any concerns.  I knew at one point we were going to hit a stride and I was just hoping that it wasn't later, closer to the playoffs.  I was hoping that we'd get a good streak in us before the playoffs rolled around, and that happened, and as a result we've been able to ride that wave all throughout the playoffs. 

 Q.  You guys are on the brink, need one more win.  Talk about your emotions at this point. 
 MICHAEL FINLEY:  Well, I mean, it's an accomplishment for the whole team.  I mean, we still have to get that one more win, and it might be the toughest win of any of the playoff games thus far.  From what we've been through as a team, what I've been through as an individual over the years, it's a great feeling. 

 Q.  What surprised you about this series? 
 MICHAEL FINLEY:  Besides my inability to hit a shot (laughter)?  Nothing.  I knew there would be a defensive struggle, especially with two teams and two coaches that are very familiar with one another.  I knew it was going to come down to whether a team gets hot or not, defensive stops, and the team that made the least amount of mistakes.  And thus far, that's pretty much been the blue book on this series. 

 Q.  Your organization has already won three titles, going for a fourth, becoming a dynasty.  What do you notice that might be surprising about that? 
 MICHAEL FINLEY:  Well, the whole organization is a very class organization, from the front office people to the guys on the team, and they go out of their way to keep that consistent.  You know, sometimes the talent level of the players may go down, but they want a class organization.  And when you put those type of people around you, usually good things happen, and that's been the situation here in my opinion.
