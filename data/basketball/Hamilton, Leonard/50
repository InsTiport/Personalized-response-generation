  BRIAN MORRISON:   With have with us now Florida State head basketball coach Leonard Hamilton. 
Coach, a few comments about your team and then we'll open it up for questions. 
COACH HAMILTON:   I think our team has been somewhat inconsistent.   We played some outstanding basketball at times this year, then we've played like we're an inexperienced team.   That showed last week where I thought we gave an inconsistent effort in execution and focus at Auburn.   I thought we played a lot better on the road in our first ACC game at Clemson. 
Overall I think we've had better practices than we have played.   I do believe this team is just now kind of figuring out the way we got to play, the effort we have to deal with in order to be successful. 
Three of our first ACC games will be on the road.   I think that's good for a young, inexperienced team that we have.   It's going to raise our consciousness.   Anxious to see how we're going to do when we play against a very hot Maryland team on Wednesday night. 

Q.   Coach, where is Ian Miller right now?   I know he missed several games.   Is he back to what you expect from him?
COACH HAMILTON:   It's almost impossible to be back when he's been inactive for as long as he was inactive.   He missed four or five games with a bone bruise.   We had to shut him down.   He was in the swimming pool, riding the bicycles, shooting standing jump shots. 
He practiced a couple days prior to the Auburn game, played four or five minutes in that game.   He did play 23 minutes in the Clemson game.   He gave us some good stability and I thought he made a big difference in the game. 
We have had a rash of nagging injuries with the bone bruise with him, Terrance have what you call a stinger, most of the time football players have.   Robert Gilchrist, he had a little groin pull. 
Seems as though that's what's been happening with our team. 
Ian seems to be back now physically, but I'm sure it's going to take him a little while to get back on top of his game.   You don't miss all those practices and games and pick up.   I have the film on Saturday at Clemson.   He did a good job, made some big plays for us, thought he made a big difference in the game. 

Q.   You know pretty much night in and night out what you'll get from Snaer and Okaro White.   The rest of the guys, are they kind of the inconsistencies you were talking about?
COACH HAMILTON:   I think we've been in somewhat of a learning mode.   All seven of our first‑year players have had their moments where they played pretty well.   We have not been able to get everybody hitting on all cylinders at the same time.   They've always shown potential. 
I think we're getting closer and closer as we move into conference play.   I'm anxious now to see where we are going on the road as much as we have to early in the season. 
But we've had very good practices.   They've shown signs in some of the games, in New York, on the road against some people, the Tulsa game, I think we've shown signs of having some potential to develop. 
I think now we're just starting to figure it out.   I think they have been inconsistent, like most freshmen are.   I'm sure you have a few freshmen occasionally that figure it out coming in the door.   My guys are still learning, growing.   Three of my first‑year guys are international players.   That just kind of heightens the adjustment they have to make. 
But I feel good about this team.   I think potentially we have a chance to be where we have been.   Now it's a point for us to go out and get the job done. 

Q.   Coach, after the kind of rough start in non‑conference play, how pivotal is this next little stretch with Maryland, UNC?
COACH HAMILTON:   I think it's very important.   I guess you might say our backs are against the wall a little bit.   We're going to have to do something exceptional.   We've been moving up every year getting better and better.   In order for us to continue that, now we have to do it in conference play against tough competition with 18 conference games. 
But I'm excited about that.   I like this team.   I think the talent is there.   It's just a matter of us putting it together and being more consistent. 
It seems we almost got our entire team back now somewhat healthy.   But I think we're capable.   But we're going to find out a lot about us against Maryland because they're about as good as we've seen them in a while.   They're loaded with talent, very well‑coached.   If we're going to keep our post‑season opportunities alive, we're going to have to do something unusual, unexpected, and that's winning games on the road against people that are playing well. 

Q.   Some people have called you one of the most disappointing teams in the country.   How do you respond to that?
COACH HAMILTON:   Why should I?   I mean, I think most teams that have five freshmen, seven first‑year players have been inconsistent.   I don't think our team is a lot different than what some of the other people are going through. 
That's one thing good about basketball.   It's a season.   It's not the beginning.   Last year we were 9‑6.   This year we're 9‑4.   I'm sure we have plenty of time to overcome our inadequacies. 
BRIAN MORRISON:   Coach, thanks for taking time being with us today. 
COACH HAMILTON:   Thank you.
