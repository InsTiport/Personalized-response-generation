<p>	Q.  Parity, it seems like people have different opinions as to whether parity is good or not good.  Tell me why it's good for women's basketball. </p>
<p>	Q.  Lynn, I know it's only a couple weeks after the new format, for the first and second rounds, but just based on attendance figures and just initial feedback, just the committee's thought on the new format. </p>
<p>	Q.  For Lynn, the attendance, I think to say Easter weekend is a little bit, I mean attendance was abysmal, especially in my Regional at Kansas City.  How does the attendance at a place like that affect the NCAA's view on bringing a Regional back to that area? </p>
<p>	Q.  Women's sports in general seem to be still a niche market in this country, whether it's women's gymnastics in Utah or women's basketball in eastern Tennessee.  How does that affect your philosophy in putting on the tournament; are you trying to overcome this and bring the women's game to areas where it may not be as popular or do you use that fact in order to drive your selections?</p>
<p>	Q.  What can you do or how much more proactive does the NCAA have to be as far as selling regionals?  Because a Final Four now has been on lottery system since 1998, been an advance sellout since 1993 and yet it seems like there's still a lot of trouble selling the regionals.  You've talked before about the potential of maybe awarding regionals for multi years; is that still on the table? </p>
<p>	Q.  This question is for Sue.  TV ratings seem to drive sports more each year, does it -- is there a bit of an, I don't want to say disappointment, but without a UCONN, without a Tennessee in the championship game, does that -- do you worry about what effect that's going to have?</p>


<p>	Q.  Can both of you ladies address if it hasn't been already, the thought of what's going into, there's a move now to move the three-point line and all these things for international -- seems to be towards with the international play in mind and what have you; how do you think and what do you think of it in regards to women's basketball, is it necessary or not? </p>

<p>	Q.  Will both the men and the women have to agree on it or can it be one or the other?</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys will decide the 2007 first and second round sites later this summer, is that correct?</p>

<p>	Q.  Can you give me a feeling, are there many more bids similar to what Texas and Texas Tech did this past year as far as two schools together submitting a bid for a neutral site?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you say 30 host cities, is that for just the regionals or for first and second rounds as well. </p>
<p>	Q.  Sue, you kind of maybe answered the question a little bit, but in looking at the regionals, a lot of interest from cities trying to go back-to-back years and did you have to go out and ask cities to do this; did you solicit it or did cities come to you and say, "Hey, we're really wanting to do this back-to-back year thing." </p>
<p>	Q.  New Mexico has been one of the best regionals in terms of attendance.  And they're going to be a regional if I understand it, next year, they're going to have it.  Do you think in 2007 and beyond, a school like New Mexico will still be as interested in hosting regionals if they cannot -- if from what I understand the Lobos couldn't appear there.  Do you think that you'll still get that kind of interest from a school like that once it has to be a neutral site and their school can't appear there? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you address what the advantages are from your standpoint of moving the announcement of the selections from Sunday to Monday? </p>

<p>	Q.  To follow it up, do you have an understanding from ESPN that they are going to increase their commitment to more regular season programming? </p>
<p>	Q.  Part and parcel to the Monday deal, if conferences want to take advantage and move their championships, everything finishes on Saturday into Sunday, would you encourage that or would you rather them stay where they are to give you more time now that you actually would have to work on the bracket. </p>

<p>	Q.  I guess two questions.  One, for this being, as you put it, Sue, I think a premier property for ESPN, women's basketball, were you disappointed that last night it went head to head with Yankees/Red Sox on another ESPN affiliate, first question.  And second, what do you say to the west coast viewers and coaches and even the Mountain Time Zone, that now is going to have a four o'clock Monday afternoon selection show or five o'clock Monday, which is far from prime time. </p>

<p>	Q.  Yankees?</p>
