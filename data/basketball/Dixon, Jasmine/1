COACH CLOSE:   Well, first of all, thank you, media, for being here.   It's really big for our game, so I want to thank you for your coverage of our tournament.   Boy, survive and advance, you know.   We've got to be excited to play the next game.   I thought we did a good job on the defensive side of the court, and we held them.   And they shot well yesterday, and I thought we limited their three‑point opportunities until late in the game.   They got a few open looks. 
But we always preach the defense and rebounding will hold you when you have a poor offensive game.   Our defense and our rebounding is with us, and we're thankful to be able to play another day.

Q.   Cori, they made a run at you, went ahead, and you were able to close it out.   Just talk to me about that last segment there? 
COACH CLOSE:   Well, I think it comes down to you have great senior leadership.   I thought we were very calm.   Actually we called timeout and sort of regathered.   
             I think they don't have any panic in them.   You have seniors that have been through the worst, and I think everyone looks to them.   Our team has established who and when it gets toughest.   When the pressure rises, who do you look to?   And everyone on our team said Jasmine Dixon.   She brings a calm to our team.   Just to have people like that to look to, I think was an emotional thing.   It wasn't a tactical thing.   It's really a credit to experienced players making hard choices and being trustworthy for their team.

Q.   Is there anything you learned about California the first two times you played them to help you tomorrow? 
COACH CLOSE:   There is good news and there is bad news.   The good news is it's not a difficult scouting report.   The bad news is it's very difficult to love out.   We said to our team, be physical and rebound and then be physical some more and rebound some more.   It was really going to come down to that.   It's going to come down to possessions.   Who can establish the paint?   Who can make a few jumpers?   Both teams would like to use their size to control the paint, get the ball inside, get higher percentage shots.   
             It's going to be guard plays.   Who can make some outside jumpers and make people extend?   Then who can dominate the possession game, which is taking care of the basketball and rebounding the basketball.   I think both coaches would say it's pretty simple; it's just really hard to do.   It's going to take a relentless spirit and it's a competitive nature.   It's going to be a phenomenally competitive game, and we're excited to have the opportunity to play in it.

Q.   Jasmine, when you went out, what did it change for you guys what did you feel like you had to do to compensate for that? 
JASMINE DIXON:   I felt like all of our post players had to step up and have her back, and we have to do whatever it took for us to win.   She knew we had her back whenever she went out.   She just took her time and got right.
