 THE MODERATOR:   We're joined by Alex Reese.  Go ahead and talk about the three-pointer you hit in the second half, what you saw on that play.
 ALEX REESE:   My teammates have always done a good job getting me open shots.  I haven't shot the ball well really all year.  I've been shooting all my life, so I try to step in with each shot, step in with confidence, think I'll make it, and make every one of them.
 Yeah, I think it was JQ who got me the shot.  I don't know who it was.  I'm amped up right now, as you can tell (smiling).
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions.
 Q. You have a chance tomorrow to win Alabama's first tournament title in 30 years.  Being from the state, a senior, what would it mean to accomplish that tomorrow?
 ALEX REESE:   It would mean everything to me.  That's what we came here to do, me, Herb and J.P.  We came here to change the culture, get us in the winning direction.  It would mean a lot.
 It's what we've been working for all summer.  It's been our goal since we got back to campus with the whole coronavirus thing, sat out a little bit longer.  But ever since we got back we've been working for it.  The work is starting to show.  We've been playing pretty well so we have to keep it rolling.
 THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
