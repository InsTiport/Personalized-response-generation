  Q.  Talk a little bit about Tony and Tim's game last night, the things that they were able to do.   
 FABRICIO OBERTO:  Tim and Tony and Manu, they're our leaders on offense, and after they're going to create really, really smart play and they're going to -- when they start taking care of those guys, they're going to start picking on the other players.  Like we did all year on defense and offense, we just keep playing as a team.   
  
  Q.  Can you talk a little bit about LeBron?  Were you guys surprised how much he was unable to get going in the first half?   
 FABRICIO OBERTO:  I think we played really good D, Bruce and the team.  We've just got to keep doing that.  We know how hard it is to play defense on LeBron and how hard it will be on Sunday, so we have to be ready for that.   
  
  Q.  He talked about he's going to be more aggressive in Game 2.  Are there any more adjustments you think you guys are going to be to make?   
 FABRICIO OBERTO:  For sure we're going to talk tomorrow and keep watching today and tomorrow the video and try and figure out the best way to stop him.  But sometimes it's the defense in 48 minutes, we know he's going to score, and he's like -- if he's going to be more aggressive, we'll have to be ready for that.   
  
  Q.  What were your thoughts of the whole pregame hype?  What were you thinking?   
 FABRICIO OBERTO:  It was really exciting for me, like the first couple minutes in your mind you have to be ready, and it's hard to focus with all of the atmosphere.  But after like the first two, three minutes it's fine, just enjoy.
