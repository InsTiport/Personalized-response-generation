 Q.  What players did you root for when you were young? 
 FABRICIO OBERTO:  I was trying to be most of the time, Toni Kukoc, I used to love how he played.  When he was playing in Europe I got tape from him.  The big guys, trying to get something, learn.  Basketball is not like a perfect science.  Can't one day learn everything.  You've just got to keep learning, no matter what age you are. 

 Q.  Do you think it's easier for international players to adjust to the NBA game than it is NBA players to adjust to the international game? 
 FABRICIO OBERTO:  Well, the defense I think is really, really hard when you go overseas.  I saw that when we played the World Championship after one year here, the pushing, and when you try to play defense is not the same. 

 Q.  Do you still talk to former teammates on the phone, talk to them about playing in the NBA one day? 
 FABRICIO OBERTO:  I mean, it's a dream of most of the players to come here in the NBA and play.  International players, we are really good friends and we talk a lot about that, guys who are still overseas and they want to get a chance here.  It's like a big goal for everybody. 

 Q.  What are the conversations like? 
 FABRICIO OBERTO:  Well, sometimes, most of the time, it's contract, how is the buy-out or how is the life here.  You know, things are different in Europe and it's hard to explain, but one thing they want to know is how is the NBA, the organization, and you can tell every detail, but if you're not in the NBA you don't see that.  It's hard.
