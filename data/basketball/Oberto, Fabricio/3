 Q.  (Talk about this being your first time in The Finals.) 
 FABRICIO OBERTO:  You know, the media, all the stuff going around these games, for us -- for me it's been -- for most of the guys on the team, has been getting used to The Finals and getting used to it pretty quick.  No, just enjoy and try to have fun. 

 Q.  Are you ready? 
 FABRICIO OBERTO:  Yeah, I'm ready. 

 Q.  (Talk about the difference in the NBA game versus the international game.) 
 FABRICIO OBERTO:  You know, sometimes when it's kind of trying to get in the right position, trying to be quick and get in the right spot, here the rules with the circle, you have to be ready.  When you start playing year by year, you learn more about three seconds.  I remember my first season I was getting a lot of three seconds. 

 Q.  What about playing soccer growing up? 
 FABRICIO OBERTO:  I was really bad, so that doesn't help me (laughter), really, really bad. 

 Q.  Can you talk about Zydrunas? 
 FABRICIO OBERTO:  He's really a big guy and really long.  When you've got to try and put it on the paint, it's always trouble.  Now you've got to really prepare for that match-up.
