<p>	Q.  You mentioned the young guys and I think you probably had one of the better recruiting classes in the Big 12.  Does it look as good on the court as it does on paper?</p>
<p>	Q.  I think most people look at Nebraska as a team that might break through this year, perhaps maybe more than some others.  Do you guys see it the same way and what are going to be the key factors for that to happen? </p>

<p>	Q.  You mentioned being able to compete athletically with these other teams.  Do you think that has been the main thing holding you all back?</p>
<p>	Q.  You haven't finished above 7th in the conference in your tenure at N.U.  What is going to be different this year that's going to allow to you get in the top half of the Big 12?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned Marcus Perry.  Any other new guys you think have a significant impact? </p>
<p>	Q.  Presence of more guards, more athletic players going to help McCray?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much is the presence of more depth, more guards who can play, how much does that help McCray -- focus off him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Any player hates it when he says coach wants to see the ball in your hands more.  You think you all going to have the inside game to answer some of those questions? </p>
