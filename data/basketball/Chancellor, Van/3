  LSU - 61

 THE MODERATOR: Joining us from LSU, head Coach Chancellor and student-athletes. Coach, would you like to make some opening remarks about this evening's game. 
 COACH CHANCELLOR: Out-coached us tonight, out-hustled us, outplayed us. I thought Melanie Balcomb did a much better job with their team than I did with mine. They played last night in overtime. They out-rebounded us. They out-carried us. 
 They did everything you ought to do. I'm fully responsible. We couldn't stop. Marsh got what I thought she'd get. Rhoads was pretty good. The kid we couldn't stop was 15. She did a heck of a job. 
 Questions. 

 Q. Coach, why do you think you guys have struggled to win close games? 
 COACH CHANCELLOR: I get our kids to realize that every possession counts. I've struggled all year to get them to quit fouling jump shooters. That's poor coaching. I can't get them to quit fouling jump shooters. 
 We made a lazy pass over the press. We shot layups. I've done everything I can to get them to understand that every possession counts. We can't keep our focus. This is why we have struggled with -- we could have had a fabulous year. We lost three overtime games, two games at the end. 
 I think nothing but just lousy, pitiful, sorry, miserable coaching. And that's putting it mildly. 

 Q. 15-3, is that the point? 
 COACH CHANCELLOR: Same problem. 15-3, had Vandy right back on their heels, could not score. All of a sudden we think we're going to become a three-point shooting team. Oh, Lord. That's poor coaching, too. 
 If you came into the conference tournament, don't know what you're trying to do, it is pitiful on your part. They have no idea. We're out there jacking up three balls, and we ought to have been getting it inside trying to draw fouls. 
 We didn't turn the ball over. I mean, the most disturbing stat to me is just at the end Vandy just out-rebounded us. Vandy had more heart, more character, more of everything. And that's putting it rather nicely. 

 Q. What did you think about Allison? 
 COACH CHANCELLOR: I thought she was great. I've been trying for three years with 17 seconds on the clock to get her to go get the ball. I can't get her. They miss a free throw, I'm down two, and I got what I think is the best open floor player in the conference. I'm out of timeouts. I can't get her the ball. 
 Yeah, I'm a little frustrated with that. 

 Q. Allison, at the end there, were you involved in the screen? And talk about what happened with the jump ball. 
 ALLISON HIGHTOWER: When she put it up, everybody crashed the boards. I think I was on the floor with some Vandy players, and the ball went to them. So a jump ball, I guess, went to them. 

 Q. Katherine, could you talk about the close games you've been in this year. 
 KATHERINE GRAHAM: They're frustrating, but I agree with what coach said. We just got to be more disciplined and listen to what he's saying, go out and execute and try to win those close games. 

 Q. Vanderbilt has a history of playing better in this tournament than in the regular season. Is there any reason for that, do you think? 
 COACH CHANCELLOR: Vandy? They got all the heart and character in the world, and they play a matchup. But let me tell you this. I hate to say this. We practiced for Vandy all freaking week, so that ain't an excuse. 
 They come out and get in this conference tournament, and they just play their heart out. Marsh is going to make shots; rhoads is going to play; and then their post players were just rebounding. 
 She just does a great job. That's why I pulled so hard for Arkansas last night. They just play. They get in this baby and they bring it. They don't overlook nobody. They play. They've had as much success as anybody in this league in this tournament, compared to what I would say where they've been seeded. 
 They've never come in here seeded first much. They've been seeded three, four and five. They're going to play Tennessee tomorrow night. Don't kid yourself. They gonna play tomorrow. I don't know if they can stop the biggest giants in the world playing women's basketball today, but they gonna play, man. Don't worry about it. They gonna play smart. 
 They ain't going to be fouling when they shouldn't be fouling. Their key players get three fouls, they ain't taking any more fouls. They ain't going to be trying to draw a charge. They ain't going to be blocking. They just play smart. They play really, really smart, and they know exactly where they want to get the ball to. 
 We scored enough points to win tonight. 61 points should have won. That's about as much as we scored, and didn't even shoot the ball really well. 

 Q. You had such a good stretch toward the end of the season. This one game, do you feel like you're seeing some bad habits that are coming back in this one game? 
 COACH CHANCELLOR: No. We played six great basketball games. Score is 15-3. We played like we played the last six games. We went brain-dead somewhere in here. 
 You want to ask the players, ask them. I'm pretty frustrated. 
 THE MODERATOR: Any more questions for the student-athletes? All right. Thank you very much.
