  JAY BILAS:   We want to start out talking about the different teams and have each coach take a couple of moments to tell us about his team and what it's like to be here at the Maui Invitational. 
    We'll start off with Butler's Brad Stevens, who is in his sixth year as head coach at Butler University.   142 career wins over those six years.   Took the Butler Bulldogs to back‑to‑back NCAA Tournament Finals in 2010 and 2011. 
    He turned down a lucrative career at Eli Lilly in order to be a college head coach, and he's done a magnificent job, one of the finest young coaches in the industry.   Brad Stevens of Butler.
    COACH STEVENS:   Thank you, Jay.   It's obviously an honor for us to be here.   I was walking along with Brianna as we were walking over here and said:   For Butler University, I think this is, and our basketball program, this is a bucket list type of thing, to be included in the Maui Invitational, to be able to compete not only against the great teams that are here, but also to be able to take in the great tradition of this tournament. 
    And so obviously our guys are thrilled to be here.   And we've got a lot of work to do.   And it's always interesting, because our goal at Christmas every year, after our nonconference schedule, is to accurately assess how we can get better. 
    And I think we'll be able to accurately assess how we can get better by the end of these three days with the team sitting next to us.   So we're excited to be here.   Our guys are really excited to play.
    Certainly has been incredible hospitality the entire time, and we thank you for including us.
