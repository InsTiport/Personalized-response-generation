Q. Have you made any decisions about tweaking your lineup, and if so, what will those changes be?
BRAD STEVENS: I've made that decision.  We'll just announce it when we have to announce it.
Q. The decision, whatever it is, what were some of the factors that led you to it?
BRAD STEVENS: You always look at both sides of the ball, where you think your advantages, disadvantages are, et cetera, and you just go from there.
Q. To clarify: Is there, in fact, a change to the starting lineup?
BRAD STEVENS: By the NBA rules, we'll have our starting lineup at 20 minutes when I give it to the officials.
Q. I just wanted to clarify.  You said you've made a decision --
BRAD STEVENS: We will start five people.  I promise. (Laughter)
