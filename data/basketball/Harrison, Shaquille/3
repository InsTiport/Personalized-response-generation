Memphis - 89, Tulsa - 67   
THE MODERATOR: We'll have an opening statement from coach and then take questions.   
FRANK HAITH: Obviously, I thought we came out in this ball game with a great focus and weren't playing the way we wanted to play and I think the score was 14-13 and I thought our guys we panicked.  We were turning the ball over and second shots were killing us, by their guards.  That was the difference in the game.  Once they got separation, I never thought we felt we got comfortable again in the game.   
THE MODERATOR: All right.  Questions?   
 Q.  Can you talk a little bit about your feelings and emotions after the loss and the early exit in the tournament?  
SHAQUILLE HARRISON: It's just a little disappointing.  Didn't turn out how we wanted.  Like coach said, 14-13, we had nine seniors on our roster, we lost our composure and panicked and we're supposed to be a veteran team and that shouldn't happen and it happened and it hurt us.   
 Q.  Talk about Brandon's performance tonight.  
FRANK HAITH: I thought Brandon, we wanted to go inside, I thought Brandon was good tonight.  He was very productive.  His last two ball games he had a career game, a career high his last ball game, and I thought he built on that.  Want to give credit to Memphis, I think Memphis is super talented, if not one of the most talented teams in our league, and it showed out there tonight.   
 Q.  What did you say to the guys in the locker room after the game?  
FRANK HAITH: Just, hey, obviously, it's disappointing.  We'll be playing next week somewhere, and we got to figure out a way to get ourselves ready to play.   
THE MODERATOR: All right.  Thank you.   
FRANK HAITH: Thank you.
