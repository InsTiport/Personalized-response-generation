  Q. Christian, playing with a player as great as a LeBron James, what do you look forward to learning from playing with a guy with his type of skills?   
 CHRISTIAN EYENGA: It's a pleasure, of course, and a shock basically to be drafted as high as number 30. I'm very much looking forward to being on the same floor with someone as talented as LeBron James.   
  
  Q. As a 6-5 wing player that you are, what are the key assets or abilities you think you'll bring to the team?   
 CHRISTIAN EYENGA: The main thing will be I'm going to help the team with defense. I'm going to run and I'm going to work as hard as possible to help the team with anything that's going to be necessary.   
  
  Q. How nervous were you that you are the 30th and final pick in the first round?   
 CHRISTIAN EYENGA: When I saw the camera, I wasn't sure it was going to be me. To me, it was a shock, basically. I thought they were filming other players because there were other players waiting to be called up.   
 I was very, very tense and nervous.   
  
  Q. Do you know anything about the city of Cleveland?   
 CHRISTIAN EYENGA: I knows that it gets very cold, but I hope it's not going to be that cold.
