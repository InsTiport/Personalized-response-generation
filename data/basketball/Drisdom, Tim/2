<p>	Q.  Tim, Coach mentioned not being the aggressor in the first half.  Was there any degree of knowing that you guys didn't have to necessarily win this game to get in the NCAA tournament?</p>
<p>	Q.  Any explanation for the first half?</p>
<p>	Q.  Tim, did New Mexico defense do anything to make it more difficult than in prior games to get the ball to Andrew?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the defensive approach to Granger tonight?  It looked at times you were getting lost on switches in the second half. </p>

<p>	Q.  Ray, what happens now?  Where is your club and how do you feel going into the tournament that we're all pretty certain you're going to get an invitation to?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned the stops down the stretch and inability to get one.  How big was the no call on the Chiotti bucket late?</p>
<p>	Q.  In the larger sense, how much did it hurt seemingly not to be able to get outside shots or very many of them to go in tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  With that in mind, did you feel like you wanted some of your guys to take shots they passed up?</p>
