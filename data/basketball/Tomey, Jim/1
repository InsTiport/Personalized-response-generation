<p>	Q.  Lindsey, Dionne Marsh goes out with two fouls in the first half and four in the second half and supposedly that's a good thing.  Was it kind of deflating to see Shetters come in and play so well?</p>
<p>	Q.  Michelle, can you talk about the importance to add size in this program?  You have guards who kind of were able to pressure and do some test to contest, but can you talk about the need that you have to get bigger if you're going to compete with these people? </p>

<p>	Q.  That seems to obviously have been your toughest situation, trying to get size.  You've signed one kid, you might have others coming, but what's been your experience since you've switched from the men's side in terms of how many really good players there are with size, and is it a situation where the really good ones are going to go to the top programs anyway and they're difficult to find?  Why is it tough to find at this point size? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you address in general the growth of the league as you've seen it since you've been a head coach as far as the balance of some of these other teams that are playing in the tournament and how difficult the league has become?  Talk about that. </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you feel this game was kind of maybe a microcosm of the season?  You said on Monday that you were worried about the team's shooting but you thought you'd be able to force turnovers.  Both those things happened.  I was just hoping you could address that. </p>
