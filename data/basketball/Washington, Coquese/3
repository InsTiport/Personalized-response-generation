 Q.  Obviously you guys had a lead going into the fourth, but I think Page only scored 4 in the fourth.  You had a couple of other players.  How important is that, especially going forward, to have other players who can score?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I think it's important for other teams to prepare.  You've got to be aware of Jaida Green.  You've got to be aware of Teniya.  You've got to be aware of Amari Carter.  You've got to be aware of our post play, and our post play showed up today.  You've got to be aware of three or four or five other people, then it just opens up opportunities for Teniya to go lead the charge.   
 Q.  On the defensive end I think you held them scoreless for seven minutes in the second quarter and a three-minute stretch at the end of the third.  What did you see there?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, I thought we did a better job of trying to contest shots, switching it up from man to zone, and forced them to try to beat us from outside, and we did a good job in the zone of getting out and contesting shots.  I also thought we did a good job in the second quarter on rebounding and not giving them second-chance points, and that was really big for us.
