<p>	Q.  Anne and Lyndsey, talk about the last sequence, getting the ball down court, getting the shot. </p>

<p>	Q.  Anne, do you guys practice that last six seconds by not taking a timeout, did you do that in practice to where you don't take a timeout in that type of situation? </p>
<p>	Q.  Katie, talk about that play from your perspective.  Was all you could -- did you think about fouling her or just trying to go for the block? </p>


<p>	Q.  Anne and both Lyndsey talked  about, you did the same thing last year against Texas Tech.  Is this even better than that because of the situation, because of being in a tournament like this? </p>
<p>	Q.  Lyndsey, you guys had not shot very well for the whole game.  You said you didn't feel like you played that well until the end.  You had a couple threes.  Was there any confidence thing for you at the end?  How did you feel? </p>
<p>	Q.  (No microphone). </p>
<p>	Q.  Up until then, you'd beaten Colorado twice, obviously they're playing with a lot of emotion.  Why is it such a struggle this time? </p>

<p>	Q.  Coach, Ceal had talked about trying to stop you guys in your transition game with the three.  Did they do about as good a job today keeping their place? </p>
<p>	Q.  (No microphone.) </p>
<p>	Q.  You're down 9 about 8:20 left.  You call a timeout.  What did you say?  There's a 10-2 run after that. </p>
<p>	Q.  Since you've been here, have you had a comeback like this in your tenure here? </p>
<p>	Q.  You stuck with Lyndsey.  There are times when you pulled her out when she's played that poorly in the past.  Talk about sticking with her, letting her learn through this, getting rewarded for that. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have an initial thought on matching up against Texas Tech again tomorrow? </p>
<p>	Q.  (No microphone.) </p>
