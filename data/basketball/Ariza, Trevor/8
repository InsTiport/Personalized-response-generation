  Q. What do you think has happened?  
 TREVOR ARIZA: Well, we know that we're close. If we want to win, we have to keep the same focus that we've been having these past three games. We don't want to let this opportunity slip away like we did the last time.  
  
  Q. And why was it hard prior to that, prior to this? I always thought, okay, you're in the playoffs, you've got Houston, don't mess around.  
 TREVOR ARIZA: Honestly, I can't tell you. My only thought was we felt like we were so much better than all the teams we played against. It may have been I guess a little cockiness. But now we realize that we can't be cocky, you've got to play with them.  
  
  Q. Were you surprise the that the Magic had as much trouble last night as they did?  
 TREVOR ARIZA: No, we're a good team when we play the right way. We feel that we can do -- we can get whatever we want any time when we're playing the right way, when we're playing well, when everybody has it going, offensively and defensively.  
 For them to have a hard time, it was a little bit on them, but I think it had something to do with us, too, the way we played defense.  
  
  Q. What do you expect out of them adjustment-wise?  
 TREVOR ARIZA: Probably try to get Hedo the ball more. That's what I would expect. He hit his first three shots, and probably to get him more involved more often.
