  Q. Can you talk about your ability to steal an inbound pass like that now twice?  
 TREVOR ARIZA: I think the ball got tipped or something, and Carmelo lost the ball a little bit and I was able to run it down, get it.  
  
  Q. Just talk about this, it's happened twice now in three games. Are you now a designated inbound pilferer or what exactly?  
 TREVOR ARIZA: I don't think that's what it is. Nobody on our team quit. We didn't give up on the ball or none of that. We tried to fight all the way through.  
  
  Q. As you see that play unfold, does it strike you that it's like the last play?  
 TREVOR ARIZA: It was kind of funny. It was pretty much the same thing, different players involved. But we got the steal. We got a win, that's the most important thing.  
  
  Q. Phil was saying that you can accelerate quickly in one step. What do you think is your greatest asset that serves you the best on these plays, is that anticipation?  
 TREVOR ARIZA: Anticipation a little bit probably would be -- that would probably be it, the anticipation part.   
 If the ball's somewhere and it's being bobbled around I'm going to get it. And my team needs me to do that type of stuff.  
  
  Q. How is your back? Did that happen last game? We got a note that it's been hurting you for a game or two.   
 TREVOR ARIZA: Yeah, I'm all right. But something happened to me last game.  
  
  Q. How bad was that fall?  
 TREVOR ARIZA: It hurt. I can't even lie. It hurt me all the way up until I went into the back and got some treatment, then it started loosening up a little bit and then I was able to play with more range of motion in my back.  
  
  Q. Do you think the steal you had in Game 1 affected how they played that inbound pass and do you think it made them a little nervous seeing you run out there like that?  
 TREVOR ARIZA: I mean, they ran the play so I guess not. I think it was a good team play. Good ball pressure again. We got a little lucky, you know, because they're a pretty good team in out of bounds plays usually.   
 So we was fortunate to get the ball right there.  
  
  Q. Your defense, your team's defense in the fourth quarter was very good as well. Could you talk about why you're so much better in the fourth quarter?  
 TREVOR ARIZA: I don't know why we played harder in the fourth quarter than we do all game. If we could play the way we play in the fourth quarter all game, I don't think nobody could beat us.  
 But that being said, we don't do it. But I think we need to start paying attention more to our fourth quarters the way we play D in the first half.
