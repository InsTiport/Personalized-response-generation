  Q. What were your thoughts about being traded? You had already been to the Knicks.   
 TREVOR ARIZA: I know it's a part of the game. This is basketball. It's a business. You can't have no hard feelings against people because they're trying to make their team better. Their team did get better and I got put in a situation where I can help the team out, too.   
  
  Q. How did you improve your shooting? How much work did you put in?  
 TREVOR ARIZA: When I broke my foot, I got time to just sit down and watch shots go in, relax, build confidence, and then all summer I worked on shooting the ball, doing different things.  
  
  Q. Anything in particular you worked with shooting the ball?  
 TREVOR ARIZA: Yeah, I worked with Coach Hodges, and one of the dudes that used to go to my high school named Tony Blaine (sic).  
  
  Q. Did you feel when you were with the Magic that that's one of the parts of your game where they said he's not shooting the ball --  
 TREVOR ARIZA: I didn't really get a chance to shoot the ball. I know they always knew that I could shoot the ball, but that wasn't the issue, it was just the confidence.
