 Q. Have you learned from last year in Boston when they took Game 4?
 TREVOR ARIZA: They did take Game 4, but we also gave it up. I think we've just got to focus on this year. We can't really look into the past. The past is not going to get us anywhere. We've got to play for the moment.

 Q. People are wondering, was their hot shooting hot shooting, or did they find some weaknesses?
 TREVOR ARIZA: I don't think they found any weaknesses, I just think that they were hot and we made a few mistakes, mental mistakes, and they got the win. 

 Q. What do you want to see your team do well tomorrow when you say focus?
 TREVOR ARIZA: Just pay attention to everything defensive. We can make mistakes on offense, but on defense we can't really make mistakes. They're too good of a team. They've got too many shooters for us to make mistakes on defense.

 Q. Defensively do you guys need to change how many times Dwight gets the ball down low in the post? 
 TREVOR ARIZA: When he gets the ball and you're really deep, yeah, that's a problem for us because when we come looking for help, we have too far to run to get back to our shooters. They shoot the ball way too well.

 Q. Do you think people are kind of underestimating how evenly matched these two teams are?
 TREVOR ARIZA: I think so. They're a good team. They play up-tempo-type game, and we can play both. They have really good shooters, and we have playmakers on our team. It's two different styles, but it's enough for a really good series.
