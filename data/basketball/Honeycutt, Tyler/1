 Q. Can you talk about being drafted by the Kings? 
 TYLER HONEYCUTT: Just grateful to be here. To get to this point has been my dream since I was a little kid, and it's come true. To play for the Kings, I think is going to be a great situation for me. 

 Q. Tyler, congratulations on being drafted. The Kings have a lot of players at the 3 and everything, so how are you looking to really be able to differentiate your skill-set to get major minutes? 
 TYLER HONEYCUTT: Just play my game. I think I can play the two or the 3. Just do what I do best and let the coaches take it from there. 

 Q. Can you talk about what the draft process was like for you? Because when you came out, there was some surprise, but obviously you impressed some people. Was there a turning point in all this?
 TYLER HONEYCUTT: No, there wasn't any turning point. I just took a lot of time after we lost to make my decision and once I knew that was what I wanted to do, I was 100% on that. I don't regret anything, though. 

 Q. Being part of a wide-open offense, in Sacramento, Coach Paul Westphal, how much are you looking forward to that, coming out of a system that was a little more half-court oriented? 
 TYLER HONEYCUTT: I think more athletic players and being even younger, you know, the tempo is probably going to pick up, and young guys are going to play off each other. 

 Q. Can you talk about the decision to come here? Obviously this is a special day; were you happy where you got picked? Clearly you probably wanted to go higher, but were you happy?
 TYLER HONEYCUTT: Definitely at the end of the day, I liked the situation. I expected to go higher, but it is what it is. Just want to show that a lot of people made a lot of mistakes.
