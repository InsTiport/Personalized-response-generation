Q.   If you could just make a brief comment about the game this evening. 
MAURICE CHEEKS:   Oh, man.   It's the All‑Star Game, man.   All‑Star Games are just like this one, pushing the basketball, not a whole lot of defense, although the coaches preach defense (laughing).   There's just not a whole lot of defense being played in All‑Star games, but a lot of good performances out there.   Obviously Kyrie Irving, Evan Turner, just a lot of good performances.   Guys played well.   It was a very entertaining game. 

Q.   Did you and Chuck have any sort of back and forth before going into the game? 
MAURICE CHEEKS:   No, he said something at halftime about the game because we were leading the whole game, so he made a couple comments about it during halftime.   But it was nothing major.   He was having a friendly conversation. 

Q.   I know this is all fun, but as a guy who was known as a defensive player like yourself, how do you feel watching a game like that, where a reach‑in here and theremight be too much? 
MAURICE CHEEKS:   Well, these are All‑Star Games.   They've all been like that.   I played in four of them, and it probably was never a factor in any of them because I couldn't do the things some of these guys could do out on the court.   These are what All‑Star Games are.   There's not a whole lot of defense and the better offensive players usually make a difference in the game, and that certainly was the case tonight.
