<p>	Q.  Tough game individually.  How much of it was you not hitting your shots?  How much is it not doing a great job defensively? </p>
<p>	Q.  Aaron, you had a good night offensively, but it looked like you had to hit a lot of tough shots.  Can you talk about how difficult it was to get a good shot off tonight. </p>
<p>	Q.  Aaron, could you put into perspective what it meant to you to see this program come this far? </p>
<p>	Q.  Aaron, can you talk about the play of Jeff Newton and maybe just in general about Indiana's bench, they put up 41 points tonight. </p>
<p>	Q.  Did the play of Newton surprise you at all and how hot he's been in the tournament? </p>

<p>	Q.  Quannas said after the game his ankle bothered him, he couldn't move side-to-side, that was part of his reason for not being as effective.  What type of role did that play in maybe you not being quite as effective as you would have  liked? </p>
<p>	Q.  One first half shot, looked like you got hit on the elbow.  During the timeout, you kept shaking it.  Did it bother you at all? </p>

<p>	Q.  I can't imagine in your wildest dreams, you would have thought your guards would have had three points between them.  How did that impact your game? </p>
<p>	Q.  You put in your game plan, and part of that must have been to stop some of the bigger-name players from Indiana.  What was your reaction to some of the bench play that Indiana had, particularly Jeff Newton? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you put Aaron back in, he didn't last very long.  How big a swing was that? </p>
<p>	Q.  You had some foul trouble pretty consistent with the big guys.  Do you think that played a role in some of the bad decision making on the post defense that you were talking about? </p>
<p>	Q.  It seemed in the first half that you had control of the game, yet couldn't get it to a 8- or 10-point lead.  Did you get that sense, that maybe you go in the locker room four up, it could have been double figures? </p>
