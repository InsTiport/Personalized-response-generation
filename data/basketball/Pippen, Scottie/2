 Q.  How do you handicap the Eastern Conference this year? 
 SCOTTIE PIPPEN:  I think the teams are still bunched together.  If I had to pull a team out of the hat it would probably be Detroit.  But Miami is still strong.  The absence of Shaq, they're a .500 team right now, but we all know that Shaq is going to make a difference. 
 Wade is back with Shaq, so I think that those are going to be the two teams fighting in the Eastern Conference finals.  I don't see anyone that's a real threat to them.
