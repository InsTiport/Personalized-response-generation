  Q. Any surprises in your rookie season?  
 GREG ODEN: I would like to play better. I wouldn't say I have had too many surprises. I like the fact that my team is playing well and we have a good record and it is not like we came in knowing exactly what we were going to be.   
 So I wasn't caught by surprise, but we are doing pretty good.  
  
  Q. You are on a team that is winning and you are contributing. Does it make it easier to give yourself more time to think where you are supposed to be?   
 GREG ODEN: When we are winning, yeah. When we are losing, it is like you need to step up and do something to help this team out.  
  
  Q. Is it strange for you to be on the rookie team and not playing with the guys that you were drafted with?  
 GREG ODEN: It is a little awkward, but I'm a rookie now. There is nothing I can do about it.
