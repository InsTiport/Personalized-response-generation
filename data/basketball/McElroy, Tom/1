<p>Q. When you see what's going on right now with No. 20, what goes through your mind?</p>
<p>	Q. Did everybody in the league want to come here for the tournament, or did it take some convincing? Did people like the rotation out here?</p>
<p>	Q. Every once in awhile -- do you see any value in ever making a change to rotate it? Would there be any good to come of that if you moved it around?</p>
<p>	Q. The teams, you said?</p>
<p>	Q. Do you look back at the 80s at players like Mullen and Berry and Ewing, Michael Jordan have developed over time. Do you look at the exodus of players in this day and age (inaudible) and in recent years, it doesn't seem like players have the same time to develop those rivalries.</p>
<p>	Q. This week, because you were the chairman, do you still find yourself wincing when you hear "RPI" and "bubble"? Do you have any bad flashbacks to those weekends?</p>
<p>	Q. The last couple years there's been a lot of controversy over rewarding the No. 1 seeds by keeping them closer. Like this year, the Duke/UConn debate. Is there any way you can bring more fairness where one doesn't have to be shipped off to the west or south or whatever?</p>
<p>	Q. 13 teams in the league: Is that too many? Should there be a 14th team to even it out; have two divisions? And your thoughts on Notre Dame being in the Big East?</p>
<p>	Q. When you guys were all in the hotel putting it together to today, what -- what would you consider the thing that you find hardest to believe happened in that 20 years? Is it how big it became? Is it that it's 13? Is it that you were so successful so quickly? Is there one thing that amazes you more than anything else?</p>
<p>	Q. A question on the game as it stands now.</p>
<p>	Q. The Big-10 recently has been looking for a 12th team and names have come up like Missouri for example and also Syracuse and Pitt. How would you react if one of those schools were considered one of the Big-10?</p>
