  QUINCY PONDEXTER:   We've got to believe that we're going to come out and fight our hearts out, we're going to compete every possession and give it our best effort. 

Q.   When it comes to the offensive flow, did you find something in that fourth quarter when you go back and watch it on tape?   Was there anything structurally different?
QUINCY PONDEXTER:   No, we moved with so much better pace, our guys were just getting down and competing.   We played with a really freeâ€‘feeling effort.   We were just going out and playing.   We weren't hesitant.   Guys weren't scared of the moment.   We were just going out and playing.   Our backs were against the wall and we had to dig ourselves out.

Q.   Was it just desperation?
QUINCY PONDEXTER:   I wouldn't say desperation, we just got back to being Grizzly basketball.   We don't care about anything else, we just care about going out and having fun and playing basketball.

Q.   Was there anything else that you saw looking at the way that you guys executed that you can take to Game 3 in terms of offensively in particular?
QUINCY PONDEXTER:   You know, I can't reveal all our secrets, but we're going to come out and we're going to move with better pace.   We figured out some things we could probably score better, and we've got to do a better job on the defensive end.

Q.   Does it all start inside?   Does it have to start inside or can you go a different approach? 
QUINCY PONDEXTER:   You know, we've got to give our big fellas the ball.   They're the best one, two bigs in the league.   They've got a great tandem going on, and we're a great team when we have them going.   But at the same time we have to loosen things being guards, and we've got to find a way to win these games.
