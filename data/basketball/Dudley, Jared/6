<p>	Q.  You said one of the things that they did to you or that you did to yourselves up there was your guys got too excited, weren't patient enough.  Obviously, the pace was what you wanted in this game.  It was kind of an odd way to win a game. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about your offensive rebounds. </p>
<p>	Q.  Craig, you had a 10-foot jumper in the second half.  That was the longest basket your team made in this entire game.  Were you aware of that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Again, is that an odd way to win a game, without making a single outside shot the entire game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you realize the guys hadn't made an outside shot? </p>
<p>	Q.  At what point did this team stop surprising you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Craig, after you made those two free throws, you came back for that last defensive possession there.  Uka put his arm around you.  What was he trying to tell you, impress upon you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Were you surprised that it was Warrick both times, not McNamara, who seemed to hurt you from the outside? </p>

<p>	Q.  Do you think they underestimated how hard Uka was going to play defense at that point?</p>
<p>	Q.  Hakim is a low-post guy, but he's skinnier than most.  Was your object to play him physical today?</p>
<p>	Q.  What adjustments did you make going in to the second half?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about playing Pitt again. </p>
<p>	Q.  When you play Syracuse, you go into the game, are you going in accepting they're going to block some shots, contest shots, and you just got to not let that faze you? </p>

<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  Pittsburgh is a physical team.  How does the team feel playing yesterday and today? </p>
<p>	Q.  Craig, you talk about the way this team played defensively.  The last 14 minutes you held Syracuse to only 13 points. </p>
<p>	Q.  Al, if Uka was maybe the unsung hero on defense, would Jermaine Watson be your unsung hero on offense?</p>
