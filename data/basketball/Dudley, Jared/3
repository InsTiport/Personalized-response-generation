  Q. How frustrating has it been for Amare, having to go up against Odom, how important is that?  
 JARED DUDLEY: I think it's more frustrating defensively knowing we can score in different ways. (Indiscernible) Amare at the top. Bynum's power. Gasol's more precise in his moves. Obviously defensively having a tough time guarding. Amare knows these guys, if you make a mistake, they make you pay. Have to slow them down.  
  
  Q. How?  
 JARED DUDLEY: How do you slow them down? You hope on the road they don't shoot as high a percentage. Defensively switching up our techniques. Fronting them the whole time.   
 Maybe going behind, trapping them a little bit more. They make tough shots. Look at the game film. Gasol. Odom. We hope home court advantage helps us out.  
  
  Q. (Off Microphone)  
 JARED DUDLEY: We did a little bit. Try to max up with Lamar. Tied up in the fourth quarter, had to go back, dig a little bit. We'll try anything.   
 I don't think our offensive posts -- we know certain guys can step up even more. Now playing at home, backs against the wall, that's the kind of games -- we play pretty well at home. And we're hoping this home crowd takes us to the next step.
