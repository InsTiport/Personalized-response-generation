Alabama   63
  Mississippi State   36

THE MODERATOR:   We'll get started with Alabama.   We're joined by head coach Wendell Hudson, student‑athletes Daisha Simmons and Meghan Perkins. 
We'll take an opening comment from coach. 
COACH HUDSON:   I thought we played awful well and awful hard.   The young ladies did a great job of trying to do things we asked them to do.   I thought our zone affected Mississippi State a little bit, kept our big players from getting the ball where they wanted to get it. 
I thought the intensity level of 40 minutes was where it should be for our team.   I have to give the young ladies credit for being in this position.   It's also tournament play, one game in, one game out.   I don't believe they were ready to go home. 
THE MODERATOR:   We'll take a comment from each of the student‑athletes.   Daisha, we'll start with you. 
DAISHA SIMMONS:   I'm just really proud of my team.   Just to come out showing like that in this tournament means a lot.   We feel we're playing in the best tournament in the country.   If we get a couple wins, it will be good for us. 
THE MODERATOR:   Meghan? 
MEGHAN PERKINS:   As a senior, this is what I live for.   The way my team played tonight, I'm very proud of us.   We've been struggling this season.   For us to come out and play like this, this is very big for us. 
THE MODERATOR:   Questions. 

Q.   What was the difference in the two games?
COACH HUDSON:   I think the difference in the two games was rebounding‑wise.   You look at the rebounding stats, at halftime, we was leading them in rebounding.   We didn't have as many points in the paint.   At half, we had more points in the paint. 
I think our intensity level is the other thing that happened.   I think the young ladies played hard, played together, rebounded the basketball against a much larger team as we've rebounded all year probably. 

Q.   Coach, 36 points is the tournament record for fewest points allowed in a game.   What do you credit that to? 
COACH HUDSON:   I think the zone that we played really affected Mississippi State.   They're so post‑oriented. 
The last time we played them, they outscored us in the post.   If you look at the stats now, post points, they still didn't get as many as we had.   We had 30, they had 12 in the paint. 
Credit to their young ladies for their effort, their intensity level.   We out‑rebounded Mississippi State 48‑42.   We had 15 offensive rebounds.   That kind of sums the game up. 

Q.   For the players, what's different for you in tournament play in regards to playing games on back‑to‑back days? 
DAISHA SIMMONS:   The difference is right now we have a couple seniors that this is going to be their last game.   We don't want them to go out like that.   We're not ready to stop playing. 
We know we could compete with these teams during the season and we have a second chance to do it.   We want to go out with fight. 
MEGHAN PERKINS:   Just keep the team motivated.   I don't want this to be my last game. 
When we were here last year, we lost first round and had to go home.   I know that feeling.   We got five people who didn't play with us last year. 
We're just trying to keep this team motivated and keep moving in the right direction right now. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
