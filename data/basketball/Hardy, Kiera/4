<p>	Q.  Talk about Kiera has great ability to create offense through defense but I am assuming there are other elements of her defensive game you are wanting to see an elevation in.  Also a lot of times the summer between sophomore and junior years is a huge improvement period for division players, have you seen that from her?</p>
<p>	Q.  You have seen definite improvement each year that you have been at (inaudible) do you think you can continue that going upward or take the next step this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  I am sure you have been disappointed with the stretch run of the season the last two years, but you have got junior college players that now have a year of experience.  You have got players like Kiera who are now upperclass players.  Do you think that could make a big difference in changing your fate down the stretch run?</p>
<p>	Q.  Kiera, talk about that too, finishing strong?</p>
<p>	Q.  I think you were the highest picked team in the north in the pre-season poll.  Is that good or is it --</p>
<p>	Q.  Kiera, Coach was talking about the large improvement you have made even since you were senior in high school.  Talk about what have been the things you have done best and what has been the hardest part of that improvement process to get to where you are now? </p>
