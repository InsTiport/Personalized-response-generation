<p>	Q.  For the players, talk about defending the three-point shot.  Utah made a lot of threes tonight.  Why was that such a problem area for you guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jacki, do you want to answer the same question? </p>
<p>	Q.  Certainly this game seemed to be a little more competitive than the last two times you played Utah.  What was difficult for you about the match-up this year with Utah and what was different about tonight's game than the two previous?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you're trying to beat a team like that, I'm sure maybe you're not noticing, but do you sort of see Kim Smith and Shona Thorburn and say we can play at that level at some point, we're a growing program? </p>

<p>	Q.  Your top two scorers tonight went 1 for 16 combined from the field.  You probably needed a few more shots from them in the first half.  Is that a fair assessment?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just reflect a little bit on this season and any steps that you feel like your program might have made?  I mean, Elaine was in here earlier, and to quote her accurately, she said that she feels like Air Force is going to make a difference in this league in the next couple years.  Do you feel like you're close to that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think Kim and Shona will go down as two of the outstanding players in this conference?</p>
