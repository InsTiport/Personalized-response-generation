THE MODERATOR:   We're now joined by Alabama head coach Wendell Hudson, student‑athletes Daisha Simmons, Nikki Hegstetter.   We'll take an opening comment from coach.   
COACH HUDSON:   Well, I thought we had some really good opportunities the first half.   We missed some shots that was open, had the game there, a 28‑18 game.   We had certainly some opportunities in the second half.   
But South Carolina did a good job.   Missed some shots.   They did a good job transitioning.   I think playing that game last night, yesterday afternoon, kind of wore us out a little bit.   The effort and intensity level that we needed to have wasn't always there.   
It's hard when you play back to back like that.   
THE MODERATOR:   Daisha?   
DAISHA SIMMONS:   I think we could have did a much better job.   It's always a disappointment going out like that.   All we can do now is look forward to next year.   
THE MODERATOR:   Nikki?   
NIKKI HEGSTETTER:   I thought we gave a lot of effort, but I think we have a lot of work to do in the off‑season.   It gives us an opportunity we don't want to have this feeling again.   It sends us into the off‑season with a little push.   
   
 Q.   Coach, if you could reflect on the season you had this year.   
COACH HUDSON:   I thought we went through some ups and downs.   We were in a bunch of games and we didn't finish a lot of them.   That's kind of one of those things that you look at the season, the ups and downs, not finishing, not going through and doing some of the things we need to do.   
I think Nikki hit the nail on the head:   we have a lot of work to do in the off‑season.   I think if we get that done, get that across, so we don't have this feeling this early.   They'll be playing this early in the tournament.   I think that's a big key also.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you very much.
