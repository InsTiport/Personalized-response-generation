Q. What did you guys, in looking at film, kind of recognize you wanted to do differently or better in Game 3?
ENES KANTER: I think the most important thing we need to do a better job on transition defense.  They got 15 offensive rebounds on us, and that's unacceptable.  I think in the third game we need to out there with a lot of physicality.  Just put a body on them because we've got a lot of really good bigs that can punish them down there.  I think that's what we need to do, just go out there and just punish them.
Q. The energy in the arena is probably going to be pretty crazy.  How do you deal with the emotions of coming back home and kind of staying even keeled?
ENES KANTER: Well, it's going to be my first Western Conference Finals in front of OKC fans.  I'm expecting everybody to show up and it's going to be definitely a crazy atmosphere.  I think just not worry about the second game.  Just go out there and play our basketball in front of our crowd and everything is going to work out well for us.
Q. Kevin [Durant] was saying that they surprised you a little bit by the way they were crashing the offensive boards rather than getting back in transition, and now it's for you guys to adjust.  So how do you adjust?
ENES KANTER: Definitely.  After what we did to them in the first game, definitely the second game they came out ready and they were really physical.  We know, I think the third game we just need to come out there with the mindset that it is going to be a really physical game and we need to punish them down there because we can use our size, we can use our physicality.  And it's in front of our crowd, so just go out there and play.
