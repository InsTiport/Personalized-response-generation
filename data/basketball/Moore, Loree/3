<p>	Q.  So when you all heard your Coach characterized as and the evil empire, what did you think?  </p>
<p>	Q.  Out of curiosity did you understand the difference between focussed and obsessing, because if you obsess on winning the national title it can make the ball seem a lot bigger and the rim seem a lot smaller tomorrow tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  It's difficult to reflect on what is going to happen in tomorrow's game in terms of it being a rematch.  When you reflect back on the last game between UConn and Tennessee, can you talk a little bit about how your team has grown and how your game has improved?</p>
<p>	Q.  Even though you guys had a tough game last night after Duke and it looked like Texas was going to beat Connecticut, did it seem this was predestined to happen, Tennessee and UConn, the dominant teams of last year going for the championship?</p>
<p>	Q.  For any of the players, you have a team full of great players, you played a tough schedule, you see the best players in the country every year; what do you think separates Diana Taurasi from the other players that you have seen?</p>
<p>	Q.  Laurie, I would like to ask you, Kara and Gwen have been through the Connecticut wars for a few years, this is new to you; what are you taking from Raleigh, Ohio; is it impacting you?</p>
<p>	Q.  For Gwen and Kara, watching the game last night, the second game last night, was this the matchup, the outcome you were looking for and the matchup you were hoping for on Tuesday?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is also for Kara and Gwen, you just talked about Taurasi and how she fulfills her role.  You have seen her four or five times over the past few years; how do you slow her down?</p>
<p>	Q.  You watched them yesterday; what does Connecticut do that concerns you or that impresses you, if anything and how will you respond to it?</p>
<p>	Q.  In your last game against Connecticut, can you talk about Gwen's performance in that game and her performance in this tournament so far and why that is important tomorrow night?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, last year, in the game you marvelled at the Connecticut game, the way they passed, the way they executed, that was a fairly unique group, we all understand that.  What stands out about this group as Connecticut, why are they back here if they were supposed to be this young and inexperienced?</p>
<p>	Q.  Pat, I'm sure you're not going to let any coaching secrets out of the bag, you have seen Diana Taurasi four times now; how do you devise a strategy to deal with her?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chamique may have been the greatest player in college basketball.  Have you seen great players, does Diana represent any kind of evolution in the women's game and the way she plays, the sort of flare that she plays with, is she different than anything you seen before in any way?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know you are a football fan; is there any kind of parallel that can be drawn between Connecticut women's basketball and Florida football?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you've talked about the importance of the season, defense over the course of the second half of the year, can you talk about the advantages and disadvantages in a season against a player like Taurasi?</p>
<p>	Q.  Pat, could you comment on your relationship with Geno, the ups and downs you may have had and where things stand now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, do you at all mind being labeled the "Evil Empire" by Geno and if you had to label his team and his personality what would it be?</p>
<p>	Q.  I don't have statistical data to back it up, it always seems to me the teams that shoot better the second game inside a dome  -- do you expect to shoot better tomorrow or do you expect them to shoot better?</p>
<p>	Q.  Pat, both teams that won last night got something out of someone off the bench.  Is that almost an X factor in these games, if both teams have five starters who are equal, is that ultimately what tips these games one way or the other, a big rebound, a big point here and there, those kind of players; is that what makes these games?</p>
<p>	Q.  Last year you talked about learning a lot about yours and the team and I am wondering how you apply those lessons from last year to this year to help you get to the championship game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Last night Gwen started off so well and then kind of disappeared until the end and then kind of took over; is that typical of her this season and does she to be your Taurasi tomorrow for you guys to win?</p>
<p>	Q.  You have been here so many times now and won so many times, how is this one different and how is the desire different, or is it?</p>
<p>	Q.  I hope this comes out right the way I ask, but  --</p>
<p>	Q.  -- should you win the title and you have had such a wonderful career and not that you are going to retire, maybe this summer you might step back and reflect on things and think about the future for you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Last night Geno after the game said that he has beaten you in your last two Final Four appearances and said that the players would want revenge; do you think that your team right now is more hungry or businesslike and why?</p>
<p>	Q.  Pat, in the January game by all rights you should have won that game; Diana had to make three shots that maybe she could maybe never replicate again?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you recall what you were thinking as she is hitting these shots and can you appreciate it even if you are the opposing coach, or does it drive a dagger in?</p>
<p>	Q.  Pat, do you think the game, not just the college game but also the professional game is still growing as we have been here for years and years and what changes need to be made to either continue the trend or reverse the slide?</p>
<p>	Q.  Pat, you just mentioned marketing, in your opinion why is this series, why is this rivalry good for women's basketball?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you addressed your players hunger for this game.  Can you put into words how badly you want this game tomorrow?</p>
<p>	Q.  From a coaching standpoint where do you place the importance of the first 5 minutes of each half?   For a game like this is it just minute by minute?</p>
<p>	Q.  I wondered if those 2 hours coaching in the National semi-finals was as exasperating as they looked or as exasperating as you experienced coaching and what it was like to try to coach that game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Pat, Geno has labeled you guys as the more talented team, do you share that opinion or is that Geno just trying to get the underdog roll?</p>
<p>	Q.  You have had many rivals, Tennessee has over the years, but it seems as though this thing with Connecticut has almost taken a personal quality.  I was wondering is there something beyond the court.  You talked earlier about the competition and the stakes being high.  Is there something else going on that makes this so intense?  </p>
<p>	Q.  You can talk about the players, Loree Moore came up big about scoring, talk about what that means to the offense in general?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just compare this team in terms of like team chemistry to the previous squads that you have taken to the championship game?</p>
