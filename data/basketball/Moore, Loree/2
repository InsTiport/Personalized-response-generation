<p>	Q.  Shyra, they announced the sites for the Final Four action several years in advance; did you see this and think, "I want to go"? </p>
<p>	Q.  Loree, I would like to ask you, were you ever fearful this season that you were not going to have a healthy day and be healthy, your best for this time of year? </p>
<p>	Q.  This is also for Loree.  Loree, through all the injuries and so forth, the different things that you do on the court; the defense, the rebounding, the passing; did they go in progression?  Did you learn one thing well and go to the next or did they all kind of pick up a little bit together?  Describe how that came together. </p>
<p>	Q.  Shanna, shooting is such a big part of your game, have you gotten acclimated to the dome, to the rims; do you feel pretty comfortable out there. </p>
<p>	Q.  To the two Indiana players, could you just talk about the demands for tickets and what sort of delegations you'll have here? </p>

<p>	Q.  Shyra, you've been here quite a few times.  Could you reflect upon the value, maybe it's a cumulative value of Final Four experience and having performed on this stage before and will that possibly give your team an edge this weekend? </p>
<p>	Q.  Shyra, when Sidney got hurt you seemed to move inside more.  How has that changed things for you this season the last 10 games or so? </p>

<p>	Q.  Pat, between Chamique and Nicky, how active have you tried to be recruiting in New York and if it appears to be not very or sporadically, what would be the reason for that?  And also could you tell the story of recruiting Nicky Anosike and what you saw in her and why you think she came to Tennessee?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you take a walk with her?</p>
<p>	Q.  I had one original question, but something since you just hit on, Nicky, how much did her mother play into that; it sounds like she recruited you as much as you recruited her maybe? </p>
<p>	Q.  What's it like, and I know you've done this obviously several times in your career, but now in a Final Four to look down at the opposite bench, you got two coaches over there that you're probably pretty close to, particularly with Semeka being so close to your last national championship?</p>
<p>	Q.  We were up at the concourse earlier for the autograph session.  What's it like having so many fans, not just from Knoxville but you talked to some of these fans and they're from all over the country, and then to hear them talk to you and talk about how you've been able and the Lady Vols have been able to touch their lives. </p>
<p>	Q.  Outside of the fact there was a pretty good team in the northeast, New England, has there been something about getting this 7th championship that has seemed so elusive, and has it begun to take on the characteristics of trying to win your first championship? </p>
<p>	Q.  Joanne P. McCallie yesterday said kind of jokingly that when she was at Northwestern she played you guys and scored 20.  My question is do you remember her as a player, do you remember that game and how is your relationship with her changed now that she's in the coaching ranks? </p>
<p>	Q.  Seimone Augustus is named National Player of the Year today and you faced her many times; can you just talk about the impact she's had on the women's game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Pat, it seems like every time you reach a coaching milestone the chatter begins about maybe you should try coaching on the men's side.  Does part of you find it, I don't know if "insulting" is the right word, that seems to be this thought that the only way you can validate yourself is if you try to coach males? </p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously the Women's Final Four has grown in stature since the first time you were here.  What do you remember about your first visit and as a follow to that, do you think there is a little bit of a shock for first-timers? </p>
<p>	Q.  What about the first-timers now?</p>
<p>	Q.  You were just talking a little bit about the importance of your players acting as role models.  It seems that particularly of late people have been talking about you as a role model, not just for women in basketball and in coaching but sort of women in sport as a whole and is that something that you sort of constantly keep in mind and think of as an important responsibility of yours?</p>
<p>	Q.  Kim Mulkey has talked a lot about your story where you called her when she was pregnant and becoming a mom.  I was wondering if she's so competitive if you'll talk about the mom side of Kim and what you see with that. </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned that Semeka and Al earlier, for a program that doesn't play you regularly, do you think it helps in preparation to have a former player and a former coach from your staff on their team? </p>
<p>	Q.  Two questions.  One, what impresses you about Kristin Haynie, their point guard, and also with their match-up zone, is more important for Shyra to start off and get off to a good start or just let Shanna need to start hitting shots against that early?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there any aspect of tomorrow night's game that you do not want to see Michigan State dominate? </p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering if you were, if you had to leave the game and retire or something, not that I'm trying to push you out --</p>
<p>	Q.  -- are you pleased with the direction of the women's college game right now and would you feel like with coaches like Kim and Pokey that it would be in good hands? </p>
