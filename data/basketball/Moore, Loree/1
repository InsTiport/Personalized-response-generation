<p>	Q.  Shyra, can you just talk about how you're feeling right now? </p>
<p>	Q.  Loree, can you talk about what went on when they made that rush back at you in the second half? </p>
<p>	Q.  Shanna, did your team relax just a little bit when you went up 16, and when did you know this was going to be a fight to the finish? </p>
<p>	Q.  Shanna, is this any more disappointing because it happened in your home state or on your home ground so to speak? </p>

<p>	Q.  Normally when you're able to get a double-digit lead on teams you're pretty much able to lock them down; why were you unable to discourage Michigan State tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about Shyra's play over the last four years in your program and her bright future that she has ahead of her?</p>
<p>	Q.  I think somebody asked you yesterday one of the keys to the game or something along those lanes and you said rebounding and you beat them by 10 and you hurt them on the offensive boards which I know you thought was important.  Yet you still lost the game.  I know it's disappointing no matter what, but does that make it even hurt a little more?  You did the thing that you thought, hey, this is what we got to do, yet you still kind of lost your composure at key points. </p>
<p>	Q.  You addressed it just a second ago a little bit, but that last offensive possession you were down by two and you had like three or four chances to get good shots and seemed like the players thought there was a little bit less time left than there was.  You might have had three or four more seconds to do that.  Would you talk about that. </p>
<p>	Q.  What does it say about the growth of the women's game that tonight we had two teams that never had been this far before, came from a combined 31-down to get the right to play Tuesday? </p>
