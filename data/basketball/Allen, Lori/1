<p>	Q.  Coach, Gary has not wasted any time getting A&amp;M competitive again to where teams -- they really give people fits, obviously.  Knowing what you have there, I mean, do you see it as this season, you know, you all can be competitive you can compete for the middle, for the top, what do you see as realistic for this team? </p>
<p>	Q.  What do you see as your biggest challenge this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  How imperative is it for this team to get off to a quick start?</p>
<p>	Q.  Lori, talk about the differences under your new coach and go into more detail about this Miss O.S.U., how did you win this?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know we have talked a little bit about you sneaking in in some of Eddie Sutton's practices and watching how they do things.  The tradition that has been built on the men's side, how much of that have you been able to draw to the women's program to try and maybe get this program going like to that level eventually?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know the last couple of years LA Tech when it came to the tournament you weren't always real pleased with the seeding you all got.  Do you I think it is a fact that it's going to be the bigger conferences and even those powers that maybe in other conferences are just not going to get that seeding when it comes to tournament time?</p>
