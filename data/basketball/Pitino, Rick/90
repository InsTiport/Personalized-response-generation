<p>	Q.  Do you recall when they first introduced the three-point shot, what your reaction was, and how much it might influence your career and the game in general? </p>
<p>	Q.  In the last 18 years, has the three-point shot become the way you envisioned it in 1987, with everybody using it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Curious to the genesis, on the sidelines during the games, your foot stomping.  Why do you do that?  Sometimes it looks like you stomp it hard enough it would hurt.  Do you wear any particular padding or insoles? </p>
<p>	Q.  In your national championship season in '96, you lost to Mississippi State.  A lot of people think that kind of refocused your team and got them ready for the NCAAs.  Can a loss help you?  Do some teams need a loss before a tournament? </p>
<p>	Q.  At any point during the West Virginia game, were you wishing that rule hadn't been implemented? </p>
<p>	Q.  How good a rebounding team are you?  How big of a role did that play in getting you here to the Final Four? </p>
<p>	Q.  What is your daily or several times weekly fitness routine?  How does it help maybe at a stressful time like this, if there's a bunch of phone calls, things going on? </p>
<p>	Q.  You personally. </p>
<p>	Q.  You've taken three programs now to this point.  You're playing a coach who is here for the first time in his role.  Can you remember back to your first time, those emotions, what he might be going through at this point? </p>
<p>	Q.  What kind of match-up problems do you think James Augustine is going to pose for you inside tomorrow night? </p>
<p>	Q.  What you rein your players or staff in this week in which you did not the first time you came to the Final Four?  Or vice versa, do you let them do some things you didn't the first time you got here?</p>
<p>	Q.  You have been so successful with the zone this year.  What kind of challenges do their three guards present to that?  What kind of challenges can the zone present to them? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about some of the match-up problems their back court gives you.  Your back court guys are longer, shoot the three well.  What are some of the advantages you feel your back court has?</p>
<p>	Q.  If the three-point line is moved back, it presumably becomes a harder shot, not as many are made, do you think that takes away something of what has made this tournament so exciting through the years? </p>
<p>	Q.  With your knowledge of the NBA and college, as the commercialization has increased, the NBA has gotten younger, do you think the gap has closed, one world becoming like the other world, or do you think they've become more distinct, a professional and college world? </p>
<p>	Q.  What might the age limit do for both the college and NBA.  I'm wondering, in light of that, seeing where you are now, do you think much about what might have happened if Sebastian Telfar and some of those other players had come to play for you this year instead of going pro? </p>


<p>	Q.  Ellis, can you talk about the fact that you missed the last year and a half, and how much maybe more special that makes it, you being here in this big stage. </p>
<p>	Q.  Ellis, wondering how you progressed into becoming more of a vocal leader over the course of your career? </p>
<p>	Q.  Ellis and Larry, you guys each give us your thoughts on Illinois, what you think the two or three most important aspects of tomorrow's match-up are going to be. </p>

<p>	Q.  Larry, their back court is considered to be the best back court, their three guards.  Can you talk about that match-up, you guys maybe don't get as much attention. </p>
<p>	Q.  Does being so close to defeat in the West Virginia game make you appreciate being here this much more? </p>

<p>	Q.  Larry, looking at the Fourth Street lives, the send off you got, do you all maybe underestimate the support?  How surprised are you from the attention you got from the City of Louisville? </p>
<p>	Q.  Larry, do you think the three-point line is too close?  What is the players' take on that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Ellis, can you talk about your freshman year or sophomore year when Coach Pitino came, spring, 5 a.m. workouts were like, how you transformed under his watch? </p>
<p>	Q.  What is your body fat at? </p>
<p>	Q.  Were you surprised when Coach Pitino let you stay out at halftime when that ceremony was going onto honor the 1980 champs?  How much of an effect did that have on you? </p>

<p>	Q.  How big is the experience factor of this team?  It's mostly seniors and juniors.  Would you have been here if you were sophomores and juniors instead? </p>
