<p>	Q.  Larry, what did they do defensively to kind of slow down Francisco and Taquan?  Did you see anything that you guys maybe weren't expecting, anything like that from them defensively? </p>
<p>	Q.  Ellis, how much Roger Powell hurt you guys today, especially when he missed the three-pointer, came in for a dunk?  Was that kind of a sign things were going their way? </p>
<p>	Q.  Larry and Ellis, can you both talk about you hear a lot of players say they want to leave a program in better shape than when they showed up.  You guys have certainly done that.  Can you comment on the shape that this program is in and the rebuilding process, getting to this point? </p>
<p>	Q.  Larry, from the time you've been here till now, the program, seeing where it is, how do you feel as far as a pride factor of where it's come? </p>
<p>	Q.  You seem like you pretty much controlled Deron Williams, Dee Brown and Augustine.  Powell went off in the second half.  How shocking was that?  How hard is it to stop Illinois when you stop three of their big guns and another one goes off? </p>

<p>	Q.  What were they doing to kind of slow down Francisco and Taquan?  Just a matter of those guys not having their shot today like they have in the past? </p>
<p>	Q.  Roger Powell virtually took over the game there for a while to start the second half.  What was going on that he was scoring inside and outside? </p>
<p>	Q.  What can getting to the Final Four, experiencing playing in the Final Four, what can it mean to this program and the rebuilding process? </p>
<p>	Q.  Francisco left the door open he might come back next year.  He said he wanted to talk with you about it.  What's going on with that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Even after Roger Powell had his big streak, you were only down one.  Then Luther hit a couple big threes.  When Luther started chiming in with Roger, how much did that change the game? </p>
<p>	Q.  You had spoken yesterday about how much fun this Final Four trip was, how it was more fun than your other trips to the Final Four.  Will you still feel that way when you look back and reflect? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned their run that they made after it was one point, what about your offense during that stretch?  Were shots just not falling or some other things you didn't like? </p>
<p>	Q.  After watching Illinois on tape, then playing against them, do you see a recurring theme where maybe they do one thing better than anybody else?</p>
