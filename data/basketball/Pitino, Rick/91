<p>	Q.  In view of some of the shots the Big-10 took during the regular season, the criticism of the league, what does it mean to have two teams in the Final Four, to have the best NCAA record right now? </p>
<p>	Q.  Your players throughout this season have never allowed personal agendas to get in the way of the team concept, despite the fact there are a number of NBA prospects on your team, there's a lot of pressure on upperclassmen to produce individually.  Were you concerned at all about that factor and how have they accomplished this? </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm wondering if you have a regular, for you, workout routine, what it is, and if it's an escape at a time like this when things are so hectic? </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm sure you've been told about a million times now that you're the one coach in this Final Four that as a head coach hasn't taken a team to the Final Four.  I'm curious as to what your take is on that and if you've reached out to any other coaches for any advice. </p>
<p>	Q.  As great as this season has been, has it been difficult to fully enjoy it, given the passing of your mother earlier this month? </p>
<p>	Q.  Your guards are basically interchangeable parts.  Has that kind of a player replaced the point guard as the most important player on a team?  What kind of advantages does that give you? </p>
<p>	Q.  You were talking about seeking out other coaches for advice.  If you could speak to each of your other three coaches that are in this year's Final Four, what might you ask them specifically for advice about this year? </p>
<p>	Q.  You just touched on this a few minutes ago, but do you see a lot of similarities in styles between the two teams? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the size of Louisville's back court and what challenges that presents. </p>
<p>	Q.  How far along are you in the game plan?  What do you know about Louisville that you didn't know two days ago? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned the threes the other day.  There were tons of threes taken over the weekend.  You were behind.  Louisville was behind.  What do you think of the three-pointer?  Is it too much?  Is there too much reliance on it in this day and age?  Do you like it or what? </p>


<p>	Q.  As the only guy in the field here who has coached in both college and the NBA, I know there's a lot of talk about the NBA instituting a 20-year age limit.  College has had great TV ratings.  Who do you think that rule would help most and how do you think it would affect the college game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Rick, this is your fifth Final Four.  If you could give one or two pieces of advice to Bruce Weber, what would you say? </p>
<p>	Q.  If there's a common thread with the four teams going to St. Louis, there's a lot of seniors and juniors on the floor.  I don't know if that's been the case of late.  I was hoping maybe you could talk a little about that.  Doesn't seem like it's a coincidence. </p>
<p>	Q.  The three-point shot was such a huge factor in the regional finals in so many different ways, not only yours, but the other games.  As you think back to the '87 Providence team you had, can you discuss a little bit how teams are using the three nowadays in comparison and how teams are defending it. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think Garcia overcoming so much tragedy will help him provide a good scoring spark for you in the tournament?  How do you feel about Garcia?  How do you think he's going to handle all the pressure and everything? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've been to a bunch of Final Fours and were fortunate enough to win one.  If you hadn't, would you feel a sense of incompleteness?  Do you at all relate to Roy Williams situation at this Final Four? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Luther Head, Taquan Dean's injury at this point and the importance of having a good trainer around Final Four time? </p>
<p>	Q.  With all these close games, we've seen some kids do some pretty remarkable things under pressure situations the last couple weeks.  In a late game timeout, how much of what you draw up actually comes to fruition or how much is dependent on the player kind of rising to the moment? </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm curious about the second time you took a team to a Final Four, how much easier or how much more comfortable did you feel having had the experience of going once before? </p>
<p>	Q.  Players like Francisco and Dee and Deron are versatile enough to play more than one position.  Has that type of player replaced the point guard as the most important player on the team now?  Having that type of player, what kind of advantage does it give you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Bruce Weber has complimented your ability as a coach.  Can you describe how your willingness to adapt even within a season has helped you and your team? </p>
<p>	Q.  The size of your back court, size of your one, two, three guys, what kind of problems does that present opposing teams? </p>
<p>	Q.  I've heard you say establishing the brand name at Louisville was one of your difficult early obstacles.  I was wondering how you did that. </p>




<p>	Q.  The guards, perimeter guys who can play more than one position, is that type of player replacing the point guard as the most important player on the team?  Having those kinds of guys, what kind of advantage does that give you? </p>
<p>	Q.  With the women in, you guys in, what is the mood like around campus? </p>
<p>	Q.  Bruce Weber said that he sought you out for a little advice on how to handle the first Final Four team.  What exactly did you tell him? </p>
<p>	Q.  Any theory on why this is the fourth straight year that a school has sent both the men and the women to the Final Four?  Maybe it's tough to look at the big picture, but why at Michigan State?  Is it facilities, sport, local talent? Any  theory on why?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you measure conference success?  Is it NCAA tournament success or top-to-bottom regular-season success? </p>
<p>	Q.  Dee Brown and Deron Williams are likely going to play their last games this weekend.  Illini fans feel like it has flown by.  Is it opposite for an opposing coach? Does it feel they have been together for a while? </p>
<p>	Q.  This will be your fourth Final Four.  Could you describe the emotion of leaving as the champion and what it meant to you to have that national title. </p>
<p>	Q.  With all these games going down to the wire last weekend, possibility of that happening again this week, wondered how you balance as a coach in late game situations, giving the players enough structure yet at the same time enough rope to step up and kind of take advantage of the moment? </p>
<p>	Q.  Four Final Fours in seven years, obviously you have the best winning percentage among active coaches, won a national title.  Do you ever stop to pinch yourself that all this is happening to a kid from Iron Mountain? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned the NCAA tournament is all about match-ups.  I was wondering if you could talk a little about the match-up at the four spot where North Carolina goes 6'9", 6'10" with the Williams guys, and you're more around 6'6", kind of how you see that match-up playing out. </p>
<p>	Q.  A few years ago there was a lot of talk that the college game was going to suffer as more and more kids went from the McDonald's All-American game into the NBA draft.  You're coming off a weekend of great basketball games.  How do you explain how the college game has come through this process and how do you feel about the proposed NBA age limit? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is this an anomaly this year where all four teams are really upperclassmen dominated?  Are we going to see another team that has a Carmelo Anthony as the young kid leading the way? </p>



<p>	Q.  With Raymond, you have a pure point, and the rest of the teams, Michigan State uses Chris Hill who can play a couple positions, Louisville uses Francisco, can probably play three.  Is one or the other type of player more beneficial?  What advantages does each bring? </p>
<p>	Q.  How do you measure the strength of a conference?  Is it what it does in the regular season or does the NCAA tournament have more weight on how strong a conference is? </p>
<p>	Q.  The three-point shot was a huge factor in all the regional finals last weekend.  I don't know if you had a chance to see the West Virginia-Louisville game.  As a coach, when a team is pumping them in, especially from 23 or 24 feet, is there almost a tendency, "What can I do?"  Throw up your hands type thing. </p>
<p>	Q.  How can a staff with Final Four experience help a team that has no Final Four experience? </p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously Tom Izzo is a tremendous all-around coach, but that specific tournament success, that winning percentage, what would you attribute that to?  Is it the style that emphasizes defense and rebounding, is it skill at short-term game preparation? </p>
<p>	Q.  I was hoping could you talk about the experience level.  All four teams are really senior/junior dominated.  You've been here with both extremes. </p>
<p>	Q.  You got three coaches in this Final Four with multiple Final Four appearances, and one in Bruce Weber who is a rookie at it.  If Bruce were to ask you for advice about how to handle things this week, what would you tell him? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you tell me, have you seen any change in Marvin Williams throughout the course of this year?  Tell us the importance of his game to the team overall. </p>
<p>	Q.  When you brought your KU teams here for regional action, you would always take them down to the river to spit in the Mississippi River.  Can you talk about that tradition, whether you're going to do that this weekend. </p>
<p>	Q.  Early in his career, Sean May's scoring on the inside, finishing plays was not one of his strengths.  Can you talk about how that's progressed this season, whether or not you feel like because he's kind of become more of a focal point of the offense, whether he's become more of a leadership guy? </p>
<p>	Q.  You were talking about the experience that coaches have in the Final Four.  Are the kids seeking you out this week to talk to you and your assistants about what your experiences have been in the past?  Are they just going on like it's another week? </p>
<p>	Q.  What should the players expect?  How will you prepare them for the pageantry of this week and the weekend? </p>
