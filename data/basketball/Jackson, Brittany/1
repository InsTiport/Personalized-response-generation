<p>	Q.  Gwen, you scored 9 of your teams first 13 points by the 6-minute mark of the first half then went silent the rest of the half; can you talk about what happened that second part of that first half and what you needed to do to turn things around again. </p>
<p>	Q.  Considering the circumstances, have you played a bigger or a better game at Tennessee than tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  It looked like you guys were hurting as much as you were hurting them running the ball early.  Once you slowed down and started pounding it inside things seemed to work out, did you sense that or was it that coach kind of slowing you down?  How did it work out, Kara and Gwen. </p>
<p>	Q.  Kara, it looked at times you guys were nervous almost playing not to lose which is a good way to lose; is that true?</p>
<p>	Q.  Brittany, what were you trying to do when you came in the second half for the team. </p>
<p>	Q.  Gwen, you got 15 rebounds, your team out rebounded them 40 to 30; what would you say was the most important factor; was it muscle under the board, desire, what actually was it right there. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, with Kara struggling, how important was it for Gwen to have the night she did?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, out of curiosity I can imagine the consternation, playing them the first half and you are down (Inaudible), was there a need to yell or take a deep breath and say you played well; we can take this game the second half; what did you tell them?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, I was wondering Duke was the team that you beat pretty handily at the beginning of the year, obviously you and the Tennessee program has a history with Duke the last five years, the energy for players, trying to get the level up to intensity, did that factor come into play at all or was it just one game at a time?</p>
<p>	Q.  The history with Duke did that (Inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Pat, the 2-3 zone that you played a lot of down the stretch, how much of that was designed to cutoff Beard's penetration; how much of that was because the teams you played before; your team seem to do a pretty good job with it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, what was the difference in Gwen tonight and when you all played Duke in November?</p>
