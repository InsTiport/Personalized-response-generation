MaCHELLE JOSEPH:   Obviously we're disappointed in the final score of the game, but like I've told this team all year long, the scoreboard doesn't make you a winner or loser, it's how you play the game.   I really felt like we played hard for 40 minutes.   Obviously we had challenges inside with Mavunga.   She had her way with us with our undersized posts.   It's just one of those things where we know what we have to do moving forward to compete at the highest level in the ACC and with somebody like Mavunga, we've got to have bodies that can challenge her on the inside.   I thought struggled to score with their size and their physicality.   I thought it was probably the most physical game we've been in all year, and I thought that bothered our shooters a little bit, and we just weren't able to connect on shots that we normally hit.   
   
 Q.   Aaliyah, can you address what coach said about the physical play and how it affected y'all's shooting?  
AALIYAH WHITESIDE:   I think we just didn't go up as strong, and we weren't getting the calls, so we just kind of missed a lot of shots, so I think that really affected us.   We definitely struggled to score at times, and we got some good rebounds, we just couldn't put it in the basket.   
   
 Q.   Coach, they had three different scorers in double digits.   How important was it that they got balanced scoring from different players?   
MaCHELLE JOSEPH:   Well, I think it was more than double figures.   We had four players in double figures.   They had three, but they had balance across the board.   They had seven players with eight or more points.   Their scoring was spread out.   I thought this was one of the most balanced attacks that I've ever seen a North Carolina team have.   I really thought that they shot the ball really well from the perimeter.   They did a great job of getting Mavunga touches on the inside.   Sometimes she doesn't get enough touches, and I thought tonight they really made a concentrated effort to give her the ball, and I thought that caused us several problems.   I mean, one of the things that I'm proud of our effort is any time you out‑rebound North Carolina you're doing something, and that's a huge effort on our part with our post players being 5'11" and six foot to out‑rebound North Carolina, I thought that was a great effort.   
   
 Q.   What really gives you so much trouble with North Carolina this year?   You haven't been able to stay in the games, although you've done better against a whole lot of other teams.   
MaCHELLE JOSEPH:   Well, I think one thing about North Carolina, they always give us their best shot.   It seemed like this year in particular, I think maybe since last year when we kind of upset them at home, I think we've kind of got their attention a little bit.   I know that they don't come into the game overlooking us, and I think that's one of the things they give us their best effort.   I thought when we played up there this year and tonight in the ACC Tournament, I thought we got to see one of their best efforts I've seen all year.   I've watched about ‑‑ 10 times, I've watched them play this year and this was one of the best all‑around games I've seen as a team.   
   
 Q.   Your team probably played the best game of the day yesterday.   Do you think that maybe got their attention a little bit?   
MaCHELLE JOSEPH:   Possibly.   It's hard to say.   Again, I thought that they came out and they were very, very physical and aggressive, and this time of the year you've got to be very physical and aggressive.   I've always said that guards‑‑ post players get you to postseason and guards win in postseason, and I really think that Mavunga is really stepping up her game right at the right time.   This could be a very dangerous North Carolina team throughout this tournament.  
   
 Q.   Aaliyah, what do you think about possibly playing some more basketball this year.   
AALIYAH WHITESIDE:   I would be excited for it.   We have a young team, so I think it would definitely help for next year.   I think we definitely need to just keep working because I think we're a good young team.
