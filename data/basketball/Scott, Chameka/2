<p>	Q.  Did things ever slow down, have they yet slowed down for you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Other than get your picture on the cover of the phone book, can you give some examples of how it was different this year?  I saw billboards all over town when I came down for baseball and just lots of different things like that. </p>
<p>	Q.  Now that you all have done this and you have been as a player and a defending champion, so how -- what is going to be different for your players this year having done it?</p>
<p>	Q.  You bring up the freshmen, wondering if you can comment about not only your team, but the conference in general and how it appears that newcomers into the league may play a bigger role or be a bigger factor in determining how the league race plays out?</p>
<p>	Q.  Concerning the talent here in Texas with women's basketball, I have a question and your thoughts on Miss Wyatt because I really watched her play in the tournament last year and it seemed like she stepped up when she really had to.  You had your veterans that were there but she really stepped up.  Also your comments on the (inaudible) state of Texas?</p>
<p>	Q.  Yes. </p>
<p>	Q.  You think she will pick up with Chelsea with it --</p>
<p>	Q.  Will you tell us a little bit about this year's team, what you all are expecting?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you work on anything specific this summer to try to improve your game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about -- I am not sure if you know but you were named pre-season player of the year.  We all know your story of how -- how you learned basketball all that stuff.  What does it mean now that people have basically picked you out being the being the best player in this league?</p>
<p>	Q.  You had such amazing post tandem with Steffanie last year.  I know the year before will you to play without letter in the post seen so you are used to.  That can you talk about a whole season without her as well as you worked together how you guys think you can make up for that and Kim, if you can then talk about that too. </p>

<p>	Q.  Talk about your newcomers and maybe which ones you expect to make an impact immediately?</p>
<p>	Q.  We all got a sense when -- how excite the everybody was when you guys came back and talk to go Kim at the end of the summer she said a lot of that excitement hadn't abated, she was still getting emails and phone calls from people.  Can the two of you talk about whether it's on campus in the community what it's been like the last few months being national champions? </p>

<p>	Q.  Tell us the status of Jordan Davis's health situation and how she is doing now?</p>
<p>	Q.  One of things you did last year, Kim, you had to push a lot of buttons at different times, and it could be a different kid, you had your consistent people like Sophia and Steffanie and Chameka but you had different role players come forward.  I guess with a smaller team this year how do you think that's going to work out?  Are you still going to be in that position of having to come up with different moves at different times?</p>
