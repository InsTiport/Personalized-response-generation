<p>	Q.  Sophia, seems like y'all dominated inside, especially in the first half.  Can you talk about the passing, how y'all did it. </p>
<p>	Q.  Chameka, they came out quick on y'all.  About 14 minutes to play, y'all had those three consecutive steals, hit some fast breaks.  How much did that get y'all going? </p>
<p>	Q.  Chameka, can you talk about how it did open it up for you?  Seems like particularly more in the second half, y'all kind of went inside out and it opened up some for you on the three-pointers. </p>
<p>	Q.  Chameka, like coach said, you started out really strong.  Was that a concerted effort?  They already played a ballgame.  You came out and acted like you've been playing for a week. </p>
<p>	Q.  Sophia, I wonder if you would talk about the contribution of LaToya tonight. </p>
<p>	Q.  Sophia, can you talk about getting a little rest today.  Looked like coach did a good job of trying to give you and Steffanie and Chelsea some minutes on the bench to maybe kind of rest you for a run here. </p>
<p>	Q.  Chameka, concerned at all into the first half, end of the second half, lulls there, offensive lulls? </p>

<p>	Q.  Beginning of the second half they cut it to 10, you called a timeout pretty quick after that.  Can you talk about Chameka and LaToya after you called that timeout, how much they kind of took over? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a bit about the passing, especially early in the game?  Y'all really set up good shots. </p>
<p>	Q.  Even though they've got some size, was the inside something you felt like you could dominate or have some success inside early? </p>
<p>	Q.  As you mentioned, you've got Sophia, you've got Steffanie.  This truly is a total team effort almost every night out. </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you expand on that.  If that's the case, when you're coaching the game, is the first five minutes an he evaluation period for what you think -- what kind of strings you need to pull? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about that stretch early where Whitaker I think had all three steals, and y'all score on the other end?  Got y'all going.  I think it was a 13-0 run. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about what it takes to be a role player like LaToya, not knowing how many minutes you're going to play, having to step in whenever you get the call? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you talk about defense, it seems to me the most elite level defenses, you look at North Carolina, I feel your team is at that level.  Make what even should be an easy play hard.  Do you think that's just a simple pass play, that happened today. </p>
