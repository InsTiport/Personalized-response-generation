<p>	Q.  Was that a conscious effort on your part to go inside on the second half to cut down the running game a little bit?  It looked like you had a power game in the second half. </p>
<p>	Q.  Would you like to see Josh be more assertive all the time?</p>
<p>	Q.  Defensively there's a bigger test for you guys, how did the team come through team defense-wise for the freshmen in particular in it was a test for everybody. </p>
<p>	Q.  How would you assess Pocius' play in the first half? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is this what you've come to expect from J.J., your backs are against the wall a little bit and he has a big night, 31 points and largely responsible for the outcome? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think Marcus is out for a while, where do you go from there? </p>
<p>	Q.  It's obviously too early to know who you're playing, curious if you've seen Memphis at all in?</p>
<p>	Q.  Shelden seemed to get some more open looks in the second half; did you change anything on your offense to get him more one-on-one looks?</p>
<p>	Q.  Why do you think Shelden played so much better after he came back in with the four fouls? </p>
