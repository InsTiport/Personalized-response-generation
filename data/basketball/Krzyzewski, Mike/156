<p>	Q.  Tough question to ask, I'm sure not easy to answer, but how difficult is this game to lose, especially when you're up by eight with three and a half to go? </p>

<p>	Q.  Chris, can you give us some thoughts about the last three minutes?  Was it their outstanding face guarding or did you guys struggle with your offensive execution or a bit of both? </p>
<p>	Q.  What did you think about the performance of Okafor in the second half? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mike, for the years we see teams collapse, maybe that's a bad word, but teams have a lead. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about how tough it is? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the difficulty of having an eight-point lead and losing that lead at the very end. </p>
<p>	Q.  Regardless of how it ended, for Chris, this has to be an incredibly rewarding season, especially after what was a disappointing year for him last year, especially with the leadership he showed in the tournament with playing with the bruised ribs. </p>
<p>	Q.  They shot 63% in the second half.  That's uncommon against a Duke team.  Was it just that they got really hot? </p>
<p>	Q.  In the final three minutes with Okafor foul problems, they kept giving him the ball in the post.  Did you think of putting him on the line to get his free-throws?</p>
<p>	Q.  Horvath. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you comment on Shavlik's contribution?</p>
<p>	Q.  You know both surviving teams pretty well.  How do you size up Monday's game? </p>
