<p>	Q.  Memphis obviously gained a lot from this tour.  So that's what I was going to ask you.  What do you gain from this tournament? </p>
<p>	Q.  When both teams have relied on freshmen, is it at all surprising to you any more that freshmen are able to come in and make an impact the way they do?</p>
<p>	Q.  After the game was over, what did you say to Carney?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is this the best you've seen Williams play offensively? </p>
<p>	Q.  What's the approach as far as Shelden and J.J. to be the focal point of the teams that are coming up?  How do you approach that, how do you make sure that they don't get frustrated as the season goes? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Sean, people developing into roles, but your other two seniors and what have they done, what do they need to do more of in this adjustment phase?</p>
<p>	Q.  John said you won by making all of the hustle plays in the end, is that the way you see it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach said he would have been fine to going to overtime and felt the longer the game goes the better it was for him.  Did you have a sense on that one way or the other? </p>
<p>	Q.  Josh got blocked twice early in the game and then he came back with a couple of dunks.  Were you looking for something like that, like the get-mad, get-back?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you see any similarities between this team and the team that won in 2000? </p>
