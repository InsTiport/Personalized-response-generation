<p>	Q.  Can you talk about what Steve Blake means to your team?  Doesn't get a lot of attention from the media, but he's obviously one of the keys to your success this year.  Talk a little bit also about what you think the particular strengths of his game are?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you tell me how important it was in the program when Williams stayed in '89 when he had a chance to leave, and did that mold the future of the program where it didn't have to take that big dip?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you had a chance to speak with him yet?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was just going to ask, breaking through and making it to the Final Four, with the way your recruiting has gone, you'll be moving into a new arena in a couple of years.  Do you feel like your program is reaching the position where it can be a yearly contender to reach the Final Four, to contend for National Championships? </p>
<p>	Q.  What are your impression of the job Tom Izzo has done at Michigan State, and what makes it so difficult and rare to do what he has done, and what you did in terms of going to Final Fours in consecutive years?</p>
<p>	Q.  How well do you know him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Mike, I'm wondering that your use of the 3-point shot this year, was it something that you foresaw in the off-season or just how did it develop? </p>
<p>	Q.  I read the article about taking exams during tournament time.  What's your take on that?  Is there sort of a weird paradox in that student/athletes have become athlete/students any time the NCAA Tournament roles around that it takes precedent? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you comment on the job Gary has done after that night when your team came back and shocked Maryland the way it did?   What is your impression of his job since then? </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm writing about Jason Williams and I have a Williams-related question.  If you could talk about Jason Williams, from your perspective, and then for Coach K., If you could talk about what do you think he can still learn if he were  -- you know, assuming he stays in college or whatever, what do you think he could still learn next year? </p>

<p>	Q.  You've been to the Final Four several times from various teams.  Can you talk about, I guess, is there one factor with those teams that stands out, that made each one of those teams special enough to reach the Final Four?  And secondly, could you just speak about Chris Duhon's play this year? </p>
<p>	Q.  I'd like to ask both of the coaches a question, kind of from different perspectives.  What does it mean to you to win at the Final Four in terms of recruiting the way the university viewed you, the way maybe the public or the media viewed you?  And Gary, what way do you think it would do for you to win at the Final Four? </p>

<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)?</p>

<p>	Q.  Could you both talk about the balance of this Final Four field and how any of the four teams can win it?  And also, could you also address the fact that these two teams, Duke and Maryland, have to get it on again for the fourth time in one season? </p>

<p>	Q.  Could you just talk about what it means for you to finally get to the Final Four?  And also, talk about what you did to keep the team together after that tough  --  blowing the lead against Duke? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you had that difficult loss at home against Duke, and your fans were turning on you, that kind of thing, what did you do to keep the team together there and to get the even keel back?</p>
<p>	Q.  You joked a little while ago that if you got past the Sweet  16 and got to the Final Four, you would be much smarter as a coach.  Obviously, you are talking about perception, but do you think there is anything that you've learned over the years that has helped you this time, or was it just happenstance that this team got by when some of the others didn't? </p>
<p>	Q.  You both alluded to this earlier about the strength of the Conference.  What does it mean to guarantee the ACC a spot in the Final Four, and what would if mean to each coach to carry the Conference banner into the Final? </p>

<p>	Q.  Does the fourth time around, familiarity breeds, what, contempt?  Comfort?  What exactly do you think? </p>

<p>	Q.  If you could follow-up on that theme of familiarity, what are there, if there are any, disadvantages to both teams and the players knowing each other so well? </p>
