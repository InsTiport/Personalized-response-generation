 Q. Just your thoughts on the event? It was pretty cool with the kids today. What was your favorite part?   
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, well, when they raised the wall and to see the reaction of all the kids, including the kids who are playing on our team because I think it brought out the kid in them, to see how those kids reacted. I'm not sure it could have been better.   
   
 Q. It was awesome.   
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, just watching it and the excitement. It helped our team feel even deeper the responsibility and the honor of playing for our country.   
   
 Q. Was that the goal doing an event like this to try to help bring that on?   
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, and also to bring‑‑ we want to get associated with TAPS and help out beyond their team. We want our country to be proud of us, and that was what we tried to do 11 years ago when Jerry took over. It's worked, and you don't do that without coming to be with the public. So these guys have done that. I'm anxious to coach them. I'm really anxious to coach them.   
   
 Q. One of the biggest challenges with this team as opposed to the other team?   
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: It's the same, and that's adapting. How quickly will we adapt to one another, because you only have a limited amount of time, and we have six guys who have never played for our staff so we need the help of the six guys who have and the leadership. But today, they really get along. We're a very versatile team. I'm anxious to see how we all mesh.   
   
 Q. As usual you sound excited?   
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, well, we should be excited. In order to represent your country, if you're not excited about representing your country, then you're a sad case. So, no, it's an honor and it's exciting. Looking forward to being in Vegas and getting going.
