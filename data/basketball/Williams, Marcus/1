 Q.  Talk about what the experience has been like so far? 
 MARCUS WILLIAMS:  It's been real cool to come help the kids on a day like this and to show the support to the inner city. 
 I think it was a real good thing that we did today. 

 Q.  Talk about tonight's game. 
 MARCUS WILLIAMS:  We have to go out there and win.  You can't go out there just to play.  You don't want to get injured, of course, but you still want to go out there and try to get a win.
