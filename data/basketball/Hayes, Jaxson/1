Q. How can you summarize your feelings about tonight so far?
JAXSON HAYES: I'm really just excited right now.  Excited my family's here with me.  Excited my name finally got called.  So that's really all I can say.  Just really excited.
Q. I know it's early, but how do you think your game will pair with Zion Williamson?
JAXSON HAYES: I think it will pair really well.  We're both really athletic guys.  Zion obviously is a freak.  But I feel like we'll match up really well together.
Q. You're the third Texas center in a row to go in the first round.  Another one plays in this building - Jarrett Allen.  He tweeted out a congratulations to you.  Have you had any contact with him?  Is he someone you've tried to model your game after?
JAXSON HAYES: Yeah, I've met Jarrett a few times.  He's given me a lot of advice, as well as some older big guys that went to University of Texas.  Yeah, they've just given me a lot of advice really.
Q. Over the summer, what are some of the skills or moves you are looking forward to adding to your arsenal to prepare for the regular season?
JAXSON HAYES: I'm looking to add more shooting into my game.  Also more of an outside game, so kind of like a trailer.  get the ball, maybe handle it a little bit.  So just stuff like that.
Q. Where do you think you grew the most in your one year at Texas?  How do you think that's going to serve you at the pro level?
JAXSON HAYES: I feel like I grew the most in my offensive game.  I've always kind of had my defensive game to kind of put my name on, something that I pride myself on.  But I feel like my offensive game came along way well while I was at Texas.  I just want to thank the coaches for that.
