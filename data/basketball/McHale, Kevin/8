Warriors   115
      Rockets - 80

Q.   As well as they played in that first half defensively, the Warriors played defensively in the first half, were there things you weren't doing‑‑
    KEVIN McHALE:   We had some breakouts that we didn't get early.   We didn't really get an offensive rhythm all night.   We couldn't stop them.   If we did stop them‑‑ they beat us in two areas that we can't beat, and when we get beat in that area we lose every single time.   We got hammered on the boards and we didn't beat them in the paint.   For us, we've got to be able to handle our business in the paint, score down there, get fouled and offensive rebound, and they beat us up in those two areas, and we had no answer for that. 

Q.   You guys have shown so much heart all season.   What's the state of your team‑‑
    KEVIN McHALE:   We've got nothing else we can do.   We've got to come out and fight.   We didn't play particularly well tonight, but they out‑hustled‑‑ they got loose balls, they got tips, they made the second and third and fourth efforts.   You know, we seemed to get down because our offense wasn't flowing, and you know, again, it doesn't matter who we play.   That team won 67 games this year.   But it doesn't matter who we play, when we get beat on the boards and get beat in the paint points, we very seldom win those games against anybody. 

Q.   Is it a reflection of your lack of defensive intensity when they only commit one turnover in the first half? 
    KEVIN McHALE:   Well, you know, I honestly‑‑ we did not play very well, and they played better than we did in all aspects of the game.   I mean, we're down 2‑0, we had two tight games there, and I was surprised that we didn't come out with more.   I thought we'd come out with a little more juice, and it seemed like things got a little tight defensively.   They tightened it up, we couldn't make some shots, and then we just‑‑ they just drove us all night long, they got the ball and just attacked our paint.   When we're attacking the other team's paint and being aggressive, we play a lot better, and we didn't have great ball movement, great body movement, and we weren't able to collapse their defense.   I don't think anybody had real good looks at threes because we were collapsing their defense and getting in there and making them run out.   We had some break opportunities early in the first half, in the first quarter, that we didn't score on, and it seemed like that just deflated us. 
    And then they got it going, and they just piled it on. 

Q.   Steve was just saying he's never seen a shooter like Curry in terms of the ball handling combined with the confidence and the smoothness of the shoot.   Is this as well as you've seen anyone shoot it at this level?
    KEVIN McHALE:   Yeah, he's a great shooter.   Tonight he‑‑ again, we made some mistakes early and he made us pay.   They got some offensive rebounds, they throw it out to him and those are tough because everybody is scrambling.   But on the offensive rebounds they put more guys on the board that should be able to run on them if we get it.   We weren't able to run out, but yeah, he makes you pay.   The kid is a phenomenal talent.   He had an MVP year.   He had a great game tonight and I don't think he really had any impact on the game for maybe five minutes to go in the second quarter.   He had an impact in the game, we were trapping a little bit, he was throwing it out.   He was very patient he just let his offense come to him, and when it came, it came in bunches.
