  KEVIN McHALE:   Just so you don't have to ask the question about it, Dwight hasn't warmed up yet, so I don't know how he's going to go, so we'll see how he warms up and how his knee feels. 
Next question?   (Laughter.) 

Q.   I just want to start off by asking kind of a non‑basketball question.   I asked Steve about playing against you back in the day and if that had any bearing on how he prepares his team.   He said he couldn't guard you, but I wanted to know maybe your thoughts about that. 
KEVIN McHALE:   Well, they all shoot like Steve, which is a problem for us.   He's done a nice job with his team.   Look, we've got to come out and do a few things better.   You know, we made a few minor adjustments that we're going to go with tonight and go out and get after them. 

Q.   When you had sometimes as a player, Conference Finals, I remember one Finals, maybe more than one, where you were choosing whether to play hurt, how receptive were you to trainers, doctors, trying to influence you, and how do you feel about it looking back?
KEVIN McHALE:   That was a whole different era, and I didn't listen to anybody.   I just listened‑‑ I wanted to play, and you have to have some part of you that feels that you can contribute no matter what shape you're in.   Yeah, I mean, hey, you see me walk around now, I didn't always make the best decision.   (Laughter.)
