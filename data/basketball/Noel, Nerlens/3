Q.   I saw the smile on your face when you came on the court. 
NERLENS NOEL:   Yeah, yeah.   It feels great.   To be sidelined for a year away from basketball festivities like this.   And to be able to be a part of it this year, to be back on the court, just being around the guys from around the league, going through what I'm going through, it feels good. 

Q.   I know that Mike isn't playing, but the fact that you have three guys.   We know the process that you're all going through.   But the fact that you all have three of the best 11 U.S. players. 
NERLENS NOEL:   Yeah, it feels great to be able to arrive.   Mike is not playing.   I think it means a lot, the group we have.   We're going to continue to improve.   And build for this. 

Q.   What do you think is the hardest challenge transitioning to the NBA?   What do you think was the hardest challenge for you? 
NERLENS NOEL:   I definitely have to say the physicality.   I'm a leaner guy.   Just the speed of the game.   The game moves so fast.   Be able to slow your mind down in a lot of different ways.   Let the game come to you. 

Q.   Does anyone help you try to do that best? 
NERLENS NOEL:   The assistant coaches.   All of my coaches, really, they try to help me the best they possibly can to transition into the NBA.   I think I've progressed in a lot of ways, mentally. 

Q.   Who is the most NBA‑ready college player?   Like in college basketball, who do you think is the most NBA‑ready?
NERLENS NOEL:   I don't watch a lot. I just watch my Wildcats.   I think they are all ready.
