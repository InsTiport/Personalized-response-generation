  Q. What did you do to prepare?  
 SHANNON BROWN: Just really practiced, went to my previous dunk contest I was in and watched what I did, same action, same motion, and just really got ideas from everybody. But just really want to go out there and have some fun.  
  
  Q. I heard you got some ideas from President Obama. Is that true?  
 SHANNON BROWN: No, I didn't really get no ideas from Obama. Obama, Mr. President, Obama just basically told me that he was going to be watching, so I'd better win.  
  
  Q. Who do you think your biggest competition is?  
 SHANNON BROWN: Everybody. I'm anxious to see what they have in store, and that will really determine which dunks I pull out.  
  
  Q. Who would be the best cowboy?   
 SHANNON BROWN: Out of the All-Star players? I don't know, that's a tough question. You're talking about football Cowboy or cowboy-cowboy? I don't know, man, that's a tough question. That's a tough one.
