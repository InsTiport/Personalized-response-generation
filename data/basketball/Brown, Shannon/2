<p>	Q.  Shannon, did you talk to Dee yesterday before or after the game, did you think you would see a game that topped his?</p>
<p>	Q.  What is going through your head in the huddle when they are waiting to decide if it is a two point shot?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about what this means to the team, to the seniors, to be in a Final Four?  This team has gone through a lot of people saying what they don't do now you have done something very few times?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could any of you guys, especially Shannon, describe the sequence for the three when you were down by four in the first overtime?</p>
<p>	Q.  You missed free throws against Iowa in the Big-10 tournament?</p>
<p>	Q.  Mo, did you feel like today you were playing a road game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously you're focused on winning the game and the result.  At any point in this game, were you guys able to realize what a great game it was?  Were you able to enjoy the fact that it was one of the greatest games that maybe you ever played in?</p>
<p>	Q.  You got a lot of attention for you dunks. </p>
<p>	Q.  You have been talking all tournament about making memories.  What kind of memory is this game going to be?</p>
<p>	Q.  Duke, Kentucky, Carolina, probably the three premiere names in college basketball --</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the defense that you all played.  They didn't score a point until the 1:52 mark of the second overtime.  Alan, can you talk about the free throws that you made from the second overtime?</p>

<p>	Q.  Can you talk about how the team rebounded emotionally from all that waiting around?  You hung in there and persevered?</p>
<p>	Q.  Paul, could you talk about the dunk in the second overtime.  And also how gratifying it is to play good basketball?</p>

<p>	Q.  What do you do in that six or seven minutes where all officials were looking at the clock.  Do you just coach them like it was going to overtime?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you recall or compare the feeling of getting to this Final Four with the one in '99 and also just in general your range of emotions today?</p>
<p>	Q.  Two things, what did you do different on Sparks in the second half and also what did you say to Chuck Hayes as you were leaving the court?</p>
<p>	Q.  You alluded to the slow start you had at the start of the first overtime and your first basket came late.  Can you talk about that stretch?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about your defense at the end of the first overtime and the first two possessions?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, after seeing those two games yesterday what you went through, is there anything left for the Final Four?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you go back two weeks when you are coming out of a Big-10 tournament.  I am sure there was a moment when you said we can go one or two ways here.  We can back out in the first round or maybe there is something more here.  Did you feel like that?  When along the timeline did you start to sense it was going to happen?</p>
<p>	Q.  Tom, can you talk about the defense?  It seemed at the end of the first overtime that you couldn't get a shot with 25.5 seconds left.  And then the free throw shooting?</p>
<p>	Q.  Initial impressions of North Carolina?</p>
