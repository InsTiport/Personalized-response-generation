<p>	Q.  Mike, have you had discussions yet with the other BCS Commissioners about your new conference; and, are you confident that the new BIG EAST will stay part of the BCS?</p>
<p>	Q.  What was the consideration in remaining in Florida?  Was it the television market there?  What schools were you considering, and why did you choose South Florida?</p>
<p>	Q.  How will the new league be split up?  And not just for football and basketball, for the other sports?  And if there is divisions, how will you decide what goes where?</p>
<p>	Q.  When will you come to those decisions?</p>
<p>	Q.  You were fairly critical several months ago of the ACC for its expansion plans with Conference USA.  How is what you've done any different to Conference USA, different than the ACC's expansion?</p>

<p>	Q.  For Father, first, and then Mr.  Nordenberg, am I saying that correctly? </p>
<p>	Q.  This is sort of "back to the future" for the basketball schools.  This is what you guys began with, greatly enhanced.  I want you to talk about the strength from your side and, if you could, deal with a little bit of the weaknesses.  I know you guys are a fine basketball-playing school, but football was your bread and butter  - is your bread and butter  - and what this does for you. </p>

<p>	Q.  Mike, have you discussed with Boston College about staying on next year?  Are they part of the conference for '04, '05?  And what will the withdrawal fee be when they do leave?</p>
<p>	Q.  Regarding football, I was curious to know Notre Dame's role in this and whether or not you guys would make an effort on getting Notre Dame to be playing football in the BIG EAST Conference?</p>
<p>	Q.  In regards to the new members, will the BIG EAST help cover their financial obligations to Conference USA for leaving that conference?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about what you think this will do to football in terms of your television contract, and also your Bowl tie-ins, whether this has any effect on your Bowl tie-ins.</p>
<p>	Q.  In regards to the '05-'06 timetable, especially considering the dominos sort of falling into place with Conference USA, and some farther down the line, has there been anything that you heard from the new members about going in next year instead, just so they don't have to play more than a year and a half as lame ducks in Conference USA?</p>
<p>	Q.  You don't consider it closed, that timetable?</p>
<p>	Q.  Mike, sorry to put the cart before the horse, where do you guys stand in terms of keeping the eight teams or going to 10 or 12?  Has there been talk about how soon, or is there any sense of, "We won't do anything for X-number of years"?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked at the meeting about looking five years, ten years, fifteen years down the road.  Obviously, you can't look at a crystal ball and say what's going to happen.  What have you done as far as getting a commitment from these 16 schools that this is going to stay together for a while?</p>
<p>	Q.  Two-part question.  One is will you be keeping the title "BIG EAST"?  And, your partnerships in basketball with Madison square Garden and now with Hartford with the women's side, that will stay in place as well?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering what the entry fee for those universities would be, and what kind of penalties would they incur if one of them decided to leave?</p>
<p>	Q.  At least on the basketball side, you could have looked at other conferences, particularly the Atlantic 10.  How much of an effort was made to keep this to one conference?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know you said you haven't determined alignment or whatever, but administering a 16-team basketball conference in terms of scheduling and all that, how difficult is that going to be?  How do you overcome some of that?</p>

<p>	Q.  I just wanted to ask, as far as men's basketball goes, considering the NCAA tournament usually takes five or six teams from a conference, is there a concern some teams might be left out?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you expect to have to start lobbying your fellow BCS members to give you time right now, to not reassess your membership within this contract?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was there any thought at all of reconsidering Temple at least for football?</p>

<p>	Q.  Mike, as far as the BIG EAST Basketball Tournament, is there any talk about opening it up to more teams, adding another day to it?  Have you guys talked about how you're going to configure the BIG EAST Basketball Tournament?</p>
<p>	Q.  Has ESPN approached you yet about renegotiating a football contract?  And, if not, do you expect that they will?</p>
<p>	Q.  Operating under the assumption that your basketball contract will increase, will that make up for how the football decreases?</p>
