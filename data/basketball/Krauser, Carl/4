<p>	Q.  Julius said for a while now so long as the team is winning, his scoring is not an issue.  Are you concerned about his scoring? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned you thought your team played pretty well, still kind of a shocking defeat.  A championship was lost.  Will this have an impact going into the next tournament? </p>
<p>	Q.  Julius did such a great job on Gordon for so long.  Do you think he ran out of gas at the end? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jaron, how bad was your ankle?  How taped up was it?  How much did it affect you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did they turn up the defense on you guys in the last four or five minutes? </p>
<p>	Q.  Carl, what were you looking for in that last drive before the ball got kicked around? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you assess your team's NCAA readiness, does it affect it at all? </p>
<p>	Q.  Same thing for Jaron.  Is there any doubt in your mind you guys will bounce back from here? </p>
