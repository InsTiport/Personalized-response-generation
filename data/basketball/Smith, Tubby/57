<p>	Q.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing today?  I was just kind of curious if both coaches could reflect on bringing their first teams as a head coach to the Final Four.</p>


<p>	Q.  Mike, I'm curious about teams that lose their star players.  Both -- The situation are similar with Utah and Stanford a little bit with Kentucky, as well.  Why do you think teams that lose big players like Keith Van Horn or Brevin Knight can come  back and even go further the next year?</p>

<p>	Q.  Mike, I'm just wondering if you've talked to anybody in the coaching profession about how to handle the hype this week and, for Coach Smith, I wanted to know if your players are actually helping  you get through the hype of this week since they've been through it before?</p>




<p>	Q.   I have something for each of you.  Mike, you mentioned a minute ago about how you hoped to go and really relish and enjoy the situation and, in the past, you've made it sound like you don't have time to enjoy it.  Are you able to really absorb a little bit more of it now?  And for Tubby, can you talk about any pressure you may have felt to be able to do this as a first year coach because of the tradition at Kentucky.</p>


<p>	Q.  Tubby, Jeff Shepard coming off a red shirt season, he comes back to be your top scorer.  Can you talk just a little bit about his season in general and also whether you're kind of surprised at how much he's contributed to the team?</p>

<p>	Q.  Hi, Mike.  I was wondering if you could talk about how the players feel about this reputation as sort of the most physical and toughest team, maybe, that remains physically and, Tubby, if you could just talk about that match up, going against a team that does play so physical.</p>




<p>	Q.  I was wondering for both of you what you consider your ultimate dues-paying experience in your coaching career and what that experience was like.</p>




<p>	Q.  I was just wondering if both of you guys could comment on why you think that schools like Carolina and Kentucky seem to compete every year, if not in the Final Four, at least, to get to the Final Four?</p>
