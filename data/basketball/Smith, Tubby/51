<p>	Q.  How difficult was it for you guys when you had three starters in foul trouble in the first half but the bench came in and did a good job?</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys played thirteen guys and you have been doing it all season.  Talk about the effect that has on a team.  Did it grind Utah out a little bit?  Did you wear them out?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the three point play you had where you spun around Andrew Bogut and it put you up 11.  How satisfying is that?</p>

<p>	Q.  If you had to sum it up, what would you say that put you over the top tonight?</p>
