   VINCE CARTER: They're making plays on both ends. That's why we have to get back to our style. 

 Q. Do you believe the whole rebound 3-0? 
 VINCE CARTER: Damn right. You can't win a series unless you win the first game. You win one game. That's our goal, to win one game. 

 Q. Dwight came out after the game last night and said our hearts and our minds weren't in it. Where are you guys today? 
 VINCE CARTER: It's definitely in it. It's now or never. This is a very painful position to be in, being that this team is very capable. But somebody has to believe, and I'm not going to quit on this team. I don't expect anybody else in this organization or on this team who steps on the floor to do the same. 
 I expect us to go out there and fight. If not for anything, fight for what's on the front of your jersey as well as on the back. It's never about who you are as an individual; it's about who you are as a team. Each person has to commit once they step in between those lines tomorrow. It's about business, and nothing else matters.
