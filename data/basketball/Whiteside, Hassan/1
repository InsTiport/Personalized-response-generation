  No. 33 Selection, Sacramento Kings  
  
  Q. What are your thoughts?  
 HASSAN WHITESIDE: I would like to thank the Kings for drafting me, first off, and I plan on bringing to the game defense and offense and rebounding and just become a great player overall and make the team better.   
  
  Q. You're going to be playing behind Samuel Dalembert, very defensive presence in the middle, talk about what you're looking forward to learning from him. Second question is do you feel you should have waited another year, because you were projected to be a lottery pick; do you think you should have waited or did you make the right choice?   
 HASSAN WHITESIDE: I can't really tell the future, all the coaching staff at Marshall left, so it would have been different. My future at the Kings, I feel like it's a good organization that I always wanted to play for.  
  
  Q. You have six blocks a game; do you think with your defensive presence that can get you minutes instantly?  
 HASSAN WHITESIDE: Yes, sir. I plan on just coming in and playing hard and making the team better.
