<p>	Q.  Jason, did you feel like overall maybe the energy level was down, you got off on the wrong track from the start?</p>
<p>	Q.  Any idea why the energy thing after having almost a week off  --</p>
<p>	Q.  The second chance points were Colorado 18 to 6 and that's kind of an unusual number I think when you look at your two big guys.  Any comment on that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Thoughts on whether or not that Oklahoma State game got you into the tournament, if this one could have done any damage to the progress that you have shown?</p>
<p>	Q.  Brad, obviously you guys are going into some post-season tournament.  Do you think this kills any type of momentum?</p>
<p>	Q.  Daniel, did you feel like there was maybe a lack of mental preparation in taking Colorado seriously since they were 4 and 12 in the conference?</p>

<p>	Q.  Rick, comment about how Kenton Paulino's ankle looked?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was this game as disappointing as the Oklahoma State game was exhilarating --</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you talk to your club during the week or before the game or half-time talking about the NCAA in terms of motivation, that must be especially frustrating for you secondly, are you optimistic about your chances?</p>
<p>	Q.  Any relationship between playing so well at Oklahoma State and maybe having a letdown?</p>
