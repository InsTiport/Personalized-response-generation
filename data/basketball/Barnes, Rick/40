THE MODERATOR:   Coach Barnes, some opening comments? 
COACH BARNES:   I thought there were some much, much better things.   At least we competed.   Came out and I thought played with more passion.   Tried to execute better.   We had some opportunities.   I thought where we really could have gotten control of the game, we didn't finish it on the defensive end, and we gave up two, three, four offensive rebounds back‑to‑back.   Then we gave up.   We had two really defensive possessions where we really three.   One, we didn't do a very good job on a ball screen defense.   We didn't do a very good job showing.   Gave up a slip to the basket, and gave up dribble penetration once that turned into a three‑point play which was a big play in the game.

Q.   Coach O'Neill described the game as kind of a rock fight that was really kind of back and forth.   Both teams struggled to shoot the basketball in the second half.   Your impressions of those thoughts? 
COACH BARNES:   Well, we thought it would be a very physical game.   We felt that going in.   And again, that's where, again, they came up with some big offensive rebounds.   Again, both teams were trying to get there.   Really, as physical as it was, you look at there weren't a lot of fouls called there either way.   But we had a chance in regulation. 
We didn't do‑‑ we gave them obviously an easy basket, because we didn't get back one time, and you can't allow that to happen there.   But still, overall there were some things that we can build on.   We still haven't gotten into a rhythm where we need to be offensively.   I know we're a better shooting team than we've shot. 
But that will come if we continue to‑‑ today we found some guys that I thought competed, and that's what we've got to get.   We've got to get more of them, but we got a lot better than we did yesterday.
