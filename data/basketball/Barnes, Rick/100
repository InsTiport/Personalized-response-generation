<p>	Q.  TJ, how much zone has this team faced this year?  How tough do you think it is driving or passing to get inside Syracuse's zone because of their wingspan? </p>
<p>	Q.  Royal, are you expecting to be matched up with Carmelo?  What is your opinion of him?  Are you going to be on him in the beginning, do you think? </p>
<p>	Q.  TJ, you're the shortest first team All-American in 32 years.  I'm wondering if that's something you've had to deal with something your whole career, being the short guy who had to prove himself? </p>
<p>	Q.  TJ, when players and coaches talk about attacking a zone, what exactly does that mean? </p>
<p>	Q.  Have you been able to think at all about what your presence has meant to Texas basketball? </p>
<p>	Q.  TJ, you guys love to push the ball up and down the floor.  This Syracuse team has been beaten that way in the past.  Is that the key to your game and the key to beating them? </p>
<p>	Q.  Rick Barnes coached at Clemson before he came.  Can you explain what it is about him and his personality that makes him so successful? </p>
<p>	Q.  As far as his personality that's different?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you often guarded a player who was that much taller than you, like Carmelo?  What do you do when you're confronted with a player like that? </p>
<p>	Q.  How do you make up for the height difference? </p>
<p>	Q.  Brandon, can you talk about being the only native of Louisiana coming back here to play in the Final Four?  How many friends and family do you expect tomorrow? </p>
<p>	Q.  Some of the Syracuse players were talking about when their zone defense is effective.  They can see the point guards maybe getting a so-called bug-eyed look, they kind of feed off that.  Have you watched film or seen any defense do that to you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Yes, TJ. </p>
<p>	Q.  Brandon, with the history of football at Texas, what would it mean to have a national championship? </p>
<p>	Q.  The last couple games you played, a lot of foul trouble.  How do you think foul trouble will come into this game?  Do you think it will be physical?  Do you think they'll let some stuff go? </p>
<p>	Q.  TJ, you said height, you've always been what you are so you play to your strengths.  Was there a point when you realized that you were really quick? </p>
<p>	Q.  Throughout your basketball career, do you ever get the feeling that you're a natural winner? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there an NBA point guard that you try to model yourself after, someone who makes up for lack of size with quickness?</p>
<p>	Q.  Brandon, when people talk about being aggressive against the zone, you hear people talking about penetrating, then opposite of that, shooting 3-point shots.  Can you talk about the importance of the midrange game against a zone defense? </p>
<p>	Q.  One of the guys in the locker room was saying for a practical joke you borrowed Coach's car. </p>
<p>	Q.  I wondered how he got you back. </p>
<p>	Q.  Where did you put it? </p>
<p>	Q.  How did he get you back? </p>
<p>	Q.  Royal, was there any player that you've gone up against in college or back in New York on the school yards who is as quick as TJ? </p>
<p>	Q.  Brandon, how much does this remind you of two years ago, guys were here playing against Temple, against a 2-3 zone?  What can you take from that game into this game? </p>
<p>	Q.  TJ, when Royal gets his defensive assignment, do you automatically assume he's going to lock his guy down? </p>
<p>	Q.  Back in December you took a visit to the White House, visited with the President.  The First Lady is a Texas Longhorn.  Did that visit mean anything to you? </p>



<p>	Q.  The Big-12 getting two teams in the Final Four this year, same as last year, how much does that really say about the strength of a conference?  Do you think the Big-12 needs to win a national championship to really place itself up at the top? </p>

<p>	Q.  Any secrets that you learned at Providence about attacking a 2-3 zone that hold up 10 years later?  Is that zone just naturally more effective when he's got guys with the wingspans that this team has?</p>
<p>	Q.  With that said, how does your defense match up against Syracuse's offense in general, also in particular with Carmelo Anthony?</p>
<p>	Q.  You have the reputation as such an intense coach, yet you also have the reputation as a very loose guy who doesn't take himself very seriously.  Is that something you have developed through your career or is it just a natural way for you to be?  Did you learn to be more loose along the way? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the beneficial edge that you have had at the free-throw line in the tournament so far, how that has come about. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the confidence you're seeing in Brandon Mouton? </p>
<p>	Q.  The NCAA is talking about incentivizing athlete's academic progress, penalizing teams, if not enough of their players are making progress toward a degree, keeping them out of the tournament, taking away scholarships.  Do you think that's fair?  Do you think it's fair to put the onus on a coach and team to make sure players are doing what it takes in the classroom?</p>
<p>	Q.  In your career, is there anybody that Anthony reminds you of?</p>
<p>	Q.  Brandon Mouton, being in his backyard, the pinnacle of college basketball, I'm sure he'll be excited.  Are you worried about him being maybe too excited, trying to do too much?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there a better style of player than TJ to counteract the kind of zone you're going to see? </p>
<p>	Q.  In preparing for the zone, do you have to be careful not to build it up too much and turn it into some kind of a mythological monster for your players? </p>
<p>	Q.  With the war going on at the same time as all this, is there anything you notice in perspective or attitude or routine that's different? </p>
<p>	Q.  In regards to TJ Ford, he's an obvious floor leader on the court.  What role does he play off the court?  Is he as much a vocal leader as he is a floor leader?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is the time of year where a lot of coaches  -- there's a lot of transition in coaching.  I want to get your impression, how do you feel about the relative freedom that coaches have to sort of move about, and players really don't have that same sort of freedom to move?  Do you think that's the way the system should be, that players are frozen, their coaches can move sort of freely? </p>
