<p>	Q.  Coach, I imagine when you first got there, people thought you would be kind of crazy for going to a school that's so football crazy.  Can you just talk about maybe what convinced you that you could get it done there, that you could really make basketball a viable product?</p>
<p>	Q.  Also, can you talk about what the mood around campus has been like because you have both women's and men's teams in the Final Four.  What kind of electricity is buzzing through there?</p>
<p>	Q.  I've got two questions for you real quick.  Is there any added pressure being the only No. 1 seed to actually make it to the Final Four, or do you pretty much feel like everybody else right now? </p>
<p>	Q.  One of the things I've noticed about this team is it seems like every player on your starting line-up has one basic skill that they always sell:  You've got James Thomas, who's excellent at rebounding; Brad Buckman, same thing; T.J. Ford, passing skills.  It seems in this day and age a lot of what we call basic skills gets lost in college basketball, because we're looking for that one flashy player.  Talk about your philosophy of coaching and how it's worked for you and the players.</p>
<p>	Q.  Everyone I talked to says that you're the same guy now that you were, you know, at every stop along the way.  Can you talk about how you've managed to maintain your personality throughout all the different stops.</p>
<p>	Q.  Are you a better coach or different coach now that you made it to the Final Four than you were, say, a week ago when you had never been to the Elite 8?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know that it's hard to have missed the speculation about Roy Williams and the North Carolina job.  As someone who's been in the ACC, someone who's changed jobs a couple times, can you understand or appreciate what he may be going through right now in trying to get his team ready for the Final Four?</p>
<p>	Q.  There are so many great individual players in the Final Four this year, kind of an unusually high number.  There may be as many as four First-Team All-Americans.  Do you think that adds anything to the special way that the Final Four is, does it add to the luster of the tournament? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the specific problems that Anthony presents. </p>
<p>	Q.  You were just talking about "special players," and it's "a tournament for players."  Can a team get to the Final Four without that "special" kind of player?  All four of these teams have a special guy who can take over a game.</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you anticipate a really fast-paced game?  Do you think it's going to be an entertaining, up and down, 94-foot game?  Obviously, you guys would probably prefer it to be that way. </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you have a chance to see any of the women's game at all last night, or were you too tied up?</p>
<p>	Q.  How extraordinary is it for a place like Texas to have both teams in the Final Four? </p>
