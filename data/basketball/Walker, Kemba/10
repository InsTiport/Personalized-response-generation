Q. If you could please make a brief comment about this honor you received tonight.
KEMBA WALKER: Oh, yeah, it's a special honor.  I really appreciate it.  I definitely want to thank the whole Charlotte Hornets organization for allowing me to be myself, my teammates, as well, and the coaching staff, as well.  Yeah, I really appreciate this honor.  I know it's not the biggest award, like the Player of the Year or Sixth Man, but I really take great pride and try to be a better person each and every day, so I'm proud to be recognized for this.
Q. You mentioned in your speech, your family, how you think their influence led to how you act on the court and how you actually got this award.
KEMBA WALKER: Yeah, for sure.  My parents, they raised me to be a certain way.  So that's why I am the person I am today because of my parents.  Yeah, my mom is really outgoing.  My dad, he's more on the calm side.  I think I'm kind of more like my dad, but yeah, they shaped me into the man I am today, so I have to give them some recognition.
Q. What does this award mean for you, knowing that you have the respect of your teammates?
KEMBA WALKER: It means a lot.  It means a lot.  Not only my teammates but my peers.  I'm glad that these guys recognize my sportsmanship and know how good of a person I am.  That means a lot.  Especially like I said, in front of these guys, they are the ones who voted.
Q. What does an award like this mean, given where you're from and the kids that watch you play every day?
KEMBA WALKER: Yeah, it kind of just shows the kids that anything's possible.  You know, I'm from a pretty rough neighborhood, so I mean, if I can do it, anybody can.  That's how I feel.  I'm living proof.
