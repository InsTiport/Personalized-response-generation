Q.   We're trying to find out which team knows their coach better.   I have three questions for you about Shaq.   How many teams did Shaq play for?
KEMBA WALKER:   I'd say four.

Q.   Six.   Cleveland at the end, Boston at the end.   Yeah.   What is Shaq's best movie?
KEMBA WALKER:   I don't know. 

Q.   What is Shaq's shoe size?
KEMBA WALKER:   22.

Q.   23.   One inch off.   What do you think of Chandler Parsons?
KEMBA WALKER:   He's a great guy.   Off the court.   He's the guy that everybody loves to be around.   On the court he plays hard, a high basketball IQ.   He has a great overall game. 

Q.   What did people say to do in Houston?
KEMBA WALKER:   There's so much to do this entire weekend.   I'm looking forward to enjoying myself. 

Q.   Can you talk about what it means to young players to aspire for a weekend of this kind. 
KEMBA WALKER:   It takes a lot of hard work to get to this point, a lot of struggles, a lot of ups and downs.   But at the same time just enjoy it, make sure you work hard.
