 Q.   How much relief was it last week to actually get that win and break the streak?  
KEMBA WALKER:   It was definitely a relief.   It was a huge win for us.   We were excited.   
   
 Q.   Coach Fratello and the bunch over there are playing some hardâ€‘core defense.   Are you guys ready to play some defense, or is it all about offense?  
KEMBA WALKER:   We're ready to play some defense.   We're going to go out there and play a complete game.
