 Q.  You've got a guy like you, LeBron, Kevin Durant, Westbrook, I'll take that team any day.  
KEMBA WALKER: Oh, no question.  I mean, both teams are crazy, especially with the mixture.  But, yeah, of course I feel like we're going to win.  We're going to go out there and compete as hard as we can.   
 Q.  What does it mean when a guy like LeBron chooses you?  
KEMBA WALKER: He didn't choose me.  I'm sorry.  I'm just a replacement for [Kristaps] Porzingis.  I didn't get chosen.   
 Q.  Does it change the atmosphere?  
KEMBA WALKER: What's that?   
 Q.  Did it change the atmosphere and the camaraderie level?  
KEMBA WALKER: I don't think so.  I don't think so.  I think last year it was pretty similar.  But like I said, to get a chance to be around these guys and know some of the Western Conference guys, it's pretty cool.   
 Q.  What is the conversation for the week from the team captain?  What's your response to that?  Is this a platform to discuss race relations?  
KEMBA WALKER: I think so.  I think people should have the chance to say whatever they want, especially a guy like LeBron who's a huge icon.  It's bigger than basketball with LeBron.   
Everyone knows who LeBron James is, but I think he definitely should have an opinion if he wants to.  Everybody is entitled to their own opinion.   
 Q.  What if somebody told you to shut up in general?  
KEMBA WALKER: Oh, man, I don't know.  I don't know what I would say.  It was pretty disrespectful.  But, you know.  LeBron is a pro.  He's a professional.  He's going to handle everything well.   
 Q.  Kemba, you're known for your killer crossovers.  Who has the best dunk right now in the NBA?  
KEMBA WALKER: The best dunks?  Oh, man.  There's so many guys.  You've got Aaron Gordon, Zach LaVine, you've the two young boys, Dennis Smith and Donovan Mitchell, Victor [Oladipo].  I mean, there's just too many.   
 Q.  Craziest dunk that you've ever seen, how did it go down?  
KEMBA WALKER: Probably Vince Carter's dunk contest.  All his dunks were spectacular.  Those are my favorites.   
 Q.  Tell me about a wild bet on or off the court?  
KEMBA WALKER: A wild bet?   
 Q.  That had to do with basketball.  
KEMBA WALKER: I don't know.  The last bet I made was when UConn played Kentucky in the championship game, and my teammate, MKG [Michael Kidd-Gilchrist], he had to wear a UConn shirt for the whole day.  So that was really it.   
 Q.  Would you change anything about the NBA right now?  
KEMBA WALKER: I wouldn't change anything.
