 Q.   Does that mean we might be seeing you in the slam dunk contest?  
DION WAITERS:   No, I don't got a lot of tricks.   I got two dunks:   between my legs and the cock back.  
   
 Q.   Who are you rooting for for All‑Star Saturday?  
DION WAITERS:   I would like to see Damian.   See what he got.   John Wall.   
I'm going with the East, man.   I got to represent for the East.   
   
 Q.   Do you play NBA 2014?  
DION WAITERS:   Yeah, I play it.   I like Madden better, though.  
   
 Q.   Do you play with any other team besides yours?  
DION WAITERS:   Oh, yeah, I don't never play with people like that.   No, we randomly pick.   I played with them before, but it's still feels surreal.   Like you're out there playing with yourself and you're in the game and things like that, it don't feel‑‑ it feels weird.   
   
 Q.   So you're cheering for the East?  
DION WAITERS:   Yeah, I got to.   
   
 Q.   How does it feel to be playing here?  
DION WAITERS:   It's a blessing.   A lot of people don't get an opportunity to come to things like this.   And I'm just blessed to be here.   
   
 Q.   What are you trying to show?  
DION WAITERS:   My passion.   I'm going to try to go out there and get everybody involved.   And just have fun.   Just enjoy it.   Enjoy the moment.   And most importantly, get the win.
