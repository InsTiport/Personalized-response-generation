<p>	Q.  How different will this team look?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about taking on that role now and with so many freshmen on this team, what responsibility do you feel like you need to take on with this team? </p>
<p>	Q.  The Big 12, you can tell them I guess about what to expect, but if you think back at your first Big 12 game, what do you remember from that and how can you prepare them for the rigors of this conference?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about Nina being overlooked.  Do you think last year when she was hurt, her absence was pretty glaring that maybe that was something that showed everybody, even her teammates, how valuable she was?</p>
<p>	Q.  Second question, managing depth, the amount of depth and talents you have if you can -- you have done that before, talk about both those things. </p>
<p>	Q.  How different is it going to be for you there, that leadership role on the court, without having Jamie over there because seems like you kind of, I don't know, rely on her in a lot of ways over the last three years?</p>
<p>	Q.  With Tiffany, so talented coming in as a freshman.  Between sophomore and junior year there's still that step up.  Do you see that from her?  I guess, in general, what do you see from her this season?</p>

<p>	Q.  How do you -- when you have freshmen that have so much expectations before they have even played a game, how do you keep them from expecting too much of themselves and getting too out of control or how do you handle that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you discuss what Todd Wright's influence has meant?  I know it hasn't been long but has he made a big impact already?</p>
