<p>	Q.  Tiffany, were you surprised by Brie Madden's being so aggressive on the offensive end? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jamie, what was going through your head at the last second?  You're trying to shoot that basket.  What was going on? </p>
<p>	Q.  Was there a point when you shot it you thought it was good?  Did you know when you shot it it wasn't going in? </p>
<p>	Q.  A loss in this manner, do you think it will have any effect on the way y'all -- your mentality going into the tournament? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jamie? </p>

<p>	Q.  When y'all had the similar losses early, there were questions of mental toughness.  Is that still a question? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you wonder if this might affect your NCAA preparation and seeding and do you even care about the seeding? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've been talking a lot about missing layups.  What about defensively?  Especially in the second half, there were a lot of times that K State had an open basket.  What happened? </p>
<p>	Q.  It was a real partisan crowd.  When they sank a three, the place went crazy. </p>
<p>	Q.  Was it a case where you guys concentrated so much on Wecker and Koehn that you left Brie Madden open, or was Brie just one of those nights where everything she put up went in?</p>
