<p>	Q.  Tiffany, had you a big game offensively.  It seemed like maybe the key in the game was your defense on Leah Rush late in the second half.  She was having her way inside.  You got onto her, pretty much shut down. </p>
<p>	Q.  Tiffany, you seemed real emotional there, especially in the second half.  Was there a sense of urgency about this game?  Can you talk about taking over the game offensively? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jamie, can you tell us what the strategy changes were that you talked about at halftime, and why y'all did such a better job defensively in the second half? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jamie, talk about your job defensively on Erin Higgins.  Didn't give her a lot of room to shoot. </p>
<p>	Q.  Jamie, how did that game feel to you offensively in terms of flow? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jamie, could you talk about Tiffany's progression in her first two years at Texas, especially offensively? </p>
<p>	Q.  Tiffany, can you talk about how things are different offensively without Nina?  You guys have kind of changed the offense a little bit mid-season to allow Nina to do some things.  How different is it without her? </p>
<p>	Q.  Tiffany, if you would have wanted to come out of the game, would Coach Conradt have let you or not?  Did you have a contract or what? </p>

<p>	Q.  I wonder if it was a surprise to see Oklahoma play zone as they did tonight. </p>
<p>	Q.  Oklahoma shot so well in the first half.  In the second half they went seven and a half minutes without a field goal when you took over the game.  What happened during that seven and a half minutes to create such pressure on them? </p>
<p>	Q.  Would you talk about the switch, put Jackson on Rush there, the second half. </p>
<p>	Q.  Was Tiffany kind of your designated hitter on defense?  You had her out guarding Dionnah for a while. </p>
<p>	Q.  Given what you were talking about about picking it up on defense, the fact that they went the seven minutes plus without scoring, do you think you wore them down also? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is Nina available in a crisis situation?  Is she available for the next game?  Where is she, how is very affecting your offense? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is it hard not to take Tiffany for granted?  Do you kind of assess her progression over two years? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you like seeing Tiffany take those shots today from about the free-throw line, those little jumpers, not try to go in and create something like she normally would? </p>
