Q. Tyler, can you just take us through that final play?
TYLER SCAIFE: I wanted the ball in my hands, so I went and got it, and KK set a screen.
Q. What does that say about your leadership skills and being willing to take that last shot?
TYLER SCAIFE: That I'm not afraid of the moment.  My teammates believe in me, and so does the coaching staff.
Q. How good does this win feel today?
TYLER SCAIFE: It feels good, but we've still got a long way to go.
Q. I believe it was in the third quarter when you hit back-to-back threes.  How important was it getting momentum for your team?
TYLER SCAIFE: It's very important.  We needed that to win the game.
Q. Tell us a little bit, it seemed like you had a little bit of a shoe issue out there.
TYLER SCAIFE: Yeah, my shoe flipped off.
Q. Is it true that somebody had to run back to the hotel to get you new shoes?
TYLER SCAIFE: Uh-huh.  Somebody had to go get my other shoe.
Q. How good does it feel to get that tournament win and kind of get a little bit of confidence in you?
TYLER SCAIFE: It feels good.  I think the team needed this win so we can get back on the win streak.
Q. I'm not sure if you're aware, with your scoring performance today --
TYLER SCAIFE: No, I don't want to talk about that.
Q. You did move past Kathy.  How does it feel?
TYLER SCAIFE: It's cool.
Q. Do you have loftier goals than that?
TYLER SCAIFE: Yeah, Big Ten Championship.
