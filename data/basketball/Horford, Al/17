  Q. What are you looking for in the second half of the year?   
 AL HORFORD: I think for us to really try to take it a game at a time.   
 It is so important for us to keep winning and keep playing the right way, to put ourselves in a good position ready to play, I think that's the biggest key.  
  
  Q. Wednesday night you guys showed real poise down the stretch.   
 AL HORFORD: It really meant a lot for us to really be able to stick together and go to a place like Detroit and get a win. I think it showed a lot of character for our team.  
  
  Q. Especially with the win in Detroit, you get a home court advantage.   
 AL HORFORD: Yeah, it is still really early, but we had to take care of our business and really make sure we try to get on the right track.
