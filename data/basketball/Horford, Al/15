  STEVE SMITH: First of all, it was good, get a chance to come out. Give a lot of credit to Al. Al hit a lot of halfcourt shots and Coco knocked them down and it was fun to beat Kenny Smith, so we don't have to hear his mouth. A great win for Team Atlanta.  
 COCO MILLER: It was fun for me to be a part of this with Al and Steve, two great players, two great players I really admire, and just this whole weekend has been a lot of fun so it was great.   
 AL HORFORD: Same thing, it great to be able to work with Steve and Coco and just happy with to beat Kenny, because he was doing a lot of talk in the locker room for and questioning if I should be in this shooting contest or not. There you go, Kenny.
