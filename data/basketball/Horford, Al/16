  Q. Today the Olympics are starting in Vancouver, so if you had to partake in a winter Olympic event, what would it be and why?  
 AL HORFORD: Snowboarding. I just think it's so cool.   
  
  Q. If you had to pay to watch someone play, who would it be?  
 AL HORFORD: I'd pay to see LeBron James. I definitely would. He really puts on a show for people, and he's who people pay to go see, so I would go see him.  
  
  Q. In your young career, funniest guy you've played with?   
 AL HORFORD: Rasheed Wallace. He's funny, man. He doesn't shut up, and he's just a funny dude. He's always talking and saying different things and making fun of people. He's a funny guy.  
  
  Q. I think the casual basketball player would probably say you're a little bit ahead of schedule being here. The knowledgeable fan would probably say he's on a team with a lot of good players, and his production is really impressive. Do you feel like you're ahead of schedule being here?  
 AL HORFORD: Yeah, you could say that. That's fair to say. But I really feel that with the success that our team has had, I knew that I was going to have a chance to be here. So it really doesn't surprise me. I knew that our team could have had two guys, possibly maybe three here. I'm honored to be here, and it just shows that the coaches appreciate what I do. I know I'm going to keep getting better.
