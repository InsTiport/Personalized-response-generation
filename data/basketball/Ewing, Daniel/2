<p>	Q.  How do you guys feel about all the talk about you not being so deep off the bench and how that will effect you guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you remember about the first time you played against Michigan State, particular towards the end of the game I think you were able to hold them off?</p>
<p>	Q.  Daniel, Can you talk about your transition to the point?  Just how difficult it has been or how easy it's been?  Can you talk about Daniel has been able to do this season?</p>
<p>	Q.  Any memories you have of the Erwin Center when you were at Willowridge?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is your fourth year being in the NCAA tournament.  At this time of year, does Coach turn up the intensity a little bit?  Is there something special that takes over Duke at this time of year?</p>
<p>	Q.  J.J, can you talk about Daniel's play at the point and any situations that stand out in your mind where he has come through?</p>
<p>	Q.  Daniel, dating back to high school, you've never really been the focal point in terms of the teams you've played on, playing with TJ, and now playing here at Duke.  How hard of an adjustment has it been not being that focal point?</p>
<p>	Q.  Relate your best Mike Krzyzewski story of dealing with him, something specific that you will always remember in practice or off the court?</p>
<p>	Q.  Something that you will always remember. </p>
<p>	Q.  Guys, when you were three and four, what turned it around to finish nine and one in the current stretch?  What turned your season after that pick-up part of year?</p>
<p>	Q.  You know, so much is said about teams measuring themselves against the Duke program.  The respect that you have for Michigan State and Coach Izzo, can you touch on that a little bit?</p>
<p>	Q.  J.J, you seem to you talk about their whole mindset on the road and on the league.</p>
<p>	Q.  J.J, when you look at all the attributes on your team that, the talent of the players and their skills, could you talk a bit about the group's mental toughness and where they rank in terms of what makes you a good team and where that came from?  Did you start with it or did it evolve?</p>
<p>	Q.  J.J, do you feel like you are in a slump when you have games like the last two?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is for J.J, did you watch any games other than your own last week?  If so, did you count the number of times that American Express commercial with Coach K ran?</p>
<p>	Q.  J.J, what are your plans for next season?  Are you back at Duke or moving on?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you hear teams say they have got to get physical with you guys, what do you think about that?</p>

<p>	Q.  Mike, from where you sit, is this team getting here a remarkable achievement, maybe an unforeseen achievement that it is being portrayed as?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, one of the big challenges that is Coach Izzo has had is trying to manage the expectations he created.  Can you recall when expectations first spiked for you at Duke and how you have dealt with that over the years?</p>
<p>	Q.  I don't know if you can comment specifically on Andrew Bogut, but can you talk a little bit about what the accomplished international players do better than maybe the American college kids do?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, Coach Izzo talked about your program being a measuring stick and how he holds you in high esteem.  Can you talk about your thoughts on the way he runs his program?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about how much Sheldon has improved?  Where do you think you would be without that improvement?</p>
<p>	Q.  How difficult do you see this regional from a coaching standpoint just having the quality of coaches here?</p>
<p>	Q.  A lot has been made of your team's depth.  How many guys on your team are you comfortable with playing a lot minutes in this point of the season? </p>
<p>	Q.  I Wanted to ask you about Daniel and the changing role that he has had in his career.  Also in that same vein, he has never been the focus.  At Duke he has not been the focus.  How does he handle that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk a little bit about having Duke, Carolina, and NC State all in the Sweet 16.  And when you were in Durham, if you got a feel for the excitement and atmosphere?</p>
<p>	Q.  You spoke of the difficulty of the region.  I was wondering, nine Sweet 16s in a row for you.  I think Carolina had a streak of 13 in a row at one point.  How difficult is it now to get a team to this level, to the regional with the rise in the mid majors and the way college basketball has become more competitive?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you beat Michigan State if offensively they play the same way they did the first two games?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you mention that had you're good friends with Coach Izzo.  Could you elaborate on that how often do you talk?  How aware have you been that he molded his program after yours?</p>
