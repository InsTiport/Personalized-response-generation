<p>	Q.  Chelsea, can you talk about the way you guys didn't seem to play quite as tight?  Were you loser, more relaxed? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kiera, I wouldn't -- it's not a slump.  You wouldn't call what you're going through a slump, would you?  Did you feel more comfortable out there tonight shooting the ball?  What was it like being back here, too? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kiera, what does it feel like to win a game?  I guess you haven't won a game in Kansas City, the team hasn't, since 2000. </p>
<p>	Q.  Chelsea, when Kiera has been in a slump or whatever she wants to call it, how important is it for other players to step up and take some of that offensive pressure off of her? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kiera, this is your second year at Nebraska.  She's starting now.  Coach Yori, how has she impacted you from the standpoint of her game and from the team? </p>

<p>	Q.  Specifically how did you play Oklahoma State different defensively than last time? </p>
<p>	Q.  With Chelsea playing so well tonight, that bodes well going into Kansas State tomorrow, having more power inside for you. </p>
<p>	Q.  (No microphone.) </p>
<p>	Q.  What did you talk to your players about leading into this tournament after a disappointing finish to the regular season? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talk about how difficult it is to make a dent in this conference.  Obviously Oklahoma State has had a very hard time.  Can you empathize with Julie? </p>
<p>	Q.  (No microphone.) </p>
