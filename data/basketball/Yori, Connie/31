<p>	Q.  Coach, this is about Kendra Wecker.  A little bit about her this game, her record-breaking number. </p>
<p>	Q.  Big-12 all-time leading scorer now.  Just how do you cover her or try to cover her? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jina, can you talk about your post-season hopes and what y'all are thinking? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jina, can you address your team's offensive struggles tonight.  Was there a source of it?  What was the problem with the offense tonight, in your estimation? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jina, does a game like this make you want to get back on the court even more? </p>

<p>	Q.  Would you address the post-season as well. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Patterson said that you guys probably maximized all that you could out of your team, your talent this year.  Is there more to it than that or did you really kind of run out of steam or peak too early a few games ago? </p>
<p>	Q.  What do you say to them at halftime?  Obviously the effort is there, but they're not making any shots.  What can you say to them at that point? </p>
<p>	Q.  Saying you guys maybe maxed out, your opponents are trying to figure out how to play you, what convinces you you can make a deep run, considering the way it's gone? </p>
