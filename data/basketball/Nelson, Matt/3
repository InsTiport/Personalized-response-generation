<p>	Q.  Matt Nelson in particular, you were missing a lot of the kind of shots you normally hit early in a game.  Was there anything about what was going on and the way they were defending you or was it just an off day?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is for both of you.  Are you guys, do you find this just to be an incredibly more bitter-than-anything moment or can you look back on your careers and feel happy about about what you've been through, just so much adversity and so many things that go against you guys?  I'm wondering what's your feeling?</p>

<p>	Q.  Either one of the players, just was there a time when you felt like, okay, this game is turning our way and we can take them, and if so, at what point did that feeling kind of fade away?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned the hump.  Just for either of you, what do you think it is about the second half this year that just seems like especially in the conference games you couldn't quite come out and maybe finish it or complete the victory if you had the lead?</p>

<p>	Q.  Dale, 79 points and 51 rebounds in three games against you guys by Andrew.  You have the best center in the league besides him, you have the biggest team in the league besides them.  What does that say about just how good this guy is?</p>
<p>	Q.  Offensively were you happy with the shots they were presented or did you think the guys were being a little bit hasty?  Obviously that was your take on execution, and were things going in the right direction?</p>
<p>	Q.  You can kind of see the defense adjustments that Utah made at halftime.  What adjustments did you make?</p>
<p>	Q.  Dale, this is the I think eighth game against a conference opponent this year that you guys have had a lead at halftime and not been able to finish the deal.  Is there any one thing you can put your finger on that's made that happen on a consistent basis or not?</p>
<p>	Q.  With Nelson gone, with your three seniors gone, and again, you're returning some people.  As you start to look ahead to next year, what do you feel you can maybe take out of this season?  What do you change headed into next year?  Have you started to think ahead toward that yet?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you derive -- do you feel any significant advantage of this game being played in Denver?</p>
<p>	Q.  With the adversity, the injuries and players leaving, was there ever a game until the very end here that you felt like this was the team and this is what Colorado State basketball was supposed to be at all this season?</p>
