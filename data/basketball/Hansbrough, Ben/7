West Virginia  Â– 53
  Notre Dame - 51

 THE MODERATOR: Notre Dame is here. Luke Harangody, Ben Hansbrough, Tory Jackson, Coach Mike Brey. 
 COACH MIKE BREY: Proud of our group. Boy, we made a run at it. And to have a shot, it was kind of a weird game. We were in a hole. But to dig out and have a look, it was pretty good. We had the tempo we wanted. We did a better job on Butler. And that was a combination really when we got Ty Nash on him, that at least gave us a chance to have a chance to win the game. 
 They're really good. Very difficult to defend, and physical and take away space in the half court with their length. 
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Tory, do you wonder what's it going to take for you to hit a game-winning shot? 
 TORY JACKSON: Just keep watching Michael Jordan clips, I guess. It just happens, you know. Things happen. I thought it was a good shot when I let it go. But you live and learn. One thing we're not going to do is dwell on it. We just had a heck of a run. We have to make another one coming up. 

 Q. Tory, it looked like your defender backed up. Were you going to the hole and he backed off? 
 TORY JACKSON: Yeah. When he dropped off, that's what made me want to take that shot. It was a wide open shot. Just didn't go down. 

 Q. Ben, you've been kind of struggling with your shot recently. Is that the game you've been looking for? 
 BEN HANSBROUGH: I've just been -- feel like I need to let the game come to me. I'm not going to try to force anything. Especially with the flow we've been playing at. Just got done with a six-game winning streak. Try not to worry about individually. We've been getting those W's. So I haven't even thought about it, honestly.

 Q. Ben, Tory, what do you make of this run you guys had here? It started beforehand, but what did this do for you guys? What did you take out of it going to the next one? 
 BEN HANSBROUGH: West Virginia is the sixth ranked team in the country. They're a very good team. I think that just goes to show we can play and we can beat anybody in the country. We want to take that momentum into the NCAA Tournament. I mean, we lost to the sixth ranked team in the country by two points and had a shot to win it. It just shows how far this team has come. 
 You look at us at the very beginning of the year and you look at us now we just got done with a six-game winning streak, and people didn't include us in the picture and we got tough. We showed we can play and beat anybody in the country now. 

 Q. Coach, second night in a row, tough, close game. I think you used your last time-out with more than a minute to go. Talk about that and that last play with Tory tonight. 
 COACH MIKE BREY: Well, I think we needed our time-outs to set our defense and get our legs under us. One thing I don't do with this team is overcoach them because we have a high basketball IQ. And, you know, we kind of flow and make reads. I think the worst thing would be, even if you had a time-out, was to let all that length get organized. When they get organized and they would have got organized, it may have been tougher. The karma around this guy during this run has been so good, when he took it, I said we're going to live and die with it. 

 Q. Coach, middle of the first half their 1-3-1 extends pretty much farther with that length than other defenses the you'll face. Why was it they were able to defend the wings and corners as well? 
 COACH MIKE BREY: Well, it was a little different. I thought they would play more of that instead of just let us burn clock versus man. They've watched us do that. And it is something in their arsenal to kind of make us try and play a little faster. I don't know if we played faster, but our rhythm was a little different than playing against man-to-man and burning against man. And it took us a while to kind of get into a rhythm. 
 Now, we missed some great looks that we usually make that I think would have helped confidence-wise. We had some great looks there. Carleton (Scott) and Abro (Abromaitis) against that. But it was a different rhythm. We talked about that today in the shoot-around to be ready for heavy doses of that. 
 THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? 
 COACH MIKE BREY: Thanks. 
 THE MODERATOR: Notre Dame, thank you.
