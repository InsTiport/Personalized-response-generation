  JaVALE McGEE: It's going to be exciting this year.   
  
  Q. How do you get back --  
 JaVALE McGEE: Just creativity. I'm glad they took most of the rules out so we can use as many possible and do anything. This should be the responding.   
  
  Q. Do you think the Dunk Contest discriminates against --  
 JaVALE McGEE: Definitely. I remember the first Dunk Contest -- inaudible. But yeah, of course, they discriminate against tall guys, but as long as we come correct and we come with a lot of creativity, they didn't discriminate against us. I just want to be as creative as possible and get the edge, especially from the crowd. I'm just trying everything. I was going to come out with some little shorts, but I decided not to.   
  
  Q. Anyone you might bring out?   
 JaVALE McGEE: I think I'm going to use John Wall.   
  
  Q. You talked about the crowd; talk about the electricity tomorrow night.   
 JaVALE McGEE: Definitely going to be exciting. I'm sure DeMar has like 30 tickets he has to buy. It's going to be real exciting.   
  
  Q. How many did you have to buy?  
 JaVALE McGEE: I had to buy like ten.  
  
  Q. What's the single biggest obstacle you've faced in getting to where you are?   
 JaVALE McGEE: Just coming out being unknown and not knowing what I can do. So just trying to work as hard as I can and show what I can do.   
  
  Q. Any advice for kids that want to be dunkers like you?   
 JaVALE McGEE: Try, if you can jump, dunk the ball.
