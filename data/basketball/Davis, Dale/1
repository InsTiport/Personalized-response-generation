   DALE DAVIS:  There's no tomorrow for us.  I mean, we've got to go on a game-by-game basis, and with the next game coming up, just focus on that and leave everything out on the court. 
 Q.  What turned the game around in your mind when you were up six and all of a sudden you were down 12? 
 DALE DAVIS:  Well, I thought we had good momentum, especially in that third quarter.  You have to give them credit.  They made some good plays during that run to kind of cool us off a little bit, but it was a bang-bang game.  Even though we didn't play well throughout for 48 minutes, we had good signs, and the main thing right now is just regrouping and getting ready for the next game. 
 Q.  You guys got really physical in the paint tonight.  Is that just part of the plan and something you've got to keep going when you get back to Detroit? 
 DALE DAVIS:  I mean, it's playoff basketball.  Of course we definitely wanted to win tonight.  You know, it's going to be physical, no question about it.  We're down now, our backs are pretty much against the wall, and usually when that happens, we respond.  So we look forward to the next game.
