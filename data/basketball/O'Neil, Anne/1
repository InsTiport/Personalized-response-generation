<p>	Q.  Anne, the last shot, talk about it, how good it felt coming off? </p>
<p>	Q.  Katie, where did you think they were going whenever they went inside to Alesha on that last play for them? </p>
<p>	Q.  Anne, can you talk about the defense.  They didn't let you guys get a whole lot of open 3-point looks.  It was hard to post up inside.  What did they do that made it hard for you guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the first half and second half?  First half, 10 points, eight boards.  Second half a little foul trouble. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you take something out of this, you guys really did play well, even though it's a loss?  You played a top team, played them to the wire. </p>



<p>	Q.  Do you think you had it in you one more time? </p>
<p>	Q.  You have your go-to player, she had the ball.  Tech doesn't really have that one player you knew the ball was going to.  What were y'all thinking? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you guys are struggling, that was big. </p>
<p>	Q.  (No microphone.) </p>
<p>	Q.  You had a nine-point lead in the first half, eight points in the second half.  Was there ever a point where you thought, one more basket, maybe stagger them? </p>
<p>	Q.  What do you think about your position heading into the NCAAs? </p>
<p>	Q.  Ever since the Baylor game, I think the last three regular-season games and yesterday's game, I don't think (inaudible) today you saw Iowa State at its best? </p>
