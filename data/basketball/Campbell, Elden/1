TAYSHAUN PRINCE:  We all came from some long roads, Ben in Orlando and now here, Chauncey -- I say pretty much that I'm the only guy to be drafted by the Pistons, but everybody else had to take a different road to get here.  We're united, period.  It doesn't necessarily mean that on the floor, you know, we're a group of guys off the floor, and we always hang out with each other.  It doesn't matter if it's on the floor, we're always united.  This is a team full of veterans that know what they want and we know what we've got to do when we go out on the floor.  We can go out and make practical jokes and all that stuff on the floor, but once we're on the court, it's different.

Q.  How do you view your role on this team? 

ELDEN CAMPBELL:  I just fill in the blanks and the gaps.  I can do a lot of things on the defensive end and even at times on the offensive end as well.  I just fill in the gaps where it's needed.

Q.  These guys have so much respect for you, did you understand before you came back the role that you played in that locker room and how much they wanted you back?

ELDEN CAMPBELL:  You know, I kept in contact with the guys the whole time.  Like when you're there, some of the guys who don't even play there anymore, once you're there and you go somewhere else it's not the same.  It's such a family unit.
