 Q.   How much better has he (Rubio) made you?  
DERRICK WILLIAMS:   A lot better.   All you've got to do is go out there and wait for the ball.   
   
 Q.   Last year the big question with Ricky was he's a young guy.   What were your thoughts about him last year?  
DERRICK WILLIAMS:   You know, over here it's a lot different.   Over here we play zone, get the ball up, around, all the rules are different.   
   
 Q.   Can you guys be a playoff team?  
DERRICK WILLIAMS:   Yes, definitely.  
   
 Q.   Is that the feeling or is that the goal?  
DERRICK WILLIAMS:   Yeah.
