  Q. The Heat announced, as you know, that Bam is doubtful and Goran is doubtful.  With no Bam, probably going to see Kelly or Meyers, possibly both.  What can they add to the series in your opinion with the Lakers' size, and can they maybe help pull some of the Lakers' bigs out since they're such effective three-point shooters, sort of pull them out of the paint?
 JAE CROWDER:   Yeah, obviously those guys spread the floor for us and are big bodies to match their length on the inside.
 So, we know exactly what Meyers and Kelly bring to our team, and hopefully we can exploit that to the best of our ability.  Yeah, that's the game plan.  We know exactly how they can affect the game; just a matter of us putting them in position to help us win games.
 Q. And one more thing.  You've obviously practiced against Derek Jones.  He hasn't played a ton in the series.  When he's at his best, how good a defender is he?
 JAE CROWDER:   He's definitely can be a disruptive defender for the opposing team.  Obviously, he brings length and he's definitely an athletic guy, so he can definitely alter some shots.  That's what we need moving forward.  When he steps on the court, he can definitely affect the game at a high level and we're aware of that and we're going to need that.
 Q. What would you like to change for Game 2 about your approach on the game?
 JAE CROWDER:   Just take control I think of the turnovers and our shot selection and controlling their fast tempo a little better.  Like to see that in Game 2.
 That's basically it.  Control the things you can control to the best of your abilities at this time of the year.
 And that affects -- when you control what you control on offense, that affects what you're doing on defense as well.
 So play hand to hand.
 Q. Do you think it's fair or appropriate for players to speak out on the lack of black head coaches given the fact that the players have spoken out against systemic racism and social justice?
 JAE CROWDER:   I think it's fair.  I think everyone has freedom of speech, right?  I mean, especially what it is just you telling your side of what you believe.  I just feel like, yeah, a player in this league definitely has the right to speak on it if they deem so.
 So, yeah.  That's my answer to it.
 Q. Erik was talking about how -- and you obviously brought up Kelly -- but Kendrick has been one of the guys in the gym who has not got a lot time, but he's seen behind the scenes working hard, especially after coming back from COVID.  What have you seen as his teammate in the background that led to what he was able to do in the fourth quarter?
 JAE CROWDER:   IÂ’ve been telling him just stay prepared, stay ready.  I saw the story a million times where a guy is in the rotation during the season, then he's out of the rotation, and couple series in he's back in the rotation.  So, you got to prepare and be a professional, and that's my message as a leader on this team, especially an older guy he looks up to.
 I just was always in his ear.  I'll date it back to the Indiana series the most because it hit him the hardest when he first realized he wasn't in the rotation.
 Just stay prepared.  Your moment is going to come again and you have to take advantage of it.  I just feel like that was my message, and it played out to where he had a good game and good inning of Game 1, and hopefully can roll over to Game 2 and the rest of the series for us.
 Q. You mentioned the Indiana series.  Was that a point where you saw him get reinvested?  Okay, I could get another chance down the road and I need to be working hard and prepare?
 JAE CROWDER:   100%.  I think I remember when Goran went out for Game 5 of that series for a split second and coach threw him in and he made some plays.  He made some plays on the offensive end.
 I remember him coming back to the sideline, and I said, I told you.  Your number is going to get called again.  Stay prepared, stay ready.  You can't get frustrated with the process of what the coaches see and do on a game plan situation.
 So my message to him was just stay ready at all times.  Continue to put in the work behind the scenes, and when your number is called again, take full advantage.
