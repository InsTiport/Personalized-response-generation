 THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with Auburn. We'll ask Coach Lebo for some opening comments, thoughts on the game, and then we'll take your questions just for the two student-athletes. And then finish up with Coach Lebo. Coach, would you begin.   
 COACH LEBO: Well, I'm very proud of my team, the way we competed tonight against a very talented Florida team. But, you know, obviously, one of the things that we have to do is shoot the ball well from three. That didn't happen tonight.   
 We still managed to stay in the game there. Shooting as poorly as we did, you look at the numbers, they were all pretty even, except for the three-point shooting.   
 I just feel bad for Tay Waller, who's a senior who just couldn't get it going tonight offensively. If you say we shoot 4 of 25 and Tay doesn't score a bucket and we still have a chance, I'd have said you're crazy.   
 But toughness here. Frankie Sullivan was terrific tonight. DeWayne Reed battled. Didn't, I don't think, come out of the game. Just a hard-fought game. Just came up short.   
 THE MODERATOR: We'll take your questions for either of the student-athletes.   
  
  Q. This is for Frankie. Did you feel like you really had to take the offensive load on tonight?   
 FRANKIE SULLIVAN: Yeah, I did, but I wasn't trying too much to be scoring. I was scoring to help win the game. It doesn't matter to me scoring the points. I just want to win.   
  
  Q. Yeah, for either player. I know it was a tough three-point shooting night, but how much of it was maybe Florida's defense contesting here, or how much of it did you feel was just missing looks?   
 FRANKIE SULLIVAN: I think we just missed wide open looks. We was wide open half of the time we shot the basketball. It just wouldn't go down for us tonight.   
  
  Q. For both players, can you talk about Florida's ability to pick and roll and get a lot of layups and dunks, especially with Tyus.   
 FRANKIE SULLIVAN: We knew he was great coming into the game. We was hoping that we could have off on off side and stop some of the dunks. Unfortunately, it broke down.   
 They set a lot of ball screens, and it's hard to guard them when they're coming off the ball screen. I thought they did a great job, and I hope they do well in the future.   
 DEWAYNE REED: They set a lot of ball screens. I mean, every play they have is a ball screen. Three or four ball screens in one play.   
 We just wanted to fight through and get over the ball screen and try to prevent the dunking from happening.   
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll excuse you. We'll continue on with questions for Coach Lebo.   
  
  Q. Jeff, I know you said you're going to meet with Jay after the season's over. What do you anticipate to come out of that meeting? What do you hope to come out of that meeting?   
 COACH LEBO: We'll meet like we always do at the end, like most head coaches and ADs meet. We'll have our discussion. That will be private. It will happen at some point here soon, I'm sure.   
  
  Q. Jeff, can you talk about how Florida was able to get so many points in the paint with the pick and roll, especially with Tyus.   
 COACH LEBO: They're big. You can see we're not. We're very small. That's part of the reason.   
 And they went bigger against us. They played a lot of Parsons at the two, where they were 6'8", 6'9", 6'10", 6'10". And we're 6'6" and 6'8" back there a lot of times. So they did hurt us on it. We prepared a lot for it.   
 We knew we were going to give up some of those because you have to guard two things. You have to guard the pick and roll, but you also have to guard the other big ducking in on the other side. So they put you in a bind on that. When you're not particularly big, it puts you -- it's hard.   
 We tried to zone them a little bit. That didn't work. Their ability to pass, I think that's the one thing they do as good as anybody is pass the basketball.   
 They picked us apart. Tyus especially hurt us on his pick and rolls.   
  
  Q. Jeff, getting 27 points out of Frankie Sullivan but at the same time getting zero out of Tay, does that up and down just kind of typify the season?   
 COACH LEBO: It's how Tay's been doing and how he's been playing, and how he's been shooting the basketball.   
 Shooting the ball in these type of venues is not easy. You look at the three-point percentages of the games before us, they were poor. It's just not -- it's very difficult, I think, shooting environment. So, again, we shoot as poorly as we do, and that's what we have to do to win the game.   
 I was really proud of the team the way they competed when they didn't make shots like that. We could have gotten beat by 25 when you shoot 4 of 25, the way we play.   
 I talked to Frankie before the game. I think he was deferring so much. He had been hurt, and he was deferring to Tay so much when he got back because Tay had been on fire.   
 And I told Frankie, I said you need to look to score for us out there tonight. We need you to be aggressive shooting the basketball. We need you to look for your shot a little bit more.   
 If I knew all I had to do was say that and he was going to get 25 points, I'd have done it all year. But frankly's just a tough kid. Just a unique thing for Tay, the way he's been playing, to not score in this game is -- you wouldn't have that if we played 30 more games.   
  
  Q. Jeff, what do you say to Tay after a night like this?   
 COACH LEBO: I mean, I just told him -- I talked to him afterwards. He has been great. His effort, his attitude, takes coaching very well.   
 He was heartbroken after the game. It's hard to say something to somebody after a game like that. But that's what I told him, I'm proud of him. He's given us a lot of great memories, and tonight just wasn't his night.   
 You hate to see a senior go out like that, and it's very frustrating to coach it. But he was just heartbroken after the game.   
  
  Q. Jeff, when you look at your body of work over six years, what are you most proud of, and what are you the most disappointed in?   
 COACH LEBO: I mean, we just got done with the game, so I haven't really thought about the body of work after this game. Probably not the best time to ask that question.   
  
  Q. Jeff, you lose a lot of seniors from this team and a lot of players coming back who didn't really get many minutes. What's the future of this team maybe going to next season? Can it compete as well as it did this year?   
 COACH LEBO: I hope. We've got a good recruiting class coming in. We played a lot of seniors this year. But we've got some guys that have got to get better. Some guys did get better as the season went on. They just didn't play a lot because of the seniors.   
 We just got done with a game. It's hard to think about the future right now after a season's ending and we've got as many seniors as we have. So we'll do that in the coming weeks.   
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.
