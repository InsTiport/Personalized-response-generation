Vanderbilt  Â– 61
  LSU - 47

 THE MODERATOR: Representing LSU is Coach Chancellor, Courtney Jones and Allison Hightower. 
 COACH CHANCELLOR: I want to give Vandy credit, they played well tonight. They have a lot of heart, they played tough, they did a great job. 
 LSU uncharacteristically -- this was not LSU today. We did not play like we have been playing for the last seven games. Turned the ball over, 18 points off second-chance turnovers. The thing I can't get over, I watched the Tennessee/Auburn game, and I'm not saying it's bad, but the officials have grown in love with the offensive foul. It ain't but one offensive foul after another! 
 If I was paying good money to watch a game, I would want to see a little offense, and all the games I see today offensive foul, lord! That didn't have anything to do with our losing tonight, Vandy played! 
 We turned the ball over too much, didn't rebound the ball, they had a lot of heart down at the end. Questions? 

 Q. What did you feel happened in the last 7 minutes? You were tied at 8:07 and after that it was all them. 
 COACH CHANCELLOR: We had a breakdown in defense. We let Wirth get a wide-open three, in the last eight minutes they shot a -- got one offensive rebound after another and they did a great job of executing in that eight minutes, and then we couldn't score. And because we couldn't score that affected our ability to defend. 

 Q. Allison, can you talk about what they did against you defensively tonight that gave you problems? 
 ALLISON HIGHTOWER: I thought they did a really good job on defense. They were playing me box-and-one, face guarding me the whole time, playing the zone on the rest of the team. 

 Q. Coach, we talked about upsets in this tournament, and this time it's 1 versus 2 tomorrow, can you talk about how that's shaped up? Are you surprised? 
 COACH CHANCELLOR: Yeah, I really was. I thought there would be more upsets in this tournament than there have been. Even though I thought Auburn was dominant today, and Vandy in the last eight minutes was really outstanding. 

 Q. Coach, can you talk about where you feel you guys are as far as the NCAA tournament goes and where you think you'll be seeded? 
 COACH CHANCELLOR: We won 6 out of our last 7 and 13 out of something, and we've been playing really good up until the last eight minutes of this game. I wouldn't want to think that's going to hurt us, because I think Vandy will -- I really thought they played really good.
 And this small lineup for them has been outstanding and the coach has done a great job with their kids in this tournament, I'll give 'em credit for that. 

 Q. How did you feel about Tia tonight? 
 COACH CHANCELLOR: I thought she was fine, it was just -- we were thankful she didn't have other problems. She was fine. Hard to have 20 turnovers, give up 13 offensive rebounds and beat a good team. 
 Defensively they were really good. That's one thing I don't think they get enough credit for, they play really good defense and don't get enough credit for it. 

 Q. Courtney, did you feel like you guys, the supporting cast gave Allison enough support tonight when she struggled a little bit? 
 COURTNEY JONES: Sometimes we did try to get her open, but it was hard. Sometimes they would switch on the screens and she wasn't open. You're going to have games like that and we just needed to step up. 

 Q. Allie, do you feel like this loss is going to affect the confidence of the team going into the tournament? 
 ALLISON HIGHTOWER: I feel like we have time to prepare, get back and practice, get back to the basics and do the things that we need to do to come out in the tournament and compete. 
 COACH CHANCELLOR: I thought their seniors were outstanding. I thought Risper and Wirth took over the game and were pretty good tonight, certainly. Thank you very much, I appreciate it. 
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach, thanks.
