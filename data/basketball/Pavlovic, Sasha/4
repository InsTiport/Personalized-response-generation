  Q.  The fact that you guys haven't been here before, could it be possibly better that you're opening up on the road?   
 SASHA PAVLOVIC:  I don't know, we'll see.  It's so exciting for us.  I can't possibly explain this feeling.  But we can't let that distract us, and we just have to stay focused and try to win games.   
  
  Q.  We all know what a challenge it was for you to get by the Detroit Pistons, but because they were so powerful in the Eastern Conference, is this really that much more of a challenge for you guys?   
 SASHA PAVLOVIC:  Yeah, it's much more of a challenge than Detroit because we're here right now, and I think it's going to be -- we all know there's going to be hype, but that's why we're here.  I think we deserve to be here, and we played a pretty good season and even better in playoffs, and we're just going to try to win games.   
  
  Q.  Do you feel like the Cavaliers' surge in the last half a season sort of coincided to the point that you went into the starting lineup and maybe opened things up a little bit with your shooting?   
 SASHA PAVLOVIC:  No, I just worked so hard this summer, and I know coach told me before the season I have to step up my defensive game, and that's what I did.  I worked hard on that this summer, and he gave me the opportunity and I used it.  Now I'm in the starting lineup, and I'm just going to try to help my teammates win games.   
  
  Q.  What's the biggest thing you think you learned in the last series about yourself?   
 SASHA PAVLOVIC:  For me every other game is a new experience for me, and this Eastern Conference Finals was the biggest experience I've ever felt in my life.  I think it helped me a lot.  Now I know what playoffs means, what Finals means, and I think I'm going to be better in my game because of that.
