  Q.  How do you take a negative and turn it into a positive from the last two games going forward?   
 SASHA PAVLOVIC:  We have to close out the game.  We were ahead in the second game at halftime and we let them come back.  We shouldn't have let them do that.  The rest of the games I think we have to come out like they did and just come out and help each other and try to win.   
  
  Q.  Does it surprise you about these first two games of the series, how they played and how they went against you and things like that?   
 SASHA PAVLOVIC:  Well, I think both games, I think we have a good team enough to beat them.  I'm surprised we let them come back in both games, like I said.  If we just stick together and play together, we're going to win the game.
