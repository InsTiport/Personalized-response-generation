<p>	Q.  It's been a while since you won a BIG EAST tournament.  Can you talk about that opportunity. </p>
<p>	Q.  Hakim, can you just talk about your fast start.  Once you got going it seemed you got everybody on your team going. </p>
<p>	Q.  Jim, could you talk about having to maintain things when Hakim went out?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jim, you had talked about a couple of weeks ago, about not preferring to use two big guys together because of what it does inside.  Getting these big guys for such an extended period tonight, how much of that is because of what Connecticut is?</p>
<p>	Q.  What was the difference?</p>
<p>	Q.  Your losses this year have been to your "elite" teams.  What does it do for you confidence-wise to get over the hump and know you have a win against one of those elite teams? </p>
<p>	Q.  Hakim, what about you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, Connecticut usually has success against your zone.  Did you do anything to change your zone?</p>
<p>	Q.  For the players, how do you guys like the rough-and-tumble physical style of play in games like this? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about getting hot at the right time, getting hot going into the NCAAs.  Talk about how it puts you in the situation you're in right now?</p>
<p>	Q.  If I got it right...</p>
<p>	Q.  Amazing what 700-plus wins will do to a guy's ego.  I think the first basket was a second offensive rebound.  It looked like they were attacking the basket.  Did you get a sense early on they were going to go after it tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the opportunity you have, you've won a national title.  Talk about this opportunity. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about playing an unlikely opponent tomorrow night, West Virginia. </p>
