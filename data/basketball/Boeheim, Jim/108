<p>	Q.  Jim, can you talk about the last two minutes of the first half.  You applied full-court pressure. </p>
<p>	Q.  How significant is it to win this tournament to set you up for what's ahead?</p>
<p>	Q.  Not an overwhelming display of euphoria when you came out to accept your trophy.  Surely there's emotion or thought going through your mind. </p>
<p>	Q.  How much of a barometer is it with (inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Were you concerned after such a big, emotional win over UCONN, that they might have a letdown? </p>
<p>	Q.  Before the game at UCONN last week you said you were basically where you wanted to be midway through the season.  Have you made up a lot of ground?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Hakim's performance overall?</p>
<p>	Q.  Hakim, as Coach said, maybe what matters most is next week.  You've won a national championship.  You never won the BIG EAST tournament.  How much does this mean to you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Following up on that, Hakim, will it be easy to put this behind you and get ready, obviously, for next week? </p>
<p>	Q.  It's been a long time since you took home the trophy.  How does it feel? </p>
<p>	Q.  Hakim, your club had a really strong week from the sophomore class.  Going forward, how important is it for your sophomore class to play well next week? </p>
<p>	Q.  For Jim and Hak, with regard to what you were saying about the mindset, did you make a conscious decision not to cut down the nets here? </p>
<p>	Q.  Hak? </p>
<p>	Q.  I think you opened some doors for John Beilein over the years. </p>
<p>	Q.  Hakim, can you talk about the team's improvement in defensive rebounding.  What happened there?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you thought about your senior year, was this a goal you set out? </p>
<p>	Q.  After all of the winning that you guys have done while you've been here, and you've got the national championship, can you describe why winning a BIG EAST tournament is significant to you. </p>
<p>	Q.  Jim, any thoughts about where you'll go next week and where you'll be seeded?</p>
