<p>	Q.  Could you just comment on what Kueth Duany has meant to your team this year, and if you could elaborate on it a little bit.  As you know, he comes from a pretty different background.  Does he give you a different perspective on the world this year with all that's going on right now?</p>
<p>	Q.  First question  - it's a two-parter  - real fast.  Obviously, one of the things that's really been the strength, I think, of your team this year has been its depth in the bench, especially Jeremy McNeil, Josh Pace, Billy Edelin.  Talk about them just a little bit and what kind of benefits they give you in addition to just playing time with their durability.</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you talked to Rony Seikaly? </p>
<p>	Q.  About the New Orleans thing, is it a little bit weird going back there?</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you remember about that '87 game?  It was '90 when you lost to Minnesota in the Sweet 16 with a pretty good team.</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, can you talk a little bit about T.J. Ford, and are the problems he presents for you with your zone a little different than he presents for other teams?</p>
<p>	Q.  We were just talking about T.J. Ford there.  But you look at the entire back court at Texas, Brandon Mouton is a scorer and a terrific player as well.  Can you talk about battling both T.J. Ford and Brandon Mouton with both the zone and the man defense?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, I'm sure you're aware of all the speculation going on about Roy Williams and the North Carolina job.  As someone who's been in the business for a long time, can you appreciate the situation he must be in right now?  Have you ever encountered anything like that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is it kind of an advantage to have so many young players who really haven't been to a Final Four and maybe might not even really know what it is, or does it go the other way?</p>
<p>	Q.  Yeah, the dumb theory of like, "What's this Final Four thing?"</p>
<p>	Q.  Just kind of following up on the freshmen, Coach Williams just was saying that he feels like he'd rather have talent over experience any day.  What are the things that...</p>
<p>	Q.  What are the things that make Carmelo so special?  We can see from a distance that he can just dominate at times.  But from your perspective?</p>
<p>	Q.  Rick Barnes was saying yesterday that one of his most vivid memories...</p>
<p>	Q.  He was saying nice things about you.</p>
<p>	Q.  He was saying his most vivid memories were his first years at Providence, wide-eyed, new coach.  His first conference meetings down in Florida, you were one of the guys that went out of your way to tell him "it's going to be all right."  Do you have any special memories of him from his younger days?  He was kind of wild and crazy back then.</p>
