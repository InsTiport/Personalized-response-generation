<p>	Q.  Coach, when you're up 25 at the half, did it remind you of what happened at Rutgers last time? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, how beneficial is it for your team that the second half wasn't extremely competitive, wasn't close?</p>
<p>	Q.  Speaking of playing back-to-back, can you talk about playing them for the third time this year. </p>
<p>	Q.  Gerry, you've struggled against UCONN in the past.  What do you have to do tomorrow night to do what you did tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  Playing UCONN for the third time. </p>
<p>	Q.  Hakim, was it important to set a tone this time against a team you're supposed to beat, set it early the way you did, put them on their heels early on? </p>

<p>	Q.  Coach, that said, would you say the reason you were able to avoid that may be your experience?</p>
<p>	Q.  How would you assess the play of Roberts and Watkins, especially going forward? </p>
<p>	Q.  How tough is your team to beat? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, do you mind playing UCONN twice in a seven-day span?</p>
