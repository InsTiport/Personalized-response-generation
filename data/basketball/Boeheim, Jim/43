COACH BOEHEIM:   I thought we got off to a slow offensive start and we just really never could get anything going offensively and but I thought we made some really good plays to get back in it and we made two bad plays to get back out of it.   
   
 Q.   Jim, if you could go through your last offensive possession there if at any point you wanted the guys maybe to slow down because they had time?  
COACH BOEHEIM:   Well, we needed a three at that point and I think we got four looks at it, which is more than you're normally going to get.   But we had to get a three at that time.   
   
 Q.   Same thing to you, what was that last possession like?   It looked like you had the best look on that last one?  
C.J. FAIR:   Yeah, our last possession we got a few good looks and myself, I got a clean look.   I just didn't knock it down.   And from there, we was just scrambling trying to get in another opportunity.   
   
 Q.   CJ, you know, Warren was on you all game.   Was his defense tight all night or were you just missing shots that you normally get?   
C.J. FAIR:   I mean, you do a good job denying defense.   But I thought I was getting my normal shots that just wasn't falling and, I mean, that's what it was really.   
   
 Q.   Jim, how much did it hurt when Rakeem got his fourth foul early in the second half?  
COACH BOEHEIM:   Well, you'd like to have him in there, there's no question about that.   But he was out of position three times and if he had been in the right position, he wouldn't have been in foul trouble.  
   
 Q.   Jim, Tyler was pretty good from behind the arc today, more emphasis on shooting that he's been this year.   Is that something that you want to see more out of him considering Trevor's recent struggles?  
COACH BOEHEIM:   Trevor was hurting a little bit.   He wasn't moving as well as he can.   He turned his ankle a little bit.   Tyler tries to score when we need points, and we needed points.   
   
 Q.   Jim, forgive the timing, but can you kind of talk about, the ACC started this season with a lot of hype.   Can you kind of give the impression of what you thought the league was like in the first year and how many teams you think deserves in the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH BOEHEIM:   I have nothing to that, any of that.   
   
 Q.   Jim, can you talk about your team and how it's trending?   Are you worried about slumping heading into the NCAAs?  
COACH BOEHEIM:   We played our best game of the year Sunday and that was a very optimistic turn for us.   When we didn't play well, you know, two of our last losses, we didn't have Jerami Grant.   So I just discount that completely.   
But we played extremely well at Florida State.   And I thought that we would play well here.   And I don't think that we played that poorly.   I think we shot the ball badly and it's hard to recover when you're not shooting the ball well, it's very difficult to win.   The ball's not going in the basket.   
I thought we did everything we could to come back and we tried to get to the basket more, get to the foul line, but we just have not shot the ball well from the three‑point line the whole year.   
But we've been able to get back in the games and when we get back in them, we've been able to make good plays down the stretch.   And tonight we made two offensive fouls and we took a bad shot when we had the two‑point lead.   Tyler got in traffic and took a bad shot and they got the ball out and we had the foul and they made two shots.   It was a really bad play and we haven't been making those plays in the close games.   
Even the close games that we've lost, we made good plays, we make good plays down the stretch.   We missed the lay‑up in the Duke game.   We made really good plays down the stretch.   But tonight, when we did get back in, you're going to make a bad play, we made two really bad offensive plays.   
I thought we really made some unbelievable steals to get back in it.   They had the game pretty much under control.   We made a couple of really good steals in our traps and got down and gave ourselves an opportunity to win the game.   But we made some bad plays down the stretch.   
But I'm not concerned about our team.   I think we played well all year.   I think we struggle shooting it.   I think that's pretty well documented.   But in spite of that, we won 27 games.   So I'm pretty pleased with what these guys have done.   And I believe that we'll be a very good tournament team.   
   
 Q.   I don't know if you've heard that the ACC tournament will move to Barclays Center?  
COACH BOEHEIM:   I haven't heard.  
   
 Q.   2017, 2018.   What are your thoughts?  
COACH BOEHEIM:   No thoughts.   I'm concerned about one thing.   I think you may get that point.   I'm not speculating or talking about anything.   We're concerned about this season, how we're playing, how we're going to play this week.   When the season is done, we'll try to talk about all of this other stuff.   
   
 Q.   TJ Warren led the ACC this year in scoring, but tonight he played defense on CJ throughout the game.   Could you talk about what he was able to do defensively?  
COACH BOEHEIM:   I thought CJ got the shots he normally makes.   I think he's the best offensive player in the league.   I think he was clearly the best player in the league this year.   And, you know, he is a tremendous offensive player.   CJ got the shots we'd like him to get.  
   
 Q.   Just because this is a first‑time experience for your university community as a whole, could you share your perception of how the fan base and everybody else rallied around this experience compared to past experiences?  
COACH BOEHEIM:   I think it's great.   I thought we had huge fan support tonight.   You know, I thought we had a lot of people down here and I thought that was ‑‑ we've had great support wherever we've gone this year.   The people in Greensboro are great.   They try to take care of everything you have.   But it's just a matter when you go to a tournament, there's only one thing that matters is how you play.   If you don't play well, then it's a bad experience.   
   
 Q.   CJ, what did you think about the shots that you got tonight and what do you kind of attribute to not a ton of them going down?   
C.J. FAIR:   Every game I take the normal shots I usually take.   And today was one of those nights where I couldn't really get going.   You know, Tyler and Jerami had a good little team man game going on.   I had to fit around that and not really force things.   Because I didn't get anything going.   But it was one of those games where we didn't play good offensively and we gave up too many easy buckets.
