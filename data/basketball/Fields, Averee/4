MIKE CAREY:   Well, first of all, congratulations to Baylor.   You know, we wish them only a lot of luck in the NCAAs. 
Second of all, our girls played extremely hard.   We had a one‑point lead with a minute to go and just didn't execute, and then we go down to the other side and then didn't score and then come down to the other side and didn't execute again.   But both teams played extremely hard.   There was runs.   We were up five at one time in the second half, so there was runs both ways. 
I thought the difference for them was Johnson, to be honest with you, and then right there at the end we let her refuse a screen and hit a baseline jumper when we were up one.   We took some shots in my opinion, some bad shots that we normally don't take.   We got in a hurry.   They did a great job sagging in on Bussie, and Asya, I felt she was a little bit tired today, people pounding on her and banging her and pushing her and shoving her now for three days, so I thought Asya, she did a great job, but she was a little bit tired, couldn't move. 
We had her open at times, we didn't get her the ball, and at times we didn't throw the ball where it should have been. 
Overall I told the players, remember how this feels because the next time going down the stretch, we've got to execute.   We normally have executed well going down the stretch.   Today we just‑‑ we had a couple shots, missed them, and then defensively is where I was really disappointed, we didn't execute and get some stops. 

Q.   Averee, second half it seemed like you guys came out with the mindset on offense to really drive the ball at them.   Was that one of the messages at halftime to really be aggressive going to the basket? 
AVEREE FIELDS:   Yeah, I think we played a little bit tentative the first half, so second half Coach Carey just told us to play our game to do what we normally do and so I think we came out with a lot of energy and wanted to play the way we normally do.   We like running up and down the floor, so we tried to do that more the second half. 

Q.   Bria, you picked up, I think, two fouls there within like a minute, and it all came about so quick.   Is it hard not to let that affect your play there?   Do you have to go about things a little differently at that point? 
BRIA HOLMES:   I just have to play smart and just have my teammates talk to me about it and just play smart for the rest of the game.   I picked up a third foul real quick, too, and Coach Carey sat me down.   I just had to play smart and let me teammates talk to me and keep my head focused. 

Q.   Asya, the game in Waco, I guess, eight days ago was kind of described as a street fight.   Was this game similar to that as far as it seemed there wasn't much margin between you guys and you guys were just going at it the whole game? 
ASYA BUSSIE:   Yeah, I think it was very similar from the game in Waco, it was just fighting the entire game.   I think Sune said it on the court that it was very similar and we were tailing a couple times, and we just didn't execute down the stretch, we didn't defend, and the outcome was just different. 

Q.   Asya, did they do anything differently here than what they had done in the previous two games?   I know you really scored a lot maybe in the Waco game or the one at West Virginia?
ASYA BUSSIE:   They might have sagged a little bit more but I think it was pretty much the same, just having their point guard kind of off and sagging a little more in the paint.   I think that was the only difference, but pretty similar. 

Q.   Averee, I know obviously this one stings, but you've got to put this one behind you.   It's a whole new season starting next week.   Do you think that's going to be something that this veteran team can do? 
AVEREE FIELDS:   I think yes.   I think tonight we'll feel the loss a little bit, but we just have to learn from it.   Our season is not over, and we want to make a good run in the NCAA Tournament, so we have to put it behind us.   We have to move on from wins and we have to move on from losses.   So I think that we'll get back together, get focused in practice, and we'll be ready for the tournament. 

Q.   Mike, you guys, I think, were down one, you guide lobbed it into Asya and Sims kind of came backside and knocked it in.   Was that the play you were looking for?
MIKE CAREY:   We was looking for a little bit of high‑low, but if it's not there, it's not there.   We went ahead and threw it.   I think she did knock it and Asya thought it was off her, and if we'd have just let the ball go out of bounds it probably would have been our ball. 
I thought we had a good trap right there at the end of the game, and then a foul was called.   But I thought we had them right where we wanted them at the end of the game right there. 
To answer whoever's question was about sagging, they were sagging their 4, too.   That's why Averee Fields was open a lot at the top.   Sims was just cheating in there and then they were sagging their 4 there on Asya plus the big girl on Asya.   They bottled her up a little bit. 

Q.   Coach, Odyssey had scored, I think she had averaged like 43 in the first two games.   Did you do anything differently on her or was it just her missing shots? 
MIKE CAREY:   Well, she only took 14, so normally she takes a lot more shots than that.   I think, like I said earlier, I think Johnson and their 4 player, Davis, I mean, was taking some shots.   I mean, normally they don't get as many shots as they'd get.   But we did a good job defensively at times.   Our rotation in the first half was not good, was not good, and they made an adjustment from our game right there where we would rotate our 4 over, but our outside guard was not rotating on their 4, and they got‑‑ the first half it looked like they were getting mostly lay‑ups on the block, and then I thought the second half we did a better job. 

Q.   During spring break this week what are your plans for the team? 
MIKE CAREY:   We'll give them off a couple days and then get back to work.   We'll give them off, what is today, Monday?   We'll give them off Tuesday and Wednesday and then get back to work on Thursday. 

Q.   The play where Sims hit the jumper to give them the lead, was that what you were talking about when she refused the screen there?
MIKE CAREY:   Yeah, she did it and then Davis did it.   There's no reason to do that to let them refuse it because we were either showing or we were switching it.   To let them refuse it is something that we always guard against, and we just did‑‑ I think we just got tired a little bit down the stretch and let them do some things we normally don't. 

Q.   I know you don't like talking about it too much, but now with this heading into the NCAAs, where do you see yourselves being ranked in there? 
MIKE CAREY:   I mean, I think we at least should be a 3, at least a 3 seed.   I said this yesterday:   2, 3, I'm happy.   Don't want to be 4 and 5.   I'm happy at a 6.   I just don't want to be 4 and 5.
