 Q. Bianca, you had a good start there, 14-point lead, and then what do you think happened that the game slipped away in the final minutes?
 BIANCA JACKSON:   I feel like we lost the lead because we didn't have as much intensity as we needed to, to sustain the lead.  We lost focus and we didn't execute the game plan down the stretch, and we just have to be better and learn from it.
 Q. Was it anything Syracuse was doing differently in the second half for them to be able to come back the way they did?
 BIANCA JACKSON:   No, I don't think so.  I think it was all on our end, a lack of focus.  We didn't execute how we were supposed to.  They played a great game.  They kept battling, and they got the win.
 Q. Obviously you had 25 points and seven assists.  What were you seeing from the defense from Syracuse just to get those seven assists?
 BIANCA JACKSON:   I was able to come off the ball screen a couple times and get to my pull-up.  They were kind of low, plugging, so I was able to hit that shot a couple time, my teammates found me in good spots and I was just trying to be aggressive and do whatever the team needed me to do.
 Q. Where do you go from here and how do you get back on track as you head into the NCAA Tournament?  What do you think you need to work on?
 BIANCA JACKSON:   We just have to regroup, refocus, get back in the gym and get back locked in.  Whoever they decide we get to play against, we just have to lock in and focus.  It's a hard loss for us.  We wanted to win this game really bad, so we've just got to figure it out.
