 Q.  What are the challenges of playing one position versus playing the entire team?  
DAYVON CURRY: I don't really think it's a challenge because I'm great at my position for a reason, so I don't really see a challenge.   
 Q.  Do you think this new NBA 2K League appeals more to gamers or more to NBA fans?  
DAYVON CURRY: Honestly, I think both.  You know, it's basketball.  Anybody that loves basketball.  Anybody that loves basketball.   
 Q.  What's your favorite game other than 2K?  
DAYVON CURRY: Fortnite.   
 Q.  Are you good at that, too?

DAYVON CURRY: PlayStation 4 and Xbox.  I play both.   
 Q.  Are you good on both?  
DAYVON CURRY: Yeah, I'm good on both.  I love competition.   
 Q.  So like how did you -- when did you hear about this and you decided to jump in the combine and go through the process?  
DAYVON CURRY: I heard about it on Twitter.  Everybody was talking about it, and I've always played 2K.  I played in the All-Star Game 2017, so when they brought this out, it was just automatic for me to get to it.   
 Q.  Did you think you were definitely going to make it?  
DAYVON CURRY: Oh, I already knew I was going to make it.   
 Q.  How much talking with the Knicks or whatever team was there before this?  
DAYVON CURRY: I only talked to them one time.   
 Q.  When did you talk to them?  
DAYVON CURRY: I can't tell you, a week -- I can't tell you.  I don't know.   
 Q.  What did they talk to you about?  
DAYVON CURRY: Just asking questions about myself.   
 Q.  Any nerves coming into today?  What have the last few days been like?  
DAYVON CURRY: I've been acting normal, but when they were starting to do picks, that's when the nerves started hitting.   
 Q.  Did you get a chance to talk to Jim Dolan yet?  
DAYVON CURRY: No, I want to.   
 Q.  Are you a Knicks fan?  
DAYVON CURRY: No, I'm a Cavs fan.  Always have since I was young, watching LeBron James.   
 Q.  Is that going to be a problem?  
DAYVON CURRY: No, no.   
 Q.  What do you think of the league starting up?  
DAYVON CURRY: It's a great idea.  You know, it's something that I always wanted to do.  I always wanted to become a pro, and now I can finally say I am.   
 Q.  Are you going to school?  
DAYVON CURRY: No, that's the funny part.  I did go to school, but then I dropped out to pursue my gaming career.   
 Q.  What did you drop out from?  
DAYVON CURRY: I think I dropped out in 2015.   
 Q.  Where were you going to school?  
DAYVON CURRY: Lone Star College in Texas.   
 Q.  At that point, were you like, this is my thing?  
DAYVON CURRY: Yeah, this was my thing, because like on my breaks, I always go back home just to play the game, and that's how I knew I always had a love for the game.  I knew it would all pay off one day.   
 Q.  But there was no 2K league.  
DAYVON CURRY: No, I was going to play in the All-Star tournament.
