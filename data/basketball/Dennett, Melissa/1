<p>	Q.  Sara, you've had a great game.  What was going through your head as you were going through the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Melissa, I had the sense that this was from start to finish the best game you guys have played in quite a long time.  I don't know if you agree with that or not.  I'd be curious on your thoughts, and maybe what was the key?  What was different tonight that you guys could sustain everything for as long as you did? </p>
<p>	Q.  Sara, can you just talk about the shooting tonight?  I mean, 7 of 10 from three-point range.  At what point did you know it was kind of your night? </p>
<p>	Q.  Melissa, it looked like it was a very physical game inside.  Will you talk about that and also if that played a role in the difference of the fouls?</p>
<p>	Q.  Melissa, next year obviously you, Lindsay, Vanessa, all you guys are going to be seniors, you're pretty much bringing back the entire team.  What do you take from this year heading into next year, which obviously I imagine you have pretty high expectations for?</p>

<p>	Q.  Chris, I would assume you're going to be in contact with the WNIT people.  What do you think your chances are, and if you do get in, how do you think -- you're coming off a couple of pretty good performances.  How do you think you can do?</p>
<p>	Q.  You said earlier this season that any time a team has been able to get really physical with you guys and kind of body you up that those have been teams that you've had some trouble with.  What did you do tonight to try and get over Anderson and Kubic and company?</p>
<p>	Q.  When Sarah is going like that, obviously you want to get her the ball.  Do you think you can maybe have that too much?  It seemed down the stretch trying to get the ball to her and you guys end up with the 20-footer from Lindsay?</p>
<p>	Q.  With Julie and her penetration, it seemed like both her and Ambrosia got to the rim a little bit.  Just defensive let-downs on that or no rotation?</p>
