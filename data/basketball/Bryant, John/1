<p>	Q.  Phil, could you describe what you've done since the game ended. </p>
<p>	Q.  Jameer, talk about match-ups.  I don't know if you guys want to get into that too much in front of this many reporters.  Give us some idea as to what kind of advantages you have, what kind of advantages Oklahoma State might have. </p>
<p>	Q.  Jameer, you obviously made a good decision to come back.  Would you look back and tell us maybe some of the things you're going to miss about college and college life.  No one really knows until college isn't there anymore, but what do you think you might miss? </p>

<p>	Q.  Coach Martelli, can you talk about the Oklahoma State team.  Do they remind you of anyone you've played this year?  I think they're probably one of the older teams in the tournament, as well.  There might not be as much advantage or experience in this game for either team. </p>
<p>	Q.  Jameer, going back to the Chicago camp, you declared for the draft.  Can you recall or put a percentage on the likelihood that you felt you would be staying in the draft before you went to Chicago? </p>
<p>	Q.  Pat, what gives you the most trouble with your shot as far as a defender, the type or style of defender? </p>
<p>	Q.  Pat, last night Wake Forest starts, there has to be a point that Jameer drove so much they had to go to a zone.  How often does that happen?  How often does that happen where a team thinks they have to play man, they realize that's not going to work, they have to pick their poison and switch defenses on you, then you beat that, too? </p>
<p>	Q.  Delonte, Jameer, how important has it been to have a guy like Barley come off the bench, give the defense, having guys like Pat Carroll, the importance of the other players on the team? </p>

<p>	Q.  Phil, earlier in the year when there continued to be these criticisms of you guys about what you weren't as a team, you weren't big, do you think people that are seeing you more get a sense of what you are and maybe a better appreciation for the way you do play to your strengths and how unique your style of play has been this year? </p>
<p>	Q.  Pat, Phil, you went through a stretch early in the year when you weren't shooting the ball very well.  How did you come through that period?  How did you sort of reenergize yourself?  Phil, how tough is that to do for a player who has been part of the program, to sit him down? </p>





<p>	Q.  Coach, last night both Dwayne and John got into foul trouble early with Williams inside.  How are you going to prepare them for the tough physical presence of Oklahoma State tomorrow? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about in a game that's so much talk about guards, talk about up against their big men.  They don't have a lot of size, but their athleticism.  What you expect? </p>

<p>	Q.  Coach, keeping in mind that it's a team effort that has gotten you guys where you are this season, do you feel like Delonte has gotten a little bit overlooked?  His talents when he's out there are pretty extraordinary.  Jameer gets a lot of attention.  How do you keep that from overshadowing the team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jameer, Delonte and Phil, I read Phil said Tyrone gives you guys epic battles in practice.  Is he indeed the best defender you guys go up against on a daily basis?  How has that improved you all? </p>


<p>	Q.  Phil, it's a common theory that college basketball has fewer and fewer dominant big men.  Do you subscribe to that theory?  How do you see it's affected the game and a program like yours in particular?</p>
<p>	Q.  Phil, why do you think more people haven't appreciated Saint Joseph's this year?  Do you think we no longer pull for the underdog?  Do you think we're in love with the name brand?  Will you be more comfortable if someone else in a public forum would diss your team right about now? </p>
<p>	Q.  Beginning with Delonte, I'm sure each of you have had a lot of coaches in your careers.  Could you each just give a very brief description of what it is you like about Coach Martelli, what trait you like about him, what trait you think you would like to see at the next level?</p>











<p>	Q.  When you started putting this team together three or four years ago, did you think a moment like this or a run like this for the Final Four would be possible?</p>
<p>	Q.  Along those lines, when practice did get underway and this group came together as a group, did you get a feeling early on that something special could happen?  Was it pretty early in the season?</p>
<p>	Q.  Eddie Sutton put his team in football pads for a couple practices this season.  One, have you ever done anything crazy like that? </p>
<p>	Q.  About the construction of this group.  When you began to put it together, did the personnel determine the way you wanted to play or did you have a model in mind when you went on the recruiting process?  What was it that convinced you that this model could work?</p>
<p>	Q.  In an era where there's almost paranoia in some teams, their point guards calling out the play by covering their mouth, Oklahoma State literally have flashcards that announce the play.  Have you ever seen anything like that?  Is it because they have so many plays that they can afford to do that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Not excluding Tyrone, you really allow Jameer and Delonte to run your offense from a point perspective together, kind of interchanging roles.  How important is it for you to have trust in Delonte as a point position player as much as Jameer?</p>
<p>	Q.  When did you first become aware of Eddie Sutton?  Can you share your thoughts about him being sort of a warrior in the game, he's almost 70 years old, has never played for a championship? </p>
<p>	Q.  That summer, where were you doing most of the doodling?  Exactly how tired are you now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Where were you doodling? </p>
<p>	Q.  Over half the six teams remaining yesterday were teams that start three guards, at least three guys 6'4" and under who are clearly perimeter players, and you're one of them.  Does this say more about the big-man problem in America going on or of a desire of coaches to play that way? </p>
