 Q.   What are you looking forward to this weekend?  
GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:   To have fun, to be with all of the guys and just go out there and enjoy it and have some fun and with the team winning.   And but we need to have fun too.  
   
 Q.   So far in the NBA what is the most valuable lesson that you've learned?  
GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:   I don't even know.   I'm just trying to grow on the court and just enjoy every moment.   
   
 Q.   How have you enjoyed this Allâ€‘Star experience?  
GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:   Oh, it's just wonderful.   I'm just out there for like 30 minutes or so, but it's great.   
   
 Q.   You're very young, but playing professionally for a few years, what's the difference between coming to the NBA and where you've been playing?  
GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:   It's a big difference.   And I'm in another country, and I speak a different language now.   The NBA game is very different from the European game.   
So I'm trying to adjust myself day by day and just try to adjust myself day by day and have some fun.
