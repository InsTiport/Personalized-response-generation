Creighton - 75, Xavier - 72
COACH MACK: Obviously a great game between two teams battling, and a team that had, I shouldn't say had the ball last, because we obviously had the ball last.  But big shots on both sides.  And a lot of times when teams hit 3s on you like that, you really want to complain about your defense.
I thought a lot of their 3s were really contested looks.  Cole Huff specifically.  They shot the lights out.  Not a whole lot you can do about it.
We tried to go zone a little bit, and they were getting the ball where they needed to in zone.  And when a team's shooting that well, I don't know if our secondary defense is one that's going to contain a team that was shooting that well.
So we have nothing to hang our head about.  Guys competed for three days.  And I think our team grew up over the weekend.  And so hats off to Creighton.  They played extremely well, especially in the second half.  And they earned the victory.
Q. Chris, obviously your stay here in the city won't be as long as you would have liked, and you kind of just alluded to this, but are you happy with the work you got in this week, and do you think you're an NCAA Tournament team at this point?
COACH MACK: Yeah, I don't think there's any doubt.  It's hard to say I'm happy after we lose.  We came here with different intentions.  But so did nine other teams.  So we gave it what we could.
We had guys that were playing heavy minutes all weekend.  They battled.  It's all you can ask for as a coach.  And I'm proud of my team just as I was last night.  And we'll live to fight another day.
Q. You mentioned that you contested all those 3s pretty well.  What's that like to watch you contest it so well and just three after three go in?
COACH MACK: It's tough.  That's the thing I really appreciate about my guys is they didn't hang their head.  They didn't cave.
They responded on the other end, and we did what we could defensively against a team that was having a terrific shooting night.  But we battled for it to be a one-possession game down the stretch.  I think it says a lot about the quality of our team as well.
Q. Quentin, would you say fatigue was a factor, this being the third game in three days, did that come into the equation at all down the stretch?  And, Chris, if you wanted to weigh in on that?
QUENTIN GOODIN: For it being such a close game going down the stretch, I honestly don't think fatigue was a factor.  I feel like we really wanted to win.  We would do anything to win that game.
You would think, outside looking in, fatigue was a factor.  But going down the stretch there was a whole lot of timeouts and that allowed us to get our breath back.
COACH MACK: Yeah, I feel fine.  (Laughter).
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
