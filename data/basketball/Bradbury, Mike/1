Nevada - 74, New Mexico - 64   
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by University of New Mexico head coach Mike Bradbury and student-athletes Jaedyn De La Cerda and Aisia Robertson.   
COACH BRADBURY: I thought it was a little choppy at times. I give Nevada credit. They make you play that way. They're really good defensively. They're well-coached. And they made it hard for us to get any flow offensively, especially in the second half.   
And I thought in the fourth quarter we struggled to rebound it and that's where they really beat us up.   
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.   
 Q.  Aisia, will you reflect on your two years at New Mexico and just everything that you've gone through, your time and what you're going to take most out of it?  
AISIA ROBERTSON: What I learned in these two years is that I should have committed to Mike out of high school. He's by far the best coach that I had throughout my career. I've learned so much from him in these past two years. He made me a better person and a better basketball player.   
But the list goes on about what I learned coming to the University of New Mexico. I just appreciate the university and the coaching staff.   
 Q.  Jaedyn, the way the team had to reinvent itself throughout the year, later on in the year, where you (indiscernible) played today as well, just talk about your performance in this championship?  
JAEDYN DE LA CERDA: I wouldn't be able to do it if it wasn't for Coach Mike and my teammates. He just said be aggressive and attack, so that's what I did. And I got open looks from my teammates and stuff like that.
