 Q.   Who takes the longest to get ready in the locker room?   
SHABAZZ MUHAMMAD:   The longest to get ready?   Shoot, probably Wiggs.   He takes the longest.   We call him "Sleepy".   He's always tired.   He probably takes the longest.   
   
 Q.   Do you remember the first time you got a pair of Jordans?   
SHABAZZ MUHAMMAD:   First time I got a pair of Jordans?   I was probably like five or six years old.   I didn't even know what they were, but I thought they were really cool.   
   
 Q.   Since then have you been collecting shoes like that?   
SHABAZZ MUHAMMAD:   Yeah, definitely.   I'm definitely a shoe collector.   I'm signed with adidas, so I can't really wear Jordans.   I still have them.   I have a lot of great shoes.   
   
 Q.   You get the hype over them?   
SHABAZZ MUHAMMAD:   Definitely.   I never could wait in line for hours.   But I see why people do sometimes.   They're awesome shoes.   
   
 Q.   Last question:   If you could sponsor one brand or one product, like the unofficial spokesman for that, what product would it be?   
SHABAZZ MUHAMMAD:   I think it would be‑‑ I think it would probably be‑‑ I don't know, probably Beats headphones.   I like them.   I listen to music before the game.   So that's something that's valuable.
