Q. (No microphone)?
C.J. McCOLLUM: I think that just the entire weekend is fun.  Going to different events, the NBA Cares events, the media, being able to see the dunk contest, the three-point contest.  Everything together at once I think is cool.
Q. C.J., what do you think it's going to take for you guys to improve?
C.J. McCOLLUM: I think we've just got to close out games better.  It's one of the biggest things between teams in the upper echelon, teams making the playoffs and teams that don't, is being able to win close games.  We're probably 15-27 in close games.  We've got to do a better job closing out games in the last five minutes.
Q. The guy you want to emulate, the guy whose fashion sense you want?
C.J. McCOLLUM: I don't emulate any of them.  I just try to put stuff together.  I can wear a nice suit from time to time.  I have my good days.  I have my bad days.
Q. (No microphone)?
C.J. McCOLLUM: I think everyone does it in different ways.  Steph shoots more off the dribble, Klay more catch and shoot.  They're both efficient.  I think there's a lot of very good shooters.
Q. Did you do any special preparation for this?
C.J. McCOLLUM: I did some practice.  I got in some shots.
