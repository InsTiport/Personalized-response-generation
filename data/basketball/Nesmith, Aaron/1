  Q. What will you bring to the Celtics?
 AARON NESMITH:   Shooting, instant floor space, making life easier for those guys who are really heavy creators on offense, like Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker, just making their life easier; while on the defensive side of the floor being able to contribute with my size and my length and my ability to guard multiple positions.
 Q. Who would you say you're most excited to play against in the NBA?
 AARON NESMITH:   Definitely Khris Middleton or LeBron James.  Khris Middleton went to my high school.  He's on the Milwaukee Bucks, which is another title contender in the East.  So that would be fun to be able to play against him and kind of have that moment that I always envisioned since high school.
 Q. For those who have never seen you play, what is the thing that Celtics fans should be excited about having with you on the roster now, being a part of the Celtics tradition?
 AARON NESMITH:   You know, an absolute sniper, a guy who's going to make life easier for the creators of the offense, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker.  A guy that is always going to be there and work hard and earn his stripes and do it on both sides of the floor.
 I want to be great.  I want to be the best player I can be, and so that includes defense.  I'm going to give my all and the best effort I have to that side of the floor, and with my size, length and athleticism, being able to guard multiple positions.
