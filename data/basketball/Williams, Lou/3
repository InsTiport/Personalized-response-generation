Mavericks 135, Clippers 133 (OT)
Q. Lou, I guess in general what will eat at you most about where this game could have been won but wasn't?
LOU WILLIAMS:   Just losing in general.  I thought we took our foot off the pedal in the second quarter.  We had a good lead.  We were playing well and I think we slowed our pace down.  So the second quarter, closing the half, I think that's got to be something we address tomorrow.
Q. At what point in this game do you think you guys lost it?  Was it in the second quarter when they made the run?  Was it in the third quarter, the fourth quarter?  When do you guys lose that lead for you guys, I guess?
LOU WILLIAMS:   Lost the game in overtime.  A lot of things happened during the game.  And obviously when you have a big lead you kind of feel crazy about it.  That was the second quarter.  Played 29 minutes after that.  So we had our opportunities to win the game.
Q. As competitive as these guys have been up until this game how is it that you guys end up losing that emotion that doc talked about through the second quarter as you mentioned?  How does that kind of dissipate?
LOU WILLIAMS:   They started -- they didn't want to lose the game and they played a little harder than we did.  So that happens in basketball.  I thought we did a good job of putting ourselves in a position to win that game.  They did an even better job.
And give Luka credit.  I don't think you guys would ask this many questions if he missed the shot at the end.  We had an opportunity to win the game.  They did.  He made a big shot.
Q. Lou, what do you make of Luka?  When you're out there with a guy that's playing that well, like what do you do with that?
LOU WILLIAMS:   Play them as best you can.  He's one of the more talented players in the league.  He's an All-Star caliber guy, young.  He plays with a lot of confidence.
