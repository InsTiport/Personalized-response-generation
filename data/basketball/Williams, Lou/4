 THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Lou.
 Q. It seemed like you did a slid jobs on the starters.  What went wrong with the second unit defensively?
 LOU WILLIAMS:   You got to give them credit.  I think though just played harder, were hungry to get a game.  They outplayed us.  You got to give them credit.
 Q. How different is the psychology of a Playoff series when typically Game 3 would be a super pivotal game?  With all that out of the window, how does the psychology change?  Feel more of a long haul?
 LOU WILLIAMS:   The game was over half an hour ago.  I haven't been able to digest the idea of that.
 I think Game 3 is pivotal no matter how you chop it up, whether we were going to Dallas or in L.A.  At 1-1, you just got to go out there and compete, play at a high level, try to win the basketball game.
 Q. Obviously you are a super deep team.  When you lose a guy like Pat, what does that mean?
 LOU WILLIAMS:   He's one of our anchors on the defensive end, gives us a different look, gives us so much energy, plays at a passionate level.  Energy is contagious.
 I thought we missed that tonight.  I felt like we didn't pick it up until the second half.  I think some of the tangible things, some of the small things he does for this basketball team was missing tonight.
 Q. After Game 1, Doc said he felt you were undisciplined in your defensive pick'n roll coverages.  How do you feel you adjusted tonight?  What mistakes did you see made out there?
 LOU WILLIAMS:   I think we made a lot of small mistakes, just miscommunications, not talking in situations where we were supposed to be communicating.  Just not giving ourselves an opportunity.
 When you lose a game by 10 or 12 points, the small mistakes start to add up.  That's what happened tonight.
 THE MODERATOR:   Thank you very much, Lou.
