  Q. If you could talk about your style of play to start with.   
 RODRIGUE BEAUBOIS: Style of play, I would say I can run. I would like to run, so for the NBA, I think it's a good thing.   
 After that, I think I can do a couple other things, like I can shoot the ball. I can make the others better. So that's it.   
  
  Q. What are you going to do to prepare yourself for the physical rigors of the NBA season?   
 RODRIGUE BEAUBOIS: Yeah, I think I need to work on my body, for sure. So I think I don't know, maybe next week I'm going to start to work on weightlifting, things like that, run. I really want to be ready for the beginning of the season.   
 So I will prepare myself to be ready.
