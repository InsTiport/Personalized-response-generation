THE MODERATOR: If you could start out with an opening statement about what you'll bring to your new team, please.   
GUERSCHON YABUSELE: I'm going to bring a lot of energy on my new team, try to be an energizer on the team, play great, help my teammates, and try to be the best on the court.   
 Q.  Did you expect to be selected this high?  
GUERSCHON YABUSELE: No, nobody was expecting.  I see them coming close to me, see my name.  So I was really surprised to be in here, but I was so happy.   
 Q.  There were some rumors going around the league that the Celtics were interested in you.  Did you hear those?  And is this a destination that you kind of expected?  
GUERSCHON YABUSELE: Not really.  I talked to the coach a little bit, talked to the GM.  I knew there was interest, but I don't believe that I'm going to be the 16th pick.   
 Q.  Had the Celtics talked to you about their plans, if they want you to stay overseas for a little while?  
GUERSCHON YABUSELE: Not really.  The GM said I can be interested to play the five, but we don't know yet.   
 Q.  Would you be open to staying and playing in Europe for a couple years before coming over to the NBA?  
GUERSCHON YABUSELE: It's not a problem for me, even if I got to go one year, two years in Europe, in another country and play, I'll go.  I just want to play in the NBA and try to be better, so it's great.
