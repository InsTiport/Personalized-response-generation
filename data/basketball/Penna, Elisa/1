Miami 68, Wake Forest 60
JEN HOOVER: Super proud of our team.  I love this team to death.  You know, even though we came out in a slow start, and give all the credit to Miami for that because I think they just really came out on a mission to show some speed and quickness, and it took us a minute to kind of bat our eyes and, whoa.
But it only fazed us for a minute.  There was no quit in this team.  We've had fight all year long, and came back and took the lead.  Just proud of what we've been able to accomplish and each one of our players laid it all on the line for me today, and that's all I can ever ask.
Q. Just your thoughts as it got whittled down there, and it seemed like the cap was about seven points for a while in the second and third quarter; and then as you take the lead in the fourth quarter, are you thinking it's there, it's just in the cards?
JEN HOOVER: Yeah, you know, I thought we were kind of hanging around.  The first half, really, the turnovers hurt us.  I think we turned it over 15 times in the first half, and at halftime we only had one less shot than them.  So kind of told them, we would be up ten by now if we had been passing the ball to ourselves.
Tried to make them a little bit relaxed out of it, and second half, you're exactly right, kept it right around that seven point.  And I just felt like if we could get it down, get that one basket and that one stop, and then all of a sudden, we're able to do it.
And then, you know, kudos to them again.  Katie calls a couple time outs, settles them down and they make the basket they have to make.  You know, we weren't able to kind of come out on top.
Q. How big was Anna's rebounding in that fourth quarter?
JEN HOOVER: It was huge.  She came in and you could tell, like I tell her all the time, like everybody rebound has got to be yours, and she really took ownership of that in that fourth quarter when she came in and was super fresh.  She can jump out of the gym and she just went up and got them and kind of beasted on the boards.  It was a huge momentum shift for us.
I thought Kortni Simmons' was huge for us during that little transition, and people coming from the bench and really making big contributions.  That's kind of what this team's been about all year.  We've had the steadiness and consistency of certain players; these two sitting here and Amber Campbell.
But when we can have our bench step in and do those things, Raegyn Branch hitting a three, that she's done that all year for us.  We just have to continue to do more and more of it.
Q. Alex, as you look back on the first couple minutes of that game, is it regretful that it took y'all a minute to kind of adjust there?
ALEX SHARP: It definitely hurts at the end, looking back at that first few minutes, thinking that if we locked in, what would have come of it, but you can't think like that, really.  It just has to be minute-by-minute, play-by-play and we let that part slip.  But I think we really bounced back and were able to settle a bit, and so that was good.
Q. I know you struggled with your shot a little bit tonight, but the pass to Anna that put you all up, what did you see on that play, if you remember?
ELISA PENNA: I don't even remember to be honest.  But I mean, every shot I took, it's because my teammates find me open.  This one right here, she finds me every time.  People that set me screens, you know, it's thanks to my teammates if I can take all these shots.
Yeah, I mean, overall, that's it.  That's what I have to say.
Q. What's that locker room like and how are you handling the loss and how do you say good-bye to Amber Campbell?
ALEX SHARP: I think we're all really disappointed.  It's tough having to say good-bye to Amber because really we can't see Wake Forest without her.  She's been such a big part of the program and she's really lifted it to where it's great for all of us coming in to be able to build up.  It's really just a sad place right now but we'll be able to work through it, yeah.  We're really just getting around each other and supporting each other.
Q. Can you talk about the first half?  You had 15 points, really sort of getting it going, and in the second half they seemed to find a way to shut down.  What were you seeing in the first half and what did they change in the second half?
ALEX SHARP: I think I was really finding my shot in the first half, and obviously I struggled in the second.
When I knew I was struggling, I tried to do other things.  I tried to get boards.  I tried to find E. and other players that were open.  Really I think it was just, I don't know, couldn't get it in the second half going.  But something to work on.  Something to build on for next year.
