ZHAIRE SMITH: It's a blessing to end up with the Sixers.  I worked out twice, so I knew they were really interested and I knew (coach Brett Brown) liked me.
Q. Were you a little shocked when the trade went down?
ZHAIRE SMITH: Yeah, a little bit.  It hasn't hit me because once I was about to get picked by the Suns, my agent said I was getting traded to the Sixers.  So I'm like, all right.
Q. You said you worked out twice.  When you look at that roster, what excites you about being a part of it, like the things how you can fit in?
ZHAIRE SMITH: They run in transition.  I feel I can be a part of that.  Ben Simmons, he can bring it up and make good passes.  I'm a good cutter, so he'll make me look good.
Q. What kind of conversations did you have with Brett Brown?  You said you worked out with the Sixers twice.  I was wondering what he might have said to you about coming to the team and what he might expect for you or what your role might be as a rookie?
ZHAIRE SMITH: He was just comparing me to Kawhi Leonard.  He said, "I really like your game."  It's just really interesting.  He was just curious.  He was like, "We're going to make something happen."  Apparently, he did.
Q. Why do you think the Kawhi Leonard comparisons were made, and why do you think Coach Brown felt you about that?
ZHAIRE SMITH: Probably because Kawhi in college he was like a 4 and he turned him into a wing.  I guess he looked forward to turning me into a shooting guard.  And he just liked me for defense, too.
Q. Do you want to get your own shoe line with Puma?
ZHAIRE SMITH: Yeah, they're making big moves.  If I can get my shoe line, I would like to.  Just look forward to being different.
