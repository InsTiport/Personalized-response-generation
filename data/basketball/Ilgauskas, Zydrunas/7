 Q.  Have you adapted to the circus that is the NBA Finals?  You guys have never been here before? 
 ZYDRUNAS ILGAUSKAS:  We're getting used to it.  It's a little strange obviously, all the attention and everything.  But when it comes down to it, it's still basketball. 
 Tomorrow we'll try to play the same game that we play every day.  It's just a little bit more intense, takes a little bit more of your time. 

 Q.  Can you talk about some of the difficulties that defending LeBron presents? 
 ZYDRUNAS ILGAUSKAS:  A lot of it, he's got the complete package.  Shooting the ball, moving to the post, great passer.  Like I said before, what we have to do is make the adjustments game by game. 

 Q.  Does he remind you at all of Anderson Varejao? 
 ZYDRUNAS ILGAUSKAS:  A little bit.  I think he's a little bit more offensive oriented than Anderson, but both guys are great NBA chargers and stuff like that. 

 Q.  Have you reflected on your career and all the pain you've gone through, the foot injuries, to finally be at this stage? 
 ZYDRUNAS ILGAUSKAS:  A little bit.  It sounded kind of final a few days ago, and now this is just another series.  Obviously it's The Finals and this stage is a lot bigger, but like I said, it's just basketball again. 
 None of us have been here before, but we're bound together and we'll take it one game at a time.
