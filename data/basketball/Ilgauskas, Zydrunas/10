   ZYDRUNAS ILGAUSKAS:  Obviously, like you said, we had an opportunity to win both and we came up empty handed.  We've got to forget about these two games.  They're gone.  We can't do anything about them.  They did what they were supposed to do with their home-court advantage.  Now it's up to us.  We have to win these next two games to give ourselves a chance. 

 Q.  Playing as close to them as you did and not getting a win, does that help the confidence or does it hurt the confidence? 
 ZYDRUNAS ILGAUSKAS:  It doesn't hurt.  This is a confident team.  You know, we've been through a lot this season.  More than anything, maybe after the game it makes it harder to digest because knowing how close we were.  Like last year, the first two games in the semifinals, we really didn't have a chance, so that was really a little bit easier to take than these ones because they were heart-breakers. 

 Q.  What do you have to do differently in the third quarter? 
 ZYDRUNAS ILGAUSKAS:  You know, it's always something, each game different.  It seems like we do come out flat after halftime.  We've tried to do different things, warmed up and everything as a team, but nothing seemed to work.  We do have to come out better at halftime.
