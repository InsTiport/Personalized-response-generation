  Q.  (Talk about last night's game.)   
 ZYDRUNAS ILGAUSKAS:  They got a lot of loose balls, got a lot of offensive rebounds.  We gave them second-chance opportunities, which for this team is lethal, and then they executed better than us.   
  
  Q.  (How tough is their defense?)   
 ZYDRUNAS ILGAUSKAS:  I mean, they're a good team and they proved it last night.  We thought we had some good looks, but even around the basket, it wasn't easy to finish.  They were contesting shots, so we didn't get a lot of easy looks.   
  
  Q.  (Does everybody on the team need to pick up the slack?)   
 ZYDRUNAS ILGAUSKAS:  Yeah, I mean, we all should pick it up.  You know, it's obvious that aside from the LeBron, we need to play better, and yesterday we didn't.  You know, it happens.  It's one game.  We're not looking too much into it other than we have to keep our confidence up and just hopefully we'll do better.   
  
  Q.  What do you think you've learned from that experience?   
 ZYDRUNAS ILGAUSKAS:  I think, like I said, executing.  We need to execute better.  They're so good defensively, if we don't move the ball and we don't make them move their bodies, they'll zone up on LeBron and we'll end up shooting contested jump shots all game long, and that's what they need, and that's what kept them rebounding.  We need to drive more to the basket, get in more foul trouble, make their bigs play defense.
