  Q. What happened and how do you adjust? What do you have to do different?   
 ZYDRUNAS ILGAUSKAS: They shot the ball extremely well. Their shots were amazing in the second half. In the third quarter, they came back in the game.   
 Just have to challenge. Have to push the ball and make the shots. Like I said, we have to make the shots.   
  
  Q. Is Game 2 a must-win for you guys?   
 ZYDRUNAS ILGAUSKAS: Sure. We will worry about Orlando on the road.  
  
  Q. What did you not do in the second half defensively that maybe you guys could work on?   
 ZYDRUNAS ILGAUSKAS: I don't know. We got to give them credit. They moved the ball extremely well, made penetration. Like I said, they were making good shots. When they do that, they are tough to guard.  
  
  Q. You said Howard is getting better every time he touches the ball, it seems like. You guys need to do a better job on him early on and not let him get those easy dunks?   
 ZYDRUNAS ILGAUSKAS: I have to do a better job. It starts with me. Sometimes we double team. We got to seize the opportunities. We messed it up. He was scratching the ball. It was crazy.   
 So really it was amazing. He played well. He made a lot of shots. There is not much you can do sometimes.   
  
  Q. How much of a mismatch problem does he pose? He contributed 24 to 29 points in the fourth quarter. Is he a nightmare just because of his size and length?   
 ZYDRUNAS ILGAUSKAS: He is a facilitator for them. We try -- we blitzed them throughout the game. We tried to take the ball out of his hands. There was, in the first quarter, some steals and then the offensive blitz and started finding open guys.   
 So, you know, if we can stop him, it will be to our advantage. It all starts with him.
