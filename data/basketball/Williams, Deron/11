 Q.  Was there one particular area of your game that you try to work on during the off season? 
 DERON WILLIAMS:  No, I was working -- I was trying to work on everything. 
 I just want to become a better all around player and just work on a lot of aspects of my game and try to improve and try to help my team. 

 Q.  Didn't you go out to Spokane and work with John Stockton? 
 DERON WILLIAMS:  Yeah, I went up there for about four days and worked out with John doing two-a-days with him.  It was a good four days for me. 

 Q.  What did you focus on when you worked with him? 
 DERON WILLIAMS:  He just gave me a lot of pointers.  We did a lot of pick-and-roll stuff, some shots he used to get out of the offense, because we ran the same offense.
