Q.   Can you talk about Linsanity. 
DERON WILLIAMS:   I think everything is just under a microscope now because of how things have taken off at every game.   I don't know, it was just a good win for our team.

Q.   Do you think he generally might be overrated? 
DERON WILLIAMS:   I'm not going to use that word.   I think he's had a solid ten games.   His story is amazing because you can say he would have been out of the league if he didn't play the way he did against us the first time, and his run has been great.   He had a rough game yesterday, as people do. 
So we'll see.   I'm sure he's going to have a long career ahead of him now, and he gets to write his own story.

Q.   You played with Jeremy Evans for a few months.   You knew before anybody‑‑
DERON WILLIAMS:   He should have been in the Dunk Contest last year, yeah.

Q.   How good is he of a leaper, and what stands out to you about him in the Dunk Contest?
DERON WILLIAMS:   Man, I don't know if I've seen anybody jump as high as him.   I think with him it's just going to be see what he can come up with, what kind of dunks he can come up with and see if he can make them.   He's my favorite right now.   I'm pulling for him.   If he needs me to come out and throw some lobs, I'm here for him.   I'm really happy for him.   He's a great kid and great athlete.
