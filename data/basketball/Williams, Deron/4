 Q. Talk about how it feels to be playing in your hometown. 
 DERON WILLIAMS: It feels great. I'm excited about my first All-Star game being in my home town of Dallas and my family being able to come out and support me and just hang out with them and just have a good week.

 Q. Have you been to a Cowboys game at the new stadium? 
 DERON WILLIAMS: I was. I was at the first game against the Giants. It's a great stadium. Scoreboard is ridiculous. I'm interested to see how it's going to feel to play in front of that many people and how many people are going to fit in the arena. 

 Q. (Inaudible). 
 DERON WILLIAMS: Who will be MVP? I don't know. I don't know. 

 Q. Are you getting pulled in all directions?
 DERON WILLIAMS: I haven't seen my family really. I haven't had a chance yet, but I will tonight, get to hang out with them a little bit. I've got a lot to do. I can't relax. It's a busy week for me. I won't get to see them as much as I'd like to, but it's good being home and having them come to the game and supporting me for my first one.
