   THE MODERATOR:  If you could talk briefly about your performance tonight.   
 DERON WILLIAMS:  I was nervous coming into the competition because all three of the guys had done the event before.  And I had to go first, too.  So that put a little bit of pressure on me.  I thought I had a decent run my first one, but I didn't know if I was going to get in until I saw D Wade make the mistake.   
 And the second round I didn't make any mistakes, and that's ultimately why I won.   
  
  Q.  Fitting that it comes down to you and Chris in the end?   
 DERON WILLIAMS:  Yeah, of course it had to.  It's a rivalry.  So we like to go against each other.   
  
  Q.  Does that settle it once and for all?   
 DERON WILLIAMS:  Oh, yeah (smiling).  No, I was just out there having fun.  It was just coincidence, I guess it was me and him that it went down to.   
  
  Q.  I saw you out in rehearsal earlier before the competition.  Was that the first time you had actually gone through it?   
 DERON WILLIAMS:  Yeah, besides I was in the PlayStation suite this morning playing "NBA '08," but other than that, it's the first time I played.   
  
  Q.  Did you have fear of getting stuck out there throwing the bounce pass five times without it going through?   
 DERON WILLIAMS:  Yeah, and that missing the shots.  Once I saw J Kidd go, I felt pretty good.   
  
  Q.  What were you and Chris talking about before you went out there for the finals?   
 DERON WILLIAMS:  He told me to go slow, and he was going to go fast and he was going to win (smiling).   
  
  Q.  What did you say after that?   
 DERON WILLIAMS:  "I can't do that."   
  
  Q.  $35,000, is it already spent?   
 DERON WILLIAMS:  No, no, no, I put that away somewhere for a rainy day.   
  
  Q.  How good does it feel to take something away from All-Star Weekend?   
 DERON WILLIAMS:  It feels good.  It's a special weekend to be part of.  Glad to be in New Orleans.  Glad the city's doing good.  Glad I could come down here and be part of the weekend and got a victory.  I'm a competitive guy, so I kind of did want the victory.  Even though it's about fun, I wanted to win so I'm happy about that.   
  
  Q.  Even though the game didn't exactly work out for you as far as getting in, have you felt like an All-Star this weekend coming down here, and the way you've been treated and everything?   
 DERON WILLIAMS:  Definitely.  I wish I could play in the game, but it didn't work out.  I've got many years to try to make it.  But I got invited by the NBA to be in the Skills Challenge.  It was an honor that they invited me, and I'm glad I came.
