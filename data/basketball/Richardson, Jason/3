		   JASON RICHARDSON: Rebounding. Playing defense, whatever it is. Just trying to score. Doing whatever we can.

 Q. Obviously it's not just scoring, but we know that at Portland, when you got the 40, it was just -- it opened up the floor for everybody. Do you feel a sense of pressure in that sense?
 JASON RICHARDSON: No pressure on me at all. I'm enjoying this. 
 I'm not putting pressure on anybody. I know I can go out there and play well when the team needs me to. And it's just a matter of when -- picking the spots.

 Q. Do you like going up against Kobe?
 JASON RICHARDSON: It's fun. It's great. He's the greatest player that played the game. Or he's right up there. 
 He's just one of those guys that just knows how to play the game. Very trough on the defensive team and a monster on the offensive end. Definitely fun playing against him.

 Q. Do you get into it more because it is him?
 JASON RICHARDSON: I'm into it no matter who is on the floor. Especially in the playoffs. I don't care who it is. I want to win the game. I know he's like that, the same way.
