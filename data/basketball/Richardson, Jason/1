		   JASON RICHARDSON: We're going to definitely come out, give it our all. 

 Q. The guys really supported each other. There's a chemistry here of support. That says a lot about this team. 
 JASON RICHARDSON: Oh, yeah, definitely. That's just the way this team is. No pointing fingers, no getting down on each other. It's just one of those things. 
 We watched what we did wrong, put that in our past, and we're looking forward to winning Game 6. 

 Q. You've come closer to winning there than they have here. 
 JASON RICHARDSON: We know we had a chance, opportunity, going overtime in the game. Still have to figure out a way not to get in big holes like we did yesterday. We were down by 18, down by 10 at one point. 
 We figured a way to keep maintaining it over the game, maintain at a level we have, we have an opportunity. It's important right now because we have to win a Game 6 to force a Game 7. 

 Q. You legitimately work together well. 
 JASON RICHARDSON: That's a team. We care about each other. We all just regular guys, we all be friends. I think that's the most important part of it. We get along off the court. We have off-the-court chemistry. You have that off the court, on the court, adversity, you support each other, try to win a game. 

 Q. Playing at home tomorrow night, the crowd, knowing what's on the line, your thoughts? 
 JASON RICHARDSON: It will be huge for us. We definitely are going to need their energy. We're going to have enough energy between the team. It's going to be crazy. We know how important this game is. We know if we don't win, our season over with. 
 So definitely go out there, give it our all, play hard.
