THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Vanderbilt.   
We'll go directly to questions.   
 Q.  How would you describe that game as a typical SEC game between two good defensive teams, perhaps?  
COACH BALCOMB: I don't know if we're two good defensive teams.  We play defense totally different.  It would be better if I probably didn't answer that.   
But, yeah, it's very physical.  To play that kind of physicality, after three days, we had just played Missouri, came home, turned around, we just had four straight wins.   
It was extremely physical.  We were really affected by it early.  I don't know if you call them charges or what they are, when they fall down, and then we were very hesitant to be aggressive on the offensive end.  It makes you afraid to play on offense.  It changes the game.   
 Q.  Minta and Rachel, could you talk about the physicality of the game.  
MINTA SPEARS: They were physical.  We knew that's probably what they were going to do since we played them a week and a half ago.  Especially since we played Georgia last night.   
Yeah, it was physical.  But at the same time we kept talking in timeouts to get open with our lower body, try not to use our upper body with the charges and things.   
Yeah, it was physical, but at the same time we have to look in the mirror and try to find ways to get open and find ways to make our offense work.   
RACHEL BELL: I agree with Minta.  Defensively we struggled getting open.  Coach was really emphasizing L cutting and getting our girl.  I thought we struggled with that tonight because they were really denying.   
It was really physical.  We tried to screen.  They would lock up on us.  They're a good team and we have to adjust.   
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.
