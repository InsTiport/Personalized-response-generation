		   KATIE DOUGLAS: We'll be trying to play to a high level. Really need to get ourselves mentally prepared. 
 I think they want to put a good product on the court and we want to try to match that product. You know, I think everybody's competitive nature is going to take over. Nobody wants to feel embarrassed or lose. 
 They're going to have a lot of things they're trying to do. We haven't had many practices this week. 

 Q. Is there a possibility for you to be picked up by the USA Basketball team? 
 KATIE DOUGLAS: I'm not sure. I have no idea. Maybe there's a possibility. But I think they have so many options in the pool that they have. There's 20 some of them out here. You know, there's not many slots open. 
 They have a great amount of talented people that they have involved. For us, it's important for us to give them a good run, get them prepared. I understand they're preparing for the World Championships, limited practice time, the time they're going to have together, not only this weekend but prior to the World Championships. 
 Just give them a good run and have a little bit of fun, too. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 KATIE DOUGLAS: Well, we're better-looking (laughter). I don't know. I'm not sure she's available for play. I'm not even sure who's playing now at guard. Very thin at guard. That scares me a little bit.
