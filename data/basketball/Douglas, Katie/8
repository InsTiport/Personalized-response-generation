Q. It looks like this took your team to another level confidence-wise.  Has that happened?
 
KATIE DOUGLAS:  I think so.  The night before we could have hit some shots and won the game, but unfortunately we weren't able to do that and they made the bigger shots the night before, and Brooke hitting that shot definitely gave us confidence that we can compete in this series. It's been tough for us playing without Lindsay, because we haven't had to do that all year.  But I think Brooke hitting that shot made us all believe that we're in this for the long haul, we're in this to win a championship.  
 
Q.  Are you worried about this crowd in this building? 
 
KATIE DOUGLAS:  I don't know, I just think it's great for women's professional basketball to come into this kind of atmosphere.  I think we do a great job at Mohegan Sun but we're anxious to see what the Sacramento Monarchs and their crowd can do out here as well.  
 
Q.  Does it help knowing you've already won here this year?
 
KATIE DOUGLAS:  I think so.  I think when we did play here they had a pretty good crowd, a pretty decent crowd.  So knowing that we can come in, we know that Sacramento did a great job of protecting their home floor this year.  And we were one of the few and fortunate teams to come out with a win here.  So we know it's going to be the same in the playoffs.  Like I said, when it comes to the concentration and the crowd, it's a lot higher in the playoffs, especially in the WNBA Finals.  So it's going to be a tough one tomorrow night.
