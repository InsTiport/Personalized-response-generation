<p>	Q. Camille, in the second half, the offensive rebounds, you just went right to the board, four baskets. Did you just find yourself in good positioning? </p>
<p>	Q. Can you talk about what you guys did against Jackie and how you were able to contain her a little bit?</p>

<p>	Q. Can you just talk about playing point guard for a long stretch in the second half?</p>

<p>	Q. Did you get the sense coming in to night that you were the uninvited house guest? </p>

<p>	Q. Katie, can you talk about your first half? I know you've had some slow first halves, but this one you just came bursting out? </p>
<p>	Q. How excited are you to advance to the championship game? </p>
<p>	Q. What does it say about your program and the enduring nature of your program, the assisting coaches that through all of the change and all of the stuff you've gone through, you are back in the championship game for the second time in three years? </p>
<p>	Q. It looked like Wright and Parks all the way on Jackie. Can you talk about that?</p>
<p>	Q. Were Wright and Parks your stoppers? </p>
<p>	Q. Is there a Big-10 style of play with the women as well as with the men, and did we see that tonight? </p>
<p>	Q. Can you talk about how Katie bounces back? She had the big turnover where she threw it cross-court, but then she comes back with a big 3 just minutes later, how she responds to that stuff?</p>
<p>	Q. Comment on Shalicia's defense tonight?</p>
<p>	Q. What did you see on film when you were watching Jackie Stiles, and what were you guys able to do that other teams were not?</p>
<p>	Q. Apparently the last time they lost before tonight, Northern Iowa used a jump defense on them. Did you consider that at all, or did you pretty much figure you were going to play the man with help?</p>
<p>	Q. Stopping Jackie was a big part of your game plan, but I don't think you could have expected her to not score the last 16 minutes and 40 seconds in the first half?</p>
<p>	Q. Just how excited are to you make it to the championship game? </p>
