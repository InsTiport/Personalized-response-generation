<p>	Q.  Can we talk a little bit about that first half run where you were hitting all those threes?  What the heck was going through your mind?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was just wondering defensively what you did to keep Wyoming out of sorts on their offensive end. </p>
<p>	Q.  Ricky, you get in that roll shooting free throws there.  How tough does it get after you've hit 12, 14, 16 in a row to keep focusing?  Do you just keep rolling or do you think, I'm due to miss one one of these days?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ricky, can you talk a little bit about Michael's run there early in the game?  You're out on the court; what do you think is going on when the other starters aren't scoring but yet everything and anything he puts up goes in?</p>
<p>	Q.  Michael, how do you feel about handling this burden that's been placed upon you to kind of lead this team the last month?</p>
<p>	Q.  Michael, this was a game, at least from those of us who were watching it, that just appeared to be very strange.  Your run early, starters not scoring until early into the second half, Ricky's situation going to the free throw line endlessly at the end of the game.  As you're playing this game did you get a sense that this was something real bizarre?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, did you use the altitude as any factor at all in your substitutions when you were rotating? </p>
<p>	Q.  Joel, can you talk about facing Andrew Bogut again?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ricky, at times late in the game you guys didn't look like you had a whole lot of composure, yet somehow you managed to hold it together.  Could you talk about how maybe this last three-week run of winning games and finding ways to win games played into that?</p>

<p>	Q.  Coach, same question basically that I asked Ricky and Michael about just the weird flow of this game.  Did you get a sense as you're coaching this thing just how up and down and sideways this whole game was going?</p>
<p>	Q.  Going off of something Ricky said about other people stepping up, if someone had told you that Odartey Blankson was only going to score five points, would you believe you would win this game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about facing the Utes and how to slow them down on the backboards when they're so good?</p>
<p>	Q.  Why were field goals so hard to come by today, other than Michael in the first half?</p>
<p>	Q.  The attendance at this tournament is down markedly since it moved to Denver.  Do you think this is a good venue for this tournament long-term or would you like to see a different site?</p>
