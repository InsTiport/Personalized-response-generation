<p>	Q.  For both players, could you explain what all of a sudden got this team going four minutes in the second half after 24 minutes of struggling play?</p>


<p>	Q.  Romel, you have had a couple tough days of late, especially after BYU.  Can you explain why you were able to get going tonight, why all of a sudden you kind of got it back going again?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you sense that they were getting a little frustrated as you guys started making this comeback and they started losing their composure a little bit?  And did it remind you guys a little of the San Diego State game there?</p>
<p>	Q.  Odartey, as a program you guys got some success in getting to the championship game.  Is it an odd feeling to not be there and how disappointing is that for you guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  For both players, do both of you still want to keep playing next week if you were invited to play in the NIT?</p>

<p>	Q.  Do you think the rest of your teammates feel the same way as you do right now?</p>

<p>	Q.  Lon, did you get the sense that these guys were ready to turn it around or were you hoping they would find a way to turn it around?  Did you see something that led you do believe --</p>
<p>	Q.  Lon, can you just tell me about the challenges Andrew Bogut presents defensively?</p>
<p>	Q.  You had Jerel together on the floor trying to get this thing all the way back.  What made you believe that was the best line-up at the time?  Ricky has been playing well.  You have had --</p>
<p>	Q.  Anything that Jerel did in particular that you were happy with?</p>

<p>	Q.  How happy were you to hear your players say they want to keep playing next week?  Do you believe you have done enough to be playing next week? </p>
<p>	Q.  What is your gut feeling?</p>
