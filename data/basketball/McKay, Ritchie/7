<p>	Q.  Danny, first off, what do you have to say to the NCAA tournament committee?</p>
<p>	Q.  You looked like you were on a mission the first half doing everything you could offensively.  They seemed to adjust, then you went to look for your teammates more in the second half.  Talk about that. </p>
<p>	Q.  Congratulations, guys.  David, talk about the defensive game plan against Bogut.  It seemed like there was no way they could get the ball into him. </p>
<p>	Q.  Danny, I wonder if you could go through what is going through your minds as you were stepping up for free throws late in the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Were you thinking about this Memphis game?  Did you see that today?</p>
<p>	Q.  Describe the big dunk.  Utah had the lead.  Describe that play and what it meant for a boost for you guys?</p>

<p>	Q.  Danny, if you could tell us a little bit what it feels like -- you've got the conference championship, the tournament MVP, and the automatic bid.  How does that feel together?</p>

<p>	Q.  Ritchie, when Marc got in foul trouble, you went without a point guard.  Are you able to do that just because Danny handles the ball so well?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ritchie, it's a long, long road for you.  I watched as the clock ran down.  You were just like we won any old game.  Could you talk about your feelings, reactions and the crowd you had here?</p>
<p>	Q.  You had your backs to the wall for six weeks basically here.  How did you keep the momentum going and just trying to be able to play every game as if it was a must-win game to get to this tournament. </p>
<p>	Q.  What is your reaction to getting the mystery out of this thing and not knowing if you guys were going to the tournament?  Were you still thinking today that you guys might have to win this thing?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, first of all, you guys have great fan support.  I've never been down to the Pit, but just the noise in here tonight, congratulations.  Also, you and your staff deserve a lot of credit.  You guys run a great offense.  I just want to know who was your mentor as far as coming up with your plays and stuff that you run?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is definitely getting ahead of it.  Last night you said you thought you deserved the bid.  Now that you have got it, given your hot streak, any doubt about what seed you think you ought to get?</p>
