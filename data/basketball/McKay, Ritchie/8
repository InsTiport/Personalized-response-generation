<p>	Q.  Alfred, in two games against SDSU this year, you played three games, in two you were 17 for and 20.  Tonight you had some clutch threes, four for six.  What happened tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  They went on a run to close it to within six, then you hit one three where you weighed your options and switched it.  Were they giving you too much room or did you see an opening?</p>
<p>	Q.  Alfred, when Danny is playing as well as he was tonight, how much better does he make the rest of you out on the floor?  Have you seen him step up his game to this level before?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did either one of you guys analyze your performance tonight?</p>

<p>	Q.  Danny, you beat these guys comfortably two times then you get up nine nothing right away tonight.  Were you at all surprised the way they came back given the talent they have?</p>

<p>	Q.  Can you guys talk about how they stayed in the game?  It seemed like Brandon Heath started doing his own thing.  He scored twelve straight.  Could you tell he was losing you guys?</p>

<p>	Q.  Danny, any thoughts on Utah at this point or just relieved to get past this one?</p>
<p>	Q.  Danny and Coach McKay, do you see any of Marcus Slaughter in your play?  Is it pretty much the same match-ups sizewise, reboundwise, is it close?  Do you guys play a similar game?</p>

<p>	Q.  Kind of along those lines, are you conscious of guys and their number of fouls?  Do you tell your players, Slaughter has got three right now, try to pick up the fourth foul?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, have you ever coached a team that was just -- I mean, I don't want to say reliant on one player, but obviously he has had such a huge effect on your winning and losing?</p>
<p>	Q.  It seemed like in passes at least, there were more bad passes and more bad shots.  Things I hadn't seen in a while.  Is that because of how disruptive they were?  Did you guys get overconfident after the early lead?</p>
<p>	Q.  I don't want to speak too soon, 25 and 3 with Granger in the line-up.  Another big win today following the win yesterday.  Is it just going to take a win tomorrow night?  Obviously a win will give it to you if you guys put up a fight.  Do you think that will be enough?</p>
