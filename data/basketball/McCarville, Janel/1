<p>	Q.  Lindsay and Janel, I realize this is a painful time right now, but is there a point where you're going to be able to appreciate what happened for Minnesota basketball this year? </p>

<p>	Q.  Lindsay, can you talk about the sequence and I don't know the exact timing of it, but late in the game you went on a drive and it appeared from the end we were sitting that you got hit a couple times.  Were you surprised there was no call and to what would you attribute that to? </p>
<p>	Q.  Janel and Lindsay, can you just talk about how you just refused to give up this whole time, this whole game, they go up by 7, 10, you come right back.  Talk about that. </p>

<p>	Q.  For both of you, it looked like they paid a lot of extra attention to everything you guys had been doing throughout this tournament.  Did you sense that they were really determined to not let you do what you had normally been doing? </p>
<p>	Q.  For the student-athletes, can you talk about Diana Taurasi's ability to lead her team not necessarily with scoring but what were some of the intangibles that you saw from your opponent tonight that maybe led them to victory?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is for Lindsay, just wanted to you kind of summarize your career now, being this is your farewell game. </p>

<p>	Q.  Coach, there were two sequences where you closed within two points and I think particularly that sequence where you closed within 58-55.  And there were three times you stopped them defensively.  Were you thinking, if we could just get the lead, we could at least shake them and maybe go on and win this game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about the defense that was played on Janel by Willnett Crockett, and Janel and Barbara Turner, what sort of defense did you see that you hadn't seen before on her?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about having the freshman on the court at in the Final Four like this and maybe the pros and cons of that, that happened tonight?</p>

<p>	Q.  Pam, when you got it down to 3 and then to 2 they made two big putback baskets, Turner and then I believe Crockett.  Can you just talk about the plays they made and the one when Turner made it, that's the one you had had to put Janel on the bench for a brief rest.  Will you second guess yourself on that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you also just comment briefly on Lindsay's contributions and how you move on now that she's gone. </p>
<p>	Q.  Geno talked about how he was highly complimentary about Minnesota and this is your first trip here, what can you do or what can this program do to sustain this kind of effort to get back here again, not just a one and done?</p>
