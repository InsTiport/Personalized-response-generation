<p>	Q.  Chuck, can you just describe what you guys were going through while you were waiting for the decision about Patrick's shot and what you thought during that time?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chuck, during the time you were waiting, what was that like?</p>
<p>	Q.  In the first overtime you got ahead by four and then that sequence when they got five offensive rebounds and Brown hits it three, how important was that to the outcome?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chuck, could you talk about the possessions at the start of the second overtime.  Maybe some guys were standing around.  What did you see?</p>
<p>	Q.  What happened at the end of the first overtime in not getting the shot off?  Did you get the ball too late?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chuck, can you just put in words the emotions that you are feeling now to play this kind of game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chuck, you had four fouls for a long time.  Was that sitting out and waiting to get your minutes back in, was that difficult?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about I think you were two for six today.  Can you talk about their defense, your involvement, that sort of thing?</p>
<p>	Q.  For people watching this game it will go down as just a fabulous, great NCAA tournament game.  Do you think in spite of your pain now in time you will be able to see it that way?</p>
<p>	Q.  When they turned it over the first two times to start the first overtime, did you sense they were discouraged and it was a chance to jump on them right there?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chuck, what impressed you the most about Michigan State?</p>

<p>	Q.  Coach, Shannon Brown has had a great game with a lot of 3-pointers.  He wasn't shooting that well coming in the game.  Was that a surprise?</p>
<p>	Q.  What was your sense when you were waiting for the three call?  Did you get a good look at it yourself?</p>
<p>	Q.  At the end off the first overtime when the ball was shot and went out of bounds, did you call a play or what were you looking for there?  Was Rondo going to create something?</p>
<p>	Q.  At the end of the first overtime?</p>
<p>	Q.  At one point in the second half, Michigan State was 15 of 18 from the field.  What did you see from their offense and your defense in the second half?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ramel Bradley stepped in when Rajon got in foul trouble.  Could you comment on his contribution then and if you know anything about his injury?</p>
<p>	Q.  Offensive rebounding was really crucial down the stretch for Michigan State.  Talk about that.  What was going on when the -- the sequence with three or four key offensive rebounds for them?</p>
<p>	Q.  About the collision.  You said it was a --</p>
<p>	Q.  Tubby, on that subject, from our side of court, could you see from your vantage point whether or not there was some contact when Sparks shot that three point shot?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you share what you are feeling about Chuck right now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Tubby, I know any loss is disappointing but just from the emotions standpoint and ups and downs and everything, is this the most disappointing tournament loss for you?</p>
