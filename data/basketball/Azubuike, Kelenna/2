<p>	Q.  Patrick, what does it feel like for you as somebody who grew up wanting to play here and not being able to start at Kentucky and then ending up there?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chuck, your coach just described Michigan State as tough and athletic.  Are those words that you would use to describe your team?</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you know about Michigan State and the way they like to push the pace and what kind of responsibility do you think that will put on you in tomorrow's game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chuck, you have a couple of freshman that you rely heavily upon.  Can you talk about their development and maybe if you guys have exceeded expectations considering how much you rely on the youth?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chuck, can you talk about your relationship with Coach Izzo and your impressions of him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Rajon, from what I understand you have some experience playing against Drew Knight.  Can you talk about what you know about him and what that experience was?</p>
<p>	Q.  Wisdom says that it is veteran guards that win these games?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chuck, can you talk a little bit specifically about the pangs that both Mississippi State and Kentucky took to reach this point, specifically looking at the last games where both teams use their depth to overcome a team that had a great player?</p>
<p>	Q.  Randolph, the three of you guys last night did a nice job on Bogut.  Could you talk about how your interior play may figure in to tomorrow's game as well?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chuck, how much does it come into play having played them as recently as last year?  Can you feed off that?  It has got to help a little bit to have knowledge of their players?</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you remember about last year's game against Michigan State?</p>
<p>	Q.  Maybe you can address what Chuck said.  Do you feel like a sophomore now?  What is the most difficult part about being a freshman in the NCAA?</p>
<p>	Q.  Patrick, Michigan State's defense last night did a pretty solid job on chasing Redick through screens.  Do you anticipate them being physical?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chuck, UK is defined like a lot of programs.  How much do you feel like your legacy is going to be defined by whether or not this team gets to the Final Four?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you comment on Chuck's play in the tournament?  It seems like in all three games you can pinpoint where he took over?</p>
<p>	Q.  Patrick, with each game that goes by, do you guys feel more and more pressure to do this for Chuck since he is a senior that is leaving?</p>

<p>	Q.  Tubby, I am wondering how important do you think the pace of the game will be tomorrow?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, I am wondering if you could talk about your philosophy on sharing the ball.  Sort of what are the values or virtues in spreading the minutes around.  And the challenges if they have come up in getting across to your players why they won't be having superstar minutes?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would you talk in general about how important basketball is for the state of Kentucky and how that makes your job pleasurable or difficult?</p>
<p>	Q.  You alluded to it a minute ago that Michigan State is more experienced than you guys.  Can you talk about what that means at this stage of the year and also what your freshman have missed at this point?</p>
<p>	Q.  How far they have come?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible.) </p>
<p>	Q.  Yesterday up here Kelenna was teasing Chuck that you have adopted him like a son over his four years here.  What has he meant to this program over the past four years he has been here?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does he epitomize your team, Tubby?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just wanted to ask you a little bit about what Chuck alluded to, the similarities of these teams.  Is that a coincidence to you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you see something in Sparks the second time around that you didn't see when he was in high school?  Was he better than you thought originally?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible?)</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked earlier about the responsibility coaches and players show at Kentucky in maintaining the tradition.  Did that process turn into being more difficult?  Have there been moments and times where you felt that personally?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, when Michigan State beat Kentucky in the regional finals back in '99, it was a landmark win for their program and for coaches.  Do you have specific memories of that game that you would be willing to share?</p>
<p>	Q.  In Your three games to the NCAA tournament you are shooting over 50 percent offensively.  What are you doing different through the conference tournament?</p>
<p>	Q.  With two teams as deep as ya'll are, is it going to be important to pay attention to what is going on on the court to select the right people for the floor?</p>
<p>	Q.  When was the last time you started a freshman point guard?  Also, have you had to adjust in terms of having a freshman at point guard, the expectations and the way you handle that kind of situation?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Izzo spoke the other day about the respect he has for you and Coach K. Can you talk about the respect you have for Coach Izzo and where he has taken the program in the last ten years?</p>
<p>	Q.  20 to 30 years ago, compared to now, when you look at the Michigan State team you are facing tomorrow, you are seeing a team that is deep seven, eight, nine players.  Did you find yourself game planning against teams who are more superstars, where you actually guard one or two people more for example, Bill Walton?  21 and 22 instead of a team like this where they are equal?</p>
