DREAM  Â– 84
  STORM - 87

 Q. Can you talk about your game plan coming in? 
 IZIANE CASTRO MARQUES: That's how we beat a lot of teams with this defense, that's how we got here, so just trying to fight from the beginning of the game, that's all. 

 Q. So you like the pace better? Why were you able to pick up the pace after game one? You were almost 20 points below the season average scoringwise but better tonight. Why? 
 IZIANE CASTRO MARQUES: I think everybody was just focusing on leaving early and looking out ahead, rebounding and run, that's our game plan all the time. The other team stops us from doing that, and tonight anytime anybody got a rebound we were saying "push the ball" and we were fortunate in doing that. 

 Q. Izzy, what happened to your nose in the first quarter? 
 IZIANE CASTRO MARQUES: I think Tanisha got her hand on my nose, and I broke my nose a month and a half ago, so now I have the doctor see if it's okay. 

 Q. Going back home now down 2-0, can you speak to what you're going to have to do down there to climb back into it? 
 IZIANE CASTRO MARQUES: We got confidence going home that we can win, a 2-point game, 3-point game, so we think we can have the win at home with offense and the advantage for us. 
 Just focusing on winning the third game, of course it's crucial for us, but we're confident we can do at home. Just have a few things to adjust and the game could go either way, both games that we played here, so there it would be a different scenario.

 Q. You guys had a few more turnovers tonight than you did in game one. Can you talk about what was happening that was different or were you guys just not executing as well? 
 IZIANE CASTRO MARQUES: They play an excellent defense, so I think especially like the first five minutes -- and we just have to be more focused on what we are doing in the moment, because (away from microphone), but we were able to bounce back, and that's important, and you just have to watch the tape and see what we did wrong to correct for the next game.
