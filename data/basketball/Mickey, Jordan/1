  JORDAN MICKEY:   Being drafted by the Celtics is a great honor.   That's a winning franchise.   They've always done a great job at it, and it's a dream come true just being drafted today, to hear my name being called and walk across that stage and receive this hat.   
   
 Q.   You have great physical attributes.   Will those attributes help you guard LeBron James and Kevin Durant?  
JORDAN MICKEY:   Definitely.   I feel like my attributes translate to the NBA and they will help me guard these type of players; LeBron James being 6'9" and Kevin Durant being 6'10".   So I feel like I have the length and athleticism to guard those guys.  
   
 Q.   How do you see yourself fitting within Brad Stevens' system?  
JORDAN MICKEY:   I see myself fitting in well get up‑and‑down a little bit half court and run a play and get what they want.  
   
 Q.   What kind of familiarity do you have with the current players on the team or anybody on the coaching staff?  
JORDAN MICKEY:   Jared Sullinger I watched him work out a few times at Ohio State, actually when he was going through the pre‑draft process.   Guys just got drafted, Terry Rozier, I've been through quite a few workouts with him.   We talked a little bit.   R.J. Hunter, I don't know him too much, but definitely good friends with Marcus Smart.   He's another Dallas guy.   I played against him quite a bit.   So those guys I know.  
   
 Q.   What kind of relationship do you have with Marcus?   
JORDAN MICKEY:   I'd say we're pretty close.   Definitely when we see each other we always talk a lot, laugh.   So I feel we have a pretty good relationship.
