 Q.  Kyle, kind of like dÃ©jÃ -vu all over again for you guys, up here four times in this building, 110 points you guys have lost by in those four games.  What's the difference between here and at home where you've defeated them four times?  
KYLE LOWRY: I don't know.  They play extremely well here.  Tonight Kevin Love got it going early.  Kyrie got it going early.  LeBron did what he usually does.  But we've got to take one of them out of the game.  They can't all have 23-plus points.  Kevin started the game -- he only played 23 minutes and had 25 points.  They went to him early and got him going early.  They played very well here.  They protect home, and they've protected home all year.   
 Q.  DeMar, for you, did they do anything defensively to shut you down tonight?  
DeMAR DeROZAN: No, no, we just didn't get in a rhythm.  We didn't have a rhythm all game.  We were kind of stagnant.  We had 18 turnovers.  That's 18 opportunities that we could have had to at least run something that we've been running the last couple games.  But we turned it [over].   
Like I said, we just didn't get in a rhythm with things.   
 Q.  DeMar, Coach Lue talked a lot about defending you differently, whether it was going over screens, under screens, blitzing, things like that.  Did that impact you at all?  I know you did a lot of work from the line tonight, but your midrange game was obviously night and day compared to Game 4.  
DeMAR DeROZAN: I only took eight shots.  A couple of the shots came late in the game when we were down.  I didn't come out aggressive like I wanted to.  I just got to be more aggressive early on and understand that no matter how they play me, just go out there, be aggressive, get shots up.  Eight shots throughout the whole game, that's not me.   
 Q.  You have an opportunity to even the series, but even if you do, you still have to come back here for Game 7.  What's the mindset of the team knowing that?  
DeMAR DeROZAN: We're going home.  We play great at home.  We've got to take it one game at a time.  We'll figure that out once we get past Friday.
