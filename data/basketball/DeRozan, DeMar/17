 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DEMAR DEROZAN:   I remember so many.   I remember Jordan, where they had the jersey ‑‑ I was so young, but I just remember that ‑‑ I remember so many of them.   Since I was like five on up, I've been watching every All‑Star Weekend.  
   
 Q.   Do you remember what you were doing and where you were when you found out you were going to play in this game?  
DEMAR DEROZAN:   I was in an airplane heading to Denver, getting off the plane.   That's when I found out.  
   
 Q.   Who told you?  
DEMAR DEROZAN:   They already did the announcement, so on TNT.   So we were getting off the plane an hour after they announced it.   
   
 Q.   And you were acting so cool?  
DEMAR DEROZAN:   Yeah, I was acting more cool.   My teammates and everything were really excited.   But it was a cool thing.   I definitely wanted to soak it in.   
   
 Q.   After the break, is there anything about your game that you want to change?   Any aspect of it?  
DEMAR DEROZAN:   Not really.   Just gain experience.   It just definitely helps you being apart of this game, being an All‑Star.   There's only a few selected to be there.   So I think that it just helps the overall confidence.   
   
 Q.   What does it mean that the coaches picked you as one of the elite players at the position in your conference?  
DEMAR DEROZAN:   It's a great honor.   I can't say how much that means.   
To have NBA coaches acknowledge that you are NBA All‑Star definitely means a lot.   It's definitely an honor, and I'm very thankful for it.
