<p>	Q.  Are you willing to concede that maybe you're more reloading than rebuilding at this point?</p>
<p>	Q.  Justin, the front line has kind of been a question mark and tonight you proved there really is not a question mark, did you see a particular responsibility tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  It seemed like there was a stretch where the inside game lost a little passion and then you got it back towards the end of the game.  Did you feel that way? </p>
<p>	Q.  And where do you see the team right now?  Do you think you're better than everybody thought? </p>
<p>	Q.  Have you gotten a chance to think about Kansas/North Carolina and what you think about the matchups? </p>
<p>	Q.  What do you remember about that game last year the most?</p>
<p>	Q.  It been written that if you could add anyone to your schedule it would be Florida.  Why are you so keen on that matchup? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think care at all what your perception might be nationally in terms of what you've accomplished as a coach, where you're at as a coach? </p>
<p>	Q.  There's a guy out there, Jimmy Bayhan (ph) has had great success and yet some people still say he's not faced a National Championship.  Do you face that on the West Coast?</p>
<p>	Q.  About all of the success and not having grabbed the brass ring?</p>
<p>	Q.  What has four straight wins done for your confidence? </p>
<p>	Q.  With that pressure taken off of you, how do you look forward to the championship game, no pressure, or how do you feel right now? </p>
<p>	Q.  You guys sat on the bench the last time, how does that feel to come out here and be a big contributor in the Garden? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you feel particularly juiced when you first stepped on the floor? </p>
