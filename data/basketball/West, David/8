 Q.   What's the mood of the team after there was such a big win last night?   
DAVID WEST:   We still have to‑‑ it's important for us to go out and try to get a win on the road.   Obviously, we've got to just take care of the basketball and try to put together a good game.  
   
 Q.   Paul George is a great talent, but that fourth quarter last night was his best quarter of basketball ever.   What did that do for you guys?   
DAVID WEST:   I just thought he was very aggressive, and he bailed us out a bunch.   He made some really good plays for us, and he carried us.   We needed some big shots, not just to get the attempt up, but he made them.   He got us out of a tough jam.  
   
 Q.   What carry‑over does that have to Game 6?   
DAVID WEST:   I thought the way we matched up, it worked to our benefit, putting him on the point guard and disrupting him.   Him being able to be a roamer a little bit, get his hands active and get out of the break, I thought really got him engaged and got him going.  
   
 Q.   Anything about your team's approach to this game that's changed at all?   
DAVID WEST:   It's the same.   We've just got to get one win.   We get one win, our season keeps going.
