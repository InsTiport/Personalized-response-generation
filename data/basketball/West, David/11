 Q.   [No microphone] in previous years.   Why do you think that you're more equipped to handle that this year than in previous years?   
DAVID WEST:   Just I'm familiar with who they are, familiar with their roster and their guys, familiar with their system.   We've dealt with their adjustments in the past over the last couple of seasons.   
So we just‑‑ we're confidence in who we are more so than them.   We're just confident in what we can do and our ability to guard them and to align our defense to get key stops in key moments.
