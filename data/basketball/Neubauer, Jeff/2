George Washington 78, Fordham 72
Q. What made Zeigler so difficult to deal with on the offensive boards?
JEFF NEUBAUER: Yeah, so first of all, I mean, he's big and strong.  He's an experienced player.  So when you get a guy like that that's an older player with the length and athleticism that he has, he's really tough.  He also made some really good driving moves where he drove hard right and spun back to his left.  Those are difficult it guard.
Q. You seemed to do a pretty good job on Yuta tonight.  What was your game plan to contain him?
JEFF NEUBAUER: Well, last Wednesday night, he had his career high against us, and most of those points that he got last Wednesday, were in transition.  So we really made a point of emphasis to try to just not let him get opportunities in transition, and we did a much better job.
Q. And finally, any reflections or words on the season as a whole?
JEFF NEUBAUER: Yeah, our guys kept battling until the end.  So there at the end, we literally had four guys left and our guys were fighting the whole way and that's what we asked him to do.  So we certainly are proud of our effort.
