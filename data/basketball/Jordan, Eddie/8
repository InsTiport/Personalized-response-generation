   EDDIE JORDAN:  I just told Kobe what a heck of a predicament, I lose by 30 and follow him at the press conference. 

 Q.  Make a brief comment about tonight's game. 
 EDDIE JORDAN:  I thought the West was a little bit more energetic than we were.  We knew going in that their size was going to be a factor.  We didn't get back in transition well enough. 
 We thought we would have to win with the tempo and the open floor and we just didn't quite get that.  We turned the ball over and couldn't get back on defense and they kind of built the momentum. 

 Q.  Do you think that the NBA could consider maybe Las Vegas being a permanent destination? 
 EDDIE JORDAN:  For the All-Star Game?  If not a permanent, maybe just to rotate it in every three years or so.  But, again, I always say the Commissioner is a bright man, he's a Rutgers grad, like I am. 

 Q.  How is it to downshift in the next 24 hours and now gear up for these next 32 games? 
 EDDIE JORDAN:  The comfort level and the comfort zone is going to be welcomed.  To get back home and get come out with a game plan, talk about your own players.  We had a great ending to the first half.  Coming here we beat Philly at Philly, with all of our bench guys coming in and contributing. 
 We feel really, really good about ourselves, and just the comfort level of coming back home should be a little bit of a spark for us, at least myself and Gil and Caron.
