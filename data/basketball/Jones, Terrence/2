Q.   A few words on your rookie season so far. 
TERRENCE JONES:   Sophomore season, it's been real good.   Just learning a lot from all my veteran players and my coaching staff, and this has been just helping me get better.

Q.   You came out, six players going in the first round.   How was that?
TERRENCE JONES:   It was good.   I mean, I just was excited to be here and excited to make it to this league.   And I just wanted to make sure when I got here I worked on my game every day to make sure I could do everything I could to get myself ready to help my team in every possible way.

Q.   You're a starting power forward on a team that's going to the playoffs.   How excited are you for that?
TERRENCE JONES:   I'm really excited.   Right now we're rolling.   We just got our seventh win in a row, so happy for us. 
Right now and everybody's playing so well and everybody's healthy.   It's just exciting just to see other guys on your team do well and just to share these moments.   It's been great.

Q.   What's been the key to your success?
TERRENCE JONES:   I think just the way everybody's playing together and just feeding off each other.   And whoever has the hot hand that night, we have just been going through them. 
And just everybody being happy for everyone, for one another.   So when they're scoring and getting it going.
