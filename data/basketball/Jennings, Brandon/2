   BRANDON JENNINGS: It's a great feeling. All the hard work that I put in paid off, so you've just got to keep it going for the rest of the season.

 Q. Talk about the game tonight. 
 BRANDON JENNINGS: You know, we're always going to play to win the game. I think we're quicker. They might be a little bigger, but I think we're going to try to quick the ball tonight and just run them out. 

 Q. We've heard a lot on the internet. (Inaudible). 
 BRANDON JENNINGS: If it presents itself, it depends on how it first comes up. If my shot is falling, then I'm going to shoot the ball. But if it's not, I'm just going to beat the assist record. I think it's 17. I know I can beat 17. I'm going to try to get 20 or 25.
