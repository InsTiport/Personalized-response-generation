		  JAY BILAS:   Thanks, Rick.   Our next coach is the head coach of Chaminade, Eric Bovaird.   Had a chance to watch Eric's team practice yesterday.   An outstanding coach.   Team is very well drilled.   Number of players back.   They play hard and they'll be a tremendous challenge in every game that they play here at the Maui Invitational.   Eric.
    COACH BOVAIRD:   Yeah, obviously this event is huge for Chaminade University.   Our players look forward to it.   When the schedule comes out and the tournament comes out, we all get together, and it's so exciting to see the bracket and finally meet all these coaches I've looked up to for a long time. 
    We're really looking forward‑‑ I'm watching Texas on tape, trying to figure out how can we play with them. 
    UNIDENTIFIED COACH:   I can tell you.
    COACH BOVAIRD:   I will take your advice.   I appreciate that.   KemperLesnik does a great job putting this event on, and we're just so happy to be part of it.
