		  JIMMY DYKES:   To my left is Eric Bovaird.   He's the head coach of Chaminade University in his third year.   They upset Texas last year in the EA Sports Maui Invitational.   They play a brand of basketball at their level that is very similar to what Minnesota likes to do and Arkansas.   They come at you.   They pressure you and they get after you.   Sometimes in this field he has to scale that back a little bit because of the size of athletes that he's up against, but he's an excellent coach. 
He led Chaminade last year to the 2013 Pac West championship game.   Prior to being at Chaminade he was an assistant at West Liberty, and they hung a lot of points on folks.   He's an assistant there for seven years.   I feel like he has probably one of the better Chaminade teams I've had in the seven years I've been out here.   So Eric Bovaird and Chaminade will tipoff Monday.   Coach, give us a few words.
COACH BOVAIRD:   Yeah, you'd think after three years of being here that I'd remember to bring my sun glasses.   We're always facing the sun.   But I see Coach Few and Coach Pitino are the only smart ones out of the group. 
No, I'm really happy with our team this year.   It's a great honor to play against the level of competition we're about to play.   These teams have the ability to definitely expose some weaknesses.   Our ultimate goal is to win and to get to the Division II National Championship and win that.   This is a great, great opportunity for our guys to learn about ourselves and it really helps us throughout the season.   Last year's win versus Texas was huge.   Not many Division II programs get the opportunity to lead Sportscenter, so hopefully we'll be on there again this year maybe.
