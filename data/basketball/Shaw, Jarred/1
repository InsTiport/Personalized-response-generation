THE MODERATOR:   We're joined by Utah State.   Coach, if you could make a few opening remarks about today's game. 
COACH MORRILL:   Well, obviously it was quite a comedown from last night's game, disappointing.   But San Diego State just takes you out of everything you're trying to do.   At least they took us out of everything we were trying to do. 
They're able to switch almost every screen.   Their quickness, their athleticism can be overwhelming, and it was today. 
We had a lot of shots, open shots, that we often make, and we couldn't get them to go.   I thought, you know, there wasn't enough open shots because their defense was just so outstanding. 
Their offense was an awfully good portion of the game, it was good for them, as well.   So give them all the credit. 
THE MODERATOR:   We'll take questions for the student‑athletes. 

Q.   Spencer, out in the perimeter, you guys were struggling to hit it from deep.   What was San Diego State doing?
SPENCER BUTTERFIELD:   I think we got some really good looks right in the beginning.   They just weren't going down.   I think some of our confidence wasn't there.   We maybe lost some confidence, I'm not sure.   Shots we usually hit, they just weren't going down. 
You got to credit their defense.   They were really long and athletic.   That can make you change your shot.   So you've got to give them the credit for that. 

Q.   Earlier in the season you played them into an overtime game.   What was the difference in today's game? 
JARRED SHAW:   I think the difference in the game then was our defense mentality was tougher.   We were knocking down shots that we normally knock down.   We just played a good game.   We were up to play them. 
Today it was kind of like we weren't up.   We didn't make shots that we normally make.   We just give credit to their defense.   They played really good. 

Q.   This San Diego State team today, how would you rank them against any opponent you've played all season long? 
SPENCER BUTTERFIELD:   They're probably the best we've played against all season long.   You can just tell by the score.   I don't think we've been even close to being beaten that much. 
JARRED SHAW:   I agree.   Between them and New Mexico, I think they're the better team.   They're tougher to defend.   Their defense is more active.   Yeah, I think they're better. 

Q.   Spencer, could you talk about the start of the game.   How demoralizing or frustrating was that? 
SPENCER BUTTERFIELD:   Yeah, I think it was definitely frustrating especially because they were good looks.   It's not like they were really contested.   Felt like we got really good looks there in the beginning.   Just sometimes it doesn't go your way. 
There's really not much else to say.   We usually hit those shots.   It definitely affects you.   But you got to be able to be mentally tough and overcome that and we didn't do that today. 

Q.   Jarred, there's been some games where you've been able to weather the storm and come back, but not today. 
JARRED SHAW:   With that type of team, you can't dig yourself a hole.   It will be hard to get back in.   We dug ourselves a deep, deep hole.   We couldn't make shots, so that couldn't help us get back in the game.   We had some defensive slippage, so that would have made it harder to get back in the game. 
You just can't dig yourself a hole against an opponent like that. 

Q.   Thames hit some three‑pointers at the end of the half.   What effect do you think that had going into halftime?
SPENCER BUTTERFIELD:   Yeah, I definitely think Thames played great, especially at the end of the half right there.   It was still within striking range, I felt like.   Him hitting the threes, especially at the end of the shot clock, it definitely can affect you.   It went from a 12‑point lead to a 21‑point lead just like that. 
You have to credit him for knocking those shots down.   We should have been in there a little bit more so he didn't have those looks, but you have to credit him for hitting them. 
THE MODERATOR:   We'll continue with questions for coach. 

Q.   You've been around a long time, seen a lot of teams.   What kind of damage do you think San Diego State can do in the tournament?   How far can defense like that carry you?
COACH MORRILL:   Well, their offense was, like I said, really good tonight, too.   I think they can go quite a ways.   If they play that well offensively, to go with unbelievable defense, I mean, that's one of the better defensive teams I've seen in a long time. 
And the great thing about them right now is they seem to be totally unselfish.   They're all about just playing good basketball.   There's not a lot of guys looking for their own.   They all understand their roles.   That's a credit to Coach Fisher. 
I mean, they're a very impressive basketball team.   I wish them nothing but the best.   Obviously tough to get thumped like that your last game, but they totally dominated us. 

Q.   Do you feel maybe the finish of last night's game, the emotion and everything tied into that, maybe fatigued your team today?
COACH MORRILL:   No, no.   I think that's just looking for something that isn't there.   I mean, it was a quick turnaround.   You're playing again in 19 hours. 
But San Diego State was what determined everything.   I mean, they just locked us down, played exceptionally well. 
We were excited to play.   We were looking forward to it.   As well as it went for us last night was as bad as it went today. 

Q.   Now that conference play and tournament are in the books, can you compare the overall level of play and talent in the Mountain West to the two leagues you've been in before. 
COACH MORRILL:   Yeah, I mean, the thing that's a little bit hard is the WAC was ever in flux.   There were teams coming and going.   When we first got in the WAC from the Big West, the WAC was rated equal to the Mountain West.   I think they were both 9, 10 in the country, a very good league.   The WAC got progressively worse as teams left, I guess you would say. 
It's a tremendous jump when you jump one time from one league.   We did that from the Big West to the WAC.   Then you take the next jump, I mean, that's been an interesting journey.   The Mountain West, the venues, the talent level, I mean, it's a huge jump.   I think you're talking about a league that's underrated across the country. 
I mean, I knew what I was getting into from the old WAC days way back when.   I knew the challenges that were going to be there.   But I've been away from it long enough that it kind of slapped me in the face.   It kind of did that to me this year. 

Q.   A couple years ago you were able to go into the CIT.   Any talk of that post‑season?
COACH MORRILL:   Our guys, going into this year with five seniors and everything...   It was our first year in the Mountain West.   We were probably a little naÃ¯ve.   Their intent was to get back to the NCAA tournament.   Obviously we were a ways away from that. 
I think when you look at three different things, when you look at our fan base, they're not overly excited.   We didn't get a great response last time.   Our administration is not overly excited about it.   Our players aren't overly excited about it right now. 
I would say the CIT is probably unlikely.   Doesn't make a lot of sense given those three circumstances.   I've said before, I always like to think you should go play if somebody asks you to.   But given those three different facets in our program, I don't think it makes sense this year. 
We're probably assuming a lot to even think we'd be asked.   I mean, we finished eighth.   We just got beat by 35.   I mean, who the hell are we to think we might go to post‑season?   That should have been the first thing I should have said.   That's assuming a lot that someone would ask us to continue to play.   We don't ever want to snub our nose at anything. 
But given those circumstances, if someone did ask, I think it would be the CIT, and I think it would be unlikely. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, coach.
