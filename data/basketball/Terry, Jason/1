  JASON TERRY:   Every guy today that came through this building understands that.   Again, we will play better than we played last night.

Q.   You've played a lot of basketball.   How surprised are you just to be in this situation, considering how well you played in Oakland?
    JASON TERRY:   Well, it's surprising.   Again, we lost two tough games in Oakland, and last night was just bad.   That really wasn't the Houston Rockets.   Again, we must play better and we will play better tomorrow. 

Q.   Can you put your finger on what caused it? 
    JASON TERRY:   Well, we have to move the ball offensively, and defensively we have to stay in possessions and play it all the way out.   I mean, there was a couple times where they made three or four passes and we quit on the fourth pass.   The Golden State team never quits, never stops moving, never stops passing the ball, and so you always have to be guarding them.

Q.   You mentioned that was not who you guys feel you are.   Last night Dwight said we can't go out like that.   How much of it tomorrow is just about sort of regaining pride and showing who you‑‑
    JASON TERRY:   Oh, the rest of the series is about pride.   It's about coming out and establishing that you are a tough team, and we've been doing that throughout this postseason.   There's no doubt in my mind that will be the case tomorrow night.

Q.   I know you can't win four games in one night, but do you have to tune out the noise about no one has ever done‑‑
    JASON TERRY:   That was the same thing last series where we just took it one game at a time.   I hate to use clichÃ©, but that's what it is, and that's how we're looking at it.

Q.   Dwight says everyone has to remain positive, but is everyone positive?
    JASON TERRY:   Yeah, everybody I seen come through these doors today were positive.   Again, you have another opportunity.   When there are no more opportunities, then you can kind of throw the towel in, and okay, it's over.   But it's not over, man, until they win four games or we win four, and again, our job is just to win one to keep this thing going.

Q.   In the Dallas series Rick Carlisle said when they were down three, at some point an NBA team is going to come back from 3‑0.   Why do you think this team could be that one?
    JASON TERRY:   Well, again, we can't even think along those lines.   It's just one game.   One game.   And if we can get that win, then we can talk about the next one.   But until then, our focus is solely on playing much better than we did in Game 3. 

Q.   You took it personal last night for what Steph did‑‑
    JASON TERRY:   Oh, what he's done all series, I'm taking it personal.   With that said, I have to have controlled aggression playing defense on him.   I'll see what happens, but that passive, lay back and wait for him to do whatever he wants to do, that's over with.

Q.   So that's the key, being more aggressive?
    JASON TERRY:   Well, that's the key for me.   Whether that works or not, we'll see.   But that's the approach I'm going to take, and we'll see if it works out.
