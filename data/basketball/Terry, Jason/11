 Q. (Indiscernible).
 JASON TERRY: We're going to see what happens. We're excited. We're very thankful for being in this position. It's a blessing. Why not enjoy it? 

 Q. You talked about what it means to come back here over the last five years. Now that you're able to do it, does it make it any better? 
 JASON TERRY: We love being on the road. To be able to start on the road in a situation of this magnitude, it's very fine for us. We have a veteran group here. Going in on the road, it's not new to us. We love the atmosphere, the environment, and we just look forward to Game 1. 

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 JASON TERRY: It really is. For us, right now, the journey we're on, the mission we're on, it doesn't feel like anything more than what it is. I think it's important we continue to keep that mind frame and come out really focused in on Game 1. It's a very important game for us. 

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 JASON TERRY: I think it comes from your veteran leadership. Guys realizing that the opportunity is now, guys realizing that this opportunity doesn't come very often. The team we put together this season has been a special group. We felt that from day one. 

 Q. You and Dirk have been the longest tenured veterans for the team coming together. A piece here, a piece there, how have those pieces worked? 
 JASON TERRY: This year it's worked obviously because you have Jason Kidd spearheading the whole thing. Tyson Chandler, what he means to this team is tremendous on the court, vocal in the locker room. His leadership has really been key for us.
