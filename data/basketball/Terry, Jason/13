 Q.  Is there one thing about this team that makes you most proud? 
 JASON TERRY:  Just our desire and our will to win.  And then when we face adversity, whether it's a 10 or 15 point deficit or whether we just lost the game, we come back with fierce emotion and energy, and we leave it on the line every night. 

 Q.  Does being one of the greatest teams, record-wise, mean anything, or do you have to win a championship? 
 JASON TERRY:  It definitely would be nice, but winning a championship is all that matters at the end of the day. 
 You can go 82-0, and then get out to a 2-0 lead, and don't finish, it doesn't mean anything. 

 Q.  That's why your motto is finish this year? 
 JASON TERRY:  Yes, sir, our motto is finish this year, and hopefully we can get it done. 

 Q.  How often do you think about last year's finals? 
 JASON TERRY:  I think early in the season -- I think earlier on in the season we thought about last summer, and that's what got us off to somewhat of a slow start. 
 But I think we put that in the back of our head now, and we're just going out focused every night.
