 Q.  The NBA really takes over a town when it comes in for this weekend, doesn't it? 
 RANDY FOYE:  You're right.  You see guys on billboards everywhere.  Some guys on billboards that they don't even know about.  It's crazy. 
 Like you said, we take over the town for the couple of days that we're here, and it's good to see that.  And it's good to see that because that's NBA basketball the way it's supposed to be. 

 Q.  Can you grasp the concept of how big it is for the NBA to have the game in this city? 
 RANDY FOYE:  I think it's big for the city, just for the city to see how big basketball really is.  And I think for them not having an NBA team here, and for the NBA playing an All-Star Game here.  It's special for the city, period. 

 Q.  Can you talk about starting now?  Did you expect it? 
 RANDY FOYE:  I was happy with my role.  I was playing my role and just doing what I could do.  And we struggled a little bit, so the coach said the team needed a change and put me in, and we're 2-0 right now.  But everybody has just been helping me out, trying to make the adjustment, trying to make the transition easy for me.
