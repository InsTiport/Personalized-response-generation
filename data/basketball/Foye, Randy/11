<p>	Q.  Coach, third night, third straight night you played gut-wrenching tough games.  In the second half, did you get the sense that maybe the gas tank was on E? </p>
<p>	Q.  Follow up on that, that's why it was so important for you to get out there quick, a quick start to the game. </p>
<p>	Q.  Started this week under .500.  Postseason is out.  It looks pretty likely you'll make the NIT.  How does that feel?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel if you had the whole team together longer than you did, you would have made a little (inaudible) more easily?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Jason's play a little.  You'll go on and play now.  These games are good building blocks for you to play. </p>
<p>	Q.  Jason, can you just address what the Coach was just talking about as far as stepping up at this tournament now and how it will help you and the team grow. </p>
<p>	Q.  The confidence that you had last night, did that carry over into tonight?  It seemed like you were playing with the same kind of purpose you did last night. </p>
<p>	Q.  This is for either or for both of the players.  Obviously, you're disappointed you lost a game tonight.  Can you talk about moving on, playing?  The NIT is a tournament you guys could do some damage in. </p>
