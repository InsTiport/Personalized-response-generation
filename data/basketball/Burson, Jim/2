<p>	Q.  What are the indications from the feedback of the APR? </p>
<p>	Q.  Wondering if you are monitoring the situations with steroids in baseball, Major League Baseball, and now it looks like it might become an issue in professional football, if you're monitoring that, and confident in where the NCAA stands with regard to being aggressive in that approach. </p>
<p>	Q.  Have you had a chance since you've been here to walk into the Edward Jones Dome where the Final Four will be played?  If so, how do you score it compared to other venues on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the best? </p>
<p>	Q.  Last year at San Antonio I asked you about the floor for the APR.  You responded with a 50% would be too low for some schools and too high for other schools.  Now that the initial floor has been proposed at 50%, what kind of response are you getting along those lines? </p>
<p>	Q.  The center for science and public interest and other groups have called on the NCAA to stop running beer ads because of their supposed effect on drinking at colleges.  Can you respond to that and talk about the NCAA's relationship with Anheuser-Busch? </p>
<p>	Q.  What are your personal feelings about colleges that allow beer sales and sometimes other alcohol in their own campus events? </p>
<p>	Q.  We've come through a college football season with the recruiting policies in place.  What is your sense on how those worked and is there scheduled meetings for that task force to reexamine and tweak those measures to further address those issues? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you anticipate anything coming out of Monday's meeting with the College Basketball Partnership that would impact next season? </p>
<p>	Q.  Would any rule changes that might come about or policy changes that might impact like, for instance, the exempt situation with the two and four, I know it's gone to the management council for further review, but things of that nature? </p>
<p>	Q.  What, if anything, do you anticipate coming out of Monday's meeting that would impact the game in the future? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about how exciting the Elite 8 games were, the regional final games.  Do you anticipate the same excitement for this weekend?  Got some great teams and some great student-athletes and hopefully some good basketball on tap for fans across the nation. </p>
<p>	Q.  If you can keep your fan's hat on here, you've just done what a lot of people have done for the last several days, and that's kind of celebrate what college basketball has gone through.  Does the fan in you wish for the same thing in college football?  Do you think college football gets the same hit from its post-season that college basketball does? </p>
<p>	Q.  Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski has been on TV during the post-season.  Other coaches have done that in seasons past.  I'm curious if people are talking to you about whether that constitutes an unfair recruiting advantage, something on your radar, something you've been discussing with other people? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you approve of colleges allowing alcohol sales at athletic events on campus?  Should the NCAA even be involved in the matter? </p>
<p>	Q.  An APR follow-up.  With the transfer rule, are you comfortable that, for other than basketball, football and hockey, ice hockey, kids can transfer, and that can facilitate and skew some of the numbers.  I know you could have a one for two, but that will lower -- put you closer to the threshold.  Does that need to be looked at? </p>

<p>	Q.  Jim, of the proposals that you have on the table with the management council, which issue is most pressing to the NABC?  Realistically, what are your chances of getting change implemented on that issue? </p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously the three-point shot was a tremendous part of the excitement of last week's games.  I hear more and more coaches ready to see it back at the international distance.  How strong is that consensus among the coaches?  How quickly would you like to see legislative change there, if that consensus is as strong as it seems to be? </p>
<p>	Q.  About the academic progress rates.  Coach Sampson, your team did fine.  Well above the 927 cutoff.  Coach Purnell and Kennedy, you were all below that, but still not within the conference boundary from the NCAA.  What was your reaction to getting those scores?  What does it mean?  Is it going to change anything about what you're doing now or how you recruit in the future? </p>



<p>	Q.  At high school All-Star games this time of year, NBA people can have full access to guys who sign with colleges, and colleges have more limited access to those players.  Can you talk about whether or not that's something that is going to be addressed in some of your proposed legislation. </p>
<p>	Q.  What is the thought process behind penalizing schools for athletes that turn pro early?  Is the point you prefer those athletes don't come to college at all or do you expect them to not graduate?  You expect them to turn down pro contracts and graduate?  Why is there a penalizing component to that? </p>
<p>	Q.  What do the coaches feel about that? </p>

<p>	Q.  When you see these transfers taking place now, with the advent of the APR, is it a deterrent for a coach to look at these transfers knowing what kind of impact it could or could not have on that? </p>

<p>	Q.  Did your organization support the notion of the minimum age requirement for the NBA? </p>
<p>	Q.  The suggestion that's out there, the -- no, I don't know anything you don't know. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Sampson, I don't know if you're aware of this, but the NCAA is asking all schools that have Native American mascots to prepare a report by May 1st, justifying why they should have those mascots, including your alma mater.  Given your background, I was curious what you thought about that? </p>
