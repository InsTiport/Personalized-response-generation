<p>	Q.  Tell me about this team, what you expect with all of your starters returning and most of your scoring returning as well?</p>
<p>	Q.  Turnovers were an issue for your team last year.  Do you think you are going to be sure --</p>
<p>	Q.  What did you guys learn from last year because obviously talent was there you bring it all back this year.  What can make the difference in having the type of season you guys want to have as opposed to what you had last year? </p>

<p>	Q.  Talk about -- I know you had a crazy year with turnover of players last year, and just talk about how difficult that was and then how much, you know, different it's going to be this year with just players that you can count on being there? </p>
<p>	Q.  You guys talked about just getting that consistency on the court.  What did you guys do this summer as captains to kind of get the team together and maybe kind of gel a little bit?</p>

<p>	Q.  It is easier to motivate a team that you feel is being overlooked?</p>
<p>	Q.  I guess if the players could talk about this.  What about the chemistry between you two, as guard and post player, you guys have played with each other for a while now.  I think when Missouri works is when things are working with you two because you both can be effective scoring both from outside and inside, and obviously LaToya penetrating too.  Talk about that.  And, Cindy, can you talk about that chemistry between those two? </p>


<p>	Q.  What about depth?  You guys have five starters coming back, but how much depth do you feel you have and how important will that be for this team?</p>
