<p>	Q.  LaToya, could you talk about how tough their defense can be? </p>
<p>	Q.  Christelle, you guys are going to be coming back next year.  Can you talk about what your expectations are going to be for Missouri?  Put the season into perspective a bit. </p>
<p>	Q.  Christelle, Coach Stein mentioned Baylor can be a handful.  Can you talk about their inside players, particularly Blackmon and Young, how dither to face inside there? </p>
<p>	Q.  LaToya, I'll ask you about a specific play again.  Hopefully you remember this.  The very first basket of the game that you had, you seemed pretty excited about that one.  It was a put-back, then you got fouled.  Can you talk about that at all at the beginning of the game how you guys started off? </p>
<p>	Q.  LaToya, I wonder if you would talk about that stretch during which Baylor (inaudible) went up. </p>
<p>	Q.  LaToya and Christelle, could you talk about the time when you, right after the half, you got within 10 of them, what do you think motivated you or helped you to come out strong like that? </p>

<p>	Q.  LaToya, this has been a frustrating season for you guys in a lot of ways.  What have you learned from this season and what can you apply to make next season a little better? </p>

<p>	Q.  Is it hard to face Baylor when you went know which other player is going to be the one to step up that day? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about, LaToya mentioned early in the season your team might not have reacted well in pressure situations, but the last part of the season how well they've changed, the growth they've made. </p>
<p>	Q.  I wonder if you'd address that stretch of the first half when Baylor changed the momentum of the game. </p>
<p>	Q.  Maybe discuss the pressure they put on you defensively.  Seemed like every position passed the ball so well. </p>
<p>	Q.  Y'all did get it back to 10 there in the second half.  At that point, the way y'all had worked to get it back, did you feel like you were kind of back in the game, had a chance right there? </p>
<p>	Q.  If you could continue on that.  If I remember the sequence of plays right, you're within 10, then the point guard turns it over trying to pass inside.  Is that the next step your team has to take, where you have leadership on court to know when you have to make that next big play? </p>
<p>	Q.  They say in the Big-12 everybody knows everything about everybody.  Do you have enough of a scouting report to know what LaToya Wyatt could do or would do?  Are there so many other things you're worried about, you don't get that far down? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about your decision to leave LaToya in the game with four fouls. </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you sort of give your assessment on Baylor's potential as a Final Four team.  How would you rate them with the other ones that have gone to the Final Four? </p>
