<p>	Q.  Rick, this is for you.  I just had a  question about Andre Miller's development at Utah and how big -- obviously, he was huge the other day.  How big a part of your success has he been?</p>

<p>	Q.  This is for Rick and then for Bill.  In playing a team -- playing with a team, coaching a team that doesn't have a -- a big name star, a guy who's going to give you 25 points a night, is it easier to get other guys to step up, to really pick up their games?  And also, for Bill, is it tougher to defend a team like that than it is, maybe, to defend a team where you have a couple of guys or you have one guy and he's going to score most of the points? </p>

<p>	Q.  You get part A, Rick.</p>

<p>	Q.  Is it easier to coach a team or is it as fun to coach a team that you don't have a dominant player?</p>

<p>	Q.  Bill, could you just talk a little bit about Ed Cota, your impression of him as a person, the stuff he's been through in his life, how he's  handled that sort of things and then, Rick, if you wouldn't mind, just talk about that match up and a little bit of him as a player?</p>

<p>	Q.  Rick, if you could talk about that match up at all.</p>

<p>	Q.  Question for Coach Guthridge and, after he's done, I've got a question for Coach Majerus. Bill, Shammond Williams what he's been this year as far as his play and leadership and also what you remember his semi-final performance last year at the Final Four?</p>

<p>	Q.  Rick, I was wondering, like, at half time of a game or during the season, is there is particular statistic that you look at as for as your  all's team that you look at as a key, like, at half time at games, is there one statistic that you go to on the stat sheet?</p>

<p>	Q.  I wondering if both coaches can just address what it's been like and what it is like for them personally this week to be in the Final Four as a head coach for the first time and especially Coach Guthridge who has been there so many times with Dean Smith, what's the biggest difference and what's been the best difference and the most difficult difference?</p>

<p>	Q.  Hi.  I wonder if you guys can both talk in your preparation you've both been in this situation before as assistants coming to the Final Four.  What was that like and, also, when you look back, what was the situation that when you guys were preparing as assistant coaches, a dues-paying kind of experience that you had that, you know, you  were trying to be a head coach ones of these days and you're looking to it, but what's one thing as a dues-paying experience that you remember.</p>



<p>	Q.  Rick, you made mention the schools like Carolina and Duke being there and you're having that ultimate respect.  I'm just wondering if both you guys could talk about why you think that schools like Carolina and Kentucky and a handful of other ones always seem to compete at the highest level, either at the Final Four or competing to get to it.</p>


<p>	Q.  Rick, there has been a lot of talk this week about your "triangle and two" and how well it worked in Arizona.  What do you think of that type of defense in this type of match up or what do you think just, specifically, about their inside players, how can you try to counter team.</p>

<p>	Q.  Coach, just wondering if you could go back to '77, your first encounter with North Carolina, and give us a little progression with your relationship with the program over the years and, also, I heard coach George Carl gave you a couple of tips on how to beat Arizona and I was wondering if you could tell us.</p>

<p>	Q.  Hello.  I would appreciate it if you both would address this:   Just looking at it, you've got four coaches who are going to the Final Four for the first time as head coaches.  How much of a factor might that play once the games get going and did that get negated by the fact that experienced guys got beat in the regional finals.</p>



<p>	Q.  Coach Guthridge -- and I also have a question for Coach Majerus -- Coach Guthridge, what was it like being an assistant in the early years at  North Carolina and, also -- this is for both of you coaches -- what problems does each team present for the other?</p>


<p>	Q.  What problems does Carolina present Utah?</p>

<p>	Q.  Question for Coach Guthridge and Majerus. Coach Guthridge, you've made a point in year talking about this team being Dean Smith's offenses and defenses and stuff.  There do seem to be some changes in this year's team under you as opposed to last year, particularly players being allowed a wider degree of personal expression on the court and on the bench.  I wonder if you would comment on that.  And I wonder if Coach Majerus would comment on what changes he sees this year as UNC's team as opposed to previous year's teams.</p>


<p>	Q.  Hi, Rick.  I was wondering if you would talk a little about the about the reaction from Utah since you've gotten back from Anaheim and, also, in connection with that, any unique experiences you've had as far as people's reactions or maybe things they've done for you or you've seen?</p>
