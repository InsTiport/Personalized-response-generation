<p>	Q.  Duke has broken through in the upper elite status, for the growth of the women's game, what might other schools, teams need to do to make the kind of breakthrough that Duke has had?  </p>
<p>	Q.  A two-part question.  One are you more comfortable as a coach?  Is it your comfort zone to be coaching a team from the underdog roll and if every team is an underdog who is the favorite to win?</p>
<p>	Q.  Comfortable in coaching a team as the underdog doing?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about how the win over Tennessee in 1999, what kind of impact that had on your program and how has your program grown since that win?</p>
<p>	Q.  Alana, for those of us who don't cover your team regularly, I'm sure you have answered this question 100 times, can you just kind of take us back to high school and your recruitment and kind of what happened.  I understand there was a tape involved.  What happened with that?  And Tennessee especially since that is who you are going to play?</p>
<p>	Q.  There has been a lot of talk in the Tennessee camp how thinks changed since that meeting early in the season, how do you think your team has changed since that game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Mistie Bass won a starter job with you about 5 or 6 games in the season.  10 games she was replaced in the starting lineup and she had a broken nose, can you discuss her revolution as a player during the course of a season?</p>
<p>	Q.  I would like to ask both players, last year so much of the Final Four, I don't know if there this is true or not, everything that's involved with coming to a Final Four, I'm wondering this year does the team seem more calmer or businesslike since you were just here last year?</p>

<p>	Q.  Both of you ladies are All Americans and both of you have the ability to take over a game at some point but you both try to share the ball, what is it in your mind during the game that clicks and says, hey, I need to step up, do something different and stronger for the team instead of passing all the time. </p>

<p>	Q.  Alana, in talking to your mom, it sounds like you grew up in a household where the girls beat the boys.  Women's basketball is on TV a lot.  Do you think that gives you a unique experience and makes you more appreciative of the Final Four?  And can you still beat up your mom. </p>





<p>	Q.  Gail, I think from what I am picking up the last couple of days, the reason people think Tennessee may be the favorite is their rebounding power, is that your biggest concern going into tomorrow?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, your offensive output has decreased in the post season compared to the regular season, what do you attribute that to and how much are you concerned about that?</p>
<p>	Q.  You can talk about your feel for the predetermined sites in the first and second round as you head into the tournament and now that you look back over what came out of it, what is your feel for it now?</p>
<p>	Q.  My question is the to the players, do you or your team have any superstitions that you do before the game. </p>
<p>	Q.  Alana, some of your emotional moments from your first two years has been well documented, did you have to teach yourself not to be so hard on yourself when you made mistakes and has that been an important part of your development?</p>
<p>	Q.  What did you think of the shooting background out there, and is it going to take some time to get used to?</p>

<p>	Q.  I wanted to ask the players this.  I see you on TV and everything when you are doing your commercials and stuff, and I see you all are very close, how does that contribute on to the court?</p>
<p>	Q.  Alana, in that Duke/Tennessee game in '99 who were you pulling for and did you cry at the end of that one?</p>
<p>	Q.  Gail, Kara Lawson mentioned they took the bus down here, it seems like a conference game because of the proximity, and the Tennessee fans travel quite well, are you expecting this to feel tomorrow as kind of being a Tennessee home away from home?  </p>
<p>	Q.  This is for either one of the players, a great story together about Winter and what she has gone through, and I wonder if either one of the players can address that, and what is has been like since you got to Atlanta?</p>


<p>	Q.  Alana, have you been good at heeding your coaches' request that you not put in extra work away from practice or have you snuck out on your own and done some extra work?  </p>
