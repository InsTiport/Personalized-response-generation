<p>	Q. Lindsey, how good does it feel to be so productive offensively in such a big game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you tell me if this team can be beaten, if you guys play like you did tonight, seven guys in double figures, spreading the ball around like you did? </p>






<p>	Q.  How much importance is attached to Game 5?  Usually Game 5 is what decides a Final, you know, seven-game series, how much importance can you attach to it now? </p>
