 Q.   How was practice this morning in Miami?   
MARIO CHALMERS:   Practice was good.   We talked about some good things and getting ready for the next game.  
   
 Q.   Is there a level of discouragement?   
MARIO CHALMERS:   No, not at all.   We're not discouraged at all.   Actually more motivation to be the first team to come back from 3â€‘1 and win a championship.  
   
 Q.   Is there a level of discouragement with the fact that it's unbelievable how many shots they're hitting?   I mean, contested, uncontested, they're knocking down 58% the last two games?   
MARIO CHALMERS:   Yeah, they're knocking down everything.   But for us, we've just got to stay with it, figure out some changes and be ready for the next game.  
   
 Q.   Is there anything that you guys think you can do to slow down their passing?   
MARIO CHALMERS:   Try to be a step ahead of them.   That is the best thing for us to do.   But it's so tough with those guys, but we're going to try.  
   
 Q.   Have you at all given any thought to the fact that after free agency, this could be one of your last games in Miami?   
MARIO CHALMERS:   I don't think about that at all.
