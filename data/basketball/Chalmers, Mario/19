  MARIO CHALMERS:   We're enjoying it.   We've been able to relax, not necessarily relax but get our actual rest, get ready for the next day when the schedule is like it is.  
   
 Q.   When it comes down to the wire, who do you pass the ball to?  
MARIO CHALMERS:   I'd rather not pass the ball to anybody, but I'd probably put the ball in the hands of D Wade, one of the best finishers in the league.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
MARIO CHALMERS:   I'd say it's a contest, you've got a time limit, got 60 seconds to shoot 20 shots.   I think that would be more difficult than an emergency.
