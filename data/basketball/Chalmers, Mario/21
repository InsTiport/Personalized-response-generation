 Q. (Indiscernible).
 MARIO CHALMERS: Yes, it was a good game. Both teams played hard. They beat us and we'll come back for Game 5. 

 Q. You're tied 2-2 right now. What's the main message from Coach right now? 
 MARIO CHALMERS: We're tied. Nobody is up, nobody is down. Go out there and play the same game. 

 Q. Your confidence level again is up there. It's as high as ever. Can you talk about how you develop that. 
 MARIO CHALMERS: You have to give all you got. I've been waiting for this moment ever since I was a kid. I want to make the most of this opportunity and do whatever I can to help the team win. 

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 MARIO CHALMERS: Just being here, I want to make the most of my opportunity and do whatever I can do to help my team win. 

 Q. The pick-and-rolls, only 17 points, what do you guys have to do to get better? 
 MARIO CHALMERS: Be more open on the pick-and-rolls. I think we're going to work on some things today against their pick-and-roll defense and see where our spots are open. 

 Q. Cutting down the turnovers, is it a matter of effort or concentration? 
 MARIO CHALMERS: A little bit of both. Their defense is pretty good. We have to stop jumping in the air and wait for somebody to pass to. I think that would be the main thing to cut down on the turnovers.
