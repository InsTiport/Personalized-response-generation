Q.   Do you feel a little more relaxed?   Do you feel it's closer for you?   Give me context how this series differs from last? 
MARIO CHALMERS:   It's a lot less physical.   I'll say that.   I feel like Eastern Conference basketball is a lot more physical than Western Conference basketball.   When you go against teams like Chicago or Indiana, they're two physical teams.   When you face a team like San Antonio, it's not as physical.   That's the difference. 
The thing about San Antonio they think the game.   They are precision on everything.   They are not going to make too many mistakes.   They're a wellâ€‘coached team. 

Q.   Is it harder to lose Game 1 and you have to wait two or three days. 
MARIO CHALMERS:   Yeah, it's definitely hard, especially after a loss like Game 1 that we had.   I'm anxious and my teammates are anxious to get back in the court.   The thing about it is we have to be patient.   We know we have to wait.   Tomorrow is a showdown and we have to bring our "A" game. 

Q.   What do you expect of Game 2? 
MARIO CHALMERS:   Similar to Game 1, but I think both teams will be more precise.   We got the feel for each other now.   Game 1 is out the way.   So it's going to be a different type of game.
