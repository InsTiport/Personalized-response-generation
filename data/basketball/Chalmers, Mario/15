 Q.   How would you assess the game last night?  
MARIO CHALMERS:   We played a good game.   We've just got to tweak some things.   I think our main focus is just to get back on defense, cut down on transition points.  
   
 Q.   Talk about defending Westbrook.   What do you have to do?   
MARIO CHALMERS:   Keep him out of the paint.   Any time he gets a lot of lay‑ups and free throws the jumpers are going to start falling.   We've got to do a better job of that.  
   
 Q.   Dwyane talked about this being a feel‑out game.   What are your thoughts on that?   
MARIO CHALMERS:   It was a feel‑out game.   It's great that we got this first game under our belt, and now we know what we've got to do and have a great game.  
   
 Q.   You fell behind in the last series and came back and won.   What do you think you learned from that that can help you in this series?  
MARIO CHALMERS:   Just never quit.   Even when we get down, we can't get down on ourselves, we've got to keep playing our game, keep our focus and keep our intensity.
