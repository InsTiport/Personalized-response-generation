 Q. Not being able to close out games. The second half of fourth quarters, how have you guys been able to change what was happening earlier in the season? 
 MARIO CHALMERS: Just focus in later. Let our defense step it up late and be our offense. 

 Q. Is there something in their defense you guys felt you could exploit? 
 MARIO CHALMERS: Any time a team goes to the zone, you know you have an open look. Yesterday we were knocking them down. 

 Q. On the other side of that, did you guys work on the zone offense? 
 MARIO CHALMERS: Not today. We didn't. We talked about key points we can do. 

 Q. Is there anything magical happening here? You guys haven't lost here during the playoffs? 
 MARIO CHALMERS: Our fans. I think it's our fans. They come out every night supporting us, cheering us loud and providing us with that extra energy. 

 Q. Can you talk about the confidence you have to take shots. 
 MARIO CHALMERS: It's good. It shows my teammates trust me. I want them to keep trusting me, keep working on that shot and keep trying to knock it down.
