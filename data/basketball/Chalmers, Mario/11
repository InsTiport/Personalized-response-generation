  MARIO CHALMERS:   Yeah, it feels good.   We still have to take care of business tomorrow.   Tomorrow is a big game for us.   We're going to treat that like the last game, and it could be the last game.   We're just going to go out there and play hard. 

Q.   I know the guys have been giving you a hard time.   What kind of love did they give you yesterday after that game? 
MARIO CHALMERS:   It wasn't really after the game.   There was a lot during shootaround.   They gave me a lot of love.   They always have encouraging words.   Any time I hear encouraging words after struggling like I have been, it gives you an extra boost of confidence.

Q.   What was it like when LeBron went down? 
MARIO CHALMERS:   At first we didn't know what it was, if it was his ankle or his knee, but to find out it was cramps, it's not a good thing but it's not a bad thing.   We just wanted to step up for him, for our team, and we were able to do that.
