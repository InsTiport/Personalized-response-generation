 Q.   Does it make the prep leading up to the game easier, do you think?  
MARIO CHALMERS:   Yeah, it makes it a little bit easier.   We know what it takes to get here, and we know what we've got to do.  
   
 Q.   What are the preparations like?  
MARIO CHALMERS:   Don't let the pressure get to you, just relax, play our game, make sure we take our time doing our things.  
   
 Q.   You guys are in a rare position now where you're considered an underdog.   Do you guys care about that?  
MARIO CHALMERS:   No, we really don't care about that.   At the same time we're not worried about that.   We like being the underdog in a series like this.   It gives us the edge, it gives us the mental ability to keep fighting.   
   
 Q.   Talk about Russell.   You guys have had success against him the last two years.   
MARIO CHALMERS:   Just make sure he doesn't get easy looks.   You never know what he's going to do.   He can do anything at any given moment.   Our main focus is just to keep him off the paint.
