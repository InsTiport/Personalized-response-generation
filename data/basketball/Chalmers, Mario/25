  Q. What are your feelings about getting drafted?  
 MARIO CHALMERS: It's great to be drafted and finally have my dream true and be in the NBA.  
  
  Q. What's better, hitting the game-winning shot or being drafted in the NBA?  
 MARIO CHALMERS: Right now, it's a tough decision, but I'd definitely have to say being drafted in the NBA. It's a dream come true.   
  
  Q. You were one of the leaders of a very experienced college team, a very tight-knit group of guys, and what are you going to bring to your new NBA team which is kind of a young team, trying to still feel its way out; not just what you do on the court, but your leadership role?  
 MARIO CHALMERS: Just try to provide leadership and try and come in there and learn my role and see what the coaches like and just go out there and give it my all every day.   
  
  Q. Can you just talk about watching Brandon and Darrell waiting for so long, what was it like watching them getting drafted in the first round?  
 MARIO CHALMERS: It was a long wait for me and it was a great accomplishment. We all made our decision and talking about going into the first round together and congratulations to them two for making it, and I just have to make the best of my opportunity.
