  MARIO CHALMERS:   Our main focus is to get prepared for Game 2.   Go out there and play the best of our ability and get the win. 

Q.   Does it help your confidence the fact that you guys never been beaten back‑to‑back‑‑
MARIO CHALMERS:   I don't think our confidence is shaken.   It's something that is in the back of our minds.   Nothing is said and done until you go out there and play. 

Q.   Can you just talk a little bit about your feelings on the game last night?   What you guys are going to do going into Game 2? 
MARIO CHALMERS:   I think we did a good job last night until the fourth quarter.   Fourth quarter is when we have to push even more.   Leave it all out there on the court and get the win. 

Q.   (Indiscernible). 
MARIO CHALMERS:   Apply more pressure.   Stop letting them switch to the other side of the paint.   Try to contain them as much as we can and keep them out of transition.
