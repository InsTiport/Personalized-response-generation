Q.   (Indiscernible)?
MARIO CHALMERS:   Was a light day of practice.   Just went over some adjustments we will make for Game 2.   Didn't really do too much. 

Q.   So you could have played last night, had the opportunity come up? 
MARIO CHALMERS:   Yeah, I could have played last night.   I felt well enough to play. 

Q.   Are you going to be a game‑day decision?   Or are you declaring yourself healthy enough? 
MARIO CHALMERS:   Right now I'm saying I'm going to play.   But when I wake up in the morning and see how I feel‑‑ more than likely I'll be ready to play. 

Q.   What's the injury? 
MARIO CHALMERS:   Just a bruised shoulder.   Deep bruise in the shoulder.   My left shoulder.   Certain movements.   I have to keep working on it.   Keep putting treatment on it. 

Q.   How will it affect you? 
MARIO CHALMERS:   I don't know.   That's a good question.   Maybe dribbling.   Maybe shooting, squaring my shoulders up.   I just have to find a way to make it work. 

Q.   How did it happen?   A screen, was it? 
MARIO CHALMERS:   Yes, a screen. 

Q.   Was it West? 
MARIO CHALMERS:   Yes, David West.   David West screen.
