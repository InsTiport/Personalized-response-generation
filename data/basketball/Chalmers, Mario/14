Q. What did you learn in Games 1 and 2 that can help you in Game 3?
MARIO CHALMERS:   We've got to stay on the attack at all times, make sure we get back on defense.   When we get back on defense, it takes a lot of their transition, a lot of their points away.

Q.   What has Coach told you about being aggressive?
MARIO CHALMERS:   You know, he just tells me to look for my shot more, be more aggressive, pick my spots better, and try and do what I can for the team.

Q.   Defensively do you think having Norris in the game helps trying to guard Westbrook?
MARIO CHALMERS:   I think so.   (Indiscernible).   It takes away from their offense.

Q.   Who do you think is you guys' biggest post threat, do you think Chris Bosh or LeBron?
MARIO CHALMERS:   Actually both of those guys.   We'll go with either one.

Q.   You're probably on the scouting report a little more than you were last year, they're closing out on you a little bit more, and they're not going to let you get to the rim as much as in previous years.   Is that an adjustment for you?
MARIO CHALMERS:   It's an adjustment.   I've just got to keep watching film and see how they're playing me.
