 Q. When you're on the floor, is your sense (Indiscernible). 
 MARIO CHALMERS: I don't know where I was, to be honest. Just one second left on the clock. I tried to get a shot up. 

 Q. Did you watch a replay? 
 MARIO CHALMERS: I seen a replay. It was kind of hard to see. They kind of had it cut off. 

 Q. LeBron taking a step back or a back seat in the fourth quarter, is it more than that? Is it being more of a teammate? 
 MARIO CHALMERS: I think so. Usually when -- he's always been the guy to take over the fourth. This time he and D-Wade are sharing the responsibility along with Chris Bosh and the other players out there. 

 Q. It's easier said than done when you're used to being the man so much? 
 MARIO CHALMERS: I mean, it might be. LeBron is the type of guy he's going to take whatever it takes to win. That's what he's doing right now. 

 Q. You guys have some really great moments, and other moments where you've tweeted, "I have to get back to doing my job." How do you account for your confidence throughout the playoffs?
 MARIO CHALMERS: Just trying to have no letdowns. You never know when you're going to have this moment again. 

 Q. Criticism from Dwyane Wade, is that tough to take sometimes? Seems like he never holds back. 
 MARIO CHALMERS: It's never tough to take. Giving me constructive criticism. It's not like what they are telling me won't help me out. It's all positive things. 

 Q. You usually have this look on your face like, all right, all right. 
 MARIO CHALMERS: Once they keep saying -- I got to get it. I love my teammates, and they're doing a good job helping me out.
