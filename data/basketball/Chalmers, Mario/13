Q.   Was that a nice break there in Game 2 that you had a big lead and (Inaudible)?
MARIO CHALMERS:   You know, it's a good moment for us.   We kept fighting.   It was a good way to come back and get the victory.

Q.   How much did you learn from last year's Finals to this year's Finals, just about the process?
MARIO CHALMERS:   We learned a lot.   Going through last year's Finals, it was my first experience ever being there, trying to feel it out and seeing what it takes to win.   This year we're very confident.   We feel good about the situation, and we'll keep playing.

Q.   Does it get easier because you know what to expect and how it's going to go?
MARIO CHALMERS:   I wouldn't say it's easier, but you've just been through it before, so you kind of know what it takes and what you've got to do.

Q.   Seems like with every outcome in a series like this, in the public and in the media, it'll swing one way or the other.   How do you ride out those waves? 
MARIO CHALMERS:   I don't pay attention to it.   We know what we've got to do.   We know we've got to go out there and play every game no matter what circumstances it is.   Just got to do that.
