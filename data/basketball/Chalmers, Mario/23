  Q. Do you feel you have less pressure coming off the bench and hitting big shots?   
 MARIO CHALMERS: I wouldn't say less pressure. You still have to go out there and perform. You have those three guys on the team, you have to go out and perform and help the team. You can't be focused just on those three.   
  
  Q. How would you define your role on this team?   
 MARIO CHALMERS: Trying to keep the team going and get defensive stops.   
  
  Q. Mario, what was the discussion in the locker room after the loss the last game?   
 MARIO CHALMERS: It was a tough loss. We know that we had a 15-point lead, we had that game in our hands and we let it slide away. People was disappointed. At the same time we know we can't dwell on it. We have to get ready for Game 3.   
  
  Q. Do you feel fortunate, when you look at your own career, how you slipped into the second round, but you wound up going into a situation where here you are playing on a winning team very early in your career? Do you sort of think along those lines, you could have went to maybe a team that's still struggling and in the lottery?   
 MARIO CHALMERS: I don't think that at all. Everything happens for a reason. Everything is in God's control. He took care of it.   
 So I wasn't really worried about it.  
  
  Q. Spoelstra said he never lost any confidence in you. He knows you're always ready for the moment. Do you still feel that?   
 MARIO CHALMERS: I'm always ready for the moment. He knows that and my teammates know that. It's a good quality to have.   
  
  Q. What's the team's mindset going into Game 3?   
 MARIO CHALMERS: We have to play like we did in Game 1 and Game 2 except for the fourth quarter of Game 2. We have to keep playing, keep focused and keep winning.
