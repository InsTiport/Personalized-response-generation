 Q. Can you talk about how excited you are for the season?
 CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: I'm really excited. They're the best players in the world. We're all really excited to be here. 

 Q. What can we expect from the WNBA? 
 CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: You know, just a great game. You know, everyone knows that USA is getting prepared for the World Championships. 
 We're going to come out and play hard. 

 Q. Is there one particular part of the weekend you are excited for more than anything else? 
 CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: Not really. I guess the game, you know. That's why I'm here. I just think the non-basketball stuff, getting away the court, you don't usually get to see the players like that.

 Q. Can you talk about the Eastern Conference. 
 CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: A lot of teams are really playing well in the east.
