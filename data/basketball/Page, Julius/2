<p>	Q.  First of all, you guys are second or fourth nationally in scoring defensive.  They lead the nation in field goal percentage of offense.  That looks like a critical match-up.  Is it going to be Brown on Lucas and Page on Allen, as far as those two matchups? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you tell us how everything you've done the past few years led to this moment, led to being prepared for this moment, this environment, everything you had to do as a head coach? </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about what you've seen from Lucas, Oklahoma State, how well he runs that offense. </p>
<p>	Q.  The match-ups are really pronounced, your defense against Oklahoma State's offense.  Give us a clue as to who is going to guard who, unless you've already done that, who has an edge at various match-ups? </p>
<p>	Q.  Give us ideas defensively what we can expect from you guys in terms of personnel, who can do what? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Sutton has been successful at four different programs in terms of building programs.  When you think of Eddie Sutton type basketball, what do you think of?  As a first-year coach going against a coach who is probably going to be in the Hall of Fame, is there any kind of advantage or disadvantage? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jaron Brown has been described variously as the backbone of your team, a selfless player, overachiever.  Do you consider his play will be maybe even the key to what happens in this game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about how the philosophy of physical/mental toughness has developed at Pitt over the five years maybe you've been at the program, and also your reflections on Oklahoma State's toughness, especially as it deals with rebounding? </p>
<p>	Q.  How have you dealt with Page's offensive ups and downs, not only the way you have dealt with it, but the way you've seen him deal with it over the year, and also how key is he to your to your defensive strategy?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about not changing anything about yourself now that you are a head coach, but surely there have been some adjustments you've had to make during the year.  Anything jumped out at you that might have been a little more difficult than you thought? </p>
<p>	Q.  Your team has had a distinct lack of personal recognition, not only nationally but in your own league.  Are they hurt by this or is it, "We'll show them"?  How have they reacted to this?</p>

<p>	Q.  Julius, can you talk about your year?  There's a perception you're going to be a much more bigger scorer this year, then the ankle injury.  It has changed the game and made you do other things.  Can you talk about your season that way?</p>
<p>	Q.  How physical do you expect this match-up to be? </p>
<p>	Q.  As the story goes, when you were in high school, Coach Patino offered you a scholarship.  Was that true?  Do you ever think about how your career would have been different if he stayed there and you had gone to Kentucky? </p>
<p>	Q.  You were one of the players who lobbied to hire Coach Dixon.  Do you think this team would be where it is today if they'd gone in another direction? </p>
<p>	Q.  What makes you guys so good defensively?  Is it toughness, attitude, desire?  Tell us a little bit about the match-ups with Oklahoma State?  Give us kind of an idea head to head what's going to happen there. </p>

<p>	Q.  Your coach said that he thinks of you and your teammates think of you as the person that they need to follow on and off the court.  Do you have an understanding, of yourself that way?  Why do you think that is?  What is it about your personality that makes you a leader? </p>
<p>	Q.  Julius, have you played a team this year that has had the scoring balance?  Does this team remind you of Connecticut, all the different guys that have score in double figures? </p>
<p>	Q.  Julius, I heard earlier this year your son was hurt in a fall.  I'm wondering, has he recovered? </p>
<p>	Q.  What was it about? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talk about so much is made of your defense, which is your bread and butter, foundation, strength.  Guys are pretty balanced on offense.  Can you talk about the offense? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said earlier in the season you thought Coach Dixon was thinking too much earlier in the year.  Also was there a point in the season or pre-season when the players realized this is not the assistant who recruited us and everything, this is now the man in charge, he had to step up and assert this is authority? </p>

<p>	Q.  Any particular reason why you're interested in that field? </p>
<p>	Q.  With the way both teams play defense, is it possible this could be one of the playground games, first team to 20 baskets wins? </p>
