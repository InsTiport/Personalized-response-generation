THE MODERATOR:   We're joined by SanDiego State.   Coach, if you could open with a few remarks about tonight's game.   
COACH TERRY:   I'm disappointed, disappointed that we lost.   Obviously our goal this season was to win a championship, and we fell short this year.   So I'm disappointed.   Disappointed for these two, that they didn't have that opportunity.   
But really proud of the way that our kids fought tonight.   Did not give up.   Played hard the entire game.   Our defense was so good, so good.   I told them early if we kept this game in the 50s, we had a shot to win.   We definitely had that.   
So I'm just proud of our effort.   Thought we played really, really hard.   And we're going to build on that going forward.   
THE MODERATOR:   We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.   
   
 Q.   When Mimi came back in the game for Nevada, seemed like they took control of the game.   Was she just a bigger presence than you were expecting or shots weren't falling?  
CIERRA WARREN:   I mean, she is a big presence, but what she really did was crash in the paint, so that makes it really hard, being that most of our points do come from the paint.   
Watching Air Force, they probably saw that was how to win the game.   
   
 Q.   With the one‑on‑one battle against her, is that something you get up for knowing she's one of the better centers in the league?   
CIERRA WARREN:   I mean, every game you get excited.   It doesn't matter who you're playing.   
I mean, yeah, she is a great player.   But any game you play you want to get excited, you want to score, you want to do your best.   
THE MODERATOR:   We'll continue with questions for coach.   
   
 Q.   Could you comment about Mimi when she came back in the second half, do you feel that was a turning point there?  
COACH TERRY:   I do.   I think her presence makes it tough for us to score in the paint.   But not only Mimi.   I thought they did a good job of clogging everything up, making it tough for us to get some easy points.   
She does a great job altering shots, as well.   So she kind of took us out of our rhythm.   Normally we can get to the paint and get to the free‑throw line.   We didn't have that opportunity tonight.   So obviously that is reflected in the score.   
But she's a big presence.   Anchoring that zone, I thought they played a very good game tonight.   
   
 Q.   I thought defensively you were strong the whole game.   Forced the 10‑second violation in the final minute.   What play were you trying to run there?  
COACH TERRY:   We ran a couple things.   We were looking to come off a double screen, down screen, and get the three.   We were just going to take the first available shot at that point because obviously time was not our friend.   So we were just looking to get something easy.   
Chloe came through and made a couple buckets at the end, Desi Culberson got a good look for us to get it back in range.   A couple calls didn't go our way.   I mean, it's a different ballgame.   
I want to say this.   Nevada did an awesome job executing their game plan.   They're a very talented team.   They're going to really make some noise in this tournament.   
I mean, they just did a great job executing their game plan against us.   
   
 Q.   It's hard to sum things up after the game is over.   If you can look back on your first season, analyze things you did well, things you would like to improve on.   
COACH TERRY:   I don't know if we have the time for all that.   
I think we grew a lot as a team.   I inherited a bunch of young women who didn't have a lot of experience.   And the ones that did ended up getting injured.   So our record, I don't want to be judged on our record, I want to be judged on the growth we made from the start to the finish because that's really what I'm most proud of.   
We finished the season without a point guard.   For us to come and be competitive, down the stretch, in this league, is a testament to how good and how hard and diligent our young ladies were this season.   
For me going into the spring, we're going to work on our ball handling, we're going to work on shooting, being better shooters.   We have excellent post players.   Our guards have grown a lot, too.   But for me that's going to be the key so people can't pack it in like they did this season.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
