 Q.   The overall experience of being here this weekend, for a player like yourself, what's it like for you?  
MARCO BELINELLI:   Oh, everything is new for me, so it's like good to see a lot of people, like great guys, great teammates.   And it's a great experience for me, and I'm going to use that for my career.   
I'm going to be fine, for sure, and this is just amazing.   I remember when I was really young like I watched the Allâ€‘Stars on TV late at night in Italy.   
So it's really nice to be here and to be a part of this game.   
   
 Q.   Did you get any tips?  
MARCO BELINELLI:   Just a little bit, not too much, because I think that the rules are a little bit different last year, but like I think the important thing is just to like don't be nervous, try to be ready and for sure score the ball.   
   
 Q.   Why is this so special?  
MARCO BELINELLI:   Well, I played two seasons, so I can't remember my first year, like I said before, because that was my first time that I went to the playoffs.   
So my first time that really I got confidence from my coaches and my teammates, the inspiration was really good and I really have a good memory of the city and the fans here.   I have fun in the city.   It's really nice here.
