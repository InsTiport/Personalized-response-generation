Q.   What's the mindset, frame of mind of the team going up there?   They're going to throw everything but the kitchen sink at you guys. 
MARCO BELINELLI:   Yeah, tomorrow is going to be a war.   They're going to really come at us.   They're going to really be aggressive from the beginning.   But you know, this is the final of the Western Conference Finals, so it's going to be like this.   All 48 minutes are going to be aggressive on offense and defense.   We're going to do just what we did in Game 1 and Game 2, just move the ball side to side, smart play, and for sure we're going to try to do our best to win tomorrow. 

Q.   In Game 2 they talked about it and did it a little bit, and I'm sure they'll do it even more tomorrow, being more physical.   In a game like that you've got to come out and you can't wait for a call, right? 
MARCO BELINELLI:   Not really.

Q.   You've got to be just as physical?
MARCO BELINELLI:   The reason a lot of calls‑‑ just play, like I said before, they're going to be really aggressive from the beginning.   For us I think it's important to play together, be smart, use our physicality and try to do our best.   That's it.
