Q. What will you bring to the Pistons.
SADDIQ BEY:   I'm a big believer in God, so provide the spiritual, provide the faith.  And to try to help my team with whatever is needed.  They believe in me, so I want to help the franchise as much as possible and help in any way possible.
Q. You're going to a team with Detroit with guys like Blake Griffin, potentially Christian Wood.  Growing up, did you have a chance to even imagine you'd be playing next to Blake Griffin?
SADDIQ BEY:   It would be a great opportunity.  It's an honor and a blessing to be able to play with these guys, man.  I'm just looking to get better, looking to learn from the veterans and try to help the team as much as possible.
