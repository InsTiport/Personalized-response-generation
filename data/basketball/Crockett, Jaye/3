 Q.   Jaye, how disappointing was this tonight?   There were stretches where you guys hung with them, but it seemed that their size inside kind of overwhelmed you guy as a little bit?   
JAYE CROCKETT:   It was a tough loss.   They came out the better team.   We made a lot of mistakes.   We didn't play together like we needed to.   I just felt like we gave up too many rebounds and second chance shots.   They were just on tonight and making a lot of threes.  
   
 Q.   Coach said that obviously that Tolbert and Daylen will have to meet the challenge of their guys down low.   How much did it hurt to miss the floor action with foul trouble?   
JAYE CROCKETT:   Foul trouble kills you.   You can't be in foul trouble.   We needed the whole bench in the game.   We were moving so fast.   They were running fast, and we were getting tired.   We just needed everybody out there, and that hurt us a lot with the fouls.  
   
 Q.   Kader, how challenging was it inside with the size that they presented?   
KADER TAPSOBA:   It was pretty challenging because they're big.   They're really big.   If you have somebody to back you up, it's a good thing.   But if you have to play them by yourself, it's kind of hard to deal with.   
But unfortunately my teammates got into foul trouble, and we had to deal with it.  
   
 Q.   Jaye, what was the message in the locker room?   Obviously you guys have to rebound.   What is the idea of where you're going now?   
JAYE CROCKETT:   Move to the next game.   We have Northern Kentucky coming up Tuesday, so you can't dwell on that.   You win some, you lose some, so you have to bounce back the next game.  
   
 Q.   What do you all need to work on to play against a team of this caliber in the future?   
JAYE CROCKETT:   Rebounding.   We're not that big.   A lot of teams are huge in the Big 12.   They've got a lot of size.   We've just got to be aggressive and rebound.   You can't give up offensive rebounds.  
   
 Q.   How do you feel like you guys handled the adversity?   You made that one big run and they kind of peeled away.   How do you feel a lot of the guys in that situation handled it tonight?   
JAYE CROCKETT:   I think they handled it great.   We fed off the crowd tonight, and that helped us.   We're learning.   We're a young team.   A lot of the guys haven't played at this level yet.   We're learning and building every game.  
   
 Q.   What do you take away from a game like this?   
JAYE CROCKETT:   We'll go back and watch the film.   Tomorrow we'll watch all the mistakes that we made, and go out there and correct it in practice.   And next game in Northern Kentucky, you apply all the things that you learned, and hopefully it worked.  
   
 Q.   Kader, where do you see yourself as the progression ‑‑   where do you feel you made the most growth and where do you need to improve?   
KADER TAPSOBA:   I definitely am learning my jumpshot in the off‑season, and all of that it's not enough for a post player.   I need to keep rebounding and playing in the post.  
   
 Q.   Kader, what did you think of that second goaltending call?   Would you agree with that call?   
KADER TAPSOBA:   I wouldn't agree with it.   But the ref decided it, so I have to go with it.
