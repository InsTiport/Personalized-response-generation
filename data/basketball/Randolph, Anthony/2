  (No. 14 Overall Selection, Golden State Warriors)

 Q. Can you comment on your feelings being drafted by the Warriors? 
 ANTHONY RANDOLPH: I'm just very excited being selected by an organization like the Golden State Warriors, and I'm glad to come in and contribute. 

 Q. You kind of addressed this in the broadcast but there's been a lot of people who question your size and your toughness; what are you going to bring at the NBA level?
 ANTHONY RANDOLPH: I'm just going to bring toughness and hard work. I love to do this and now all I have to worry about is basketball, basketball, basketball, all day. 

 Q. You're going to an organization that plays a small ball, quick-tempo game, will that help you with your transition?
 ANTHONY RANDOLPH: Yeah, that's going to help me, and in the open floor, I get up-and-down very well and I'm not just pinpointed at one position. I can play multiple positions, so I think that I will be a great fit. 

 Q. Which position do you feel most comfortable going into your NBA career?
 ANTHONY RANDOLPH: I feel like I would be most comfortable at the 3-4, depending where they need me.

 Q. It says your favorite team is the Los Angeles Lakers, so now in the Bay Area, can we delete that from the media guide?
 ANTHONY RANDOLPH: Oh, yeah, my favorite team is the Golden State Warriors. 
 I've been there once and I love it, so I can't wait to get down there and win some games.
