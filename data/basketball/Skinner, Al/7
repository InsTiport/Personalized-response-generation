<p>	Q.  Al, you've had so many deficits this year.  None of them were 25 points in the second half.  Was it just too much when it came right down to it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Al, why do you suppose they had such a great comfort level? </p>
<p>	Q.  How about strategy defensively?  Providence played the zone, a lot of trapping zone, your team came out and played man.  They executed the same way against man as zone?</p>
<p>	Q.  The momentum you had at 20-0 is obviously not going on right now.  Going into the NCAA tournament, what do you do?  What magic button do you use?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does this serve as a wakeup call? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is that something you're still getting used to this season, the fact that you're hunted instead of a hunter now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jared, Coach said the second half it was a matter of playing for pride.  Where is this team's pride right now? </p>
<p>	Q.  Craig, everything that could go right did go right for you guys when you started 20-0.  What has been the difference the last few games, particularly the Pittsburgh game at home, and tonight, what happened in the first half? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can the team look at the second half as a bit of a moral victory?  Obviously, you guys cut a 26-point deficit down to 4.  Can you look at the second 20 minutes as something positive you can take into the NCAA tournament next week? </p>
<p>	Q.  Al, has it set in that you played your last game at the BIG EAST?  How much are you going to miss this Madison Square Garden and March atmosphere? </p>
