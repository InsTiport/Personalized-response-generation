<p>	Q.  Could you talk about Pittsburgh, your next opponent. </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about what you got from Ryan? At one point in the second half it looked like he hurt his ankle.  You looked at him.  What was going through your mind? </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible). </p>
<p>	Q.  In Syracuse you said that you need one more.  You got one more.  You feel like you're in now?</p>

<p>	Q.  Did you feel the NCA chance was slipping away? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you sense Rutgers tightening up?  Did you take advantage of that?  I mean, did your level of play change when you saw them tighten up a little bit in the second half? </p>

<p>	Q.  If you could just react to these two statistics.  The 15.2 you shot from the floor in the first half is a big east tournament all-time low.  No tournament in history came back from an 11 point deficit at half time? </p>
