<p>	Q.  Seems like we've seen this game 10 or 12 times before this year where you probably would say you're not playing particularly well, but when you have to take care of it, it gets taken care of. </p>
<p>	Q.  It also covers over to free throws.  You're not a good free throw shooting team until...</p>
<p>	Q.  Just the play of Craig in this building.  We remember the brilliant game he had last year against St. John's.  He's a dominant player again today. </p>
<p>	Q.  Just talk about the overall objective here to get to that fourth game. </p>
<p>	Q.  How will this team be different the second time around against Syracuse?</p>
<p>	Q.  Given you have to play four games in four nights, were you holding anything back tonight?  Seemed like your B game was good enough?</p>
<p>	Q.  Craig, you guys hold anything back?  You could have gotten the ball a lot more in the first half. </p>
<p>	Q.  Craig, were you guys motivated when you heard about the women winning, four games in four days? </p>
<p>	Q.  Craig, just talk to us about how you feel playing in this building.  You told me last week you were really looking forward to coming back here.  You had a monster game last year against St. John's.  Obviously, you love playing here. </p>

<p>	Q.  Last time you played Syracuse, they blew it open rather quickly.  You came back, you answered it, then they blew it open again.  Seemed like three different games.  Is the goal tomorrow to just kind of keep it kind of level? </p>
<p>	Q.  It seems to be a policy if you're going to be a decoy, it's more in the first half than the second.  Is it hard for you to be patient in that situation?  Are you saying, "I know the ball is going to come to me, I have to keep plugging away here"? </p>
