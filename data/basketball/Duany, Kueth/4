<p>	Q.  Playing in the Carrier Dome, do you think that gives you any advantage, playing in a dome here, and then also as a guy that's coaching at your alma mater, when you say Roy Williams, an opening, what goes through your mind when you see that going on? </p>
<p>	Q.  Three of the teams here have a first team All-American, you have a second team. </p>
<p>	Q.  How important is it to have that kind of special player to get to this stage and to win at this level when you've been here in the past, with marquee players as well?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you give the cliff-notes version of why you went to the zone, when you went to it, why is it so effective?</p>
<p>	Q.  Why do you think it's so effective?</p>
<p>	Q.  A lot has been said about college basketball not having enough marquee talent left.  Do you think this weekend with Carmelo, Dwyane Wade, a couple other first-rounders, that that disavows that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Myles Brand came out yesterday and said that the NCAA was going to think about revising ways to calculate graduation rates.  Do you think that's directly attributable to your remarks?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you just talk about what Carmelo means to you offensively, what you expect maybe Texas will try to do with him? </p>

<p>	Q.  Carmelo, obviously you had an awful lot happen to you during your freshman season.  Here you are at the Final Four.  Can you just talk about what the experience of the season has been like?  Are you even a little bit amazed you're here on this kind of stage? </p>
<p>	Q.  Carmelo, as far as Ivey as a defender, you have five inches and 28 pounds on him.  Is that to your advantage, do you feel? </p>
<p>	Q.  Carmelo, if you guys win the championship on Monday, how much will that play into your decision for next year? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kueth, with the stuff that's going on in the world today with America being at war, your family not being from America, what goes through your mind when you see protests, things like that, the war situation? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned Royal might start out on you, Texas may use some other people, several other defenses against you.  Talk about the adjustment that you made throughout the course of the game and throughout the season, having seen so many different players in one game and so many different types of defenses throughout the season? </p>
<p>	Q.  Carmelo said he couldn't dream about making the Final Four in his first year.  You're a senior.  What were your expectations coming into this season?</p>
<p>	Q.  What were your expectations this year?  The amount of improvement you guys have made, how much has that team matured?  How much is that a product of you being a young team that's gotten better fast? </p>
<p>	Q.  Carmelo, Coach Boeheim said for the most part you've been the key for this team, even as a freshman.  How much pressure do you put on yourself to set a tone, maybe not necessarily score right away, but to set the tone for this team? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kueth, in the course of your four years, can you recall a particular comment from an opponent that might indicate how frustrated they are trying to play against your zone defense?  What do you think the most frustrating part of that is for opponents? </p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of people who watch you play make the observation that the game looks really easy for you.  Can you describe how it feels?  Does it feel like the game at this level is easy for you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach is 0-3.  That record keeps coming up when he gets to the Final Four.  How bad would you like to get him his first win? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kueth and Carmelo, how have y'all prepared for a team that can send eight players out to score 14 or more points a player? </p>

<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the zone and TJ Ford?  Is he the right guy to attack your zone or is the zone the right way to stop him? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just talk about why you came to college?  Why did you want to play the college game even if it's only for maybe one year? </p>
<p>	Q.  For Kueth... </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you tell me how important it is to be back on defense, stop Texas' transition game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Being a Baltimore guy, what was it like when Juan Dixon won a championship last year?  Did it seem any more close to you because he had been a guy who had grown up in the same area as did you? </p>
