<p>	Q.  You've beaten three of the best teams in the Big-12 conference, now you get the league champion.  Does that run through those teams, does that give you confidence against Kansas? </p>

<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the opportunity of playing in this game on Monday as a freshman? </p>
<p>	Q.  Carmelo, before the start of the second half, it seemed like you had a little chat and a laugh with one of the Texas players, I think TJ Ford, just before the second half started.  Could you tell us what you said? </p>
<p>	Q.  Carmelo, will you comment on your overall game tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  Carmelo, you picked up your third foul late in the first half.  It didn't seem to bother you.  Did you just put that out of your mind?  At the end of the game, did you intend to dunk that breakaway? </p>
<p>	Q.  Carmelo, looked like you had a conversation going with Coach Barnes throughout the second half there, then at the end of the game you talked to him.  What was that about? </p>
<p>	Q.  Carmelo, talk about your experience at Syracuse.  When you signed with Syracuse, could you ever imagine you'd be in this position? </p>
<p>	Q.  Seemed like you were smiling throughout the game, whether it was in the first half or later on.  Did you get the sense things were going well? </p>

<p>	Q.  Could you imagine when you first started practice as a freshman you would be standing here on the last day of the season? </p>
<p>	Q.  Gerry, can you talk about the steals that you were able to make.  You were coming from the weak side, you made a couple of big steals down the stretch. </p>

<p>	Q.  Jim, could you recount the conversation you had with Roy a couple weeks ago about possibly playing each other in this tournament and discuss the match-up against Kansas? </p>
<p>	Q.  Understanding you're talking about one extraordinary freshman, one very good freshman.  Could you ever have imagined to start two freshman, playing in the final game?</p>
<p>	Q.  I believe Carmelo had your first 11 points of the second half.  Then you go on a 15-4 run and he doesn't score.  Talk about his ability as a freshman to recognize when he needs to take over and when he needs to get others involved? </p>
<p>	Q.  You and Roy have been so successful for a long time.  Can you talk about what it's like being a champion?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned Derrick Coleman.  Wallace, Rony Seikaly, Sherman Douglas, you've had some great leaders before.  Would you compare those two national championship teams, that played for the national championship, to this one?  Personally, what is your mental approach going into Monday night?  Is it any different than the other two?</p>
<p>	Q.  I think with 11:23 to go, you called a time-out, you were down 2.  What did you say to them at the time?  Is this team tougher than you thought?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Question regarding Brandon Mouton)?</p>
<p>	Q.  I'd like to get your response on that earlier Big-12 question, the fact you've beaten three teams. </p>
<p>	Q.  A lot has been said about your team's ability to score, Carmelo's ability to score.  In the first 10 minutes of the second half, he got some critical rebounds.  Talk about that. </p>
