<p>	Q.  Carmelo, your thoughts in general on winning the championship, being voted the most outstanding player. </p>
<p>	Q.  When shooters have a half like that, when the shots just fall so easily, is that just serendipity or was this the result of something Kansas had failed to do? </p>
<p>	Q.  Gerry, you did so well in the first game.  The second game tonight, the championship game, how did you feel coming into the game knowing that you would be on as you were in the first game?  The confidence was still there? </p>
<p>	Q.  Gerry, what did you think when you hit that fifth three in a row and the crowd started chanting your name, seemed like you couldn't miss?  What was going through your mind at that point? </p>
<p>	Q.  Carmelo, your coach mentioned you were involved in a couple of rough plays there.  Were you hurting a little bit at the end?  What physical toll did you pay tonight from all the collisions? </p>
<p>	Q.  Gerry, can you put into words for us what it means to be a freshman, to be national champions?</p>
<p>	Q.  Kueth, you're the only senior on this team.  Can you talk about the incredible transformation from last year's club that didn't make the NCAA tournament, although deserving, and this year you end your career with a national championship? </p>



<p>	Q.  Can you tell us what you think it means to Coach Boeheim finally winning this title? </p>
<p>	Q.  Carmelo, can you describe your elation when Warrick made the block? </p>
<p>	Q.  Right in the back. </p>
<p>	Q.  Carmelo, crowd at the end of the game is screaming for one more year.  Talk about college life.  Do you enjoy it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kueth, can you talk about that second free-throw, how you felt going into that shot, also how hard it was to give up the ball finally at the end after you got it ripped away from you? </p>

<p>	Q.  Jim, if you had had Hakim Warrick to run at Keith Smart, would life have been different these last 16 years? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the contributions of your bench in particular, Craig?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about finally winning a national championship.  Do you feel like it validates your career?</p>
<p>	Q.  Even in victory, does a piece of you feel badly for Coach Williams with their free-throws?</p>
<p>	Q.  28. </p>
<p>	Q.  They're showing "One Shining Moment," you wanted to leave the court, your wife made you stay.  Why did you want to leave?  Are you glad she made you stay and watch?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you thought about what kind of impact what you accomplished this year with Carmelo will have on other coach's approach that might be there one year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Roy mentioned at the end that conversation he had with you.  What did you say to him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about this team and compare it to your other two Final Four teams in '87 and '96.  Which team do you think it better?</p>
<p>	Q.  Having said what you said about Carmelo, the possibility of him returning next year, your gut feeling right now, do you think he's going to return next year?  Did this game as it stood, was it one of most exhausting games you coached?</p>
<p>	Q.  There were two kids who came off your bench today.  I don't think you expected anything out of them.  What they did, from a coach's standpoint, is that what makes this game so enjoyable?</p>
<p>	Q.  Any of your former players been in contact with you yet?  Have you talked to Dave or anybody yet?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've been raving about Gerry's play all week.  Are we just sort of seeing the surface of his potential?  How much better can he get? </p>
