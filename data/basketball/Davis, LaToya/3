<p>	Q.  Coach.  This November 13 is a big day, state Farm Classic.  LSU is on the schedule.  How are you going to get this team ready for this big game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, how do you plan on replacing Cisti Greenwalt this season, and do you feel like you have personnel in place to do that?</p>
<p>	Q.  If you could talk about your experience this summer and what you learned along the way and playing with some other people and how that benefits you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach talked about what a incredible defense player you were.  But I also noticed last year especially you had some pretty great offense games.  Is it different to when you play defense that hard and with the kind of responsibilities, is it different not to wear down and let that affect your offense and what maybe can you do this year or maybe coach if you can talk about that too to prevent that from happening. </p>

<p>	Q.  Just what you were saying, is the fact that a lot of your players can be very good pull-up jump shooters does make a big difference specially with the tiredness just having the little extra in your legs in the end of the game to make that shot?</p>
<p>	Q.  There's been lots of talk yesterday about you know Tiffany Jackson, Sophia was in here earlier.  Yesterday, Courtney Paris generating big buzz.  Can you talk about your post player Latoya, where does she rank in the pecking order here in the Big 12 of the best post players?</p>
<p>	Q.  My question is to coach and to the players.  How important -- how do you feel when you come here to play in Dallas, you got the Big 12 tournament area talent in this area. </p>
