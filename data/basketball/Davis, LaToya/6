<p>	Q.  Miss Davis, were you basically trailing that play toward the end or just going up court and you saw your teammate feed you the ball for the basket?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was just going to ask, would you just describe that last couple of minutes what you were thinking about or last couple of seconds rather?</p>
<p>	Q.  Shyra, a lot of people would call this kind of run you all are on destiny.  What do you call it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Seimone Augustus comes into this game averaging about 26 points per game, shooting 65 percent, what did you do to slow her down?  Anyone that would like to comment. </p>
<p>	Q.  Question for Shanna, this was the fewest points two teams have combined for in a Final Four game.  What type of game was it out there with the physical play and the lack of scoring?</p>
<p>	Q.  Shanna, talk about that 3-point shot you made right before the shot clock expired.  Whether you knew it was getting close and just take me through that.</p>
<p>	Q.  Shyra, would you talk a little bit, the rebounding was like 20 -21 at halftime and then you out rebounded them by nine in the second half.  Can you talk about that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about that last play where you were and you were the one that passed the ball to LaToya. </p>
<p>	Q.  LaToya, did you have any idea, was getting it off in time was that a question in your mind?  Did you think you had time?</p>
<p>	Q.  Shyra, how do you guys always seem to be in the right place at the right time? </p>


<p>	Q.  Pat, what was your big worry on with the six seconds left only, was your big worry Johnson going the length of the court and scoring or dishing to somebody?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you've been behind at half the last three games.  Could you talk about your ability to just hang in there and get to the last two minutes in every one of these games?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, can you recall in your tenure in NCAA games a stretch like these last three games and the way that they have turned out?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you explain a little bit about your strategy against Seimone and how you thought it worked out?</p>
<p>	Q.  With six seconds left you said, did you call the trap on the first time-out or the second?  They had called one and then you had called one. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, Johnson scored nine points in the whole game, seven in the first half.  How big of an impact was that?  10 minutes she was injured, went down, do you think that inhibited her play and did you make adjustments for that?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked all season about parity in women's basketball.  Do you feel the events of the last three games and the this tournament are proving that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does this team collectively just have low blood pressure or what is it about their calm in the final seconds?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know it's got to be somewhat tough for you to win at the expense of Sue a little bit, and the season and them making their first Final Four and so forth.  Just your thoughts on that. </p>
