<p>	Q.  Pat, coming into the Final Four there was a lot of talk about parity and top seeds being knocked off, yet it comes down to you and Connecticut.  Obviously you probably think that's a pretty good thing but I just wonder if you think that's good for the game of basketball?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, I don't know how you personally feel about the rivalry itself, but I have an idea that a 6-11 advantage to Connecticut must be grading in some ways.  Besides players, where has the difference been and where have you thought of ways to change?</p>
<p>	Q.  Pat, ESPN was talking that their highest rated program when it comes to sporting events is now women's college basketball.  No. 1 overall.  What does this match-up with UConn essentially -- I know you talked about it for years, women's college basketball, but what does this truly mean for the sport, UT and UConn again?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, your players referred last night to doing things by committee.  Could you talk a little bit about how your team has changed from having a dominant player and what that's brought to them. </p>

<p>	Q.  For Tasha.  One could understand if this thing with you all and UConn got a little bit tiresome over the years, you see each other so much.  Is the magnitude of the games what keeps it a little bit fresh?</p>
<p>	Q.  I could run this past any one of the players but I'll ask it of Shanna.  Given the last three games that you've had, all close calls, how much do you think that your success in those games owes to the fact that there have been so many Tennessee teams that have been in the situation before, had the tradition, have won in these spots and because you wear the orange uniform that you won those type of games?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach and any of the players, in the manner in which you've won the last three games, a lot of people are thinking, boy that's a team of destiny because of the way it's happened.  Coach, do you like the players having that kind of positive thought in their mind or in the back of your mind do you have to guard against them thinking, well, it will just come down to fate and it will take us through  ?</p>
<p>	Q.  Question for Tasha, could you talk about your evolution as a point guard whether you like the position, how much more comfortable you've become with it. </p>

<p>	Q.  Miss Robinson, I would like to ask, as a post player what has been maybe the big one frustrating thing in battling Connecticut dealing with them in rebounding or trying to stop their motion offense, because they do seem to get a lot of lay-ups?</p>
<p>	Q.  Question for Shyra.  Can you sort of talk about what went wrong against LSU and how much you're looking forward to being able to come back and erase that 1 of 11 from last night. </p>
<p>	Q.  For any of the players, can you just talk about what you guys learned from the last UConn game and how you've improved since then. </p>
<p>	Q.  Ashley, one of the things that's made Pat such a great coach is she has away of not sugar-coating things.  As you sat up there and listened about the last UConn game, and the essential point was your post play did not get it done and must tomorrow.  What are your thoughts? </p>
<p>	Q.  This is for whoever is responsible for Taurasi tomorrow night.  Who would that be?  Have you made up are mind yet, Pat who is it going to be primarily?</p>
<p>	Q.  Well then maybe I'll ask you, what are the keys to stopping her defensively?</p>
<p>	Q.  Any of the players, as you probably know by now Coach Geno Auriemma has a pretty unique since of humor, especially when it comes to poking fun at Tennessee.  I was wondering if you guys understand his point of view or his sense of humor or are you irritated by it? </p>

<p>	Q.  Pat, to the point of the last question, do you get the sense that because the Connecticut team is sort of a relative newcomer in the last 10 years, have done so well, in that 10-year period, while you guys have been, you and other schools, like Auburn, Georgia, have been there for the entire time, there's a sense of resentment about what you guys have done and perhaps that you guys don't recognize what they have done?</p>
<p>	Q.  Back to Geno's unique brand of humor, after the Evil Empire comment and your response, the feeling was there was no love lost between the two of you.  What's the deal there and how would you characterize your relationship with Geno?</p>
<p>	Q.  When did it go south?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you comment on Tasha and her role of stepping in for Loree at point guard and what she's done. </p>
<p>	Q.  When you look at the All-Americans' performance in these two games, I guess except for Janel McCarville, you look at the other four, Diana, Shyra, Lindsay Whalen and Seimone, none of them had particularly great shooting nights, what does that say about the defensive focus on those star players and the need for all those other people, especially at this level and these games, to support them?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've coached in over a hundred post-season games, the way your team has played and won, the past few games, very exciting finishes, have you learned anything as a head coach?</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously another Tennessee-UConn final will play well in Peoria in terms of television ratings and what have you, but do you feel any kind of rising sense of resentment from the have-nots of the sports, the new programs, the fence-sitters, that these are two programs that win too much, win too often?  You've been characterized as like two versions of the New York Yankees in women's basketball and do you feel like a growing sense of resentment from the fence-sitters?</p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of people look at this as Geno/Pat rivalry as maybe more so than Tennessee/UConn since the players change so much.  He's catching up with you with titles, if he wins tomorrow it will be 6 to 5.  Does that weigh on your mind at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously both teams are stacked with elite players, are there some players on Connecticut who you recruited heavily back in the day?</p>
<p>	Q.  As a freshman, you remember Diana Taurasi and you were at a game up in Hartford you say four years of this after watching her make some long bombs.  With the stakes being what they are tomorrow and the four years being finally up, can you talk about what it means to have her as that final stumbling block between you and the championship and how satisfying would it be to finally get the best of her on the game's biggest stage?</p>
<p>	Q.  Leaving you versus Geno out of it, having dominated the sport not that long ago, how hard has it been on you personally not to win?</p>
<p>	Q.  Let me ask you this:  When you had a good relationship with Geno, how warm and fuzzy was it and how much similarities do you see with his personality and your good friend Steve Spurrier?</p>
<p>	Q.  Beyond you and Geno, you look back at the Lakers and the Celtics, Yankees and Red Sox, is that what's becoming of this rivalry in women's basketball and how good is that for this sport?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about the significance when you guys won three in a row from '96 to '98, and how fitting is it that while UConn's trying to win their third in a row, that they have to face a team that the only team in the history that's done it before?</p>
<p>	Q.  No Geno question, I promise.  I would like to --</p>
<p>	Q.  I would like to ask how you've felt about coming back to an arena setting this year after the last two or three years of this being in dome situations.  Has it been a different comfort level for the players?  Does it feel more familiar to them, and to you, this kind of surrounding?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have any of your fans or family offered any interesting nickname suggestions for Connecticut to offset Evil Empire?</p>
<p>	Q.  Connecticut's got a senior class that have been to four Final Fours, you've brought a team to the Final Four I think four years in a row a couple times  --</p>
<p>	Q.  Three.  How special and how satisfying is it for you to see a recruit come in and then close out their career on the biggest stage every year?</p>
<p>	Q.  I apologize, back to you and Geno.  I'll give you a what-if scenario.  What if you're driving down a dark highway in Tennessee, car broken down, it's Geno, do you drive by, do you stop or do you drive by and call for help and why?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you mentioned that you talked to Taurasi during the recruiting process.  Can you walk us through that, how far in the process did you get, did you actually offer her  --</p>
<p>	Q.  What happened?  Was there no interest on her part?</p>
<p>	Q.  Reflecting on parity, it's not necessarily just the players are improving but the coaching across the board seems to be improving.  Can you reflect a little bit on what you have seen on the young coaches coming up and even how established coaches like yourself and such have modified their own coaching styles to meet the quality of the player coming in. </p>
<p>	Q.  Seeing your recruiting class for next year it's obvious you still like stars and any opportunity that it gives you to win.  But how much, how enjoyable has this year been, having a team that maybe the expectations were a little bit lower in a more starless kind of team?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know it's hard to win one national championship much less two in a row.  How hard is it to win three in a row?</p>
<p>	Q.  Somebody mentioned the New York Yankees before with UConn and Tennessee, the Yankees' main rival was the Red Sox and those two teams are always aware of the recruiting players, free agents over the winter, it got out of control the last couple years, how aware, talking about recruiting before, how aware do you think the two schools are of each other's intentions and what's going on with regard to who you're close to signing, who you're zeroing in on, is it something of a chess game or does it not get into what they're doing, it's just what you're doing?</p>
