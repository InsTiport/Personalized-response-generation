 Q.  You've got to feel like you kind of own the NBA. 
 ROBERT HORRY:  No, no way.  I've just been very fortunate to play with some great players to get me to this destination. 

 Q.  What would a seventh ring mean? 
 ROBERT HORRY:  It would mean a lot because growing up I had two posters in my room, Magic and Pippen.  I passed Magic and I passed Pippen, two of the people I admire most in this game, and I never thought I would be in a situation to be able to pass them, and it would be a great feather in my cap. 

 Q.  What was it about those two guys that made you idolize them growing up? 
 ROBERT HORRY:  6-9, do it all, and that's the way I wanted to be.  I wanted to be a basketball player.  I didn't want to be one-dimensional, I wanted to try to be a complete player, and I thought those two guys were complete.  You look at the things they used to do for those teams, they are superstars, but they didn't want the accolades, they just tried to make the people around them better and good out and do things to get W's.  That's how I am; I just want to go out and try and get W's. 

 Q.  What is it about this year?  Why do you turn it on right now? 
 ROBERT HORRY:  If you look at this year it was kind of crazy for the team coming in.  We started out slow.  We never hung our heads.  We said, just be patient, everything will work out in the end.  That's the thing about being a better ballclub.  Sometimes you're not going to play well, you've just got to maintain the ship and not let it sink and that's what we were able to do.  We were able to maintain it, keep playing hard because we knew that the talent we had on the team was no reason for us not to get here.
