<p>	Q. Robert, we've all seen you hit big shots before, but do you recall a stretch like you had in the fourth quarter and in overtime, big play after big play in a playoff or Finals game? </p>
<p>	Q.  We saw your face on the replay as you were going up for that dunk, and when you came down as you grabbed your shoulder, what's going through your mind as you're in the air there and then when you came down? </p>
<p>	Q.  The guys said that at halftime, you were frustrated and kind of sitting by yourself, talking to yourself. </p>
<p>	Q.  What were you saying, No. 1, and it must have worked because you came out in the second half. </p>
<p>	Q.  When you see them double Ginobili in the corner, in that last play and you're open, what's going through your mind?</p>
<p>	Q.  I can't let you get on the bus without commenting on Tim's description of your play, the regular season, fourth quarter, playoffs. </p>
<p>	Q.  Is that your answer to the success over the years and all the big shots and the Finals and the rings, you don't get excited until April?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would you agree that that was the greatest half by an individual in The Finals game since Jordan's first half six three-pointers against Portland in '92, from a historical perspective?  And second of all what does that say, that the decisive player in such a big game this year is someone that always says, "Keep the game fun and don't take it too seriously"?</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously Tim struggled at the line and in other ways, in the fourth quarter, besides taking a 3-2 series lead, how nice is it to pick him up and get the win?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've been in a lot of big games, was this the same feeling that you've had in a lot of these other big games or was this one different?  It just seemed to be so nip and tuck all the way through. </p>
<p>	Q.  They said at the end of the broadcast that you did not like the nickname "Big Shot Bob".  Which part didn't you like, you want it to be Rob or what?</p>
