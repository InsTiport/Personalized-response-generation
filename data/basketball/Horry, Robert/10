<p>	Q.  You had hit more 3-pointers than anyone but Reggie.  You are mentioned in the breath now with all these Hall of Fame players.  You say you don't think about it, but at some point it must enter your mind the kind of career you have been able to carve out?</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys are doing a great job of maintaining focus in staying hungry.  How do you guys continue to do that when you are in such a comfort zone right now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Manu (Ginobili) says you guys, if you see a teammate that seems relaxed, you go up and talk to him, Pop is going make sure you guys are fired up, each individual's responsibility to keep themselves pumped --</p>
<p>	Q.  How good is Tim (Duncan) compared to Shaq and Dream?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does this team take on his personality or is it Pop's personality?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does this feel anything familiar to you like Houston, like L.A., this run you guys are on right now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Anything about Tim (Duncan) that's surprised you --</p>
<p>	Q.  What about him going from the line last night?  You talk about up and down. </p>
<p>	Q.  We have seen limitations a little bit of Phoenix's style where they were kind of having -- having some of this all offense, no defense or occasional defense, when you get in these playoffs, is that the limitations --</p>
<p>	Q.  If they were as good a defensive team as you guys are, that would be a pretty scary thing?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is that what keeps you from getting overconfident even though you are up 3-0?</p>
