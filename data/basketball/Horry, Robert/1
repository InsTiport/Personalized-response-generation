  Q. Where are you living now in the summer?   
 ROBERT HORRY: Texas. Arcadia. You don't know where Arcadia is? Houston.   
  
  Q. Y'all didn't -- it said last night that it was funny that y'all didn't make any defensive changes really compared to the first two series. What was it that was so effective on Lamar and Pau?   
 ROBERT HORRY: Manu. Manu. Manu is the guy. No, that's just how we are. We feel like our game playing was good. And if you have confidence in the game plan you stick with it.   
 And the game plan didn't work very well in Game 1. It didn't work well in Game 2 because we missed a lot of shots. So we wanted to stick to our plan on our home court and see how it worked out.  
  
  Q. Was it kind of like New Orleans in that with Chris Paul, there were certain things you didn't want him to do? Kobe, there are certain things you don't want him to do?   
 ROBERT HORRY: We want to keep Kobe off the free-throw line. He is averaging 23 free throws or something crazy. The team is averaging 43 free throws or something crazy.  
  
  Q. They just got done playing Utah.   
 ROBERT HORRY: You want to keep them off the line and not generate the easy buckets like that. That was our main focus.
