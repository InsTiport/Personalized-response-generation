<p>	Q.  Robert, has it hit you what you've been able to accomplish in your career now, not only the Championship tonight but six rings, three different teams, and the three different teams, only one other player has ever done that, John Salley, has that hit you, the career you've been able to put together?</p>
<p>	Q.  The emotions right now, you have been through it before, obviously, it's not a new thing for you, but can you just describe what going through your heart, what this one means to you, coming back after a disappointing Game 6?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is this the game ball and have you got it because you're like the older guy?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned a day or two ago that right now you would rank Tim Duncan as the third best big name you've played with, would you care to change that now? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about his play down the stretch and how huge it was for you guys? </p>
