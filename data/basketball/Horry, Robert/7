<p>	Q. Do you feel that the momentum has shifted in this series?</p>
<p>	Q.  What specific adjustments do you feel like you need to make to combat that aggressiveness you saw in that Detroit defense last night? </p>
<p>	Q.  Pop says it's easy to react after a loss, do you agree with that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was what they did last night more strategic or was it just energy?</p>
<p>	Q.  The only time you've lost two in a row was at Seattle in the postseason, is there anything that you can take from that experience that you learned not to have another two-game losing streak?</p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of tough calls? </p>
<p>	Q.  What was the big difference for them last night? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there any one player that stand out in your mind that set the tone?</p>
<p>	Q.  You didn't have the ball movement and you guys were not moving the ball offensively and you didn't have the creativity that you had in the first two games from an offensive standpoint. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you agree with that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Why is that?  Why after the first two games of moving the ball so well, creating good shots, you didn't have that last night?</p>
<p>	Q.  On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you describe the intensity for Game 4?  What you can you anticipate? </p>
<p>	Q.  Rip was saying he thought that that took a toll because they were getting better screens and better contact with you. </p>
