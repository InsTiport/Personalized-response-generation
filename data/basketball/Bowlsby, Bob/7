<p>	Q.  I'm curious about No. 1 seeds.  How much time do you spend on determining that?  At what point does that happen in the process? </p>
<p>	Q.  Questions about the sixth and seventh items on the nitty-gritty.  The conference RPI, does that regard where you stand within your conference, be it sixth of 11th or first out of 11?  The road record, does that include neutral games in the road record? </p>
<p>	Q.  The ACC would be No. 1, PAC-10 2 judging by the replicas we see? </p>
<p>	Q.  You brought up an interesting scenario with lines two through eight.  Can you focus on the second and third lines for a moment.  With so much parity, what's going to ultimately determine who is a 2 and who is a 3? </p>
<p>	Q.  Has the committee done anything to tweak the process from last year, last few years, on the late Sunday games?  You might be able to consider them more.  If not, how much of a headache are those games for the committee? </p>
<p>	Q.  Last year with Oklahoma State, one of those teams where you couldn't use the contingency plans? </p>
<p>	Q.  What change do you foresee the new RPI formula bringing to the selection process? </p>
<p>	Q.  What sort of emphasis will you put on it?  Will the old RPIs sit side by side with the new ones?  How much emphasis will that carry? </p>
<p>	Q.  The Charlotte and Oklahoma City, you have a couple of teams in the Big-12, in the ACC, actually three in each case, that could be vying for 1's and 2's.  How will those conversations go in terms of how you're going to put teams in those sites where tickets may have already been bought, how you're going to differentiate in terms of which schools are closer to how you determine which two of three might end up at those two sites? </p>
<p>	Q.  Here is an urban myth.  With the new pod system, it seems that people don't get Arizona doesn't have to be in one of the west subregionals, not in Tucson, but Boise, because Tucson is closer to Oklahoma City than it would be to Boise, even though that's not technically in the west or technically in their same time zone.  Couldn't something like that occur because it is actually closer to Tucson, they don't have to go to Boise because it happens to be in the west? </p>
<p>	Q.  Virginia Tech, interesting because on the one hand they have an 8-8 record in the ACC, tied for fourth place.  On the other hand they have a bad RPI.  How do you rectify the two parts there, especially concerning the muddled mess of all those ACC bubble teams? </p>
<p>	Q.  Sounds like from that, you give as much emphasis to non-conference RPI than you do to saying .500 in a good conference, they win a game in a tournament this weekend, that may be pluses? </p>
<p>	Q.  For teams like Virginia Tech, Maryland, Georgia Tech, Miami, 8-8, if I win one game in the league tournament, do I need to win two games, what is kind of the -- how much do you -- how much do you give emphasis to that kind of thing, that they won a game or two in the league tournament, so that puts them over the top? </p>
<p>	Q.  Davidson, 16-0, only one of two teams that completed their regular season undefeated in their league, the other one being Pacific.  How much value do you put on that? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much value do you put on going undefeated in your conference? </p>
<p>	Q.  There's a lot of little controversies surrounded New Mexico this year with the low RPI.  You said that's just a tool.  First off, is there like a cutoff point that you look at?  They're in the mid-80s.  Is there an absolute you can't be worse than that type of number?  How much goes into consideration of a key player being hurt as Danny Granger was for the three games they lost there year? </p>
<p>	Q.  With the injury status, if a player does not play, do you just wipe those games off like it's a blank slate? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said earlier this year feels to you like the top line may not be as difficult as lines two through eight.  Do you have a sense for how many No. 1 seeds -- how many teams are fighting for those four spots, how many teams are in the mix? </p>
<p>	Q.  Come on. </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) that teams have some control over it.  How difficult is it when a team comes out, how tough is it to evaluate and a team tries to schedule teams that they think are going to be good and they don't turn out to be as good as they thought they were?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned in recent years the message has been kind of sent starting with the Georgia situation or Utah State I think last year.  Have you seen teams respond to those messages and try to schedule tougher schedules?</p>
<p>	Q.  As far as the No. 1 seed, I know you really haven't gotten into it, but looking at it right now, how difficult do you think it's going to be separating, like you said, there's a pretty good handful of teams that are kind of in the mix for it, and again how difficult is it if you guys can't decide or you have to wait to decide on the four No. 1's, how much does that slow up the process in general? </p>
<p>	Q.  On the RPI, you touched on a little bit what you're looking for from this new system.  Let me ask you, as somebody who has been around the block a time or two in this process, what is your gut telling you here on Wednesday afternoon?  Is the tournament going to have any different look because of this new RPI in terms of conferences being represented, multiple-team conferences that didn't get them in the past, or do you think the field on Sunday night will look very similar to the fields we've had in the past? </p>
<p>	Q.  I know you can't comment specifically on the qualifications of specific teams.  After hearing what you said about the strength of schedule, are there match-ups upcoming in the conference tournament, I won't ask you to name them, just a yes or no, that you kind of have circled and are saying, "I really want to see that game.  It may make an impact on what I decide to do over the next couple days"? </p>
<p>	Q.  We've pretty much heard every year from the chairman that the bubble teams have never been tougher to sort out.  Is that again the case this year perhaps? </p>
<p>	Q.  What is a ballpark amount of time you might spend collectively on the bubble teams? </p>
<p>	Q.  Without talking specifically about two teams, there's a couple of major conference teams within 60 miles of Oklahoma City, I think both would like to be there for their first round regional.  Is it realistic that the committee would place two teams in such proximity there or is it more feasible for just one to go and one to be sent elsewhere? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said a few minutes ago there were some situations where the new RPI varied from the old RPI.  What situations are those? </p>
<p>	Q.  With that being said, is there a possible way to determine if the new formula has helped or hurt a certain type of team?  There's been some talk that the new formula helps some of the mid-majors like Pacific or St. Mary's? </p>
<p>	Q.  I was hoping to just address two things I think might be public misconceptions.  One is just about the number of teams that might go from a given conference.  I think people sometimes think that the committee sits down and tries to say Big East deserves seven teams, we need to find a way to get seven in there, things like that.  Could you address that?  One other point is about RPIs.  There's so many of these approximations out there.  When you guys hear people refer to those as if they are the numbers, what do you think of that?  Are they pretty close to what you guys have?  Are they not really that close?  Where does that sit with you? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you have a team like Illinois, they obviously have a regional site very close.  There isn't another No. 1 seed contender any closer than they are to Chicago.  What would you say to the notion that Illinois really has nothing to play for?  A team with a resume and proximity like theirs wouldn't have anything to play for in their conference tournament weekend? </p>
<p>	Q.  Having Top 4 conferences and your RPI, could you tell me where the West Coast conference stands and why your RPI conference ranking varies so much from the replications?  Basically every other replications are the same but different from yours? </p>
<p>	Q.  Where is the West Coast conference ranked? </p>
<p>	Q.  When a key player is out for academic reasons, do you count that the same as an injury? </p>
<p>	Q.  The ACC is sitting there saying we're the No. 1 conference in the country, we should get a lot of bids.  Once you get past North Carolina, Wake Forest and Duke, you have different records.  On the one hand, how do you measure it's a top-rated conference, on the other hand you have a bunch of teams with mediocre league records?</p>
<p>	Q.  How are close losses against quality teams looked at?  Is a loss just a loss?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know you don't want to get into specific teams, but simply because Illinois was discussed before, is it fair to say your answer would have been different with no losses on their resume? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've been doing this a few years now.  With all of the technology we have today, I know all the committee members watch a lot of games.  I know most of the members think they know something about the game.  At the end of the day, how much of this field do you think is because of the numbers, the RPIs, and how much of it, especially for those teams you have to pick late, is just people on the committee saying, "They're a good team, I've seen them, Team A is better than Team B, I don't care what the numbers say"? </p>
