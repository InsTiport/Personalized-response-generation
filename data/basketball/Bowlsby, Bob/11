<p>	Q.  This business regarding the placement process, I'm trying to get a little bit more of a clearer definition on a term that's come up over the last year or two, the "home-court disadvantage."  Can you tell me how that's defined?  Is there kind of an actual mile radius for that? </p>
<p>	Q.  How about in a potential second-round 4-5 situation?  Is that one that might be impacted?  Is that a situation you're trying to avoid? </p>
<p>	Q.  I realize you can't talk about specific teams.  I've been on this teleconference 10 years in a row.  I realize people try to ask.  I'm not going to ask about a specific team.  Since I'm calling from Denver, you can probably figure out the team I'm talking about.  In the past few years the committee has made a point that a regular-season conference championship is valuable, that not just the conference tournament and not just the RPI, not just all the other factors are a factor, that winning a regular-season conference in a good conference means something.  Obviously the team I'm talking about is Air Force because they're in the seventh ranked RPI conference, but their RPI is in the 60s or 70s.  Could you address that?  Is that a priority for the committee, the fact that a team like that won a regular-season conference?</p>
<p>	Q.  A question related to strength of schedule.  The committee in the last few years has made a pretty strong statement that you want people to go out and play tough schedules.  I was curious, based on the RPI replicas that we work off of, it appears that there are five or six teams maybe that played Top 20 ranked schedules that are in what you might call the bubble area, 14, 15, 16 wins.  One of them, kind of obvious for your league, Michigan State, which played a very well-publicized, difficult schedule, now leads your conference in the conference race.  But there's other schools, too, that are in the situation.  I was wondering if you could tell us at what point does your conversation turn to that strength of schedule? </p>
<p>	Q.  A question related to geography.  Can you tell me how the committee looks at keeping the upper seeds closer to home?  How far down in the seeding process do you try to keep teams closer to their home base, if possible? </p>
<p>	Q.  You can't go beyond the first site doing this, right? </p>
<p>	Q.  For teams that lack a quality road win or quality road wins, how much emphasis, if at all, do you put into a narrow road defeat to a team that you kind of realize will be on the top 1, 2, 3 lines when you get to that part of the process? </p>
<p>	Q.  There seems to be a large number of bubble teams, if I could use that term.  I know some committee members don't like that, but they're going to have losing conference records, maybe even two games or three games below .500.  Are you seeing that also?  How do you handle that when you're weighing, especially in those last four or five, six choices? </p>
<p>	Q.  As far as what you were talking about there, if there was going to be a change in the selection criteria to where there would be a rule that you had to be .500 or better, how would that happen?  Would that be that particular tournament committee deciding that?  How would a rule like that be put into place?  General curiosity question. </p>
<p>	Q.  Big-12 media day in October, Bob Knight was a little bit critical of the committee makeup.  He said there should be more ex-coaches on there.  He said something about, "There have been good tournament committee members and there have been a lot that have no clue what's going on."  I was curious, would you agree, disagree, have any comments about that as far as the committee's make-up in general? </p>
<p>	Q.  Are there any new safeguards or anything in place to make sure what happened with BYU, miss-bracketing thing, that that won't happen again?  Is that sort of considered just a one-time kind of snafu situation? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much have you met with the committee so far?  Do you meet in person before you get together next week?  What are those discussions about in the early stages? </p>
<p>	Q.  This might sound silly, but are committee members required to or urged to keep ESPN on non-stop and watch as many games as they can? </p>
<p>	Q.  Back to the question about geography.  Last spring, last year's tournament, Kentucky went to Minneapolis for the region, ended up playing Wisconsin, neighboring state, in the semifinals of the region, then Marquette, again a neighboring state, in the finals of the region.  I'm wondering if that situation was any sort of factor in trying to put teams, the better-seeded teams, in a better situation?</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you think of the idea of reseeding the teams once the four teams advance to the Final Four? </p>
<p>	Q.  What drove the committee to decide to put an emphasis on the geography question?  Was it much lower seeds, having that crowd advantage over much higher seeds?  Was there a particular game or series of games that drove the point home? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you're seeding teams or selecting at-large teams, you look at the work, as prevalent this year as any year, it's obvious the home court advantage is so critical.  When you look at a team who has maybe a real high profile win or two at home against, say, a Top 10 team versus a team that maybe doesn't have that high profile win at home but has obviously played much more consistent basketball in terms of picking up two or three quality wins on the road versus maybe a Top 25 or Top 50 team, how do you weigh those factors?  Is it a (inaudible) versus maybe a better overall performance home and away? </p>
<p>	Q.  You could throw in a bunch of schools.  It's not a specific school.  It's easier to point out the teams that are as good at home versus the ones that are a lot better at home than they are on the road. </p>
<p>	Q.  There used to be taking into consideration if there was an injury to a key player at some point in the season, the team didn't do well without their player, but when the player came back, they did do well.  Can you address that? </p>
<p>	Q.  The Mountain West conference tournament is going to be at the Pepsi Center the week before the first and second rounds.  Of course, two Mountain West teams can play three games in the tournament.  Is that going to be a negative in your thinking about sending any Mountain West teams to Denver?</p>
<p>	Q.  Follow-up question on the injury situation you referred to.  How far can you take that?  If a player in a hairline situation misses a game against a very high-profile opponent, a one-game situation, with a sprained ankle or is limited to five minutes in that game, can that be a factor as well? </p>
<p>	Q.  Any general thoughts on just the general landscape out there this year, say in comparison to a year ago? </p>
<p>	Q.  A lot is made of how teams close in the final 10 games.  Where in importance does that matter?  If a team has struggled through a year but was able to put it together at the end of the year...</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you rate wins versus top 50's versus wins overall?  There are a lot of teams that have put up a lot of big wins but not a lot of overalls. </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm curious, when you're going through the process, do you take into account that maybe eight teams in the 12 get in, or seven out of nine?  Does that play any factor at all when you've been talking so much about body of work? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about conference RPIs, the emphasis maybe that you place on those.  It seems like some of the stronger conferences would naturally have stronger RPIs because they're playing better teams throughout the course of the season. </p>
<p>	Q.  Does that make it tougher for seeded teams like Gonzaga, Saint Joes, who don't play the competition day in and day out? </p>
<p>	Q.  I counted 17 conference tournaments on the final Saturday and Sunday while you guys are in Indianapolis.  Besides the automatic bids that come from the tournament championships, how much can you really consider the results of these games when it comes to the selection and seeding process? </p>
