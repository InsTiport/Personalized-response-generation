<p>	Q.  I heard you say on CBS that Kentucky would have been a No. 1 seed if it had won today in the SEC championship game.  I'm wondering about your placement of Kentucky in Indianapolis rather than Nashville or Cleveland?  Was losing today a consideration there? </p>
<p>	Q.  Were ticket sales a factor with Indianapolis in the dome? </p>
<p>	Q.  Iowa State.  49 in Sagarin, 62 in the RPI.  I know they finished well.  You gave them a ninth seed.  My second question has to do with a Mid-American Conference, just getting one bid when they had three worthy teams, or at least two that you were considering for at-large consideration. </p>
<p>	Q.  The Big-10, Iowa getting in with seven conference wins, IU fans talking about how they have 10 conference wins. </p>
<p>	Q.  (A question regarding Maryland.) </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about Louisville. </p>
<p>	Q.  With regard to Illinois' situation, obviously they've gone the shortest distance for their things, was there any consideration given regarding the funeral of the player's mother? </p>
<p>	Q.  How many No. 1 seeding scenarios did you have?  How big a headache was it? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned with Indiana, 15 wins was kind of a magic number.  Mike Davis has been so adamant about the Charlotte game shouldn't have been a win.  Did you consider that, look at that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Saint Joe's didn't expect to get in after losing yesterday.  No cameras waiting with them.  Did you give any special attention to the injury of the Saint Joe's player, the island loss right after it happened? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned the surveillance.  How central did some of those things become in part of the discussion within the group? </p>
<p>	Q.  What was the deciding factor on Oklahoma State being sent to Oklahoma City? </p>
<p>	Q.  If Oklahoma State had lost today, would Oklahoma have gotten that 2 seed in Oklahoma City? </p>
<p>	Q.  If Oklahoma State had been beaten in the Big-12 final, would Oklahoma have gotten the 2 seed in the Oklahoma City trip? </p>
<p>	Q.  You addressed Louisville.  Maybe if you could talk about in the final analysis with them, how much did conference strength play into it?  How big a factor was conference strength when you looked to see what line those guys were on?</p>
<p>	Q.  They had been very conscious of late-season performance.  They stumbled in past years and felt like they had been penalized for it.  Was there one thing that penalized them last year?  Their late-season success seemed to be better. </p>
<p>	Q.  Nevada and Pacific lost in their conference tournament.  When they had the losses, did their position get iffy or was their position solid after that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about Washington getting the No. 1 seed, how much of that is a reflection of what they've done as a team and also the strength of their conference? </p>
<p>	Q.  Was UAB one of the last two or three at-large teams in?  What lifted them into the field? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did their performance in the Conference USA tournament, pushing Louisville to the wire in the semifinals, that was a factor? </p>
<p>	Q.  Was it close enough that Duke's victory today gave them the No. 1 seed in Charlotte instead of Wake Forest? </p>
<p>	Q.  North Carolina State, was it their victory over Wake Forest that put them in the tournament finally?</p>
<p>	Q.  Wake Forest, how did the committee view Chris Paul's absence from the NC State game?  For Bill, has there ever been a subregion site that has had two No. 1's?</p>
<p>	Q.  How did the committee view Chris Paul's absence from Wake Forest's quarterfinal loss in the ACC tournament?</p>
<p>	Q.  UConn and Boston College shared the regular season title in the Big East.  Neither one obviously made it to the Big East tournament final.  Can you explain how it shook out that UConn got a 2 seed and BC developed to a 4? </p>
<p>	Q.  Regarding the Big East, you talked a little bit about Notre Dame on CBS.  Could you say where they came up short and how much West Virginia impressed you during the tournament?</p>
<p>	Q.  You were talking about the Mid-American Conference.  You mentioned 70 teams with 20 wins.  The one team that has 20 and is not going is the Buffalo Bulls.  They went 7-3 or 7-2 in their last nine, got to the championship game in the Mid-American, losing last night to Ohio University.  Did the parity of the Mid-American Conference hurt Buffalo in the last time when the committee met? </p>
<p>	Q.  For the games in Cleveland, when you try to keep people close to home, you have West Virginia and you have Pennsylvania coming into Cleveland, but you have schools close to the center, Ohio U, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati going to other regions.  Was there any consideration of bringing the Spartans, bear cats or Pittsburgh to come to Cleveland State for the two games?</p>
<p>	Q.  The 5:15 time you alluded to, can anybody speak to whether that's close to a record on how late this has gone into the process? </p>
<p>	Q.  With regard to the No. 1 seeds, would there ever be a discussion about the appropriateness or inappropriateness of having three from the same conference? </p>
<p>	Q.  Virginia Tech.  There were some things working against them.  What were the factors that kept them out of the tournament?  How close did they come to getting in?</p>
<p>	Q.  What kind of RPI did they have?  307 was the non-conference strength of schedule?</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously the conference tournaments had a big effect, especially on the seedings.  Did it have more effect this year than in the past?  How do you balance that against your consideration of body of work, for example, Duke finishing two games ahead of --Wake finishing two games ahead of Duke in the ACC?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is it fair to say that if Arizona beat Washington, they would have been a No. 1 seed?  How close was Arizona to get the No. 2 seed after losing to the Huskies? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much attention do you put on a team that is hosting a regional site, trying to get them on a different day than the day -- Arizona plays on a Thursday in their region here, their (inaudible) is always being played on a Thursday/Saturday.  Do you try to get away from that scenario?  How much does that play in as a factor? </p>
