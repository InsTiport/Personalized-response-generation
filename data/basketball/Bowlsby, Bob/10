<p>	Q.  Just wondering, with a tournament like the ACC tournament played so late, so close to your selection, how much can a team's seeding bounce up and down with one game, say, played on a Friday or Saturday? </p>
<p>	Q.  There's been some confusion, at least on this end, if a team is hosting a regional on say a Thursday-Saturday, can they play in another regional on Thursday-Saturday? </p>

<p>	Q.  Could you kind of review for us the procedure the committee does taking into account injuries, especially if you have a potential critical injury to a key player.  How do you go about finding about that player's health?  How do you judge whether they're going to be healthy or not for the tournament?</p>
<p>	Q.  If you get to a point on Sunday when you're trying to put the final pieces together, you still are unclear on that player's status, would you call the school itself to see what they can tell you?  How would that work?</p>
<p>	Q.  What is your criteria for picking the teams for the play-in game?  Is it strictly on RPI or what other considerations are there?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you try to rotate the conferences in that?  Particularly if you have two historically black conferences, would you try to avoid having those two teams play each other?</p>
<p>	Q.  My question has to do with how a team finishes a year.  You talk about the last 10 games frequently.  Two teams that are 5-5 at the end of the year, one team wins their last five, the other loses their last five, does the committee make a distinction there? </p>
<p>	Q.  There exists a potential for LSU and South Carolina to play in the quarterfinals of the SEC tournament.  Those are both teams that you know have lost key players.  Is that a game under which the criteria you said earlier that could end up having a lot more meaning to those teams in terms of the possibility of them getting in? </p>
<p>	Q.  Much has been made about a team like Washington that can present an ultimate test case for you guys because they had a horrible start, yet a sensational finish.  My question is, do you relish a situation like that?  Have you had anything that's been really, really difficult to weave through when the RPI numbers are off the chart, yet the good things are off the charts, too? </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm at the SEC tournament, and there's a lot of speculation year about Kentucky and Mississippi State both being contenders for a No. 1 seed.  My question is, how plausible is it that if those two teams were to meet in the finals here that both could receive No. 1 seeds, even though obviously one would win and one would lose?</p>
<p>	Q.  Maybe you can just refresh my memory, Iowa, your school is largely considered to be a bubble team.  I'm curious what the protocol is for you when it comes to discussing Iowa's chances?  Do you leave the room, participate at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  We're realizing that you don't pay attention specifically to a conference game, X number amount of teams in the tournament.  In the SEC, you have four teams all with 8-8 records.  Obviously, those teams are going to be compared against one another because of their similarities.  Because they are from the same league, how do you distinguish between those teams with identical league records?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've mentioned several criteria, RPI, strength of schedule, last 10 games, road victories.  I wondered which of any of those are either more significant or less significant in the seeding process. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about how you compare mid-majors and major conference teams, especially where you have a major conference team with a losing record and maybe a 6-10 record versus a mid-major team that might have won its conference?</p>
<p>	Q.  I'm going to try to ask this question without using a specific example, if I can manage that.  It's kind of a follow-up to the one that you were just asked about majors and mid-majors.  When you're down to those last few teams and you have an institution from a major conference that has had numerous opportunities against nationally ranked teams, teams with very high RPIs, whatever tool you want to use, and maybe necessarily has had some wins but not a lot, how do you compare that school to someone who is from a smaller conference that hasn't had as many at-bats, if you will, to get that dynamic-type win, whether it's home or away?  I guess what I'm asking is, is there a point that you say, "Having X number of shots starts to work against you if you don't connect on some of them"? </p>
<p>	Q.  Have there been some surprises so far among the automatic qualifiers that are probably going to bump out, make it a little more difficult to gain an at-large spot? </p>
<p>	Q.  If a team has the only victory over a team all season, obviously I'm thinking of Washington over Stanford, does the importance of that victory diminish significantly if a second team then beats the one-loss team? </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm wondering how history plays a role in the committee's things.  The big west has an at-large bid in 11 years.  Utah State and Pacific have really separated themselves this year.  I'm wondering if the loser of the championship, should they meet, has made a case for at-large consideration? </p>
<p>	Q.  First, you formerly being athletic director at Northern Iowa, are you still allowed to have any voice in how you think Northern Iowa should be seeded?  Secondly, when it comes to this pod format, maybe keeping more teams within their region than before the pod format, is there a criteria for who gets to be closer to home?  Is that based on seeding?  That's kind of murky to me. </p>
<p>	Q.  Forgive me if this is a bit of apples and oranges.  But everything you talked about, there's very much a human element involved here.  Do you think or ever see yourself going to more of a computer-type situation?  Do you think that's where maybe the BCS type situation is really faulty, because they don't have that human element? </p>
<p>	Q.  In the call two weeks ago you said you'd go back to the committee and discuss the home site situation with the Mountain West conference being played at the Pepsi Center, whether that might eliminate teams from returning to Denver.  What was resolved on that? </p>
<p>	Q.  I guess because it's a tournament rather than regular-season games, is it?</p>
<p>	Q.  After you guys are done meeting tomorrow, can you give me an approximation of how many of the at-large bids are still up for grabs?  Four or five?  Eight? </p>

<p>	Q.  I'm hoping no one asked this.  I got in late.  Is it ever brought up that over the years, Rudy Davalos comes to mind, sometimes committee members seem to get preferential treatment even though they're supposed to leave the room for their teams.  Is that brought up, discussed?  Do you try to guard against it? </p>
