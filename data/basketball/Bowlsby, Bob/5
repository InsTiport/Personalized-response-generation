<p>	Q.  I'd like to ask you, what is the message sent to conferences like the Mid-American when they have five teams ranked in the top 55 RPI and four of them are left out. </p>
<p>	Q.  How difficult is it to try and compare mid-major conferences to the big conferences?</p>
<p>	Q.  How aware was the committee that it was setting up a potential second-round game between Cincinnati and Kentucky?  Was that done by design? </p>
<p>	Q.  It's coincidence that Kentucky is playing Eastern Kentucky in the first round, as well?</p>
<p>	Q.  After Syracuse won the Big East conference tournament on Saturday night, Jim Boeheim made some comments.  He suggested maybe it's time to have a discussion about expanding the field, increasing the number of teams, when he said looking at the number of good teams that are getting left out.  Given all the tough decisions that you had to make yesterday, all the number of teams with 20 wins, do you sense any feeling out there, either as a committee or on any other level at the NCAA that there might be a discussion ahead about adding teams to the field?</p>
<p>	Q.  Wasn't that long ago we were at 48 or 32.  There were changes.  What kind of complications would it create if you added, say, another 32 teams? </p>
<p>	Q.  Another 15 or 32, either one. </p>
<p>	Q.  Bill, do you have any updates on ticket situations?  Anything change as far as sell-outs or anything? </p>

<p>	Q.  What sites are those again? </p>
<p>	Q.  Will there actually be a sell-out at Syracuse at the dome or is that unlimited? </p>
<p>	Q.  In terms of the University of Louisville, what was the biggest negative on them for not getting any higher than a four seed?  Obviously, the rankings don't necessarily play into it, but they come out No. 4 in the poles today. </p>
<p>	Q.  It's as much a product of their conference not having a great hang your hat on type of win other than beating Florida at Florida?  The conference was down, so therefore their strength of schedule was down?  Or was it a penalty for not having a great non-conference schedule, which they did not have? </p>
<p>	Q.  Why doesn't the committee, for teams that play in their conference tournament championship game on a Sunday, why aren't they just automatically assigned to a Friday first round to level the playing field, so to speak?</p>
<p>	Q.  Where does the SEC rank in terms of strength as a conference?</p>
<p>	Q.  I just wonder if the situation with Louisville and maybe the MAC are sort of the greatest part of fallout you've encountered?  It seems like it's been relatively quiet in terms of how people have viewed being left out.  Can you gauge how that compares with years past in terms of email or phone calls you've gotten? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you say that, can you describe how you gauge that?  Are you listening to any talk radio?  Are you daring to look at your email? </p>
<p>	Q.  I wanted to ask you about St. Mary's College.  I heard it was a pretty close call with them getting in.  I was wondering, how close were they to not getting in?  What factors pushed them over?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you please evaluate the adjusted RPI?  Did it achieve what the committee had hoped?  Was there any particular impact?  What do you expect as far as the future?  Do you expect it to remain the same or could there be further adjustments? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have any personal preference as far as continuing with the weighted format or making a further adjustment? </p>
<p>	Q.  With 20 wins, I thought that was kind of being put to the side a little bit as a measuring tool.  It sounds like that's coming back into play now. </p>
<p>	Q.  This is done historically year to year.  Back to the Mid-American Conference, it seems like every year this conference is consistently bypassed in some way, shape or form.  Is that a concern?  I'm sure if you take a step back and kind of look at what's gone on over the years, seems like there's always one team there, and it seems to be a MAC team that's right there that for whatever reason doesn't measure up in any given year in the eye of the committee. </p>
<p>	Q.  In terms of that conference being so competitive, carving each other up, to use your phrase, that seems to be considered a plus for some conferences and a negative for others. </p>
<p>	Q.  Both Kentucky head coach and Eastern Kentucky head coach seem to think the teams were paired up for a specific reason.  Can you elaborate on how it was a coincidence that they were paired up together in the first round? </p>
<p>	Q.  Northern Iowa coach suggested yesterday that he thinks he may have been the last one in.  I know you don't say who the very last one in was.  Northern Iowa the last school -- among the schools to go in at the end?  What tipped the scales in their favor? </p>
<p>	Q.  People are wondering around here if the committee was suggesting maybe you might want to run for governor, since all three teams from Iowa got in. </p>
