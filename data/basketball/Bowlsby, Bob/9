<p>	Q.  Could you address the exclusion of Utah State and the factors that were involved in that?  Also, under the heading of protecting the higher seeds in the pod system, there are several cases where you could have potential lower seeds playing significantly closer to home than higher seeds, including Kansas and Wisconsin.  Could you address those, please. </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm wondering if you could just speak a bit about St. Joseph's as the No. 1 seed, just the factors that went into that. </p>
<p>	Q.  I take it from your answer to the question at the beginning about the difficulty of games ending after 4:00, was that the reason Wisconsin, which beat Illinois today, ended up seeded lower than Illinois?</p>
<p>	Q.  Like Utah State, Air Force also had a suspect non-conference schedule.  They went out early in the conference tournament.  What was the deciding factors with them? </p>
<p>	Q.  Looking at Colorado, I'm assuming they're one of those final teams that you're talking about.  Does the fact that they won 10 conference games in the Big-12, was that trumped by the fact they weren't one of those 20-win teams you mentioned?</p>
<p>	Q.  I wanted to ask about Florida State.  I assume they were one of those bubble teams that went down to the end.  Was there any one thing that jumped out that offset their wins against  Wake Forest, Georgia Tech, Maryland and North Carolina during the season? </p>
<p>	Q.  What, if any, consideration did Oklahoma get?  Were they actually in that final pool? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've talked about how a lot of teams got in and got high seedings because of what they did during the regular season.  Can you talk about how Maryland went from a bubble team that needed to win a week ago a regular-season game and is now a No. 4 seed?</p>
<p>	Q.  I'm curious about Gonzaga.  This is a much higher seed than they've received in the past.  Was the fact that maybe they've been under-seeded in the past part of your consideration or did they stand on their own merits this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  How long was the conversation about having a fourth team from the Big-10, and can you tell us roughly how many teams started on the board when you first got to Indianapolis? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said earlier you made an adjustment with Duke.  If they had won today, would they have been the top No. 1 when you looked at the four No. 1's? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about Connecticut being lifted up to the two line?  I was wondering if the committee was more impressed maybe by how they played without Okafor or the victory over Pitt.  Do you discuss potential second-round match-ups?  In Connecticut there's going to be a lot of talk about Jim Calhoun possibly going against DePaul and his former assistant? </p>
<p>	Q.  There was some concern about how many teams would actually be in there on the first ballot, how much more difficult that would make your selection process.  Can you talk a little about that first. </p>

<p>	Q.  How difficult did that make it in terms of selecting the teams this year as opposed to previous years? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned you were trying to protect the teams in the first round, in terms of not playing lower seeds in certain areas.  But you do have North Carolina playing Air Force and Denver, it looks like.  Can you talk about that. </p>


<p>	Q.  We hear a lot of talk about different factors going into the final decision:  RPI, closing well, showing well in tournament.  Can you share with us a sense of what the committee was feeling like, which of those factors were really motivators as far as coming out with final decisions to get into the 65? </p>
<p>	Q.  Going back to the Sunday conference title games, if the Big-12 ended at 3:00 today, would it be fair to say that Oklahoma State had an excellent chance of being seeded No. 1?  Secondly, would you prefer, speaking as a Big-10 member, that your own conference play its game earlier on Sunday? </p>
<p>	Q.  As far as the play in the game Tuesday, any reason you selected Lehigh as opposed to anyone else?</p>
<p>	Q.  UTEP as the 13 seed in an at-large bid appears to be the last team in.  What were the factors for getting UTEP in? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much consideration was LSU given, and how much of a factor Lloreda's injury? </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm wondering, if you're going to seed the four No. 1 seeds, I'm wondering why you went away from calling them the East, the Midwest, from regions, and went to the identities of the cities?  I think that's confusing to a lot of people, no? </p>
