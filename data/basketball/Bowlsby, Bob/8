<p>	Q.  We have a situation here in Austin where Texas lost two starters midway through the season.  They're not getting them back.  How does that factor into the equation? </p>
<p>	Q.  Much has been made about how Illinois could potentially have a bus ride all the way through to the Final Four from Indianapolis to Chicago to St. Louis.  Does the committee wonder or gauge what might be too much of a home-court advantage for any team, or has a team like Illinois kind of earned that right with its performance to this point? </p>
<p>	Q.  About the Texas situation, but more in general, when you have a situation where a team got off to a pretty good start, then lost two players, how do you assess what they did with those two players, now knowing they're not going to have them?  I know you're going to assess the team going into the tournament, but what weight do you put into what they accomplished with those players that are no longer on the team?</p>
<p>	Q.  About the changed RPI formula, there's some people, you can look at like Southern Illinois obviously is a pretty good team, but some of the Internet RPI have them maybe 13 or 15 in the country, which would seem to be a little bit high.  Did the pendulum swing maybe too far in one direction as far as the tweaks with the RPI?</p>
<p>	Q.  The Southeastern Conference was 1-13 against ranked opponents in their non-conference portion of the schedule.  I'm wondering how the committee would view a record like that at the end of the season in determining how good the elite teams are? </p>
<p>	Q.  With the new RPI, you see some schools with increases of 20 to 30 spots with simulated RPIs compared to the old RPI.  Will that old RPI be taken into account when evaluating these schools?</p>
<p>	Q.  Some of the Internet RPIs have nine or even 10 so-called mid-majors in the Top 50.  Are you surprised by that?  Do you think that's an accurate reflection of their strength?</p>
<p>	Q.  Regarding the injury question, St. Mary's, which I'm sure will be one of those that's debated for an at-large bid, they lost a couple games at Madison Square Garden where I think there were two stars, including their lead scorers, at the time were ineligible athletes.  Will you look upon those losses, they didn't have those two players, didn't lose them at full strength, and judge them more heavily along the lines of what they've done when they've been intact?</p>
<p>	Q.  I'm sure you know that Floyd Kerr will be going off the committee.  Can you talk about his contributions to the committee for the last years, and will his successor come from a historically black conference?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering, will the outcome of the conference tournament title games on Sunday have any effect on seeding or are most of the No. 1 seeds already determined on Saturday night?</p>
<p>	Q.  If I could downshift for half a second.  The BCS is contemplating using a selection committee to help them out.  Given your position, would you recommend a selection committee for the BCS? </p>
<p>	Q.  It seems that ever since Georgia made the field, I believe it's 16-14 in 2001, that the committee has placed an added emphasis on non-conference strength of schedule.  If that remains so, what do you say to some of the mid-major coaches who claim that they find it very difficult to schedule quality non-conference opponents? </p>
<p>	Q.  All year long, the national media, television, ACC has been listed as the No. 1 conference.  Yet the reality is that after you get by Carolina, Wake and Duke, there's a very good chance nobody is going to break .500, and nobody else may make .500.  You have situations like Maryland that beats Duke twice and lost to last-place Clemson twice.  You have NC State and Virginia Tech, all of these teams are going to be in the mix together, Miami.  But State and Virginia Tech have zero wins of any quality other than whatever they won in the conference.  If you have six or seven ACC teams, I know you take them as individuals, but how are you going to differentiate when you're judging just where they fall against each other?</p>
<p>	Q.  By moving to this weighted RPI, obviously the committee thought there was some kind of flaw in the formula that needed a change.  Today you've already fielded several questions about the new system, what potential problems might come up with that.  Is there any feeling among the committee that maybe the RPI has outlived its usefulness and maybe you might need to switch to something else in the future? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much do you think the committee looks at teams in terms of whether or not they pass the smell test, if you will, just look like, "Hey, that's a top seed, that's No. 2.  Forget the number, forget how many RPI Top 25 teams, I've seen this team, that is one of the best four teams in the country"?  How often does that kind of conversation occur in the meeting? </p>
<p>	Q.  With conferences growing over the years, is there any particular challenge at all when you're looking at the unbalanced conference schedules of certain teams?</p>
<p>	Q.  A lot has been said that this might be the year that some of the mid-majors do better than they've done in the past, for instance maybe three valley schools, something of that nature.  Are you ready to make that characterization?  Do you see this as a breakthrough year for the mid-majors?</p>
<p>	Q.  As you look at the Charlotte first-round games, you mentioned the ACC kind of putting you in a difficult situation last year, there's three schools from North Carolina probably in the Top 10 of your RPI, what would be the most from that that you could see going to Charlotte? </p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of the Southeastern Conference teams are starting younger players, freshmen, sophomores.  I'm wondering if that's taken into account in terms of losses in November and December, and teams get better? </p>
<p>	Q.  If you have a team from a Division I power conference that's been struggling over the years and they deliberately schedule a very soft non-conference schedule just to gain confidence, they do well, then they get into conference play and do surprisingly well, how much does the committee weigh the soft non-conference schedule versus the performance within the conference? </p>
