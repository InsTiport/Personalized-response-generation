(Through Interpreter)

 Q. If you could start with your feelings about being drafted and describe your style of play. 
 SERGE IBAKA: This is a big day for me, a very important day in my life. I feel that this is the beginning and this is a great beginning and I'm very happy. 

 Q. Wondering who your favorite NBA basketball players are, and how much did you follow the game growing up?
 SERGE IBAKA: Growing up, my favorite player was Kevin Garnett and still is, for how he plays, and his talent and energy. 

 Q. Just another question, how much do you know about the City of Seattle and the team that Seattle has, a very young team, possibly one of our best young stars, Kevin Durant; do you know much about the city? 
 SERGE IBAKA: It's been only a few days since I've been here in the United States working out for teams and visiting some cities, but I don't really know about Seattle for the team.
