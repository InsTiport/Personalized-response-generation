 Q.  How quickly were you guys able to put the disappointment of Game 5 behind you and focus on what's ahead?  
SERGE IBAKA: We have to.  We did that so quick because we know, we believe we still have a chance.  We have another opportunity tomorrow, so go out there and play our best basketball.   
 Q.  Your impact coming off the bench, especially within this series, has been incredible.  What is it that you feel like you're bringing to this team individually?  
SERGE IBAKA: Just with my mindset and going out there, trying to play my best basketball. Just play my game and play with confidence.  No matter what, mistake or not, just go out there and play.  I think that's the key.   
 Q.  And mentally how is the team responding to such disappointment, especially the last four minutes and it not going the way that you wanted it to?  
SERGE IBAKA: We knew it was tough.  We have the choice to change our mindset and to be ready for tomorrow.  Like I said, again, the good thing about it, we have another opportunity tomorrow to go out there to play our best basketball.   
 Q.  You won on this floor in Games 3 and 4.  You played well in your role.  You also won here during the regular season.  Does that give you an edge going into this game?  
SERGE IBAKA: The past is the past.  I believe anything is possible, and I believe I can even do better than what I did.  I'm not going to be here to think about what I did in the past.  I'm here to think about what I can do better for my team tomorrow.  So that's what is in my mind.
