 Q.   With all the media and everything, does it feel like The Finals have really arrived for you?  
SERGE IBAKA:   Yeah, man, this is the NBA Finals.   NBA Finals are always like this.   For us, kind of surprising for us, like myself the first time.   But it's also the NBA Finals, so it's normal.  
   
 Q.   You entered the series theoretically as the favorites.   How does that feel?  
SERGE IBAKA:   It's got a lot of pressure, too, but it's good.   It's good because that makes us hungry because we know we have the pressure.   I think is not really nothing different to play against Miami, you know.   We just have to play as hard as we can and try to do the best, like you said, when we played against San Antonio, because always we hear San Antonio is one of the best teams in the NBA right now.   
   
 Q.   Can you compare the home court here in Oklahoma City compared to what Miami might have down in Miami?   Is it more of a home court advantage here?  
SERGE IBAKA:   Yeah, like always NBA Finals home court, always.   For us we have first two games here, so first game we come out hard and we play our home basketball.   But we mostly prefer to win the first win here at home tomorrow.
