 Q.   Talk about how the mindset has to change for this team now with the stakes that are at hand tomorrow night.   
SERGE IBAKA:   We need to just keep believing, keep believing.   We have one more chance to get this win and go back to Oklahoma.   We just need to believe that we can do it.  
   
 Q.   Perk said you had some really good encouraging words for James earlier.   Was there an opportunity for the team to come together and just talk to one another, encourage each other?   How did you have time to do that?  
SERGE IBAKA:   Yes, I wanted to address a message to my teammates that we need to stick together and we need to believe that we can do it.   We addressed Kevin, guys who can make some crazy plays and make us all achieve better.   My message was to make them to believe that we can do it because we've been working hard to be here.   We still have one more chance.   It's not over yet.   We believe all together, and we will try to go for it again tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Did anybody else jump in on those words and say something?  
SERGE IBAKA:   Yeah, everybody was happy to‑‑ everybody was really motivating.
