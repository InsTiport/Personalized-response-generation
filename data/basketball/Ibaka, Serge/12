  SERGE IBAKA:   For us it's the first time to be here, and first of all for myself, I was kind of a little bit nervous.   I want to say the truth.   But then after everything was okay.   Now we've found our way to play basketball, and after winning the last game, I think we're back with our confidence and our focus.

Q.   Do you expect tomorrow to be quite a bit different, at least at the start?
SERGE IBAKA:   Of course, of course, because Miami Heat, they enjoy to be a good team for next game, so we'll just be ready to play.

Q.   Specifically the Thunder, though, getting off to a good start?
SERGE IBAKA:   Yes, and tomorrow we'll try to start a better start than last game.   We'll try to start a better start and play our basketball. 

Q.   When you're looking at Dwyane Wade, does he look like the real Dwyane Wade to you? 
SERGE IBAKA:   I don't know, man, I don't know.   All I know, we was playing great defense team, make him take some tough shots, don't get him points in the paint.   That's what we did.   But personally, I don't know.
