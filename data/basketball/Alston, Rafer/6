 Q. Talk about this match-up. 
 RAFER ALSTON: It's going to be great. They're a tough team. I think everyone focuses on Kobe Bryant, but you've also got to worry about Gasol but then you've got the supporting cast - Odom brings a different dynamic to his position and then you've got guys that come off the bench that really put an impact and turns up the intensity with Vujacic, Farmar, Walton, Shannon Brown, too.

 Q. They said guard play is going to be really critical for this series. Talk about that. 
 RAFER ALSTON: They've said that I think every series I've been in (laughing). All three rounds, in the Eastern Conference and now. I think everybody's play is going to be critical when you're trying to win the title. I know when they look at the match-ups, the other guys end up canceling each other out by how good they are. 
 But we're up for the challenge. The guards within our team are definitely up for the challenge.

 Q. What's going to be the toughest part of this challenge?
 RAFER ALSTON: Understanding how much support and help he get on Kobe with the mindset that they have some guys that can really shoot the three ball. If they get it going, it could be a long night for you. Fish could definitely shoot it, Farmar could shoot it, and you have Vujacic who can shoot even though the numbers so far in the playoffs show that they've been struggling from the three.
