 Q.   Do you expect Williams to use Rubio at all?  
CHASE BUDINGER:   I definitely think he will.   I definitely think he will.   Rubio has done such a great job this year, too, and he's such a great passer, so why wouldn't you use him?   
   
 Q.   You've been able to see them a little bit this year.   Your impressions of the Wolves so far?  
CHASE BUDINGER:   They're a great team.   Rick Adelman came in there and has done a great job with those guys.   They're definitely playing well, and I feel like they're going to keep playing well, keep getting better as the season goes on.
