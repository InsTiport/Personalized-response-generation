THE MODERATOR: Deyonta, if you would just start with an opening statement about what you bring to your new team.
DEYONTA DAVIS: A player that wants to win, a hard-working player, and a player that is not a problem child.
Q. We spoke yesterday and I asked you what would be ideal for you, to be drafted earlier or later.  Now that you had to wait a little bit longer than you expected, was it a little bit frustrating to go through that process?
DEYONTA DAVIS: I mean, it was because I expected early, but the pick doesn't matter.
Q. What do you look forward to now with your new team and how do you think you'll mesh with the current core of people who are on that team?
DEYONTA DAVIS: I mean, I'm not a hard person to connect with, and when I get there, I'm just going to play like I'm playing with a chip on my shoulder.
Q. How did Tom Izzo motivate you and help you to grow into a better player?
DEYONTA DAVIS: With all the tough mistakes I made like in practice or in games, he just pulled me aside, talked to me, telling me to just keep my head up and just try not to make another mistake.
Q. Speaking of Coach Izzo, I saw that he was sitting with you the entire time.  What were some of the things he was telling you to encourage you or things like that?
DEYONTA DAVIS: He was just motivating me, telling me to stay positive, keep my head up.
