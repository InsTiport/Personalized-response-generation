<p>	Q.  For any of the players, and specifically Tasha, considering the way you have won the last two games, is there a little feeling of destiny going through you all for Tennessee this year? </p>
<p>	Q.  For any of the players, how do you deal with Seimone Augustus and do you know who is going to be mostly dealing with her for you guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is for Tasha, Tasha, coming on the way you have, can you talk about how your confidence has grown?  Did you ask for the ball in the last game, last second like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  For the players, this kind of obviously is Coach Summitt's team and she gets the lion's share of the credit, but can you guys talk about how much of a role the assistant coaches take in the day-to-day operations and the practice and maybe how much you guys trust them in addition to Coach Summitt. </p>
<p>	Q.  Ashley, if you can answer this, we just talked to LSU's players and coaches and talked to them about what they felt like they needed to do in order to beat you.  They said they need to be better on the board and what do you think about that because obviously that's your territory over there.  What do you think they need to do?  Actually what do you think you need to do?</p>
<p>	Q.  LaToya and Tasha, since Loree's injury, how have you dealt with that stuff in the back court?  Have you shuffled around roles a little bit, people doing different things than they would have before that?</p>

<p>	Q.  Candace Parker said that a certain personality type is drawn to Tennessee for coach or the players.  Is that true?  Is there a certain type of personality that usually goes to Tennessee or end up there? </p>
<p>	Q.  A lot's been made about the fact that LSU is so close here.  But they only got 850 tickets and they think it might be a big Tennessee crowd tomorrow night.  Can you talk about whether you expect that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Tasha, you guys as seniors have sort of been overshadowed throughout your careers, does this feel particularly good for all three of you up there to be the ones of this class to lead Tennessee back to a Final Four?</p>

<p>	Q.  Coach, I'm wondering if it had been your destiny to Coach 40 years and win 700 games and never be in a Final Four and you get a team there and then you couldn't participate because of illness.  I'm wondering how you would have felt about that.</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, much has been made about the absence of Loree Moore and deservedly so.  You hate to lose a point guard.  When in your mind did this team get beyond the fact that they would not have her and begin to play as if they didn't miss her?</p>
<p>	Q.  They say times change and obviously from 1991 to now a lot has changed, what do you remember about being here in '91 and maybe just the atmosphere and just kind of your thoughts on back in the day.</p>
<p>	Q.  Speaking about Sue, you and her had a down-to-the-wire battle for Seimone Augustus, and two years later, is this what you envisioned for them, once they landed her, did you think that was going to be the difference of them making the next level?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, without a Kara Lawson, without a Chamique Holdsclaw, is this one of your least distinguished teams in terms of individual accolades and what does that say about this group that's been able to get here just as all those other great teams did?</p>
<p>	Q.  I'm wondering if you could imagine sitting in your living room while your team reaches a milestone from 2000 miles away, what you would feel or what you would throw or anything like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  In light of that question about the makeup of your team, did you feel disparaged at all about some of the comments that were made after the regional finals about the nature of your wins and how you advanced here?  There were some things that were said that weren't quite complimentary.  How do you feel about that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, two questions, what do you remember of Pokey Chatman, the player, who is All-American in 1991 and did you see then maybe that she might be the kind of person who could be a head coach and second, if you could talk about just how much success you guys have had against SEC teams in the NCAA tournament?</p>
<p>	Q.  A coach this morning said that she thought that Candace Parker's dunk might bring on what you call SportsCenter moments that might bring people in.  Are you concerned about what that might mean for the sport?</p>
<p>	Q.  Okay.  Well in a sense that the sport, this game really isn't about SportsCenter moments.</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have a concern about what that might mean to the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  You got LSU on one side that's making their first trip, you've been here what seems like 20 or 30 times to the Final Four, what is it that keeps it from getting old for you, how do you keep yourself motivated to come back and go through all these media interviews and all of the stuff that surrounds this.</p>
<p>	Q.  As Diana Taurasi wraps up her career, where do you feel like she stacks up against some of the best you've seen?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just wanted to talk about the game specifically.  There are so many areas obviously that you are superior in different way, how many times you've been here, all that kind of stuff, any areas that concern you, are you looking at?  Because it doesn't seem that way.  So are there any areas that you maybe are worried about matchup type things or within this game?</p>
