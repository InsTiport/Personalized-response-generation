   JERRY SLOAN:  Obviously we got to play much better, do a better job defensively.  That's the thing that killed us.   
  
  Q.  Carlos has seemed in the playoffs so far to adjust very well from Games 1 to 2.  Why do you think that is?   
 JERRY SLOAN:  I think everybody things don't go well for, they try to do better.  He is certainly one of those guys that does that all along.  You just keep working at it.   
  
  Q.  How much was it an intimidation factor in Game 1?   
 JERRY SLOAN:  I don't really know if it was or not.  I just think we didn't get into any kind of rhythm.  They do a great job at helping each other.  I think we got a little confused at times.  We lost our confidence, didn't have an edge, started shaking our heads.  (Indiscernible).  Have to have a place to run.   
 You have to know what you are doing.  Our guys get together and have a better idea.  If step A doesn't work, go to step B.  We don't have all day to screw around with it.   
  
  Q.  (Indiscernible)?   
 JERRY SLOAN:  There were times the ball should have gone inside.  By the time we reacted, it was too late.   
  
  Q.  The fact they were able to not put pressure on the offense --   
 JERRY SLOAN:  They did what they wanted.  We didn't want to give up as many side baskets as we gave up.   
  
  Q.  Why is Tony Parker had so much success with your guys?   
 JERRY SLOAN:  Tony Parker?   
  
  Q.  Yeah.   
 JERRY SLOAN:  He is a good player.   
  
  Q.  What are your plans to make any adjustments?   
 JERRY SLOAN:  Try to do a better job.  Sometimes we do have a better job of getting open.   
  
  Q.  (Indiscernible)?   
 JERRY SLOAN:  We know they do offense as well as anybody in the league.  If we don't do along those lines, the shots we took, a lot of the shots they took were outside shots.  The shots were casual shots.  You do that, you are not making the other team defend you.   
  
  Q.  How do you get better in the second half?   
 JERRY SLOAN:  That's a tough question.  They have got a good team, we know that.
