 Q. Talk about putting this all behind you and coming back next year for a fresh start.
 MAKAI ASHTON-LANGFORD:   Yeah, for sure.  It was a tough game today.  It's all good, though.  We'll be right back ready to go.  We're going to work very hard over the summer, and whatever happens coach-wise, we'll be 100 percent committed.
 Q. Just the threes weren't falling for you guys today.  That was kind of the discrepancy in the game.  What happened from behind the arc today?
 MAKAI ASHTON-LANGFORD:   We just had a couple defensive lapses.  And all credit to Duke, they knocked down open shots when they needed to, some tough shots, and it just wasn't falling for us today.
