Q.   With all of the changes that seemed to take place early, you guys had a little bit more control on the boards.   You did a little bit better job early in the game, obviously kept this one a little bit closer.   Was that a priority going into it?
JASMINE THOMAS:   Yeah, controlling the boards is always something we focus on, but mainly we were just trying to take our time on offense and execute and really try to get our best shot on offense. 

Q.   Was there a point in time late in the game you started maybe to feel it slip?
JASMINE THOMAS:   No.   I mean, even with two minutes left, it was at eight, which is possible, and I think the group that was on the floor, they played until the end.

Q.   Talk about late first half, you made a run.   Just about got over the hump and took command.   Talk about some of your momentum. 
JASMINE THOMAS:   I mean, just staying focused.   We played our best game today, like really just staying together, and everybody talking and being on the same page and not letting them get those runs that they got on us in the first game.   I felt like for the most part we answered their buckets with buckets, but we just didn't get the stops we needed at the right time down the stretch.

Q.   It seemed through the series that you never got into your transition.   That has been a trademark of this Atlanta team.   What did Minnesota do to keep you out of transition?
JASMINE THOMAS:   I mean, when you make shots, first of all, that slows down their transition because now we're taking the ball out of bounds, so that's the first thing.   But the second thing is they know we're good at transition, so they always had two and three people back.
