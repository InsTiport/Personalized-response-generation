  Q. How many more championships were in that team of Kobe and Shaq?   
 MIKE BROWN: I don't know. Some people would argue they are the best at their positions ever. Including Phil as a coach. There was a time when they were there, I couldn't see them getting any worse as the years went along.   
 Having said that, they would have won a few more. How many, I'm not sure.  
  
  Q. Shaq says six to eight, total.   
 MIKE BROWN: Oh, total. Okay.   
  
  Q. Are you playing this game like you are playing in the Finals game?   
 MIKE BROWN: We're going to tape tomorrow at practice (laughter). Defensively we will double everybody and everything. We'll rotate like banshees out there so we can contest all shots.
