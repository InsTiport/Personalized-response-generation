 Q.   I covered the Nuggets for 15 years for the Denver Post, and in the lockout year, 1999, I came to some‑‑ I can't remember what the name of the team was, the ABL team in‑‑  
BECKY HAMMON:   Oh, yeah, the Chill.   The Colorado Chill.   
   
 Q.   I interviewed you in 1999.   Your first year in the pros, right?  
BECKY HAMMON:   '99 was, right.   Yeah.   I had so much fun.   It was like an extension of college.   
   
 Q.   How is your knee?  
BECKY HAMMON:   I got cleared to play about two weeks ago.   So all set to go.   
   
 Q.   You guys are going to kill in that league?  
BECKY HAMMON:   I hope so.   I don't have to do much.   I can tell you that.   These guys are two of the best.   It all comes down to the half court shot.   Whoever makes the half court shot generally wins.   
I won with two seven‑footers who were not too good.   
   
 Q.   You've been doing this for many years.   How many?  
BECKY HAMMON:   Three or four.   I don't know exactly.   
   
 Q.   Did David make the half court shot one year?  
BECKY HAMMON:   David did.   I was in with Tim and David one year and we won.   I mean, two seven‑footers.   
So it's just whoever make that is half court shot.   But this year we actually do have shooters, so...  
   
 Q.   Is this something you ask to do each year if you can?   Do you make it known that you would like to be a part of it?  
BECKY HAMMON:   No, they come to us and ask if we want to be a part.   Invite us.   And they knew I was here, obviously.   A lot of us go overseas, so the big deal is what players are in the States and that.   
So, yeah, I was.   They called and asked me, and I said yeah, of course.   I love coming down and of course seeing great basketball and kind of just being a part of everything.   It's very exciting.   
   
 Q.   When does your camp start?   
BECKY HAMMON:   April 27 maybe.   
   
 Q.   What would you say is your best NBA All‑Star memory?  
BECKY HAMMON:   One of the‑‑ Michael Jordan's last year when the All‑Star Game was in D.C.   
   
 Q.   And he should have been the MVP?  
BECKY HAMMON:   Yeah.   And to be able to see him play live, because obviously I idolized him growing up, so just to see him live, in person, was like definitely a highlight.   That's going way back.
