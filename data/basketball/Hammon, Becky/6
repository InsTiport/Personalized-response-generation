BECKY HAMMON:  I wish we would have won.  It was a lot of fun out there.  Both teams were enjoying each other.  It was an up-and-down game, and like I said, I just wish the East would have won.  
 
Q.  What does it say when this is actually the best performance the East has ever had in an All-Star Game and you guys still got killed by them in the end? 
 
BECKY HAMMON:  Oh, boy.  Well, we wanted to score 100 points, but he didn't say about them not scoring 100 points.  So one of us did, and it was the wrong way.  I mean, in this kind of situation, just going out, and like I said, we're trying to make it fun for the fans.  We're having fun out there.  I don't think anybody takes it too overly serious out there, if you couldn't tell.  I think at one stretch, it kind of got away from us.  It went from about eight points to about 20 in a matter of about three or four minutes, and we could never quite recover from that.
