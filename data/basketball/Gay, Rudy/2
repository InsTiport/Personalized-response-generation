  Q.  Is it amazing how many guys from UConn are participating in this weekend?   
 RUDY GAY:  It definitely is.  Coach Calhoun does a great job getting guys ready.   
 I'm definitely happy I went there.  It was the best decision I made.   
  
  Q.  You've played really well during the last three or four games, what's the difference been?   
 RUDY GAY:  Just being comfortable, just going out there and trying to take good shots.   
  
  Q.  Are you learning from your mistakes?  I've noticed that lately when you make mistakes, you don't hang your head, you just come back and play harder.  How long did it take for you to get used to that.   
 RUDY GAY:  (Laughing) 12 years.  At this level you can't hang your head at all.  You make mistakes, you make it up.
