Georgia  Â– 73
  Alabama - 66

 THE MODERATOR: We'll get started. We have Georgia head Coach Landers. Coach, make an opening comment and we'll take questions. 
 COACH LANDERS: Well, it was certainly a hard-fought game. I give Alabama a lot of credit for coming to play and being very well-prepared to play. They did, in my view, a lot of good things and adjustments from the other two times that we had played them defensively, and were very, very good. 
 You know, I kept thinking when we pulled ahead, I think three different times by eight or so points, that we might spread it out. But invariably it seemed like we then would turn it over and they would hit a three and it would go back to being close again. 
 But really, really proud of our players for hanging in there and making plays down the stretch, then for hitting the free throws, particularly Meredith and Ashley as they finished the game out from the free-throw line. 
 And pleased with the way we executed versus the press late in the game, as well. 
 THE MODERATOR: Questions. 

 Q. Meredith, what was going on in your mind when you took those last free throws in that last minute? 
 MEREDITH MITCHELL: I knew I had to knock it down to get the win. We had to go back down and try to turn them over, try to get us up. 

 Q. Ashley, with a minute and a half to go, it looks like you took advantage of them running into each other. How were you able to take advantage of that? 
 ASHLEY HOUTS: Well, I think I just tried to make a play, make something happen. It was pretty close there down to the wire. Didn't really feel too comfortable with it being so close. 
 We all made some plays. We all hit some free throws. Ended up making some key stops and got a win. 

 Q. Coach, how hard is it to beat a team three times in one year? 
 COACH LANDERS: Well, it's hard to beat a team in this league one time in a year. And I think the thing that we all have to safeguard against - you, our fans, coach, players - is the expectation that we're supposed to win again because we played well the last time that we played them. 
 But I just glanced at the stat sheet. You know, I don't remember exactly, and you may, we're 1 of 11 from three in this game. In that last game, we were like 8 or 9 of 16 or 17 something. Crazy. You know, to expect to go out and do that again would be very hopeful thinking. 
 But it's hard, you know. From a mental standpoint, it's hard. I didn't think that we played with a great sense of urgency on the defensive end, and I thought that we made some poor judgments on the offensive end. 
 But, you know, again, we made a lot of plays. At the end of the game, we were everywhere that we needed to be defensively, tipping balls, deflecting balls, stealing balls, and rebounding, which we had trouble with, particularly in the first half. 
 But, you know, it's hard to get it done, it really is. 

 Q. What did y'all say to each other when you had the lead most of the game and they came back and took the lead, then it was back and forth? 
 ASHLEY HOUTS: I don't think we ever got down and thought that it was over. You know, we kept fighting, back and forth there for a while. Like I said, there were some plays that were made, some free throws hit, some shots made. We also went back down to the other end and got some rebounds. 
 I think, you know, positive from the game, we can look at it as not getting our heads down, getting down on ourselves. We fought back and tried everything we could to put it away. 

 Q. Talk about the steal late in the game with Georgia leading by two. 
 ASHLEY HOUTS: Yeah, I just mentioned earlier that they kind of ran into each other at the end. She had her head turned so I tried to take advantage of getting the steal and just swinging the momentum a little bit. 
 I don't remember if we were down or we were tied or up. But thankfully we hit some shots and made some plays that sealed it for us. 
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
