 Q.  Oleksiy, talk to me about what do you know about D.C. and the team there? 
 OLEKSIY PECHEROV:  I saw a couple of the games.  You know, I like the city.  It's a great city, it's the capital of the USA.  They have got a good team, very good players. 
 So it's nice, I'm glad to come to the league and I will work hard and I hope I will help this team. 

 Q.  Who were your favorite players growing up, either where you were or NBA players? 
 OLEKSIY PECHEROV:  Well, in the NBA, there's so many great players, I'm trying to learn from everybody.  It's what I try to do. 
 I like Dirk Nowitzki, he's a good player, he's from Europe and he's got the same skills like me.  You know, it's like I think it's a good example for me, how I can play in the future and how I can really work to be a good player. 

 Q.  Did you pattern your game after him or anyone else that you enjoyed watching? 
 OLEKSIY PECHEROV:  Yeah, of course, I'm trying.
