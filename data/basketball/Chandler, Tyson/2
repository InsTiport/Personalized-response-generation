 Q. How do you feel back in Miami? 
 TYSON CHANDLER: It feels good. It feels good. We have the opportunity to get out here and accomplish what we set out to do. 

 Q. Do you feel a sense of something different, one win away? 
 TYSON CHANDLER: Just a matter of focus. I think everybody is focused in, locked in on what we came to accomplish. 

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 TYSON CHANDLER: I think we study a lot of tape. They're very aggressive on screen-and-rolls. We're starting to see the holes that we can find offensively. I think we definitely are going to get our shots. But we have to be more focused on defense and how we come out and how we set the tone. 

 Q. Do you think you can replicate that offensive performance? Is it something you have to do versus what they do to you? 
 TYSON CHANDLER: Definitely. I feel like the last game was more Dallas Mavericks basketball, making shots, driving, penetrating, kicking the ball out to open shooters. That's what we have to continue to do. We fully expect that. But like I said, our concentration has to be on both ends. I felt like we gave up a lot of open shots. We have to contest. 

 Q. Can you talk about your mindset, what went through your mind with LeBron defensively? 
 TYSON CHANDLER: I feel like I was in a good place the entire game. He was kind of lowering his head and driving and being aggressive. I felt if I could get there early enough, I could get a charge.
