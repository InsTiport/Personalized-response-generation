 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 TYSON CHANDLER: We allowed them to get comfortable. They were able to walk up the floor and get to their spots. We didn't make it tough for them. They missed some shots, but we didn't necessarily make them miss. 

 Q. Are you happy with the pace of the game last night? 
 TYSON CHANDLER: No. We have to pick up the game. We have to get more shots. We have to get out in transition. We got lured into their style of basketball last night, which they did a good job of. We have to pick the game up next game. 

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 TYSON CHANDLER: I think the tempo being the first game of The Finals, not knowing what to expect. Took us out of our rhythm a little bit. They did a good job of it. We played to their pace. 

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 TYSON CHANDLER: I don't think it surprised us. I thought we did a good job of keeping them in the half-court set. The only time they were able to get out was when they built a six-point lead with a couple minutes left. That was the only time you saw a lot of transition plays, because there was a little more scramble. For the most part during the game, I thought we did a good job of getting back. We have to be a little more aggressive, though. 

 Q. What about going up against their defense (Indiscernible). 
 TYSON CHANDLER: We expected it. We just didn't make some decisions quick. I felt like we had openings we were able to see on tape. And we'll make the adjustments.
