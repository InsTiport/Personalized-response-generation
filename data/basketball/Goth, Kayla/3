Baylor - 83, K-State - 54   
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Kayla Goth and Coach Jeff Mittie.   
JEFF MITTIE: Baylor played well, did a lot of really good things.  So we just didn't have an answer for anything that they did.  Obviously Brown was a factor early as she always is and their frontline was physical, very dominant early in this game.   
 Q.  Kayla, your team continues to fight.  What are some things you hope to you've on with your team as well as yourself moving forward?  
KAYLA GOTH: As a team we've got to get better in almost all areas.  We're a pretty young team so I think taking it one day at a time and just trying to get better overall, personally, less turnovers.  I need to take care of the ball a lot better and stay aggressive.   
 Q.  What do you take from playing a team like Baylor?  They're so good and so talented.  What do you take from a game like this moving forward?  
JEFF MITTIE: I'll answer it.  I don't know.  What I take is we've got to get -- long ways to go here in getting better.   
We weren't as competitive as we needed to be.  We weren't as tough as we needed to be.  We weren't as physical as we needed to be.  Kayla mentioned it, we didn't take care of the ball enough to run an effective offense against them.  I will know more when I look at the film both individually and as a team, but we just weren't as competitive as we hoped to be today.   
 Q.  What are some things you thought you did positive, like from your previous, like, games coming into this one?  What did you do differently?  
KAYLA GOTH: I think we tried to slow it down.  We knew we couldn't beat them in transition, so I think we tried to slow it down, take shots toward the end of the shot clock.  So we didn't wear ourselves into the ground, either.   
Then we tried to keep a body on Kalani Brown at all times.  We obviously weren't very effective doing it, but those are some changes we made.   
 Q.  Coach, what does someone like Kayla mean to you and your program moving forward?  
JEFF MITTIE: You know, she has made tremendous strides this year and really has -- she battled through some injuries last year and she really, I thought, played well at the end.  You saw, you know, right here in the Big 12 Tournament she had 26 last year.  And she carried that over into the off-season, carried that over even though she had surgery in the off-season.  Now her role changed during the off-season.  Our plans were for her to be the 2 guard and with the injuries to Middlebrook, she was thrown into the point guard position.  Our plan was to maybe play they are 10 minutes as the point guard.  She has really been playing -- I think she is in the top 3 or 4 in the league in minutes played at the points guard spot.  She had learned to play though fatigue.  She has learned to play better through contact.  Learned the responsibility if you're having a bad night you have to find a way to will your team to play better, do those things.  She has had tremendous growth this year.  Some of it she was reluctant to grow.  She has kind of been thrown into the deep end, so to speak and for the most part she swam pretty well in there.   
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations.  Thank you.
