THE MODERATOR:   Questions. 

Q.   Emmitt, did you see this coming in practice? 
EMMITT HOLT:   I guess it came out of the blue.   We're working hard every day in practice.   Just something that came about. 

Q.   Talk about what you were able to do out there, how you have improved. 
EMMITT HOLT:   I have a great support group, my team, family, coaches helped me through the struggles.   Every day we're getting after it, trying to make better decisions. 
I've learned that I have to stop and think.   I have to make my own decisions.   Just taking it day by day. 

Q.   What were you able to do out there tonight?
EMMITT HOLT:   My team did a great job finding me in the alley.   Rob, Yogi, Stan.   They were doing a great job of driving over the top.   I was there open. 

Q.   How much progress have you made toward finally forgiving yourself for what happened that night? 
EMMITT HOLT:   From then and now, I think I've made tremendous progress.   Like I said before, I had a great support system, these guys, my teammates.   They just helped me along the way. 

Q.   Do you know yet how IU found out about you?
EMMITT HOLT:   The coaching staff told me they watched me at the (indiscernible) session and liked what they saw and they came and got me. 

Q.   To expound upon that, what was this summer like for you mentally, emotionally?   At what point had you decided to go to prep school and at what point did you decide you might be able to go ahead to college?
EMMITT HOLT:   Well, in the beginning of the summer, my plan was to go to the academy.   That was my first choice.   Towards the end of the session, like I said, the coaches saw me during the sessions.   They liked what they saw. 
I was trying to get to a big school like this going to prep school, so why not go now? 

Q.   What makes you so efficient? 
EMMITT HOLT:   I feel like it's all about the timing, talking about blocked shots.   The coaching staff taught us to wall up while the defense is trying to make contact.   That's what we did. 

Q.   Talk a little bit about what you saw out there tonight, how you've seen him progress. 
NICK ZEISLOFT:   Every day in practice he's going hard with the bigs, whether it's Han, or sometimes even Troy.   They're all getting each other better.   Tonight was just an example of the hard work that was put in during practice and then in on‑court workouts.

Q.   How long have you been working on getting the ball in the middle? 
NICK ZEISLOFT:   We definitely try to get the ball in the middle of a 2‑3 whenever we see it.   We find Han in the alley.   Whether it's Collin flashing in there or me or Yogi tonight, pretty much whenever we got the ball in the middle successfully, we found something good out of it. 
It's a big emphasis of ours.   We did that tonight. 

Q.   What defensively did you see? 
ROB JOHNSON:   I think that's what it all started with.   We picked up the intensity.   That's one thing we talked about coming out early, setting the tone, the defensive intensity.   With the type of scouting that Coach McClain did, he did a great job telling us what to take away, the key to the game.   We followed that, executed it.   It came out good. 

Q.   You did a better job following the scouting report?
ROB JOHNSON:   We had to go back and reassess our intensity level.   After we raised that, I think the scouting report, following that, that was the second key.   It was important that we followed that out. 

Q.   Was last week's poor play motivation for tonight?
ROB JOHNSON:   Yeah, most definitely, just because when you face adversity, you have two options, to get better or get worse.   That's something we always talk about. 
We decided as a team that we wanted to get better.   That's what we tried to come out tonight and try to do. 

Q.   (Question regarding Yogi's foul trouble.) 
ROB JOHNSON:   It wasn't in my head.   With our team, all our guys are pretty much interchangeable.   When things like that happen, Coach Crean moves me over to the point.   I'm pretty much comfortable running the team, getting us into our offense and things like that. 
I think it all worked out. 

Q.   (Question regarding facing a bigger team tonight.) 
ROB JOHNSON:   One thing we always talk about is just defensive rebounding.   That's going to be one of the keys for us throughout the season because we are a smaller team. 
We know if we do that, as far as offense, we pretty much wouldn't have a problem as far as our shooters in space, as long as we're following the concepts that Coach Crean always preaches to us. 
I think when you're a smaller team, the edge you bring defensively is what makes the difference. 

Q.   What are some of the ways that Devin's family helped support you and got you through this whole thing? 
EMMITT HOLT:   The first thing was they forgave me.   That was the biggest thing for me because I hurt their child.   They supported me along the way.   They knew I felt bad for what I did.   It changed my life forever.   It was great. 

Q.   What were your first impressions when you first joined the team, coming back from Canada and meeting Emmitt? 
NICK ZEISLOFT:   I enjoyed him from the first time I met him.   Great kid, great person.   He brings that every single day.   Comes from a great family.   Met his mom.   She's wonderful. 
You could really see early we were going to have a great teammate, he was always going to have our backs no matter what situation he was put in. 

Q.   Once you have the lead, what do you have to do to keep it? 
NICK ZEISLOFT:   Most definitely.   We definitely took all of what Coach McClain did in the scouting report to heart and we followed it very detailed.   At this level you have to take care of that.   You have to make sure guys don't get to the things they want to do. 
We definitely did that tonight.   We learned that the hard way some other nights.   We got to keep doing that moving forward. 

Q.   You had a 23‑point lead, they got it back down to 10.   What do you have to do to put teams away? 
ROB JOHNSON:   I think once you get up like that, that's one thing we always talk about, keep your feet on the gas, finish the game.   It's easy to get relaxed, take your foot off the gas. 
I think that's the most important thing, keep the intensity up, or turn it up a notch so you don't have that falloff, you can continue to expand the lead. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
