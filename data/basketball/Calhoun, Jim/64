<p>	Q.  Just talk about that defensive stretch where you kept them scoreless?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jim, your program has been in these games and won these games in the Big East tournament.  Notre Dame, this is still sort of relatively new with their first trip to the semifinals.  Poise and composure, how much of an advantage is it for your program?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jim, talk a little more about Tony.  That was two big baskets, right, to kind of push them back when you needed it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Caron, you went over 1,000 points tonight.  Third fastest UCONN player to do that.  Did you know that?  Did you have any idea you were 13 going in?</p>



<p>	Q.  How significant is that? </p>
<p>	Q.  You got nine of your points in the last nine minutes, Ben.  What was opening up for you?  You had a variety of stuff it looked like, that came open for you the last nine minutes?</p>

<p>	Q.  This is for either of the players.  Notre Dame has tremendous floor balance offensively.  They take good shots from different spots.  Defensively how do you stop a team like that?  You guys did a great job in curtailing that tonight.</p>
<p>	Q.  Jim, before the tournament you talked about how many teams there were in this league that could possibly get to the finals.  Tomorrow we'll see the top two seeds square off.  Can you talk about that?</p>
<p>	Q.  The answer man.</p>
<p>	Q.  Jim, kind of more a big picture thing, Georgetown has won six of these things.  When you first got into this league did you think that was untouchable.    Can you talk about where you guys are in terms of getting back to this place.</p>
<p>	Q.  Pittsburgh-Connecticut was the matchup everyone wanted to see, Brandin Knight said.  Do you feel the same way? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jim, you rattled off great names from your program.  Can you remember any guys with games like Ben has had here in The Garden?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about the poise you have shown.  Can you remember having a team with two freshman and two sophomores doing these things?</p>
