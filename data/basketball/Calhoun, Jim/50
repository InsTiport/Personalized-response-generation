<p>	Q.  Emeka, most people your age these days do not want to play center.  Why is that okay with you and also how did you end up getting the ball?  Did you have to fight for it? </p>
<p>	Q.  If you could talk about this has been a whirlwind season for you, your feelings right now, emotions as it's all over. </p>
<p>	Q.  For all three, could I ask you, similar to what you were trying to answer, what does this accomplishment mean, not the emotions, but accomplishing this feat? </p>
<p>	Q.  Ben. </p>

<p>	Q.  Emeka, you said the other day that you sort of dreamed about the idea of making free-throws to win a game.  I wonder, when did you start to believe that you could go into a game like this and score 25 points and be such a factor offensively? </p>
<p>	Q.  You were talking about being immortalized.  Today the Basketball Hall of Fame did not decide to induct your head coach.  What do you think winning a second championship means to him and did the Hall of Fame make a mistake today? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jim, could you talk about the run you guys had to send the first half, the dagger that Rashad through at the buzzer?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach talked about the immense expectations.  A lot of times when you get that much expectations, teams kind of sort of plod through the season trying to deal with that.  It doesn't become as much fun maybe.  Did you guys have as much fun as coach says?  Did you find a way to enjoy the season? </p>



<p>	Q.  Emeka, coach talked about earlier how difficult it is to go wire-to-wire.  Now with the weight of that world off your shoulders, how does that back feel now? </p>
<p>	Q.  Georgia Tech was this far in the tournament because of the way they played offensively.  Tonight only nine assists.  Can you talk about the job you did defensively? </p>



<p>	Q.  Do you have any words of encouragement for the women's team tomorrow night? </p>
<p>	Q.  Ben, if you could follow up on that defensive question, the Georgia Tech guys were in here, they paid respect to you.  They were saying it's one of those nights.  It was your defense had a lot to do with that. </p>

<p>	Q.  Ben, can you offer some thoughts on the difference between this game and the first game against Georgia Tech?  Was it Emeka being healthy tonight as opposed to not being healthy in New York in November? </p>

<p>	Q.  About four minutes to go in the half, Ben got his second foul.  I just wondered what your thought process was, leave him in, take him out. </p>
<p>	Q.  Those two guys sitting there before, they came in together, they pushed each other for three seasons now.  Here they are the two leading scorers in the national championship game.  Talk about their journey to this point, what they meant to UConn.  The school tomorrow night is on the cusp of something historic. </p>

<p>	Q.  Characterize the career of your point guard.  So many ups and downs.  Tonight he bounced back. </p>
<p>	Q.  After playing a nail-biting game on Saturday night, to win this one in as convincing a fashion as you did, how nice was that?</p>
<p>	Q.  You said to us yesterday you couldn't afford to be sloppy in this game.  Did you have to sit down with Taliek one-on-one and say something special in this case? </p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of teams get that consensus No. 1 pre-season.  You talk about it.  It becomes a burden.  There's some struggles.  You say people start getting on you.  What was the secret to this team almost relaxing when it got tough and peaking late as opposed to getting more tense? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you decide to write your biography, which probably will become a best seller, what would be the title for the 1999 championship in Tampa and the victory of tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the difference for you, reflect on that, between the two titles, especially in the wake of having cancer surgery? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you attempt to maybe put into context, about 22 years ago you used to joke with your assistants at Northeastern about going to the Final Four, getting up and speaking at that dinner.  Now who are it is, the dream come true.  You've coached a team from New England to two national championships.  Can you try to tie it all up?</p>
