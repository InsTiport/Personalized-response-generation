<p>	Q.  Coach, you referred last night to how many games you played here.  You've got a chance to tie Coach Thompson and Georgetown.  This is an important tournament for you.  Tell me about it.</p>
<p>	Q.  You said a couple times you questioned their toughness, that you have kids maybe you don't want to take home to dinner.</p>
<p>	Q.  Ben, second night in a row you've gotten 29.  Can you go a third night in a row? </p>
<p>	Q.  If you do, you'll set a new tournament record, surpassing Allen Iverson.  Can you reflect on that.</p>

<p>	Q.  Is Emeka getting on you about messing with his Player-of-the-Year candidacy? </p>
<p>	Q.  How does it feel to win so dominatingly without him? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jim, how troublesome was it for you when Villanueva suffers these injuries, and what is the extent of it and what is the impact? </p>
<p>	Q.  It was about the extent of the injury. </p>
<p>	Q.  For Ben and Taliek, this is the third straight year Connecticut and Pittsburgh meet for this championship.  That's never happened in 25 years of BIG EAST play.  Can you talk about the rivalry or sense you get that's developing between these two programs? </p>
<p>	Q.  Top that, Ben.</p>
<p>	Q.  Reflect on the assist record, Taliek, what it means for you to get it on this floor. </p>
