<p>	Q.  How hard was it for you to sit out the first half? </p>

<p>	Q.  Can you talk about what it means to you to beat a team like Duke, especially when towards the end it looks like Duke had the game under control? </p>

<p>	Q.  Can you tell us about the play of the game, you're minus 1 and you take the ball away from Luol Deng to score in traffic.  Phenomenal play. </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you want the ball at the end?  Did you tell coach, your teammates, that you wanted the ball? </p>
<p>	Q.  Given your foul trouble, how important was it for you then to bring the team back in the second half the way you did? </p>
<p>	Q.  How difficult a game was it to play in when the whistle was blowing every 15 seconds?  Never seemed like you could get any kind of rhythm or flow.  You have to play through it.  How hard is it to play through it when something like that happens? </p>

<p>	Q.  Jim, you said if it was plus nine you were going to put him back in.  Did you feel while you were watching the game that even though it didn't get to plus nine, that somehow they were gaining confidence and taking control of the game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Guys, obviously this game takes a lot out of you physically.  As you were walking up on stage, looked like you were emotionally spent.  How much emotionally does a game like this take out of you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Ben, Coach Calhoun has spent the last couple of days talking about how much the team learned and perhaps proved to itself when it was playing games with Emeka out.  Can you explain about the attitude for those 16 minutes in the first half when you did play without him, somehow stayed close, stayed in the game? </p>

<p>	Q.  You've obviously coached a team to a national championship at this point in time.  Coming off of a game like this, how hard is the challenge of trying to get the focus onto the next game after expending this type of energy?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does an early season game matter, the fact that you've played these guys?  Is it so long ago, it's a different year? </p>
<p>	Q.  What was the difference in your defense the last couple minutes?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is it good for the game to have 44 fouls called in a Final Four game? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked a little bit about sitting Emeka.  Could you talk about the end result of that, with him being in at the end of the game, and Marcus White is not.  The second part is you mentioned a hard two-foul rule?  When did you start that?  Has that always been in your coaching repertoire? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you expand upon the play of Emeka Okafor in the second half, but particularly down the stretch when he simply would not allow your basketball team to lose? </p>
