<p>	Q.  Given how well Ben Gordon has played all year, can you explain what's happened to him in the post-season, Big East and NCAA tournament? </p>
<p>	Q.  People are saying this is going to be a fast-paced transition-oriented game, that that favors you.  Do you believe that?  What kind of game do you expect?</p>
<p>	Q.  As a veteran who has kind of been through a number of tournaments, are there some common threads, components that a team needs to get to this point and ultimately win it all?  Can you tie that to your team? </p>
<p>	Q.  Maybe I'm getting too old, not sleeping enough, but I don't remember the last time two teams met in a game like this where each point guard had won over a hundred games.  Your take on that.  I'm sure if I ask you to choose who you'd take, you'd take your guy, but tell me why. </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you sort of chronicle the problems that Emeka Okafor has had through the year with his health, his back, how has that affected your season?  Could you talk about what you've seen in Shelden Williams' development throughout the NCAA tournament for Duke? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you were recruiting Emeka Okafor, did you get a chance to see some of the other kids coming out of Houston around that time?  Any general thoughts you might have on the talent level of some of the Texas kids. </p>
<p>	Q.  Emeka Okafor you mentioned graduating in two and a half, three years, why is it so difficult for other student athletes in an elite program to get out in five or six years?</p>
<p>	Q.  Four. </p>


<p>	Q.  Taliek, you've won more than a hundred games in your Connecticut career?   Duhon has also won more than a hundred games.  On this team, you're not a star.  On his team, maybe he's a marginal star.  What would you say to him if you could talk to him about what your roles are and do you appreciate what he's done in his career? </p>
<p>	Q.  There was a point in your career in high school when teams didn't really even guard you because of your limited offensive skills.  Where are you now in terms of do you see you being the focus of a team's defense, in conference play especially? </p>
<p>	Q.  Now. </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you update us on your condition?  What are you doing to physically prepare yourself?  How vital do you see yourself to your team's success for tomorrow? </p>
<p>	Q.  What are your memories of going against Shelden Williams in some camps, what you know about him as a player, what you see in him going into this game tomorrow night? </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm sure you and John at Bel Aire talked about the dream of playing college basketball.  What is that like for you two to be at the biggest stage in college basketball?  Have you talked about that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you plan on zipping through college as fast as you apparently are doing it?  How easy is it for you to balance your classroom demands with your athletic demands? </p>
<p>	Q.  Ben, a lot of guys talk about needing to step up, whether it's during the season or post-season.  You've done it the last couple, three weeks.  How did you do that?  Coach Calhoun even said in the past you had the nickname Gentle Ben, not always complimentary, because he wanted you to be more assertive.  Can you just talk about how you've shed that and been more assertive? </p>
<p>	Q.  Ben, much of the pre-Final Four talk has been about your game tomorrow, not the other game.  Could you take a look at that Duke team, the match-up you have between each other as a team? </p>
<p>	Q.  Take a look at the match-up of the two teams, Duke and Connecticut, how you match up against each other. </p>
<p>	Q.  Taliek, did you ever play against Chris in any AAU ball?  What do you a admire most about his game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Ben, Taliek, you guys are a little older, have a lot of games between you.  Duke has a younger team.  Does that have any bearing at this point in the tournament or is it pretty much all equal? </p>
<p>	Q.  Taliek, you said earlier this year when you broke the assist record, "I guess I did something in my career."  Has this run kind of validated you from past criticisms? </p>
<p>	Q.  Taliek, how your season ended last year, does this season? </p>
