 Q. How are you doing? 
 JAMEER NELSON: I'm fortunate to be here. Even though I'm not playing, the atmosphere for me is different in terms of being involved in all this other stuff this week.

 Q. Now that you are an All-Star, how is it going to be difficult?
 JAMEER NELSON: I am the same person. I got to do the media obligations. I have to do certain things I wouldn't do if I was just here enjoying the weekend. 
 I understand in the All-Star, you have got more responsibilities and more people being around you and do things with you. I'm up for everything.

 Q. Curious, with a point guard play, the leadership skills it takes to be a point guard, is that something you can teach someone or -- like Baron Davis when he was in high school he played college guys?
 JAMEER NELSON: It is natural being a point guard. It is definitely natural. One thing you have to realize is a lot of people don't want to be the guy you tell what to do, no matter how old they are. It is just natural. You got to be comfortable with it.

 Q. If you had to trace when you felt like you could become a leader on the court, would it be grade school? High school? 
 JAMEER NELSON: All my life. I was always -- when I played sports, I was always like a pitcher or a quarterback, point guard. I was always in a leadership role in terms of my position. 

 Q. When you don't want a guy shooting, is there a subtle perhaps way --
 JAMEER NELSON: You never tell a shooter not to shoot or a scorer not to score. As a point guard you are trying to make it easier for them to get shots.
