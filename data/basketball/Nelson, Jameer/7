 Q. Do you think you will get to play in The Finals?
 JAMEER NELSON: I have no idea. I have no idea who's going to make that decision and when they're going to make it. But it's not up to me.

 Q. Do you feel good? We've seen you over the last few weeks working out, rehabbing. 
 JAMEER NELSON: I feel pretty good working out and rehabbing. I felt pretty good yesterday in terms of practicing and taking hits. My confidence is high. But like I said, it's up to the organization and ownership and all those guys to make the decisions. 

 Q. You're healed, they gave you the go-ahead?
 JAMEER NELSON: For the most part, yeah. I think everything is -- you're always at risk when you step on the basketball court, no matter if you're injured or not. But like I said, I'm continuing rehab. I'm stronger than I probably could imagine right now three months ago, three months ago. I'm not going to go out there and do anything stupid. If I'm not ready, I'm not ready. And the team knows when I'm ready and when I'm not.

 Q. Was there a turning point in this when it became a possibility? Did you have a feeling during Game 6 that if we do advance you have a chance to play?
 JAMEER NELSON: Well, I'm a competitor. I wanted to play last series, but I couldn't. I want to play this series. 
 If I can't, I can't. 

 Q. How many minutes could you go? 
 JAMEER NELSON: I'm not sure. If I step on the court and I'm competing, you never know what can happen. But like I said, we haven't come across that yet, so it's a little premature for me to answer that question.
