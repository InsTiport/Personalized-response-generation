  Q. Did Coach talk to you about tomorrow night's game?   
 JAMEER NELSON: No, I just think it's going to go game by game, however he feels. I don't think anything is scripted, I don't think anything is etched in stone.   
  
  Q. Coach said it may have been a mistake to play you for 12 minutes.   
 JAMEER NELSON: He said it was a mistake? I don't know. However many minutes I'm going to play as hard as I can. It's not about complaining for anything, it's about going out there and playing your minutes whenever you get them.   
  
  Q. How did you feel about playing 12 minutes straight?  
 JAMEER NELSON: Well, I was a little bit surprised. But like I said, if I'm out there, I'm out there for a reason, and I'm going to do my job as best I can.   
  
  Q. Did it take something out of it?  
 JAMEER NELSON: No, it probably helped me out more than taking anything out of me. Even though we lost the game, you definitely can take positives out of it individually and collectively as a team.   
  
  Q. What's it like to be at this point, one game in?  
 JAMEER NELSON: It's a good feeling. Obviously you don't want to come out and lose Game 1, especially the way we did, but we've handled adversity well previously and all year, and this is not a time to let up right now.
