  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 JAMEER NELSON: You still don't know what to expect. The thing is I think everything is on the fly and it's not scripted or anything like that. One thing we have to do is whenever we're given the opportunity to play, we've got to go out there and play to our best ability. If it's two minutes or 12 minutes you go out there and play them all.   
  
  Q. Just being back on the court after four months, do you feel like you're back riding the bike again?  
 JAMEER NELSON: Well, I mean, my rhythm was off a little bit, but one thing, just go out there and play basketball and play hard, obviously you can do a lot of things different, a lot of things better, and I will on Sunday, but we just have to worry about not making mistakes and just play hard.  
  
  Q. Is that the toughest thing you've ever had to do in your life, coming back after four months like that?  
 JAMEER NELSON: Probably one of the tougher things, but obviously it's something I can handle. If I couldn't handle it, the organization, they wouldn't put me out there in that situation.  
  
  Q. And for it to end up going like that with a 25-point loss, is that any cause for second-guessing on your part or anybody else's?  
 JAMEER NELSON: No, not at all. You can't put the game on one person or one particular player. It's a team thing, and we have to make adjustments as a team. People are going to question whether I should have come back or whether I messed up the rotation, X, Y, Z, but for me I don't listen to any of those things.   
 One thing I know is my organization has confidence in me and the rest of my teammates, and they're going to put us in a situation to be successful.
