Michigan State - 67, Wisconsin - 55   
GREG GARD: Obviously disappointed in the outcome.  We could never overcome the start and couldn't get back after they got hot at the beginning, and I thought we did a good job of battling back at the end of the first half. Second half obviously extending a lot of it at that 6, 7, 8, 9 point differential, and too many opportunities given back to them, whether it was a key offensive rebound, even though they only had eight, or a foul, it extended the possession, and then they do what good teams do, they make you pay for it. We've got to make shots.  We had some really good looks.  Need to be able to score inside and out, and we weren't consistent enough inside, and obviously really struggled from the perimeter, even though we had some really good looks.  We'll learn from this.  Had a really good regular season, for this group to go 23-10 and be in the position they've been and the schedule they've played and put themselves in position for postseason play, so we'll look forward to seeing what happens tomorrow and continue to get better and see how long we can play in the next tournament.   
 Q.  Was that pretty much the difference in the game?  Rebounding was minus-14 for you guys and going 2-for-19 from the three-point line?  
GREG GARD: Well, yeah, they're going to have a differential of plus-14 when we don't make shots.  That's a lot of defensive rebounds coming off that they can grab. I thought for the most part, we did a decent job of keeping them off the glass.  They got a couple key ones there late, and then that four-, five-minute mark, three-minute mark where we were trying -- I think we were down nine at that point, or 11, but you've got to make some shots.  As big as physical as they are in the paint, if you get isolated in there -- and we weren't able to convert near enough -- but when they did collapse, like I said, we had some good looks.  You've got to make those pay because that forces them to separate a little bit more, spread out a little bit more and maintain focus, which is much help inside.
