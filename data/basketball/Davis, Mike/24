<p>	Q.  Coach, was there at all a time in the last couple weeks where you really sensed this team can make a championship run or has this sort of snuck up on everyone by surprise? </p>
<p>	Q.  When your team was 7-5, what was your feeling about the team at that time?  Did you do anything different to get them back on track? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said yesterday that the players liked you a lot.  Is that sort of relationship important now, given the way society is changing, the way it's more difficult to motivate people?  Is fear and intimidation going out as a way of coaching? </p>
<p>	Q.  You're here in your second year as a head coach.  You're coaching against a guy who is here for the first time after like 25 years as a head coach.  How much perspective does that give you on this whole experience, or do you have perspective already? </p>
<p>	Q.  A lot is made about teams having players that only stay a year or two, then go to the pros.  Obviously these two teams both have a lot of experience with seniors in their starting lineup.  How much has that experienced help you guys get to where you are now?  How important do you think it is to have at this time a bunch of seniors on the floor? </p>
<p>	Q.   When you were coaching at Miles College for $200, could you see it going on?  Were there any low points where you thought this couldn't go anywhere? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned before if your team was to win a National Championship, you were hoping for a raise. </p>
<p>	Q.  In the last couple years it has not been unusual for NBA teams to look for college coaches that have that kind of success.  How would you handle that kind of conversation? </p>
<p>	Q.  Your team seems to have gained confidence as it's gone along week after week, game after game in the tournament.  How important is that?  How has it carried your team?  How has it changed your team?  When you're down or something, how has it helped you keep your composure? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about how you spent your evening last night after the game, what it was like for you emotionally?  Did you get a lot of sleep?  Who did you spend your time with? </p>
<p>	Q.  If I could ask you a bit about emerging from this legacy of Mr.  Knight.  I tried to ask you that a little bit yesterday.  I think that's something people are going to be talking about tomorrow with the fact that Indiana is in the championship game.  Will a victory make a complete break and make you emerge completely from any shadow because of what Bobby Knight has been in Indiana? </p>
<p>	Q.  You had a lot of success recruiting the south, the deep south.  I'm wondering, what were you able to do to have so much success and what flavor has that added to your team to have so many southern players? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about a raise.  Has Miles or Terry or anybody from the administration talked to you about a raise?  Has your agent talked to IU about tearing up your contract and doing something? </p>
<p>	Q.  Everyone has been talking about battling adversity.  You have battled some adversity since you became head coach.  How much did growing up with the stutter and battling that teach you about adversity? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said last night that you can't measure heart with a team.  Have you ever had a team or played on a team that has comparable heart to this one? </p>
<p>	Q.  Going back to Miles College, talk about how you supported your family financially and the inventory in the trunk of your car during those days? </p>
<p>	Q.  I believe when you got the job at Indiana, there was initially talk about you and Coach Treloar being co-coaches.  If I'm correct on that, can you discuss how it was decided you would be the head coach and him the assistant?  Talk about the way you two have worked together.  I know there was talk initially that he might even be the guy.  Do you expect to be able to keep him, given the success of your team, the appeal he might have to schools that have openings? </p>
<p>	Q.  Describe the little Alabama town where you grew up, what important ways that shaped you. </p>
<p>	Q.  When you guys beat Duke, your reaction was kind of like a kid in a toy store.  Last night it was more subdued calmness.  What do you think your reaction will be if you win tomorrow night? </p>
<p>	Q.  It seems as if the front courts in this game might have a bit of a contrast.  Maryland has the big, thick, strong guys.  You have guys who can step away from the basket and play a little bit.  Which type of big guy do you personally favor?  Can you talk about that a bit? </p>
<p>	Q.  On Miles College, were you in a league?  What was the name of it?  What were some of the trips you took?  Where did you coach in the CBA? </p>


<p>	Q.  In what sense would you say you put your stamp on the way Indiana plays?  The team was established in some ways when you already got there.  What would you say Mike Davis has influenced most? </p>
<p>	Q.  What are your general thoughts about Maryland?  What makes this team special, what makes them tick? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there any truth or basis to a story that two years ago Coach Knight called and asked you not to take the job, offered to maybe even pay a year's salary for you to sit out? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about, are you not practicing today because it's Easter or is that your usual schedule?  You've gone on record a couple times saying, "Coaching is overrated."  Do you really believe that or do you think coaches really do get too much credit? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said you're not a traditional coach.  There's several examples of that.  Are you coaching, are you doing this on gut instinct?  Secondly, you said we have no idea what you go through.  We'd like an idea, if you could share it. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about what it's like leading this team to the point of some of the other great teams in IU history? </p>
<p>	Q.  One last thing about your stutter.  Did you actually have to change football positions because of it?  How did you conquer it?  How proud are you?  Do you still fight it? </p>
<p>	Q.  What did you learn from playing for CM Newton and Wimp that have helped you as a coach?  Can you compare Wimp's style to Coach Knight's style? </p>
<p>	Q.  How far back do your ties go, your relationship with Dave Dickerson?  Is that the first time you ever called him, when you asked about the Duke strategy?  Describe your relationship with him. </p>
