<p>	Q.  Mike, can you talk a little bit about how do you contain or stop a guy like Hollis Price who has just been on fire the whole month of March for the Sooners in both the big 12 and NCAA tournaments and what he brings to the table and have you coached against someone like that before?</p>
<p>	Q.  Two-part question on Dane Fife.  What has happened this year that's allowed him to realize that some of the offense is potential -- I know a lot of people are on him.  What about the ways that his personality and attitude, particularly the way he attacks how has that rubbed off on his teammates?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can I ask the obligatory update on Tom Coverdale and last weekend in Lexington he had said before the Duke game he was like 65 percent.  Just what do you think his chances are this weekend?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just as a quick follow-up, anyone on that team that can get out there, I would guess you'd think it would be him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is some of the toughness for this team maybe some of the things that it's had to go through maybe the last two years, which it has a unique mental toughness?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is that something that obviously there's a lot of talk and there's some people it's still a divided situation as far as Indiana maybe some peoples' loyalties, as far as distractions, is this the kind of team that usually handles distractions; doesn't let that sort of stuff bother them?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you look at Oklahoma - I know your team is known for toughness and you play in a tough league, but they are known for toughness.  I wonder, they look like you in terms of toughness and the other thing, what are your impressions of Magee and what kind of problems he might pose?</p>
<p>	Q.  We had some history made this week, I guess the Academy Awards with Denzell Washington and Halle Berry. You look at this matchup, I believe this is the first time that two minority coaches have ever faced each other at the Final Four.  Any significance to that in your mind?  Is that another hurdle knocked down?</p>
<p>	Q.  In this year Coach Richardson made that such a topic and it became such a controversial point again.  Are there aspects of being, in your mind, a minority coach in any realm in college basketball that still makes it harder?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is something you could probably go on for hours about, but I am just wondering if you could maybe capsulize how difficult it has been back there to replace an icon like Bob Knight?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you have a low point?</p>
<p>	Q.  What was the most important things you learned from Coach Knight and what do you think you changed most about the program?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you heard from him this year or even since taking over?</p>
<p>	Q.  Disappointed about that, would you like to talk  with him about the transition?</p>
<p>	Q.  What were some of those low points this year and last year that you just talked about a little bit and where did they come from?</p>
