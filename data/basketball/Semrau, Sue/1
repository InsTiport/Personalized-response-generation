NC State - 71, Florida State - 66
THE MODERATOR: Good afternoon and welcome to the 2020 ACC basketball tournament championship game press conference. I'm joined by head coach Sue Semrau and No. 15, Kiah Gillespie. Coach?
SUE SEMRAU: It was a great championship game, the largest lead by either team was 6. It was great for ACC basketball. It's great for women's basketball and I love this team. We battled. We fought and came up short. Got a lot of season left, though.
Q. For both of you, can you talk about the crowd and if it had any impact that you know of?
KIAH GILLESPIE: No. I mean, we're in North Carolina, where in NC state is from, so it's expected that they bring a large crowd and they do that. We play for each other. Not don't really see the people in the stands. Good for them, but, yeah, we got each other.
SUE SEMRAU: I think the last thing I would say is congrats to NC state. They've had a great year. Wes has done a great job and I know we've both gone through our ups and downs and really happy for his team.
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
