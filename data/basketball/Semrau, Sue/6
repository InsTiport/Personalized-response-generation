Notre Dame 90, Florida State 80
AMY YAKOLA: Coach, when you're ready an opening statement, please.
SUE SEMRAU: Yeah, Notre Dame, I thought did a great job of penetration.  They got a lot of foul calls as a result.  We need to learn how to be a little bit more disciplined defensively, but we followed the game plan.  We gave ourselves a really great shot at it and those two back breakers by Mabrey, again, you don't expect that.
But I'm really proud of my team, and just the way that they fought and played together till the end.  I think we grew, and I told them that, you know, sometimes pain and failure is a better teacher than success.  So we look forward to the NCAA Tournament.
Q. The first time you guys played them, it really was a struggle.  What did you guys do better today to be in a position where you're up eight in the third quarter and in a position to really put the pressure on them?
SUE SEMRAU: Everything.  We were more prepared.  It was the first time that -- we had a record crowd.  We had not played in a week.  You know, it was just, the moment was a little bit big for us, and I didn't feel like we had the fight that.  We learned from that game.  We grew and we're going to continue to grow.
Thanks for coming.
Q. You guys were in a position, like I was just asking Coach, and Mabrey hits the three right at the end of the third quarter, you guys were still in it, but that's when they seemed to really pick up.  What happened in the fourth quarter when they began to assert control?
SHAKAYLA THOMAS: We didn't change anything that we did.  I feel like we played tremendous defense and you're going to make shots.  From my understanding, we shade shots, too, so, hey.
AMY YAKOLA: Thanks very much.  Good look in the NCAAs.
