<p>	Q.  This is kind of a two-part question.  How much of the diversity is caused by the fact that the NCAA doesn't really control football?  Did the NCAA make a mistake long ago by not going to a playoff format before the BCS got involved? </p>
<p>	Q.  Two questions.  As you enter your last year, do you have a major regret that you weren't able to accomplish during your tenure?  Second, what will you miss most about not having the job? </p>
<p>	Q.  To go back to the funding dilemma that you talked about, would you go as far as to say colleges are overspending on revenue sports and sacrificing non-revenue sports, given what we've seen in the past few weeks? </p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering about your stance  -- I think there's something coming up in April for a vote, student athletes being able to borrow money, I think the figure was $20,000, kind of your stance on that, and how student athletics may eventually get a stipend and stuff like that. </p>
<p>	Q.  Talking about the problem with money, we're at an event that next September is going to start kicking in a $6 million contract with CBS.  A lot of people would look at that and say, "What's the problem here?"  You have an event that generates an awful lot of money.  Can you see the irony there and how important will it be to get this money distributed in a proper way? </p>
<p>	Q.  The last couple years the topic of gambling in Nevada on NCAA events has been very hot.  It's been kind of inconspicuous so far today.  In your final year as NCAA head, are you going to continue to pursue this with the people in Congress?  Also on kind of a related thing, the NCAA seemed last year to bar tournaments being played at facilities that have sports books in Nevada.  Is there any chance of some compromise being reached where a promoter could come in and still maybe put on a tournament in Las  Vegas where there is a sports book, even if it's segregated from the property? </p>
<p>	Q.  As far as the tournaments being played in a facility that does have a sports book, I know it's not a problem in Connecticut where there's no sports wagering, but there is a casino.  As long as there's no sports book, it's okay to hold an event at a location that has a casino? </p>
<p>	Q.  What are your thoughts on what's happened at the University of Michigan with the Fab Five and what this does to the image of intercollegiate athletics? </p>
<p>	Q.  Last year there were two student athletes who died in off-season voluntary conditioning programs with their football programs.  Does the NCAA need to take a look at voluntary off-season workouts, not just necessarily for football?  What about the gamut of issues like death benefits and just health benefits if a student athlete is long-term disabled? </p>

<p>	Q.  The financial crisis that you outlined, what in your mind are possible solutions, and are those solutions best addressed at the institutional or the association level? </p>
<p>	Q.  This is a wonderful event that most of us probably think is the best sporting event ever.  Yet I have sought for two years to find some logic for the expansion to 65 teams as if 34 at-large teams is some sort of a magic number.  Most of the criticism for those who don't like the expansion to 65 is they didn't want to reduce to 33 at-large teams because one of your 48 schools most likely would lose that slot.  Whether that's fair or not, at least it's out there.  But what's the logic to having 65?  Why not just go back to 33 at-larges? </p>
<p>	Q.  What is your level of awareness on the academic fraud allegations at LSU?  Is this an area where the NCAA is perhaps unable to be as vigilant as it should be because you're so dependent on self-reporting? </p>
<p>	Q.  With the academic proposals that are becoming before the management council and board, I imagine you have endorsed what the consultants have proposed pretty strongly.  That is fair? </p>
<p>	Q.  I guess you do.  The academic consultants on the new initial and continuing eligibility proposal. </p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering your views on the pod system that the committee used?  There's been some controversy, some coaches liked it, some didn't.  Your views on it this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  The tournament has expanded quite a bit in terms of the size of the field, the revenue brought in, the amount of travel prior to this year anyway.  Is bigger always better when it comes to this tournament?  Particularly, the Final Four event, have you reached a point where this is about as big as you want it to be? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned you think the NCAA really can't do anything, it's up to the schools maybe to take responsibility on some of this fiscal stuff.  It's a competitive situation.  If an alumni gives $25 million for a workout facility at school A, then school B is going to want to do that.  If a school wants to pay a coach a certain amount of money, more than his current job, that's going to happen.  It's kind of the American way.  I don't really  -- do you think there's any way that can be changed?  If there was some cap put on it, it seems like there would be anti-trust or collusion allegations thrown about. </p>
<p>	Q.  On the pod system, a specific situation was Ohio State being seeded fourth.  It was sent two time zones away, and it would have stayed out west the weekend before  -- or Finals week at Ohio State, if it would have advanced.  Is there pretty much an acknowledgment in this system that it's not fool-proof and that every year somebody is going to have to bite the bullet?</p>
<p>	Q.  I believe the first time this spring basketball coaches won't be able to recruit at certain AU tournaments if they're not approved by state high school associations.  I'm wondering why you're putting that responsibility on the high school associations and not have you guys do it yourselves.  The associations in Rhode Island, for example, they say it's not their job, never been their job, they don't even know what an AU tournament is.  If you can respond to that. </p>
