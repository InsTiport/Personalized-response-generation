 Q.  I wanted to talk to you about the evolution of your perimeter game. You went from below 30 percent from three-point range last year to north of 40 percent this year. How did you do it, and how significant do you think that is in getting your game to translate at the WNBA level?  
TE'A COOPER: I did it by just staying in the gym. That gave me a lot more confidence. With there being a need on the team that I was on, I knew I had to knock down that shot. Just believing in myself and continuously working on it in the gym is what made me more efficient in my three-point shot. I think that going into the league I'm going to have to do the exact same, work on scoring on all three levels and utilizing my mid-range pull-up and driving to the basket. I think that my shot will be very beneficial for me when I go up there.
