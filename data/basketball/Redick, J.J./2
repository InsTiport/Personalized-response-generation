 Q.  How big was the lift the bench gave you guys tonight, multiple times they sparked big runs and kind of changed the game?  
J.J. REDICK: The bench was great tonight.  You can go down the line one by one, all of them made a ton of just great individual effort plays.  Cole, Wes, obviously Jamal and Austin offensively were great.  Cole was great offensively.  But each one of them just gave a superb effort tonight.   
 Q.  D.J., over the course of the years in regular season games, how tough is it to play at Portland?  And how do you expect it to be back home?  
DEANDRE JORDAN: It's extremely tough.  They have a great crowd and they play well at home.  But we did what we were supposed to do, come out here and protect our home court.  I'm pretty sure they're being told the same thing, to come out and win at home.  We just have to keep the same mindset and play like we did in the second half.  A little bit more intensity, urgency on the defensive end and we'll be fine.   
 Q.  J.J., the heel that you hurt last Tuesday, you've played two games now.  Do you feel like that's going to be a factor going forward?  
J.J. REDICK: It's something that I have to continue to monitor and take care of.  To be honest, it's very sore, and after Sunday's game it was pretty sore the last few days.  So it's just something that hopefully will heal, but it's going to take time.
