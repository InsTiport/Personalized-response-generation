<p>	Q.  Either of you, could you address the rough spots that Chris Duhon went through last year, could you just talk about that and how he's improved as a player, how he has come together as a person since his struggles of last year. </p>
<p>	Q.  The perception here is that Connecticut is sort of the team to beat.  Considering everything that Duke has accomplished, your guys' mystique, does that surprise you?  Why do you think most people are sort of on the Connecticut bandwagon right now? </p>
<p>	Q.  UConn's guard place is one of their strengths.  Just break down their guards, what skills they bring, and what kind of match-up problems they're going to have? </p>
<p>	Q.  Thought about having all the guys from back home here at this event, having this event in San Antonio, just the Texas connection, all the kids from Houston. </p>
<p>	Q.  How do you feel about your shot right now?  Is your confidence still high? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can both you guys address most of the time the perception of Duke is the flash, that style of play in terms of not being physically tough.  Can you address the defense that you guys play, how important it's going to be in tomorrow's game? </p>

<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about the shooter's mentality.  When you go through a slump like you were dealing with at the end of the season in the ACC tournament, how does that help you just confront that and keep pushing through it, knowing that, as you were saying, that shot is going to keep falling? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you like the fact that this is the game that people are talking about tomorrow, that you do get the favorites right away? </p>




<p>	Q.  The NCAA told us publicly yesterday they finally cleared up the Maggette incident.  When did you hear about it, your reaction to it? </p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of times we talk about, "This guy is going to be a great pro."  There's a lot of great college players.  I don't know if Duhon is going to be a great pro, but he's a great college player.  What is the distinction when you look at kids, you know they're a great college player, maybe not a pro? </p>
<p>	Q.  There's a very good match-up of centers in this game that you probably don't see as much in college anymore. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think that "centers" can develop as well in college now as maybe they could 15 years ago, before the 3-pointer, all those things became such a big factor?</p>
<p>	Q.  In the way you approach this week and prepare for this weekend, just feel about this week, how much difference is there in the tenth time around from the first time around? </p>
<p>	Q.  You have a point guard who has won 123 games.  He has one that has won 101, 102.  It's rare. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you see similarities, differences?  You spoke before about Chris.  I'm sure if I asked you to pick one, you'd pick Chris.  But why?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you watch tape of Connecticut, do you see a point where they have taken it up a notch from being a good team to what you've kind of described as a really, really good team? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mike, an unusual situation, the No. 2 seed is generally perceived as the favorite in this game.  Does that surprise you?  Is that a motivating factor for your players? </p>
<p>	Q.  What is Nick's role sort of evolved to on this team?  Obviously, when he came, he probably hoped that he would see the floor more than he has.  Now playing in the Final Four after sitting on the bench hurt in his hometown the last time you were here. </p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously there's always some shading. </p>
<p>	Q.  Shading, in terms of big men that guard in the post. </p>
<p>	Q.  Is Okafor a man that demands a double team?  Can you talk about the college game in general where there's not many guys that demand a double team? </p>
<p>	Q.  What did you see in Ben Gordon when you were recruiting him a few years back?  What do you see in him now, especially his play in the post-season? </p>
<p>	Q.  As a veteran of the Final Four 10 times, what does it take to get here?  Do you think ultimately the best team always wins this tournament? </p>
<p>	Q.  How different has the mood of the team been from last week in Atlanta when they were prohibitive favorites against Xavier, to today where somebody expects you guys to lose? </p>
