  COACH DAWKINS:   We are excited to still be playing, playing into April.   To be playing for a championship tomorrow is something that's very special.   And I know we have a big challenge ahead of us and they are a very talented team.  
Just really happy for our guys, especially our seniors.   They have an opportunity to play for a championship in Madison Square Garden.   What an amazing opportunity.   
   
 Q.   Because you have quite a few veterans on this team, what is it about this team that clearly they were interested in extending their season.   Sometimes with an older team, it may be a letdown to be in the NIT but they have clearly been very engaged.   What is it about this particular group of players?  
COACH DAWKINS:   Well, I think it speaks about their leadership.   They had unfinished business.   They want to play in the postseason, of course, like everyone else in the NCAA, and it wasn't to be.   
What I really respect about them is they didn't put their heads down.   They said, you know what, you earn what you get.   We didn't earn that opportunity.   We've earned an opportunity to play in the NIT, so let's make the most out of it.   I think their leadership is instrumental, especially for our younger guys, because there are a number of them who have never experienced postseason play.   So really give our team a lot of credit.   
   
 Q.   When you played here three years ago, what were some of the things that you saw from getting those extra games and weeks of practices that might have carried over to the next season for the returning players?   
COACH DAWKINS:   I think it's important to play on this stage and to make it this far; you have to win four games in a row to play in the championship game in the tournament.   
So for us, we took a lot from it.   I thought it really helped us last year.   We ended up making our run to the Sweet16.   It really helped us because our guys got familiar going into postseason and what you had to do with your preparation and how long the season will go.   So I thought it was great.   
And just the overall experience of playing one‑and‑done situations where every game could be your last.   To play multiple games like that, that's really hard and seasons you and prepares you well for when you are in that position again.   
   
 Q.   Coach LarraÃ±aga talked about how his team is dealing with a lot of injuries; does it make it more difficult to prepare for Miami?  
COACH DAWKINS:   Absolutely.   Whenever a team is down a player or two and they are having to make adjustments, and of course, when you're trying to scout them, it becomes somewhat difficult to piece it all together.   Coach LarraÃ±aga, he's done a great job and he'll do a great job with the players that can go out there and compete.  
For us, we have to keep on studying them and trying to find something that they may try to do out there.   But it's difficult for everyone in the situation and unfortunately it happens in our sport.   
   
 Q.   What's your impression of Miami overall and just maybe the versatility they have, the way they can plug guys into different roles on the fly and just continue to be competitive the way they are?   
COACH DAWKINS:   They have some really, really good players.   Looking at their roster, they are a younger team but a team that has played really, really good in a lot of different moments.   They play in a terrific conference, and like you said, the style of play is one in which they can sub and play guys, so they have a lot of versatility in their lineup.   They have good length and size.   They have guys that can play multiple positions.   
Like I said, they have had a terrific season, and as I say, I started to prepare for them of course last night, and as we speak I'll now be preparing more afterwards.   Just watching them, they do a very good job.   They play with a lot of confidence.   They play well together and they are well coached.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you for your time and good look tomorrow night.
