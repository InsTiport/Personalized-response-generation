THE MODERATOR: If you could start out with an opening statement, your feelings about what you bring to your new team.   
JUAN HERNANGOMEZ: I've had the feelings a few times, so I'm really happy to be drafted to Denver.  I only have one word for it, for this team, and that is "thank you".  Thank you so much.  I really appreciate it.   
 Q.  Juan, Denver Nuggets were at your pro day, you put on the show, and then they drafted you.  First of all, are you coming to the NBA this year?  Is that the plan?  And what was it about the Denver Nuggets and what did they say to you?  
JUAN HERNANGOMEZ: I don't know yet.  I don't know what happened with this summer and then with the next year.  I want to keep working, and I don't know where.  For me if I got any possibilities to go to NBA with Denver, I got it.  I love Denver.  Thank you for the team.   
 Q.  Are you excited to be coming over with your brother to start your careers together in the States?  
JUAN HERNANGOMEZ: Yeah, of course.  You know, when we was child, we dreaming about the NBA.  If this year we can play together, it's a dream come true.  So really, yeah, I'm really excited.   
 Q.  There's also other brothers in the league; what do you expect it'll be like to play against them if you actually do?  
JUAN HERNANGOMEZ: It's really different to play against your brother.  I got the opportunity to play against him in the ACB and then play together in the national team.  I don't know what happened.  He's a different player, his family, but I saw a lot of games for brothers, like I saw Gasol brothers.  So we are really proud to be the next brothers.   
 Q.  How would you compare your skill set against your brother?  What are you better at?  
JUAN HERNANGOMEZ: We are different players.  He's a center, me a forward.  He does really good things, and me others.  So we can't compare the two.
