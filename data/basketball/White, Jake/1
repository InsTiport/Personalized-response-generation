WICHITA STATE   69
  MISSOURI STATE   59

THE MODERATOR: We've got a little time to kill while we wait for the Wichita State Shockers to arrive.   Wichita State Shockers go into tomorrow's 4:00 semifinal, playing the winner of the Northern Iowa/Illinois State game that comes up shortly.   Shockers are 25‑7 for the season, 3‑0 against Missouri State.
Coach Gregg Marshall is 134‑68 in his sixth season at Wichita State, 328‑151 in his 15th season overall as a collegiate head coach, 6‑5 in the MVC tournament and 4‑1 in the MVC quarters.   WSU has won its last twelve meetings against Missouri State.   Marshall is 2‑0 against MSU in the MVC, and 10‑4 over the Bears lifetime.   Marshall has won a tournament game now five years in a row.
Missouri State finishes its season at 11‑22 with the most losses the Bears have had in a season.   MSU is 22‑27 all time in this tournament.   Coach Paul Lusk is 27‑38 in his second year at MSU and and 29‑61 in his third year overall as a college head coach.   Coach Lusk is 0‑5 against WSU and 1‑2 in the MVC tournament.
Couple of notes about Marcus Marshall, MVC Freshman of the Year.   He tied and easily broke the MSU single season freshman scoring record.   He tied the mark when he buried a trey ahead of the shot clock buzzer with 19:24 left in the opening half.   He pushed his season point total to 346 to tie Blake Ahearn's scoring record from 2003‑04.   Marshall finished with 25 points, his 19th double figure scoring outing and second 20‑point game of the season.
His 25 points today are the most by a freshman in the MVC tournament since Creighton's Kyle Korver had 25 against Bradley in 2000.   And our researchers are still looking for the actual freshman record.   We're not sure about that.   But the most since Korver in 2000. 
THE MODERATOR:   And we welcome the Wichita State Shockers to the podium fresh from their victory.   Head Coach Gregg Marshall with Demetric Williams, Carl Hall and Jake White. 
Remind everyone as we have the usual protocol, we'll start with a statement from Coach Marshall and then take questions for the student‑athletes.   Remember please to raise your hand quickly.   We'll get the microphones to you from the ladies and state your name and affiliation and then direct your question appropriately.   Coach Marshall? 
COACH MARSHALL:   It's never easy, and they really battled, Missouri State.   But in the end, we were able to overcome Marcus Marshall with 25 points, and made enough plays.   I thought as a team, performance tonight, we had tremendous production from guys who, you know, played 10 to 15 minutes per game.   Tonight, they have played a little more because they played well, including Jake White, Fred Van Vleet, and Ron Baker, a guy who has missed the last 21 games. 
THE MODERATOR:   We'll open the floor to questions from Demetric Williams, Carl Hall and Jake White.   On the left here, second row.

Q.   Demetric, can you address the bounce‑back effort, getting the defensive identity back.   How did you rate tonight? 
THE MODERATOR:   Demetric, why don't you start? 
DEMETRIC WILLIAMS:   It was good.   They held them to 59, and we didn't want them to get over 60.   So I think it was a good team effort. 
THE MODERATOR:   Next question on the right side, please?

Q.   Carl, Jake, it seemed like you guys had your way with Missouri State, what front court they had.   Talk about how you guys were able to dominate together, really, on the rebounding effort. 
THE MODERATOR:   Carl, why don't you start first, please? 
CARL HALL:   I was just trying to tell Jake, just go for every rebound, because we knew the ball would bounce along.   I was trying not to get too deep.   I was trying to get, like, halfway between the free throw line and the goal, going along and I was chasing them down. 
THE MODERATOR:   Jake, your thoughts? 
JAKE WHITE:   I got to give Carl a lot of credit, because he goes to the glass every single time.   So normally, he brings, you know, two or three people with him to box him out, so leaves the weak side open a lot.   So I just capitalized on that. 
THE MODERATOR:   Other questions?

Q.   Carl, why did you know they were going long?   Rims, or rebounds going long? 
CARL HALL:   I guess because the rims were soft.   So everything was bouncing along.   It was doing that in pregame too.   So just tried to take advantage. 
THE MODERATOR:   Other questions, on the left?

Q.   Can you guys just talk about Ron Baker? 
THE MODERATOR:   Demetric, why don't you start? 
DEMETRIC WILLIAMS:   Tremendous.   We miss his three‑point shooting and he showed it tonight.   A lot of the guys in the locker room said he's back.   So, you know, he did a great job.   Helped us out as far as off the bench. 
THE MODERATOR:   Jake, why don't you take the next?
JAKE WHITE:   I thought he played tremendous tonight and it's great having, you know, one of our leaders back.   You know, he did start a majority of our games and it's great to have Ron back. 
THE MODERATOR:   Carl, anything to add? 
CARL HALL:   It helps when you got more shooters, especially when you get double‑teamed a lot on the block.   So I'm just glad to have him back. 
THE MODERATOR:   Question up front on the left.

Q.   Demetric, did you think maybe you could wear them down as the game progressed because they had to play a tough game last night? 
DEMETRIC WILLIAMS:   Most definitely.   They don't play a lot of guys like how we play, so we want to wear them down, make it hard for them on the defense‑‑ I mean on the offensive end, and a lot of guys came in and we did that.   And give credit to them because they were making some tough shots but for the most part, we did what we wanted to do on the defensive end. 
THE MODERATOR:   Second row on the left, please.

Q.   Jake, take us through that play where you grabbed Ron's miss and tossed it back in, the shot clock deal. 
JAKE WHITE:   Ron had the ball.   Knowing that the shot clock is winding down, you have to chuck up a shot, so I just fought for position early and, you know, ended up getting the ball and Mal crashed, was able to find it. 
THE MODERATOR:   Any other questions?   Hands up, front row again on the left.

Q.   Demetric, could you talk about Marcus Marshall a little bit.   For a young player, what stands out to you about him? 
DEMETRIC WILLIAMS:   He's a great jump shooter.   He looks for his shot.   They do a good job of giving him the ball and screening for him and, you know, he's just very aggressive.   And it works for him.

Q.   Coach, moving on, your thoughts on both ICU and Northern Iowa? 
THE MODERATOR:   Do we have any other questions for the student‑athletes before we get to Coach Marshall?   One more question for the student‑athletes here on the left, second row.

Q.   That offensive rebounding, kind of contagious.   You have a little success and you start going to the boards harder and harder, kind of builds on itself, maybe? 
JAKE WHITE:   Yeah.   I could say it's a rhythm thing.   But also, you also have to be willing to go to the rim every single time and you take a play off. 
THE MODERATOR:   Gentlemen, thank you.   Congratulations on the win.
Questions for Coach Marshall.   We have, again, second row on the left.

Q.   How much better did you guys get as a basketball team tonight, Gregg? 
COACH MARSHALL:   I'm not sure we got better as a basketball team at this stage of the game.   We were deeper, because we added Ron Baker back to the fold.   He's missed 21 games.   He was a big key for us tonight.   He drains three jump shots in the second half, I think.   He got a couple of easy shots for us by moving in motion.   He's one of our better defenders.
So it's interesting, lately, just the national media who‑‑ and Bob and I discussed this earlier.   No one really had seen him, and they weren't used to him.   So basically, they've been saying that we've been fully healthy now since we got Carl back, and we still have our starting two guard and our starting small forward on the sidelines.   We haven't been healthy since the eighth game of the season.
And I think now, people see what Ron Baker is capable of doing.   He's a really good player, and he does everything fairly well, if not really good.

Q.   Coach, talk about the play of Carl and Jake.   I mean, it just seemed like they had their way on the offensive end.
COACH MARSHALL:   They really did.   Carl was just the Carl that we've grown to know and love.   He was a beast around the rim and getting every conceivable second chance opportunity.   And Jake White was very good tonight.   Accurate.
And the reason I talked about it being a team effort is because Jake White picks up Cleanthony Early who wasn't playing well.   Fred Van Vleet picks up Malcolm Armstead who didn't have his best game.   Ron Baker picks up Demetric Williams who didn't have his best game.   But those guys can now bounce back and we're going to play nine, ten, eleven guys tomorrow and hopefully into Sunday.
I think if we get that far, it will pay off. 
THE MODERATOR:   Next question on the left.

Q.   Gregg, the green light, when did you get it for Baker?   You didn't seem at all hesitant to go to him tonight. 
COACH MARSHALL:   He's practiced, it's amazing.   He's missed‑‑ he played in the Tennessee game.   I think that was when we shut him down, whenever that was.   That was‑‑ I think we were 15‑1 or something like that.   No, he played 9‑1.   9‑1, that was the last game he played.
So 21 games.   How many weeks is that?   And it got to the point where three or four days ago, he was allowed to practice half court.   You know, after eight weeks, he's allowed to go half court.   And then the next day, the very next day, he's allowed to go full court.   And I'm not a doctor.   I love Todd Fagan, our trainer.   He's one of the best in the business.   But I don't understand what the 24 hours, what difference that makes to be able to go from half court one day and 24 hours later, you can go full court?   And then if you do fine on the full court deal, you can play.   So that was about three days ago.   That's when we got the green light.
There was no problems with the half court, then the full court.   And it was key that we were getting him in and getting him back out because, obviously, his wind is not making‑‑ but that's why we have great depth, and it pays the benefit of having Demetric Williams, who has had a nice year for us, sitting there to spell him. 
THE MODERATOR:   Any other questions?   Again, on the left, second row.

Q.   I guess, Ron's passing stood out to me.   Does he really help the team in that way? 
COACH MARSHALL:   He's a good basketball player.   I mentioned he can pass it.   He's one of our better defenders.   He can obviously shoot it.   I thought twice tonight, he could have gotten the old shot fake.   We don't ever seem to get that call, the old shot fake and the guy runs into him.
In the first half he got it, but they said it was on the ground in front of Missouri State's bench.   Then in the second half, he did it, no call.   I'm not saying it was a foul, but he did it again and that was the play that you mentioned, which was the last straw where it hit the‑‑ Malcolm, and Jake made the great play as it hit the bottom of the backboard, the flange, if you will, and we were able to lay it in. 
THE MODERATOR:   Another question on the left.   We're going to pass on that one.   Any other questions for Coach?   Last chance.   Last call.   Congratulations. 
COACH MARSHALL:   Thank you very much. 
THE MODERATOR:   Good luck tomorrow.   Thank you.
