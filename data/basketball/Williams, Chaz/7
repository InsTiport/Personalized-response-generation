MASSACHUSETTS   77
  GEORGE WASHINGTON - 72

COACH KELLOGG:   With the luck of the draw we were able to pull off the win and now we have to go against a very tough Temple team tomorrow night.   We got out‑rebounded by 18. 

Q.   (Inaudible).
TREY DAVIS:   It's just a blessing, I told Chaz in the huddle, I'm going to knock it down and that's what I did. 

Q.   Chaz, can you talk about the final seconds, and how much this game and the win meant to you, being from Brooklyn? 
CHAZ WILLIAMS:   You know, nobody wants to come in and lose on the first night, so, you know, going to do everything in our power to come out with this victory. 
Whatever my team needed me to do, I wasn't making shots early on‑‑ I needed to pick up‑‑

Q.   And what it meant. 
CHAZ WILLIAMS:   It means a lot, my daughter was in the stands, my grandmother, that means a lot for me, finally get to see my family. 

Q.   When it opens up like that, does everything kind of slow down for you in the moment, or does it blur by when you're just banging on shots? 
TREY DAVIS:   It was regular.   I didn't feel no different way, I just wanted to win the game so we could play tomorrow really.   That's about it. 

Q.   Trey, two years ago, you were going to go to GW, did that factor into your mind? 
TREY DAVIS:   No, actually I just wanted to win the game, because I want to go to the NCAA Tournament and I just want to keep winning so I can go. 

Q.   After TV and Cady fouled out, there was a huddle, what did you say to rally around?   That's when you really sparked the comeback. 
CHAZ WILLIAMS:   Both our big guys is out right now, we just do it as a team‑‑ we understood that and if we win tonight, we play again and we really wanted to play again.   We just really pulled together with each other and that's how it's going to be.

Q.   What was your reaction when you got the ball‑‑
CHAZ WILLIAMS:   You know, I believe in the kid a lot so when I saw him open, I knew he was going to make the shot.   Just had to get him in the right spot.   I have a lot of trust in Trey. 

Q.   Do you feel like you guys are getting caught staring at the rim when the shot goes up? 
CHAZ WILLIAMS:   You know, we have athletic guys, so you know, we try to use our athleticism to go to the rebounds instead of boxing out.   Coach talked all week in practice about boxing out‑‑ we knew we had to hit some more bodies tonight.

Q.   How crucial is that going to be tomorrow? 
CHAZ WILLIAMS:   It's going to be real crucial.   Temple has big guys, they can rebound like us, so just have to go in there and just rebound and do what we have to do. 

Q.   You've had some success against those guys, if I remember you had a really big game against them, and then they got you by one this year; what do you remember about the last two meetings and what are you guys going to have to do against Temple tomorrow? 
CHAZ WILLIAMS:   You knowIsaiah (ph) he's an awesome player; we just have to stop them and once you cut the head off the train, everything starts moving.   So just have to come out with the victory. 

Q.   Did you learn anything from the first time, having to guard him? 
CHAZ WILLIAMS:   Oh, yeah, without a doubt.   You watch film, you learn from that and Coach giving inputs and just watch game film tonight and just learn more. 

Q.   Being that you're from Brooklyn, was there pressure being in your own backyard and performing here? 
CHAZ WILLIAMS:   No added pressure.   Just wanted to go out there and play basketball and help my team win.   I guess I was a little too anxious with my beginning, I don't know where my head was in the beginning.   I felt like I was there, but tomorrow hopefully I'm settled down and all the jitters and everything is out and ready to play. 

Q.   Can you talk aboutthe ‑‑ (Inaudible).
COACH KELLOGG:   That's a good word; I probably can't use it.   He's showed a lot of character this year, and it shows coming down the stretch here.   He has not really complained about playing time where a lot of freshmen think they should play more, and he's come in and worked hard every day and he's been able to go against Chaz and really play against him and that's made him a better player. 
I think his character as a person, as a kid who has persevered some and even last year going to prep school is kind of starting to come through.   He's more confident than maybe he is good as a player, if that makes any sense.   He just feels like he's really good and he feels like he's as good as anybody in the league, and at times he plays that way, which is a good trait to have. 

Q.   Can you just talk about the last 2:30? 
COACH KELLOGG:   The game got moving, which we really tried to do all game long was get it moving where it wasn't stopped for one reason or another, or I thought our guys did a better job in the press. 
We had a lot more energy and we made some shots.   We had to make some shots, because we were not rebounding the ball quite as well as I would have liked or anticipated after our week of practice. 
That was actually UMASS basketball at our finest when we are making some 3s and getting our press.   They took a couple quicker shots, and I think Coach might have wanted them to do and now the game was put on the floor more in the players' hands than from the sidelines.

Q.   Was there anything tactically that led to their rebounding advantage, or was it just size or athleticism? 
COACH KELLOGG:   The way they play, they are going to be a good offensive rebounding team.   They play a little more old school basketball where they have three or four guys around the rim every time they run, and that lends them to be a good offensive rebounding team. 
And I assume they practice that quite frequently, because they have out‑rebounded their previous opponent by 24 and out‑rebounded us with 24 offensive rebounds.   We talked on it, we worked on it and didn't execute.   We probably have to go back and try some different things next time if we are playing a rebounding team like them. 

Q.   The last three match‑ups have been tough and come down to the wire; what is it with Temple that causes matchup problems? 
COACH KELLOGG:   The game last year I thought was one of best college basketball games I've been a part of, it was awesome even though we lost in overtime.   They have really good players.   Their support staff is very good and mature.   They are older and they know what they are doing. 
The one thing I think Coach has gotten them to do maybe better than any team in our league is he has them playing their roles.   Nobody is complaining and they all do their job and they all have a good feel for what they are trying to accomplish.   It seems like winning to them is the most important thing, and that's the sign of a good team.

Q.   Talk about Chaz, how he improved himself from the beginning of the season?
COACH KELLOGG:   He's just matured.   He controls the game better now.   I last year he was just been, boom, boom, boom, there he goes; there's Chaz.   This year he's picking hits spots more and he has better control and command of the contest.   I'll call it what it's, adding him to our program, we have had a couple 20‑win seasons, which is attributed a lot to him, but also the other guys maturing and getting better.

Q.   Based off the rebounding and foul trouble, do you feel fortunate?
COACH KELLOGG:   Very fortunate, yeah, I feel great.   I thought we played to be close and we were fortunate enough to come away with a victory.   One of the good things is that Vincent and Cady didn't play very much.   If we have two guys that should have a lot of energy tomorrow night it should be Cady and TV.   I thought getting out‑rebounded by 18, it was nice to come away with a victory.   That shows a team that's maturing or has matured.
