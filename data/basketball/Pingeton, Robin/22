THE MODERATOR:   We're now joined by Missouri.   We'll take an opening comment from coach and ask each of the student‑athletes to talk about this evening's game.   
COACH PINGETON:   I'm proud of our kids.   I thought we competed hard.   Obviously got into foul trouble that hurt us having some key players on the bench.   I thought the end of the first half really hurt us.   
Felt like our kids competed hard, played a solid game from start to finish.   Thought we had some key kids come off the bench and do a great job for us.   Just like I told our kids, shoulders back, head high, do things the right way.   I'm really proud of them.   
SIERRA MICHAELIS:   It was a tough loss, but we came in here, wanted revenge from Mississippi State who beat us earlier this season.   
What coach said, like Maddie off the bench did a great job as point guard.   That last shot didn't fall, but it's not her fault.   There's a lot of things we could have done during the game, too.   
BRI KULAS:   First off, just want to say good game to Mississippi State.   They played hard.   But I thought that our team played hard, as well.   I wouldn't question our effort for anything tonight.   
Definitely not the way I wanted to go out.   But I love my teammates and my coaches.   Just going to keep moving forward from here.   
THE MODERATOR:   We'll take questions.   
   
 Q.   Coach, can you talk about your team's fight.   Your team is young, showed a lot of resilience.   Talk about the fight of your team being so young.   
COACH PINGETON:   I am so proud of them.   It starts with Bri Kulas.   She's been a great leader for us all season long.   
With our team and the culture that we've worked hard to create, we have a group of young ladies that's committed to the front of their jersey, their approach day in, day out.   They have a second‑to‑none work ethic.   
When you're in the building stages, playing in a tough, tough league, you're going to have some peaks and valleys throughout the course of a season.   Our kids have stayed extremely resilient.   Never got too high or too low.   Continued to work hard.   Nobody has ever been pointing fingers.   It's never about who is in the lineup.   It's about the front of the jersey.   
I think that's pretty amazing for a group of 18‑, 19‑, 20‑year‑olds to be able to do that consistently throughout the course of a season.   
   
 Q.   Sierra, can you talk about Bri's leadership.   
SIERRA MICHAELIS:   Whenever we're having a tough time in practice or game, she huddles us up and says we need to regroup, calm down, that we got this.   
She's amazing really.
