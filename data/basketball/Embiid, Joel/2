Q. Do you like the fact that Giannis is trying to fix your relationship with Westbrook?
JOEL EMBIID: I mean, I don't care.
Q. Do you and Giannis have similar talents in terms of shooting ability and size?
JOEL EMBIID: I don't know.  I'm an okay shooter.  I can do everything on the basketball court, and he's a great player.  So I have a lot of respect for him.
Q. How are you liking my guy Boban?
JOEL EMBIID: I love him.  He's the best.  I've never been around such a funny guy.  He's been such a different experience than we've ever had.
Q. On trying to get a mental edge on opponents:
JOEL EMBIID: There's different ways to impose yourself mentally.  You can do it defensively.  I think the best way is actually defensively, and then, when you got the offensive skills to actually make it happen and make someone look silly on the offensive end, it's always a plus.  But just locking someone down or blocking the shot or scoring on them, much of the time, that's how you get the opportunity to get in someone's head.
