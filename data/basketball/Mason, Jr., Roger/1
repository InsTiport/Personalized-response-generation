  Q. Great shots at the end of a game, is that something useful for you?   
 ROGER MASON, JR.: Yeah, I enjoy those moments. I have been very fortunate to be in that situation and I have been getting some good looks and it has been working out.   
  
  Q. It was looked as an underrated signings. What was the dialogue up to the Spurs making a commitment to you?  
 ROGER MASON, JR.: They let me know early on that I was a big priority. I got a lot of attention during the free-agent period. Media might not have known it.   
 But it was very humbling. And for a team that's won championships and showed that much interest, it was cool. I figured I would have a prominent role.
