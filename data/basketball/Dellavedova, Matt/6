  MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA:   A lot of hard work, some opportunities along the way, and just try to make the most of them.  
   
 Q.   Do you realize how proud they are, the connection with you two years in a row?   
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA:   Yeah, yeah, I talked to Coach Bennett and all those guys all the time.   You know, I was also watching Patty last year do what he was doing.   So we're proud to represent St. Mary's.  
   
 Q.   Does it feel like coming home a little bit here?   
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA:   Yeah, definitely.   St. Mary's is my home away from home.   It's always good to see some familiar faces.  
   
 Q.   Did you pick Patty's brain on what to expect in this whole atmosphere?   
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA:   I mean, I've talked to Patty just in general about a lot of things, and he's always great.   Given me little tips and advice.  
   
 Q.   How do you handle this?   You have people lining up outside and your merchandise is being sold out.   How do you handle that?   
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA:   It's not really anything to handle.   It's just focusing on what you need to do.   I'm not really worrying about all the other stuff that comes with it.   
   
 Q.   LeBron jumped to your back when everyone was calling you dirty.   How nice is it to have the game's greatest player support you?   
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA:   He sees how I play each day, and it's obviously nice having him say that because he didn't have to say anything.   So it was nice.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible) seemed to think it was your Aussie rules background and you were taught to go for the ball and why Americans might have misread that as dirty.   What do you think?   
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA:   I think I'm not too sure of it.   In Australian sport in general, not just Aussie rules, you're always taught to win the ball.  
   
 Q.   What is the mindset of your team coming in here?   You've only lost two games at home all year.   What's it like coming in tomorrow?   
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA:   I mean, you know, we've just got to execute the game plan.   They're obviously a very explosive, offensive team.   A lot of weapons.   Obviously the crowd here really gets behind you.  
   
 Q.   Do you ever find your style of play slightly (indiscernible)?  
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA:   I don't think there's a problem with how I play.  
   
 Q.   How tough is it, the task of Steph Curry and trying to keep him from taking over?   
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA:   I mean, he is the MVP for a reason.   So I don't think anyone can really stop him.   It's more about trying to slow him down and limiting his opportunities.  
   
 Q.   What is the game plan to do that, though?   
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA:   Oh, well, I mean, I'm not going to tell you (laughing).   Obviously, yeah, he can do a lot of things with the ball.   You know, he's the engine that makes his team go.  
   
 Q.   How much has LeBron's experience been for you guys?   They've got zero players with Final experience.   LeBron's making his sixth.   How much does that mean in the playoffs?   
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA:   He's a great leader, and something he probably doesn't get enough credit for.   But he's really led us well during the playoffs.   Yeah, I don't see it being any different in The Finals.  
   
 Q.   Given where you came from, you might be the only Cleveland player the crowd might even cheer.   What do you think about that?   
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA:   I don't know if it will be like that.   There might be a few people, but, yeah.  
   
 Q.   Is it tougher playing here in the United States?   
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA:   I don't want to say that, but, I mean, you can look up some footage like an Australian versus New Zealand series, and that's pretty physical.
