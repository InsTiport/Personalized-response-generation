Q.   Matt, where have you seen you guys' defense improve in the playoffs? 
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA:   I think we just try to keep improving each game, each series, and I think we have a good chemistry, understanding, talk right now out there.

Q.   Matt, from where we sat, it was like after your second free‑throw that went in, you had a little look from the Hawks bench.   What was that about? 
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA:   No, not really.   I thought I heard someone talking, so I was just looking over.   That was it.

Q.   To remind them that the ball went in? 
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA:   No, it was nothing like that. 

Q.   Delly, how important is it for you guys to not get any kind of sense of security even though you're up 2‑0 now? 
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA:   I mean, you never want to be satisfied or complacent.   We know there's still a lot of work to do, and they're a dangerous team offensively.   So we have to continue to work hard and follow the game plan.

Q.   When you guys made those midseason trades, you kind of changed up your defense.   How quickly did you guys adapt to that new scheme that you were running, and when did you as a group become confident in it? 
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA:   I think you could see it straight away, what the new guys were going to bring and the defensive game plan.   It was just going to take some time to get used to and understand and‑‑ yeah, just everyone get comfortable doing it.   But I think pretty much straight away it definitely helped us.

Q.   How is your Aussie brethren doing, okay? 
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA:   He's going to be fine.

Q.   I'm sure you can appreciate how frustrated he must be not being able to be out there with you guys. 
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA:   Yeah.   I mean, first playoff run.   I know he desperately wants to be out there to help us.   We're obviously really looking forward to having him back out there with us.

Q.   Matthew, what's sort of your plan of attack when it comes to stopping Jeff Teague?   What don't you want him doing right away? 
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA:   He's a great penetrator.   So really just want to try to keep him out of the paint.
