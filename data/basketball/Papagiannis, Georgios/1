THE MODERATOR: If you could start with an opening statement about what you'd bring to your new team, please.   
GEORGIOS PAPAGIANNIS: I'm still 18.  It doesn't mean that's going to be an excuse for the next year.  I'm going to give the best out of me.  I'm going to work hard.  I'm hungry for the game.  I want to say that I'm going to do the best I can to bring a championship to town.   
 Q.  Two-part question for you:  How do you feel now you're going to be going to Sacramento with Kosta Koufos, another Greek there?  And you were drafted 13, which is the highest for a Greek ever.  How do you feel about that?  
GEORGIOS PAPAGIANNIS: It's a great achievement for the whole of Greece.  I'm very proud of myself, I'm very proud.  I'm going to go to Sacramento and be teammates with Koufos, being with a Greek guy on the same team, it's different.  But we've got Peja, who's going to speak Greek to me, too.  So it's a great feeling.   
 Q.  (Question in Greek).  
GEORGIOS PAPAGIANNIS: I was so nervous before the beginning of the NBA Draft.  Now I'm so excited.  I don't believe it.  Yeah, I'm so excited to go to Sacramento.   
 Q.  Are you going to go right away?  
GEORGIOS PAPAGIANNIS: That's up to the team.  I want to play in the NBA as soon as possible.   
 Q.  What do you know about the Sacramento Kings?  What do you think about going there?  
GEORGIOS PAPAGIANNIS: I met them on the pro day.  I had the pro day like last week.  Besides that, I know Vlade Divac, European guy.  Everybody must know.  I'm very excited to be like his player.  Peja, two great players have played there.  Besides that, DeMarcus Cousins, I admire his game so much, and I love that he's going to be my teammate.  Yeah, that's it.   
 Q.  You mentioned DeMarcus Cousins.  With a player with his offensive skill set, what do you think you can learn from him, and how do you expect you'll be able to play with him?  
GEORGIOS PAPAGIANNIS: I've been watching him since last year.  He has a lot of skill moves in the post.  Tough, tough guy to play against.  I love his character.  He's mean for the game.  He's hungry.
