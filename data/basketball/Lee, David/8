 Q.  If you could comment about your experience tonight in earning the MVP, as well? 
 DAVID LEE:  It was a tremendous experience just to be included in the All-Star Weekend.  I really thank the NBA for making me a part of it. 
 I went out tonight and we said we were going to share the ball and have fun.  We had some of the Phoenix Suns assistants as coaches, so we were running and gunning.  Chris Paul and Deron Williams made it very easy on me tonight. 

 Q.  Talk about how the -- having one year of experience in the NBA, how much a difference that seems to make.  The sophomores seemed to have more energy than the rookies.  It seems to be a pattern every year. 
 DAVID LEE:  It's a huge difference.  It's even more of a difference than freshman and sophomore in college.  Have that year of experience, especially on defense during the season, knowing the nuances of the game and being more comfortable out there on the floor.  Playing against great competition.  You can say, wow, there's Kobe Bryant or Kevin Garnett. 
 I used to say that, but now I've had a year to play against them and it's easier. 

 Q.  I know you mentioned it earlier out there, but talk a little bit about the enthusiasm of the crowd, playing in front of the kids. 
 DAVID LEE:  It was a great idea by the NBA having the kids down there.  It was interesting when we came out they were making all that noise, I said there's no way they can sustain that high pitched screeching noise during the game.  They certainly did that, being energetic throughout the game.  It was a great job by the NBA, and a great idea, and worked out well.
