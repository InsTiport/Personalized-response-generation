		   DAVID LEE: Just very excited to be here. Doesn't matter in the end how it happens, but just excited to be a part of this weekend. It's very special being a part of this All-Star game.

 Q. Do you find yourself in awe at all?
 DAVID LEE: Yeah, just the size of the event, it's going to be a really special weekend. Playing against all of these players is going to be fun and something to remember, that's for sure. 

 Q. (Inaudible). 
 DAVID LEE: Yeah, I mean, I felt bad for the fact that she started getting sick. That was the kind of difficult about it is I had to have somebody get hurt or something like that to get in. It's out of my control, and I just want to say a prayer for his daughter that she's doing okay and thanks for the opportunity and I'll try to make the most of it.

 Q. How did you find out and what was your reaction?
 DAVID LEE: I was actually taking a nap at the house, and kept hitting ignore on my phone when it was vibrating. The third time I answered it, and it was Mr. Walsh and he told me the good news and told me I had about 20 minutes before the car service was there to take me to the airport to catch the NBA charter. So I had a very quick turnaround. Definitely had a good night of sleep last night. I was pretty worn out by the time I got in. But feeling good now, and like I said, just really excited to be here, to go through this new experience and interact with these unbelievable players.
