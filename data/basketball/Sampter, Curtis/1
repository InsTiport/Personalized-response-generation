<p>	Q.  Talk about your defense today.  You didn't give them an inch. </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about how your team responded early on.  Pittsburgh was trying to enforce its will.  You had a couple of opportunities there. </p>
<p>	Q.  Curtis, to beat a team like Pitt who's been to the finals two years in a row, does beating a team like them give you a feeling for where your program is now, how far you've come? </p>
<p>	Q.  Curtis, it takes a lot of energy to play defense that hard.  What did the Coach do to convince you to do the hard work? </p>
<p>	Q.  Randy, how much gratification is it for you to win this kind of game against a team like Pittsburgh? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jay, you've beat Pitt at their own game, so to speak.  They built their reputation on defense.  You come in here and beat them with defense.  Does that make a statement about this program's ability? </p>
<p>	Q.  What kind of problems does West Virginia pose?  They're playing a lot differently now than a while back. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, did you go into this game with the mindset of you weren't going to let Troutman beat you?  I don't think he had a field goal in the game.  What was your attack on him? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jay, talk about the defensive intensity.  The character of the team, early foul trouble.  They didn't let up. </p>
<p>	Q.  Early in the game, low-scoring game for quite a few minutes.  What is your mindset when you're involved in a game like that (inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  Randy, when your jumper is not falling like it is today, what kind of adjustments do you make? </p>
<p>	Q.  For the players, can you talk about this season, how much fun it's been after what you've been through the past couple years?  To have rebounded and become a team like you are this year, how much fun has it been, what has it meant to you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Curtis, can you elaborate on Chevy Troutman, defending him, him not scoring, what you did and if you took it as a personal challenge? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you notice them getting frustrated? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about being an assistant coach and about what this league was about.  When you first got to know them - granted, these guys were young - did it make you cringe that the word out there was Villanova was kind of soft, that Villanova wasn't soft?  For both players, Randy, you're from Newark, you're from the city, did it make you guys cringe to hear people think you could be pushed around?  Jay, first. </p>

<p>	Q.  You're kind of on a winning streak here.  What do you think you need to do to keep that going, especially with bigger games coming up? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jay, talk a little bit if you would about the special challenge that a guy like Pittsnogle is going to pose tomorrow night. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the way you closed out the game. </p>
<p>	Q.  You guys were pressing yourself in the last four, six minutes?</p>
<p>	Q.  What are the next 24 hours going to be like, preparing for a team like West Virginia, who's fighting for their life? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Long Island's Jason Fraser.  How do you see him tomorrow? </p>
