 Q.  You guys share that intensity.  You enjoy the spotlight on it.  James wants to hang in the background.  How do you think it is for him to step into that spot?  PATRICK BEVERLEY: He's done a great job.  He's the reason everyone has been following.  It's like we wanted to have a dominant player for years.  To have a player like that on your team, you can get caught up sometimes and kind of take it for granted. We're extremely happy about the unit.  We need to be better with certain things on our team.  With him behind you saving the day most of the time, it's easier.
