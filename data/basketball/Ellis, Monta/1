 Q.  Is it an honor being here with all these great players? 
 MONTA ELLIS:  I'm very honored, being the only second round player in the game, I'm just blessed. 

 Q.  Does the fact that you were drafted in the second round motivate you? 
 MONTA ELLIS:  It used to, but now I'm just playing basketball. 
 Under Coach Nelson, with his system, I fit in very well.  We like to get up and run and that's my game. 

 Q.  What's your favorite part of All-Star Weekend? 
 MONTA ELLIS:  This is my first one, so I would have to say playing in the game.
