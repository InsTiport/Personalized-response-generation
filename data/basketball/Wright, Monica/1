THE MODERATOR:   We will have Maya Moore and Monica Wright.   Questions for the players.   
   
 Q.   Monica, talk about the night you had tonight coming in off the bench, that postseason career high for you, your mindset going into the game, and the way things worked out for you?  
MONICA WRIGHT:   Nothing different.   It's the Finals, so you want to leave it all out there.   But obviously we got it done tonight and my teammates have all the confidence in the world in me and it was just fallin' tonight.   
   
 Q.   Maya, this is your third year and your eighth WNBA Finals game.   Are you getting comfortable with this type of environment?   
MAYA MOORE:   Yeah.   It's a blessing to be at this point in the season.   I was fortunate to be drafted to a team who had some great leaders on it and who have led us with their unselfishness, their personality.   And it shows in the stats, shows how we play.   We don't care who gets the credit.   She is diving on the floor to save a ball from going out‑of‑bounds and going to the other end and lockin' up their leading scorer.   
It's a team that puts it all out on the line and that's why we're in the Finals, because we play that way.   I want to enjoy every minute of it by making sure I give everything I have like Monica talked about on the court.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk about Monica's night.   I know she does it off the bench but she did more statistically.   
MAYA MOORE:   She is in trouble, acting up.   She was amazing.   On our team we have a fine system where if you do something outrageous, you're fined.  
You're fined!   
She lifted us completely to another level, so much energy.   Her defense, her hustle, her activity.   We have known about her all season.   It's no surprise to us, so maybe people who haven't seen us in a while are like "Monica Wright!"  
But she is vital to us and we need that from her.   And whenever she can play like that, it gives everybody else life.   
   
 Q.   Monica, you guys learned the hard way last year what a Game 1 loss can do.   How well do you feel you're set up after executing as well as you did in all phases tonight?   
MONICA WRIGHT:   Yeah, I think we're setting ourselves up and we took that personal.   If you look at the way our season has kinda played out, you can tell that we've all took that to heart and we're trying to make a different ending to this season.   
   
 Q.   A lot of intensity, a lot of energy tonight.   How do you keep that momentum going when you go into the half with such a big lead?   
MAYA MOORE:   It's just a matter of mental maturity and knowing how to take the moment, you know, as it comes.   We don't want to ever relax.   The work that we do in the first half, we want to make sure that that means something.   So in order to protect what we just did, we have to go out and play just as well or better in the second half.   
To build momentum.   This is a long series and every second that we give them life is a memory that they take into Game 2 or Game 3 or the next game.   That's our mindset, we don't give up, we don't relent.   We want to win every game by 1, 20, doesn't matter.   We want to make sure we play the way we have been playing all year.   
THE MODERATOR:   Ladies, thank you.
