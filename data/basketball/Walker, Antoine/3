 Q.  Talk about his energy and what's it like playing for him? 
 ANTOINE WALKER:  Playing for Mark was really great because he had so much energy he kept for his players and wins.  His will to win as an owner is real good.  He never bothered me, his enthusiasm for the team is great. 
 Q.  A little different from anything else you've dealt with? 
 ANTOINE WALKER:  Not really, he's just the owner of the team.  He never hangs out and tells you how to shoot or run a play.  He's just very supportive of his team and on the court, he's rooting for his team.  It wasn't a distraction, at least not for me. 
 Q.  Is it kind of weird for you playing these guys in the NBA finals? 
 ANTOINE WALKER:  Not really.  It's been a couple of years since I've been here obviously.  I think our team and their team are different.  You're talking about six, seven new guys on both teams. 
 Now I'm in a new situation.  Obviously I'm happy for Dirk and the other guys that I played with to have an opportunity to make it here The Finals.  It should be a lot of fun. 
 I had a great time here in Dallas. 
 Q.  What are you guys doing well right now that's gotten you here to the Finals as a team? 
 ANTOINE WALKER:  It's a combination of things.  Establishing Shaq down low, obviously Wade is doing his thing and everybody else is chipping in when need be. 
 But the biggest thing is we have gotten much better defensively from the regular season, which now we're much more focused defensively.  It's made us get us to this point right now.  We trust each other and we feel real good.  We trust each other offensively and defensively as well.
