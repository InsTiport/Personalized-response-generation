 Q.  Pat is such a great motivator.  What does it mean to you as a player to be able to play under him? 
 ANTOINE WALKER:  Pat Riley has a lot of years of experience, championship rings, and every game he knows ways to motivate us, and he's a guy that keeps things in black and white.  He's going to keep an eye on us and he's going to tell you how you're playing.  He's not going to yell at you, but he's going to tell you how things are.  That's one of the great things about it.  But he is a terrific motivator.  Sometimes you leave the locker room and you run into a brick wall, you feel like you can run through a brick wall, and that's one of the great things about it, he's a great motivator. 
 Q.  Pat is going to remind you not to get too high about this win, if he hasn't already.  It's easier said than done; how do you do that? 
 ANTOINE WALKER:  Well, I think we're a veteran group.  I think we have to understand how we got up 3-1.  You've got to understand who we're playing.  That team is not going to back down.  They're going to come out fighting.  They're going to have a lot of confidence.  We've got to come out with the same effort that we did tonight.  I think we play better when we have a jump on them a little bit early in the game and establish Shaq inside and just continue doing what we've been doing.  They're the team right now that needs to make the adjustments, so we have to make sure that we're ready for the adjustments that they're going to make.
