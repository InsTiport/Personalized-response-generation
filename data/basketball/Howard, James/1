Providence - 49, Georgetown - 46
JAMES HOWARD: Good afternoon. A tough game out there tonight, especially for the kids in the locker room. I think whenever you fight to get back into a game and you fall short, you know, for every senior, we have four, five seniors in there, it's their last game, and you feel for them as they go through, you know, these tough times, and it was a tough season.
We'll continue to work for those that are returning and get better, and hopefully next year we're not in this position but back in a position that we have a bye week.
Q. Coach, Taylor was on fire (indiscernible) the first half. What was working for her?
JAMES HOWARD: She played well off of ball screens. She comes off of ball screens and makes good reads, and then when we're running someone else off, they're able to try to find her on a spot-up.
The key was drawing defenses and reading where she was. We try to run a lot of action for her to get her some good looks, some pin-down stuff, try to get her coming off to put the ball in her hand to make a good decision with it.
Q. Coach, can you just describe what you saw in your team there in the last five minutes of the game? Thoughts on that?
JAMES HOWARD: I think we had the interview before the game with some of the media, and one thing we talked about, I said if we -- if we're in the game, coming down to the last five minutes, their energy and their belief changed. What I saw was they start to see the clock and they saw they were down three, down four, they felt like they could win again.
The energy changed there. I thought they picked up their action, their ability to scramble, rotate. I thought right about the 3-minute, 3.5-minute mark, I thought we had three key shots that we missed to tie it.
Good looks. Three from the corner, three up top. Wide-open looks. That's the thing, when you're having to set the season, it breaks your back, because all year long we have had that look. We have had that look. We just didn't have that player to knock it down at that crucial time.
Q. Take me through the last five, six seconds between both teams with the time-outs and then the play that ultimately ended it?
JAMES HOWARD: Yes. I think when it came down to it, we tried to get Taylor Barnes coming off of something, we tried to double screen and bring her off the baseline side. The key in that action is making sure that you set a solid screen to get it to your shooter.
The second option was trying to get Tayanna Jones on a flare on the backside and Anita on the slip. They did a good job of covering it, but we got it to Taylor, Taylor got it back out, shot went up, and Anita got the rebound to put it back in and take it back to a 2-point game.
I thought it was a key possession before that when we cut it to two, we fouled, we didn't have to foul at that time. The clock was in your favor, you play through it. Again, you know, you're there, you make those quick -- not understanding what time and place is, and play through it. We try to tell them that, but you know when you're in the game, it is like your emotion, you're not thinking, and then all of a sudden, bad decision.
Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.
