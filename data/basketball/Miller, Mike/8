 Q. How important does it mean to win Game 3? 
 MIKE MILLER: If you go by history, very important. What's the numbers, something like 11-0 the team that wins Game 3 wins the series? So it's a big game for us. It's a big game for them as well. 

 Q. How does it feel not to have been able to close out the game?
 MIKE MILLER: Obviously, disappointing. But at the same time we realize it's still one game. We would like to have closed that out. Give them a lot of credit. They played well down the stretch. 

 Q. How important is it to get Game 3 and get home-court advantage back? 
 MIKE MILLER: Big. Obviously that's what we're looking forward to doing. It will be a tough game. The atmosphere is going to be great. They're going to play great at home, like they have all year. We just have to be ready to play. 

 Q. Do you think too much has been made about the celebration?
 MIKE MILLER: You know, everybody has their own opinion. If we would have won the game, it wouldn't have been brought up. They did a good job down the stretch and won the game. Now we have to figure out a way to come in here and win Game 3. 

 Q. Dwyane said the celebration had nothing to do with the outcome of the game. 
 MIKE MILLER: I think so. I don't see how a celebration can. Obviously, it's something now that we lost a 15-point lead. But it wasn't even that extensive.
