  Q. What is it about the home identity that you guys have?   
 MIKE MILLER: We hope to keep that streak alive. It's big, especially in the playoffs. Protect home court. Feed off the energy of the crowd. It's a great place to play right now.   
  
  Q. Fourth quarter has turned into -- it was the largest criticism you all received during the regular season. What has changed the last six months that you guys have been so successful?   
 MIKE MILLER: It took time to grow. Obviously we're still learning each other for the most part. Fourth quarter, our defense has been great so far. Big stops in the fourth quarter.   
  
  Q. Any problems with your shoulder?   
 MIKE MILLER: Old age. No, I'm fine. There's no effects.   
  
  Q. The overall effort you guys provided. You always do with rebounding and defense trying to set --  
 MIKE MILLER: As far as, like, we have to make an impact on the game in the beginning of the playoffs all the way through. Find a way to impact. The scoring, rebounding, the defense.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).   
 MIKE MILLER: It's what you got to do. They're one of the most impressive offenses I've seen, the way they move the ball, the shooters they got. They're a very dangerous offensive team.   
  
  Q. Did you guys work much on the zone?   
 MIKE MILLER: A little bit. Obviously they play their zone. We play inside-out on the zone. Try to offensive rebound.   
  
  Q. Speaking of rebounds, you guys have been middle of the pack all season. Plus 10 last night.   
  MIKE MILLER: Obviously for us, it limits their second-chance points. Also gives us second-chance points of our own. That's big for us. We have to keep working on that as the series moves on.    
  Q. And they're big.   
 MIKE MILLER: They're big and athletic.
