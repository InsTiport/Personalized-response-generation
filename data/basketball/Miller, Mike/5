  Q. You seem like your stroke was on the other day. Are the thumbs feeling better?   
 MIKE MILLER: It's just a matter of making shots.   
  
  Q. Will you need surgery after the season?   
 MIKE MILLER: Yes.   
  
  Q. You and James Jones, you guys seem to have interchangeable roles. First few playoff series he was getting it done. Now you've been getting it done. What is that like, he's not getting much time at all.   
 MIKE MILLER: It's tough. I've been in his situation. You wait and wait and you have to stay ready. You never know. J.J. might get a chance next. Maybe not. You stay ready, keep grinding but it's not easy.   
  
  Q. Who would win a three-point contest between you and him? Who wins them?   
 MIKE MILLER: I plead the fifth.   
  
  Q. You had the Gator years and just didn't get it done. How sweet would this be?   
 MIKE MILLER: It's the reason I came here. I have had -- obviously since Florida and being runner-up, I haven't had a lot of success in the league. This felt like a good opportunity for me, and we're close. We are two big games away.
