 Q. This series obviously has not been a shooter's dream. Both defenses as hard as they are. Talk about what that has been like, the defensive intensity. 
 MIKE MILLER: That's exactly what both teams bring to the table. That's been our MO the whole year, the playoffs, our defense has carried us through the most part. That's the way it's going to be. Going to get shots off, going to be contested shots. You have to get them off quick. 

 Q. The way you've been able to get in the face of Terry, Kidd, Stojakovic --
 MIKE MILLER: Absolutely. It's a long series. Seems like whenever they get an open look, they make it. We have to continue to pressure them, try to make them throw the ball on the floor. At the same time, try to keep a body in front of them when they do keep it on the floor. 

 Q. When the tempo of the game slows down, how important is it to get quality possessions? 
 MIKE MILLER: When you're looking at the game basically in the 80s, when a game is in the 80s, it's a possession game. Defensively it gives both teams the opportunity to sit back and get in their half-court defense, which makes it a lot tougher to score. Body on the ball is key. And getting good shots is key. In a half-court game, you have to have good ball movement and get a good shot. 

 Q. How big would it be to take this on the road? 
 MIKE MILLER: Huge, obviously. It's going to be tough. Especially going up 2-1, they still have two on this floor in front of this great crowd. It's going to be a challenge for sure. 

 Q. How has Udonis changed the dynamic of the team? 
 MIKE MILLER: Flipped it. Brings us a serious toughness to the floor. Also brings a guy that can spread the floor a little bit offensively. But defensively he's always in the right spot. A guy you can always count on.
