  Q. Talk about your role as it has developed. You performed big in the series against the Bulls, and now you come in and you really -- you have the big three, but there's a big dependence on your bench because of the depth of Dallas' bench.   
 MIKE MILLER: They've got great depth there. Their bench is a big reason why they have had a great run in the playoffs.   
  
  Q. What are the requests for tickets? How has the craziness been, seeing the things you're going through with your daughter?   
 MIKE MILLER: It's been wild. Obviously it's what we wanted. You have to fight through everything you have to fight through right now, and make the most of this opportunity.   
   
  Q. How is she doing and how are you balancing all of that?   
 MIKE MILLER: She's doing a lot better. The only way you can balance, you make sure you take care of her first and come in here and work as hard as you can.   
  
  Q. What do you see from Dallas as far as their depth and trying to defend them? And what do you guys need to do to be successful there?   
 MIKE MILLER: Obviously, their depth is big. They have a lot of talent. They can move the basketball. They have a lot of great shooters. They play basketball the right way. It's going to be a great challenge for us. That's the reason they are in the NBA Finals. That's the reason we're in the NBA Finals. It's a good matchup.
