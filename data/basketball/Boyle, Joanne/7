Georgia Tech   77
  Virginia ‑ 76

COACH JOANNE BOYLE:   Just a great, great tournament game for both teams.   Obviously it's really painful right now.   A lot of credit to Georgia Tech, but I couldn't be more proud of my team after this game. 

Q.   I guess you guys get down 13 there.   Did something kind of click in you and maybe Kelsey and Lexie to think that this could be our last game, let's not go down without a fight and you kind of turned it up a little bit? 
ATAIRA FRANKLIN:   I don't want to say that that was necessarily our first thought, that this is the last for us.   But more so that we just want to win, more than anything.   It wasn't really ‑‑ we weren't really so focused on we're the seniors and this is it.   We just wanted to win the game. 
Sarah is the one who something must have clicked for because she put the team on her back.   At the end of it I just couldn't be more proud of my teammates. 

Q.   Sarah, this was your third career tournament game.   But did you kind of get in the moment a little bit tonight and said kind of hop on my back and make that comeback?
SARAH IMOVBIOH:   Yes, I really did.   I wanted this win for all my seniors.   I wanted to advance, and we were all looking forward to playing tomorrow. 

Q.   The other coach mentioned that you switched to the zone in the end, spurred that comeback.
COACH JOANNE BOYLE:   It was good.   I'm glad we changed it up a little bit.   They were beating us off the dribble, and we were fouling up at the free throw line, we had to do something.   We had played 12 down there before, weren't quite as successful.   In a game like this, last 9 minutes and you're 9 down, and we saw some success in the first two possessions of it, I thought we have a chance now.   I think they're a little rattled, we're a little bit on a run.   So it definitely helped us. 

Q.   The technical happens and you call timeout.   And obviously Frankie hits the two free throws and there's 3.7 seconds left.   What was the play you were trying to get there and what did they do to disrupt it? 
COACH JOANNE BOYLE:   I knew they were going to switch on all screens, we faked SI screening and flashed back to the ball.   We felt she was mauled a little bit, wasn't really open, but she couldn't get open.   So the play was for SI to fake the screen, flashback, everybody else was a decoy coming to the baseline, hit SI, Frankie fake going low, come and take the handoff and attack the rim and hopefully get fouled on the first shot, to hand the ball off to Frankie. 
But SI couldn't ‑‑ was trying to get open.   Wasn't able to get open.   Not necessarily her fault.   And we could not get the ball to her.   So Rae bailed us out, got the handoff, shuffled it to Frankie, and Frankie looked to attack and shot the pull‑up. 

Q.   Frankie, obviously there's not a whole lot you can do there.   How did you try to get something toward the rim on that? 
ATAIRA FRANKLIN:   Yeah, I mean after it happens you think about all the things that you could have done within that one second that was left once I passed the ball in.   But it was just tough.   I mean Sarah was literally sandwiched.   And at that point like Coach B. said Rae bailed us out.   We got a similar look to what we were trying to get.   Sometimes things just don't work out in your favor. 

Q.   You guys take lots of charges this year.   From your vantage point where do you think she was on that play? 
COACH JOANNE BOYLE:   I couldn't see.   I was blocked by everything.   There was a couple of things I'd like to watch the film and see, but I won't do it tonight.
Again, the calls happen.   Calls don't happen.   It's part of the game, I get it.   But, again, I thought we did everything ‑‑ the kids put themselves in such great position to fight back and win that game. 

Q.   Obviously beginning of second halves have plagued you guys in this last month or so.   When it started to happen again, I guess for all three of you, was there any point that said, here we go again?   What kind of clicked to stop that bleeding and not let that happen again? 
COACH JOANNE BOYLE:   I think part of it was going to the zone.   When we got some stops I felt like we relaxed.   I told Frankie, I felt the game was 80 minutes long.   We've got plenty of time, we've got 9 minutes.   I thought we did a good job of executing.   We only had 8 turnovers in the game.   We really took care of the ball.   I thought for the most part trying to play fast when we needed to we found great balance in that game.
Coming off yesterday's game, Boston College made a push, we came back.   Today we were down, we made a push.   I felt like that wasn't even in our psyche these last two days.
