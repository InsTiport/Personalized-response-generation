<p>	Q.  Shanna, you just came out on fire in the second half and it look as if you were single-handedly determined to pull your team back into it.  Is it something you had talked to Coach about at half-time and what happened? </p>
<p>	Q.  Shanna I would like to ask you the 11-0 run at the end of the half, to get you back within 6, did that give the team some feeling that, okay, we have taken their best shot and we can come out in the second half and still win this game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Question for Shyra, Pat mentioned them going inside in the second half, I think they had 22 points in the paint.  Were you surprised that they were able to score so well inside? </p>
<p>	Q.  For either of you, could you talk about the sequence where you guys were down 2 and you had the chance to tie.  What happened on that sequence?  </p>


<p>	Q.  For both players, I know it's hard to look ahead at this point, but you've got a heralded freshman class coming in.  Any thoughts on next year? </p>
<p>	Q.  Shyra, if you could just talk a little bit more about that being an All-American and you're going to be a senior next year.  Obviously tonight is not what you wanted, but there must be optimism heading into next year?</p>
<p>	Q.  My question is kind of along the same lines, both of you will have a chance to play the Final Four next year, kind of in your own backyard, how long will it take you to kind of put this one behind you, forget about it and start thinking about that possibility? </p>

<p>	Q.  Pat, you were talking about that never quit, never say die attitude.  Shanna seemed to epitomized it tonight.  Talk about her performance and what she brought to the team. </p>
<p>	Q.  One of the things that seems evident is that there was a difficulty for Tennessee in trying to create shots tonight.  And a lot of times the offense took a while to evolve, to where it could get a shot off.  Is that something that the incoming class can help with or is it something that your kids have to develop over the summer?</p>
<p>	Q.  This might not be your most talented team but talk about their tenacity. </p>
<p>	Q.  Sorry if you've been asked this already, but much was made especially yesterday of your relationship with Geno.  And I'm curious, it seemed like you had quite a conversation with him prior to the game and then after the game.  I'm curious if you could tell us what you talked about. </p>
<p>	Q.  To follow up, could you describe what you believe his strengths are when you looked at, for example, how he coached today's game, what you think about his place in the women's game. </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk just briefly about Taurasi tonight and what it was like competing against her these last four years, maybe where she would fit in in your mind in the history of women's basketball. </p>
<p>	Q.  Just looking ahead to next year with the freshmen coming in with Candace Parker, can you talk about the excitement as you look forward to next year and maybe getting back to the Final Four with those guys?</p>
