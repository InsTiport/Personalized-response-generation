 THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Air Force. First we'll take a quick statement on the game from Coach McInelly.   
 COACH McINELLY: It's kind of been typical of what we've done all year. We played in spurts of the game. We found ourselves doing that again. I thought for the first 10 minutes, we were playing, competing very well. The next 10 minutes, even though we shot well, 42% in the first half, we gave up too many three-point shots. Amy Beggin went to town on us. We got down by 20 points in the first half. It's pretty tough to come back on a team like New Mexico in the second half when you're down 20 points.   
 But our players gave it, you know, they made a good effort the last 10 minutes of the game and I'm very proud of our young women. We didn't win a lot of games. I was quoted as saying this before. Our seniors will be very successful. Our team will continue to be successful even though we didn't have a successful season. But these young women, they come out and they work hard every single day. I'm very proud to be their coach.   
 THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.   
  
  Q. Liz, how difficult was it? This was going to be a tough team to beat anyway. I think you had 15 turnovers. Especially the offensive rebounds they got, how difficult did that make it on you guys?   
 LIZ DUNSWORTH: Well, New Mexico is a very tough team. They were just able -- it seemed like every time we went to the boards, they were just there first.   
 KIM KREKE: It's definitely tough for us to get to the boards. You know, it's something that our team will work on next year. The girls will get better next year.   
 This is an off year. But it's not like we didn't work hard on rebounding. It's not like we didn't work hard on our offensive skills. We'll put our hard work to use in the off-season. The juniors, sophomores and freshmen will get better. Air Force will change as a program. They'll get better.   
 THE MODERATOR: I'd like to dismiss the student-athletes at this time. Thank you, ladies.   
 We'll continue with questions for coach.   
  
  Q. Same question. The turnovers and the offensive rebounds, how much of that hurt you?   
 COACH McINELLY: Well, it hurts quite a bit. As I said, we were playing right with them in the first half. They had nine offensive rebounds in the first half. That was a very telltale sign.   
 We also, you know, had -- well, I think we only had five turnovers in the first half. In the second half we had much more. Sometimes you start playing tight, you start trying to force things. You know, we are young. Sometimes we don't read the defense. It's just about, you know, film work. Sometimes we're making the pass to the wrong side of the defense and they're tipping it away.   
 Because of our youth and inexperience, I think that was certainly exploited today. Don Flanagan and his staff, they do a heck of a job there at New Mexico. They've got a very good balance of young women. As you can look at their stats going into the game, of course Amy Beggin, she's someone that you have to stop. You have Hartill, then eight or 20 other people that score. Well, not 20, but it seems like it (laughter).   
 They're scoring anywhere from six to eight points. I think they have good balance. Not like they have to have a go-to player. As I said, Kim alluded to it earlier, our young kids will continue to learn, continue to do those things. We will get better.   
 But, you know, it's the seniors' last game. I felt bad. Dana Loveless didn't get to play. She's been out with an ACL all year. Brooke is not a hundred percent. She has a knee problem, as well. Who knows. She may be getting a surgery after the season. And Kim, she's a kid that just gave it her all the whole time.   
 We ran out of gas, ran out of people, but we certainly didn't run out of heart. Because of that, I love our kids. I know it has nothing to do with the game. But I just want to thank everybody, wish the rest of the teams the best of luck.
