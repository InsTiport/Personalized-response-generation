STORM  Â– 79
  DREAM - 77

 MARYNELL MEADORS: It was a great game, it was a hard-fought game by both teams. I think it proved to our players and coaching staff that we belong here. We never gave up. I thought my team had a lot -- showed a lot of courage throughout the game. 
 It was a super crowd, very loud, which is hard sometimes to communicate with players on the floor, teams on the floor, but, you know, you play 38 minutes for the last fifteen seconds to win or tie the game, and we certainly had that opportunity. A lot of players -- and it's unfortunate that Angel got into foul trouble, she got hit in the head then, so she was out of the game for a long time, and I think that if we could keep her in the game on Tuesday night, she will have a better chance of getting into some type of rhythm. 
 But I was proud of our team, I thought we fought hard throughout the game and, you know, we'll come back on Tuesday night and give it our best. 

 Q. Coach, are you heartened by the fact that Angel played as few minutes as she did and you guys hung in there the way you did? 
 MARYNELL MEADORS: I've said all along that this team was built on balance and, you know, we really -- we play hard, whether Angel is in the lineup or she's not, and we're a team, and we share the ball extremely well. A lot of times throughout the season Angel was not the leading scorer; she was a secondary scorer, but she looks to give assists to her teammates, so I would like to keep her in the game, and I would like her to play about 35 minutes. 
 That's what I want to happen on Tuesday night. As far as not getting into foul trouble, she will stay aggressive, but I was proud of the way she came back when she was in foul trouble and then when she got hit in the head and had to have stitches, she came back strong in the fourth. I'm not sure how many but there was a good gash there. 

 Q. (Away from mic.)
 MARYNELL MEADORS: I saw us give up the shot; it just didn't go in. It was designed for anyone that was open, we had our shooters in the lineup at the time, and we didn't care whether it was a two or a three. You have 2.6 seconds left, it's not a lot of time once you catch it, so we had to catch the ball and shoot it, and it was designed to get an open shot and it got that for us; we just didn't make it. 

 Q. Coach, the last shot that Bird took and hit, can you talk about that? 
 MARYNELL MEADORS: We gave Sue Bird that open look and if you give her an open look with the game on the line, 9 times out of 10 she's going to make it, and she made it this time, so we've got to do a better job defensively. 
 THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your time.
