 Q.  Maybe it's just because you're more active? 
 ANDERSON VAREJAO:  I try to be active all the time, trying to play like with energy, try to more stop against them, and also play more.  When you play more, you have more chance for more stops. 

 Q.  Do you think you and Rasheed are building a rivalry?  Do you think you guys are building that against each other in this series? 
 ANDERSON VAREJAO:  Building what? 

 Q.  Like a rivalry, like a competition between the two of you. 
 ANDERSON VAREJAO:  I have to guard him and he has to guard me.  I don't know, just like I said, I don't think it's nothing personal, I just try to help the team.  I try to guard him, I'm going to try to guard him hard. 

 Q.  He was talking about you flopping on that last play.  Do you think you did? 
 ANDERSON VAREJAO:  I don't know, I was in good position to be at his ribs a lot, and the referees didn't make the call. 

 Q.  Are you surprised?  Did you think you were going to get a foul called there? 
 ANDERSON VAREJAO:  I don't know, I just tried to try my best.  I tried my best to be in good position and the ref didn't make the call, move on. 

 Q.  This series, the more you go on, it seems like at least one player on the other team gets tired of playing against you.  It seems like you've been able to do that, you seem to irritate them with your style of play.  You've done that your whole career really.  Have you noticed that? 
 ANDERSON VAREJAO:  I don't know.  I don't know if they get tired.  I keep doing that, keep doing my job, and see what's going to happen. 

 Q.  Somewhere inside you does it make you happy when people talk about how much you bother them? 
 ANDERSON VAREJAO:  Well, I think where I come from we play like that all the time.  It doesn't make me happy or unhappy, I just want to win the games.
