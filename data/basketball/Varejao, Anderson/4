 Q.  (Talk about playing against Tim Duncan.) 
 ANDERSON VAREJAO:  You've got to play hard against him, you've got to play smart against him.  He's one of the best five players in the NBA for me, and you've got to take his space out, don't let him catch the ball where he likes to play.  He's a great player.  He can face up, he can back you down, he can do a lot of things.  All we have to do is play smart against him. 

 Q.  Is he more disruptive for an opponent as a scorer or as a play-maker waiting for the double-team and passing out?  In which way is he more dangerous, scoring or making plays? 
 ANDERSON VAREJAO:  Both ways he's great.  He's very good in both ways.  He can pass the ball, he can score we all know, and he's playing like that for many, many years.  He has for the last, I don't know, five years, six years, whatever.  The thing we're going to have to do is, like I said, be smart against him. 

 Q.  When you guarded him in the past, and I remember you guarded him in 2003 down in Puerto Rico, what have you tried to do against him? 
 ANDERSON VAREJAO:  I tried to be active all the time, move my body, don't let him think about what he can do.  I just tried to guard him.  That's all I did.
