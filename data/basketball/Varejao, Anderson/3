 Q. You were at the line quite a bit last night. Was that designed? 
 ANDERSON VAREJAO: No, you don't want to foul. The ball was fouling. It is what it is. All we got to do is just try to be -- play hard against them. There is not a lot we can do.

 Q. You guys still seem real confident that you can win the series. 
 ANDERSON VAREJAO: I'm pretty sure. We're down 2-1. I feel like we have a chance to win one game here. We are going to play hard next game and try to get a win.

 Q. You can't afford to back off or change the way you approach Howard or the series, can you? 
 ANDERSON VAREJAO: No. Got to keep playing the same way and try to be in better position next time and be physical against him because we all know he is a strong player and he will try to go to the basket any time he got the ball in the post. So we just have to be strong and try to have better position.

 Q. Is there anything they do defensively to take away some of your back-door courts and maybe the pick-and-rolls? 
 ANDERSON VAREJAO: Well, you know, they are playing really good defense, you can tell. I believe all we got to do is play like we played during the regular season, move the ball more and try to involve everybody on the offense. That will help us a lot.

 Q. Do you think Mo takes this quite personally because he expects to win? As a veteran on this club, do you talk to him at all because he is such a confident guy? 
 ANDERSON VAREJAO: Mo said that, yeah. 
 He can't think he is the one who is not doing whatever. He is all for one and one for all. We got to just -- he just -- he is a pretty confident player. And he just has got to keep shooting and playing his game and he will be fine.
