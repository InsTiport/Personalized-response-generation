 Q.  Rasheed Wallace, I was asking him about the battles you two have, and he said you're too young to have battles.  Do you think you're too young or can you do it with him? 
 ANDERSON VAREJAO:  Rasheed Wallace can say whatever he wants to say.  I'm going to keep doing my job.  I don't care how young I am.  I'm just going to keep trying to help the team and do my job. 

 Q.  What do you think of his comments about flopping? 
 ANDERSON VAREJAO:  Like I said, he can say whatever he wants to say.  I'm not going to listen to him.  I'm going to keep doing my work and help the team. 

 Q.  Zydrunas was just joking around, he says, yeah, we just ask him not to flop at practice. 
 ANDERSON VAREJAO:  Yeah, they do that, but I think he likes to do that. 

 Q.  Do you think you're getting a reputation for that, the flopping?  Do you think that that's becoming something that people are labeling you as, as far as the way you defend? 
 ANDERSON VAREJAO:  I don't know.  Like I said, my team just tries to be in good position all night, to take a charge.  Maybe sometimes I exaggerate on the charge and that's why they keep saying that. 
 Like I said, I'm not going to change my game. 

 Q.  You seem like you're getting under Rasheed's skin, though. 
 ANDERSON VAREJAO:  Well, I feel like I have to guard him, I have to guard him all the time, so that's why we have a lot of things going on between me and him. 

 Q.  How tough is it to guard this guy, Rasheed? 
 ANDERSON VAREJAO:  He's really good.  He's really good.  He's tough, he can hit big shots.  He's a really good player.  He's got a lot of experience.  I think he's one of the big keys for them. 

 Q.  How often do you get your haircut? 
 ANDERSON VAREJAO:  Every month. 

 Q.  Do you do it during the playoffs? 
 ANDERSON VAREJAO:  No.  During the playoffs it's just basketball.
