Christopher Cantrell was selected by Magic Gaming with the No. 8 overall pick of the 2018 NBA 2K League Draft. His gamer tag is KontruL.   
CHRISTOPHER CANTRELL: When Pro-Am came out in 2K 16, I really grinded the game mode, and I've been playing ever since.   
 Q.  What are the challenges of playing one position as opposed to playing an entire team?  
CHRISTOPHER CANTRELL: You know, you have less control over the game, but I feel like you can pick that up at the same time with other intangible abilities such as leadership, communication and game-planning.   
 Q.  Have you done that much, playing one position?  
CHRISTOPHER CANTRELL: Yeah, I've been a point guard for a long time.  I've never really dabbled in too many other positions.  I have played the two-guard, but I've always been a point guard and sort of a leader for my Pro-Am team.   
 Q.  What's your favorite game other than 2K?  
CHRISTOPHER CANTRELL: Fortnite.   
 Q.  Are you good at that, too?  
CHRISTOPHER CANTRELL: I'm not as good as 2K, but I'm above average.   
 Q.  Christopher, what was going through your mind when you heard your name being called?  
CHRISTOPHER CANTRELL: It honestly feels like a dream.  Like I've really thought about this -- once the 2K League became a thing and I saw that Orlando had a team, I was just dreaming, I was like, that would be awesome to go there.  And then once the Lottery came and I saw eighth pick, I'm like, there's a chance I could land there, and it actually happened, and it's incredible.   
 Q.  Can you just talk about this whole experience, this whole draft experience from the league announcement to the combine to tonight?  What has it been like?  
CHRISTOPHER CANTRELL: Oh, man, a lot of hard work, a lot of taking time out to talk to certain people, meet new people.  Got to travel to New York.  It's my first time in New York, so a lot of cool new things, a lot of new experiences for me because I've always been around Florida.
