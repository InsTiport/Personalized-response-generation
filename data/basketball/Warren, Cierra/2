THE MODERATOR:   We're joined by SanDiego State.   Coach, just some general thoughts on tonight's game.   
COACH TERRY:   Sure.   Just really happy we got the victory tonight.   I thought Air Force came out and gave us a really good game.   
Their record does not reflect how good they are.   I just want to give them so much credit because they play hard and play everybody tough.   I admire that about that team.   
So excited for us to get the win, but thought we have a lot of things to improve on.   One thing I'm most proud of, we had 17 assists, which is huge for us.   We're playing shorthanded without a point guard.   For us to take care of the ball and share the ball like we did tonight is a good omen for us going forward.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions for the student‑athletes.   
   
 Q.   You were up 50‑42, Air Force scores three quick baskets about five minutes to go.   What is the mindset as you were in the timeout talking over the strategy?  
KHRISTINA HUNTER:   I think our mindset was just to stay calm and play harder.   It's win or go home, and we're not ready to go home yet.   
   
 Q.   Sometimes a natural tendency with a team like Air Force, their record, teams can overlook them a little bit.   Did you have any of those thoughts coming into this game?  
KHRISTINA HUNTER:   I don't want to say we overlooked them.   I think we were just nervous being here knowing that we're one‑and‑done.   I think they came out as hard as they could.   We came out and we just got to pick it up for tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Last year you entered as the heavy favorite coming into the tournament.   You made the championship game but fell short.   Does that motivate at all coming back this year and playing?  
CIERRA WARREN:   I mean, I didn't play last year so I didn't actually get to experience that.   
But just being there, I got to watch the last game, I knew we were a better team, we want to get back to that spot and get the win.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk about the offensive glass there the last few minutes.   You were strong.   Was that a matter of you being a little bit more aggressive and attacking the basketball in those situations?   
CIERRA WARREN:   In the beginning they were boxing us out, keeping us away.   We knew we had to go to the board and score.   That's how we win our games.   
THE MODERATOR:   We'll continue with questions for coach.   
   
 Q.   Quick turnaround going into tomorrow's game.   Nevada got you the first time going in.   What are you going to look to do differently?  
COACH TERRY:   I don't know if we're going to do a lot of things differently.   We just need to do some things harder.   I don't think we played our best game up there.   Excited to have another shot at them.   
We need to rebound the ball.   We need to rebound the ball better.   We need to take care of the ball to have an opportunity.   We're shooting such a very high percentage from the field, we shoot ourselves in the foot and turn ourselves over.   
We didn't have opportunities to score.   But they're a very good team and can score a lot of different ways.   They have bigs that can match up with our bigs.   They have guards that can shoot the ball and beat people off the bounce.   They're tough guards.   We have to go back and prepare and give a good effort to be competitive.   
   
 Q.   You're playing without a point guard right now.   I thought your girls did a good job of making the extra passes to get open looks.   Is that something you were working on in practice?  
COACH TERRY:   Absolutely.   Everybody knows how talented our bigs are.   The two that sat next to me are two of the best in the conference.   Everyone knows that we're going inside.   
Air Force did a great job taking that away.   That being said, our guards were patient, knocked down shots when they needed to.   Chloe Johnson had seven assists for us.   She was amazing for us.   If she can play steady like that, we'll be good.   
You're right, we're playing point guard by committee.   Khristina is a point forward.   We've made many references to Magic Johnson.   They probably don't even remember who that is, they're so young.   
Like I said, if we get a shot up, that's good for us.   Our offense is offensive rebounding and getting a second chance.   They did a great job taking that away from us tonight.   We were very resilient, got some big boards down the stretch that we needed to win.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you very much, coach.   
COACH TERRY:   Thank you.
