THE MODERATOR: If you could start with an opening statement about what you bring to your new team.
MARQUESE CHRISS: I think I bring a versatile skill set that I have, and I'm willing to learn and ready to play.
Q. I spoke to you yesterday, if you remember, and I asked you, how do you feel you have to change your maturity and how will you have to adjust?  Having gone through something like this on draft night, how has your mindset changed and how are you preparing yourself for the season?
MARQUESE CHRISS: Well, this taught me patience.  I mean, things happen, and you're just going to have to adjust and live with situations and just look for the best parts in things.
Q. What do you expect is going to be your biggest challenge going into Phoenix, especially with all the moves they made today?  What do you think is going to be the best part of being with this team going forward?
MARQUESE CHRISS: You said the best part or my biggest challenge?
Q. Well, the biggest challenge and the best part mixed together.
MARQUESE CHRISS: I think the best part is playing for a young team with a new coach, and I think he takes pride in developing the youth.  I don't really know what the biggest challenge will be.  I think just being on a different team and just being surrounded by people that I don't really know personally.
Q. What's it going to feel like to get your first paycheck?
MARQUESE CHRISS: I mean, it's going to be crazy, just a game that I've always played for free and just played for fun, and I'm getting paid for it.
Q. Who was your biggest supporter growing up?
MARQUESE CHRISS: Definitely my mom.  She's been there for me.  Everything that I do, she's always had my back.
