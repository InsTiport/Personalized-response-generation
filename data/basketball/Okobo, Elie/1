ELIE OKOBO: It's an amazing feeling right now.  It's amazing to be part of this process, get your name called in the NBA Draft.  I'll be part of the Phoenix Suns.  It's amazing for me, and I really appreciate it.   
 Q.  It's three straight years of a French player being picked in the first round.  Talk about the influence you guys have had on the French basketball players coming up and just the talented crop of young guys like yourself from France.  
ELIE OKOBO: Yeah, there's a lot of good players in France.  Those who are already in the NBA, it's an example for us.  We're trying to work hard to get there and play against them and see them in the national team, too.  Yeah, it's really an example.  Everybody in France wants to come in the NBA, and today it happened for me.  So I'm really happy.
