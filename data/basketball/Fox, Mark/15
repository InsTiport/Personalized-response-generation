MINNESOTA  Â– 66
  GEORGIA - 62

Q.   The officiating, what did you see from them that had you upset at times? 
COACH FOX:   Officiating is part of the game.   That's all I'll say about it.   It's part of the game. 

Q.   What changed in the second half?   You were able to cut a significant lead and bring it down to I believe three at one point.   What changed and worked better for you guys in the second half? 
COACH FOX:   We just started taking care of the ball, quite frankly.   We had 15 turnovers in the first half and only 16 shots.   We just did not start well.   And finally Frazier gave us great leadership at the point and we stopped turning it over and gave ourselves a chance to win. 
Congrats to Minnesota.   They outplayed us.
