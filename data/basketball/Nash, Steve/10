		   STEVE NASH: Yeah, ditto to what I said yesterday.
 (Laughter) 

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 STEVE NASH: Yeah, I mean, two practices. And we've got to go out tomorrow and work our butts off and earn a victory.

 Q. What do you anticipate from them?
 STEVE NASH: We've got to expect for them to play well again and we have to raise to their level. We can't expect them to come in and play poorly. We have to expect them to come in and play their best and we have to match that.

 Q. Scored at least 25 every quarter of this series. What does that number mean to you? Anything differently that you guys could do defensively to thwart that?
 STEVE NASH: Yes, that's what we've been working on. But who knows. Each game takes on a new dimension. Hopefully we can improve on some of the things we do defensively. 
 We have to slow them down a little bit. Obviously threw a lot out the first few games defensively. But they also played exceptionally well. They made a lot of shots. 
 But hopefully we can improve and maybe they won't shoot the ball quite as well. We can bring them down to earth a little bit and give ourselves a chance.

 Q. Is the defense much more important than offense?
 STEVE NASH: Offensively we're not bad. We're scoring 107 points, shooting 50 percent. That's what we did in the San Antonio series, holding San Antonio to around 100. So we've got to find a way to get them back down and somewhere closer to 100. And if the offense stays the same or improves, gives us a chance to win.

 Q. Are you starting to feel a little more like --
 STEVE NASH: I felt great. I felt all the way back two days afterwards (indiscernible).
