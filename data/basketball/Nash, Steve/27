<p>	Q.  Just seemed like they kind of seemed to take you out of your game where it became more of a one-man-trying-to-do-it all.  Talk about trying to get back together as a team. </p>
<p>	Q.  Rather than looking at one game last night, kind of the series overall what does that say to a team about San Antonio, been together so long, they have to get some sort of credit for that?</p>
<p>	Q.  If you were to simplify things and say there's one thing you got to better tomorrow as a team that gives you a good chance to win, what could you point at?</p>
<p>	Q.  Look at the Red Sox last year and say if they can do it and why not us?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you look at it more of the Islanders and the Maple Leafs back --</p>
<p>	Q.  Would it be unfair to say that this series says something about the way you guys play and how successful --</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you think the players on your team, especially the younger guys on your team can learn from playing a team like the Spurs in the playoffs?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Question about getting Shawn involved more offensively). </p>
