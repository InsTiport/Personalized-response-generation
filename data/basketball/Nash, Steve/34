<p>	Q. Are you going to take yours to Majerle's and make a collection for Phoenix? </p>
<p>	Q.  Phoenix Suns are represented pretty well so far, you must be proud?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you do any preparation or just go out? </p>
<p>	Q.  Just try to put a little pressure on Q and Joe?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you told Pop that you want to only play a certain amount tomorrow?</p>
<p>	Q.  What's wrong with you, what is ailing? </p>
<p>	Q.  Second question, a bunch of your teammates yesterday were mentioning you for MVP honors, the early leader in the clubhouse.  I know you've said before, your teammates do such a great job that you don't want to take a lot of credit, but is that still nice to hear, like guys from Kevin Garnett, Shaquille O'Neal?</p>
