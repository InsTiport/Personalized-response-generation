  Q.  Can you see Las Vegas eventually being an NBA city?   
 STEVE NASH:  Yeah, I can see it happening.   
 There is danger, but I think there's danger in every city, in every city, in everything.  I see it happening and I don't see why being in Vegas has to rule that out.  I think it's up to people to make the right decision.   
  
  Q.  Do you think free agents would be excited to come here?   
 STEVE NASH:  Outside of the Strip, I think Vegas is a vastly growing community and one that people really love living in.  I think this would probably be a nice place to play.   
  
  Q.  What are you trying to get out of this weekend?   
 STEVE NASH:  Primarily I'm trying to rehab so that I can try to play (not many people try to rehab in Vegas) (laughter), but I'm going to try to see if I can practice on Monday.   
 Other than that, I'm going to try to have some fun and do what everyone does in Vegas.  I'm not a big gambler, and I'm not playing this weekend, but I'll try to give you guys as many quotes as I can.   
  
  Q.  What qualities make a great point guard?   
 STEVE NASH:  I think you really have to understand the game and have an intelligence on the court and a comfort in what you're doing.  It's so important the intangible quality out there of making the right decision, of being able to read every act and understand your teammates and the situation of the game and kind of adapt to situations really naturally and easily.  That's the big skill, understanding what your team needs and being able to read every act.
