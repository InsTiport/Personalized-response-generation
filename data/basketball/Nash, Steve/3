Q.   How humbling is it to hear your peers speak of you in such high regard and possibly Hall‑of‑Fame status?
STEVE NASH:   Well, it's very flattering to be respected by your peers.   It's really the ultimate kind of mark of your success, when the guys that you're playing against, competing against, they say that.   They know the truth of the matter.   We all go against each other and what each player brings to the table.   It's definitely flattering having the respect of all your peers. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
STEVE NASH:   Yeah, I guess what I'm saying is that I wouldn't put a limit on it.   I might play three more years and I might play more.   There's no reason to put a limit on it.   I mean, what will transpire will transpire.   But limit‑wise, I don't feel like I necessarily‑‑ who knows.   Right now I feel great and I'm going to enjoy it.   I wouldn't want to put a limit on it.

Q.   You had a chance to play with Kyrie Irving early in the season.   Your impressions?
STEVE NASH:   Kyrie can play.   Very talented, outstanding getting to the basket, finishing, and he also brings a lot of other things, as well.
