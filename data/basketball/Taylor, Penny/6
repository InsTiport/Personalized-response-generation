   KAREN KASE:  We'll take a quick statement on what you thought about the game overall. 
 PENNY TAYLOR:  Well, it was what I expected.  It was physical.  We got out and we ran to start with.  Probably the down fall for us they got a lot of shots on the inside easy.  Got the ball down lower we were trying not to let them get. 
 They're good down there.  They're big.  Bigger than us.  And it's something we have to focus on. 
 We know how to do it, we have done it in the past and we just have to focus a little more for the next game. 

 Q.  Were you surprised at how much success they did have inside without Sheryl Ford? 
 PENNY TAYLOR:  No, no, no.  They have great post players.  They have people that get on boards.  Big bodies down low and that's what they do.  That's how they win games. 

 Q.  Did you ever run into a double post like that before?  That you ran into in the second quarter? 
 PENNY TAYLOR:  In what sense? 

 Q.  When the two, Braxton and -- 
 PENNY TAYLOR:  Yeah, I guess there's not many teams with the amount of big players, but you can only deal with one at a time and that's what we needed to do. 
 THE MODERATOR:  That you very much. 
 PENNY TAYLOR:  Thanks.
