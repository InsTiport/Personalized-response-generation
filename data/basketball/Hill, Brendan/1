BRENDAN HILL: I'm just excited and looking forward to it.
Q. Have you been to Orlando before?
BRENDAN HILL: I've never been to Orlando.  I've been to Florida a couple times and spent some time in the state of Florida.  I've heard great things about Orlando from friends and family that have been, so I'm excited and looking forward to being there.
Q. And where are you from?
BRENDAN HILL: I'm from Tyler, Texas.
Q. How did you get into playing 2K?  How long have you been playing?
BRENDAN HILL: I've been playing 2K for about 10 years.  Me and my friends used to come home after school and play because we all played basketball growing up.  Then I started getting into it competitively about two years ago, and it's been my main focus ever since.
Q. And when did you realize that you were good at it?
BRENDAN HILL: Probably about a year ago when the league started.  Last year actually before the Combine, people were telling me that they thought I could get drafted and was good enough to do this and make a living out of it.  I just tried to focus on that and keep moving forward, and this year it has worked out for me so far.
Q. Did you try out last year?
BRENDAN HILL: I did.  I didn't make it last year.
Q. How did that motivate you?
BRENDAN HILL: I was down for a little bit, but it motivated me to further my game because I wasn't as good as I thought I was at that point.  So it was humbling.  It humbled me and just made me want to work even harder.  It's got me here to this point, so I'm excited.
Q. And what do you think you bring to the team?
BRENDAN HILL: Low-ego guy.  Just want to do whatever it takes to win.  I feel like I'm a good teammate.  I'm looking forward to working with everybody and just doing whatever it takes to win.
