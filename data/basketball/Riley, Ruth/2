<p>	Q.  What was going through your mind at the end of the game shooting those free throws?</p>
<p>	Q.  After you were having a tough game shooting the basketball, it seems you went to your floor game and you had a lot of steals, a lot of assists in the ballgame; talk about that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the catch on that last play before you were fouled; it seemed like the most difficult part of that play?</p>
<p>	Q.  What was going through your mind when that free throw was bouncing off the rim? </p>
<p>	Q.  This was probably as close  -- I mean, I know the politically correct thing is to say this is a team victory, but this was as close to a single-handed show as we've seen here.  Can you talk about taking over this game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about what was going through your head before the free throws at end with 5.9 seconds left?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about where all three of you were on defending the last possession for Purdue? </p>


<p>	Q.  I know there has been a lot of talk this year about how Notre Dame has been a more balanced team, where in years past it was maybe Ruth and four other people on the court but Kelley and Niele; can you talk about how fitting it was that it was Ruth on the line at the end? </p>
<p>	Q.  Your ankle looked a little tender in the warmups, but it did not seem to affect you during the game? </p>
<p>	Q.  The lob to Ruth, what did you think of the release, how good of a pass and how good of a catch was it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you describe the foul?  What did Shereka do to hinder you on the play that you went to the line? </p>
<p>	Q.  Yes.</p>
<p>	Q.  Throughout the game, did you feel like you were dominating the game?  Did you feel like you could do what you wanted to do and get it to go where you wanted?</p>

<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  The winning play on which Ruth got fouled, how many times have you run that in practice?  Was that exactly what you wanted to do?</p>
<p>	Q.  In the men's Final Four, they talk about benchmark games, Bird, Magic, North Carolina, that type of thing.  Might this year be looked at as game brought the game to a higher level?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was that the longest few seconds of your life at the end after the free throw went in? </p>
<p>	Q.  What does this mean to you personally and talk about  what it means to the context of the whole university's athletic scene? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just explain what the three seniors have meant to the program, and also how competitive can you be without them?  What do you see ahead?</p>
<p>	Q.  And as far as next season without them? </p>
<p>	Q.  Ruth had missed in this free throw situation in the BIG EAST tournament.  What did you say when they took the time-out and she was going to the line, and how did she appear to you at that point? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk a little bit about Niele, and did you have an exchange after the game and could you have written a better script for her to go out? </p>
<p>	Q.  You took a little bit more time coming out of the locker room before the game, with three minutes    before the start, what was said there?</p>
<p>	Q.  After the Sue Bird play in the BIG EAST game  -- (inaudible) -- did you not want to that happen again?</p>
<p>	Q.  You were 1 for 10 on the 3-ball tonight.  What were your thoughts when it finally went down to tie it at 62?</p>
<p>	Q.  With this great championship game tonight, could you consider this a statement for all of the women basketball fans across the country that women's college basketball is a great game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about Ruth's play in the game, how much she did dominate, not only scoring but drawing the fouls, putting people on the bench; how important that was for you?</p>
