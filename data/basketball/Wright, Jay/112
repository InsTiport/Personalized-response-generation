<p>	Q.  Jay, you said it's tough to take.  Tough to take because you wanted the game decided in a different circumstance?  Tough to take because of...</p>
<p>	Q.  When you look at stats, you see it was 55%, five turnovers.  Hard to find stats like that when a team loses.  Do you look at that...</p>
<p>	Q.  The last second, did it look like a foul? </p>
<p>	Q.  Considering the magnitude of the game and how well you played, toughest loss you've ever had? </p>
<p>	Q.  Allan, can you talk about what happened on the last play. </p>
<p>	Q.  Defensively in the first half, do you feel that you put up the effort you wanted? </p>
<p>	Q.  Yesterday you were able to shoot, get to the line 30 times.  Today you only managed 14 attempts.  Is that a big difference in the game plan? </p>
<p>	Q.  Randy, can you talk about the defensive intensity.  It looked like Coach was kind of mad at you guys in the beginning, called an early time-out. </p>
<p>	Q.  Was there a point where you look and think, "They're hitting everything"?  They couldn't miss. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, against Pitt yesterday they had a lot of trouble getting the ball up court and getting into their offense.  What is it about West Virginia that allowed them to do what Pitt couldn't do against what looked to be the same defense? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, are you happy with the defensive effort?  I know four minutes in you called a quick 30-second time-out and you looked very animated, like you were upset. </p>
<p>	Q.  How do you rebound from this game and play the type of basketball you played all season?</p>
<p>	Q.  What do the players think about that? </p>
