<p>	Q.  Jay, the last play of the game, was that exactly what you wanted?  If you were going to go down, that's how you wanted to go down? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about how many guys stepped up in the first half when Gary didn't have it. You got five guys that double figured. </p>
<p>	Q.   How pleased were you that you were right there at half time without Gary's point contribution?</p>
<p>	Q.  You're up 4 with 2:49 to go.  What were you telling the guys in the huddle to keep them ahead? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is this game kind of epitomizing the season you've had in terms of determination? </p>
<p>	Q.  Snow, talk about the last play and what you saw as you dribbled down court. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, I know you have some more basketball to play obviously.  Can you talk about how you finished the season.  There's a lot of courage you guys showed the last two nights.  Can you talk about that.  And, in general, where the program is heading to, as a question as well. </p>
<p>	Q.  Brooks, I know it's hard to put it all in perspective right now.  But do you take pride personally in what happened this season? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jay, you know, earlier in the year you talked about this team having to learn how to be tough.  Did they learn that over the last half of the season?  Is that something they learned the last ten games?</p>
