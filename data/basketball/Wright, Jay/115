<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)?</p>

<p>	Q.  What does it say then about this team that's been through so much adversity, particularly late in the season and had their sort of gut check in question to pull that off?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jason, I know that you haven't gotten down on yourself despite all the problems with your injuries.  To finally see it come to fruition in this sort of game when there's so much on the line for you, does it make it especially sweet for you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about that big three late?  Ran some time off the court. </p>
<p>	Q.  That was a new play? </p>
<p>	Q.  You gonna keep it?</p>

<p>	Q.  Both players, can you talk about what it means to you that you're at least now NIT eligible? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jay, after what happened at Villanova, how important was it for you to play with the pace tonight for you guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  Beside (inaudible) what did you do a little differently? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mike, in the second half, it seemed like you started to go at Jason.  Did you recognize that as a time to get the ball inside? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jay, can you describe what it's been like knowing that you have such a phenomenal talent in Jason Fraser, but not having the talent come out until a time like this?  Has it been hard? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the matchup with Connecticut.  What about tomorrow night? </p>
<p>	Q.  Does it matter if Emeka plays?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jason, people who follow your team think that your club needs another big man.  How does that make you feel? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mike, as a point guard for this team, I know your season is not over yet, but is there any sense of redemption about going down to the wire and pulling one of these out? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just tell us, Jason, where do you think you are right now in terms of your full potential?  70/40, 80 percent?  Do you feel like it's starting to come?</p>
