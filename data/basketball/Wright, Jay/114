  COACH JAY WRIGHT: ...  It looked a lot worse than it was.  Al is going to be released.  He has vision and it's going to be day-to-day prognosis now.  But it's much, much better than we initially anticipated.   
  Q.  He's going to be released tonight?   
 COACH JAY WRIGHT: He's going to be released tonight.  He'll go home with us.  He'll have some medication.  They said we'll check him in the next couple days and see how he is.  See if he can play.   
  Q.  From what you saw, did you fear it was worse?   
 COACH JAY WRIGHT: I haven't seen it yet.  I heard.  I just heard.  That's why I say it "looked" a lot worse than it was.  I don't want to go into detail because I didn't see it.  I know what everyone said they saw.  The good thing is the last time I talked to you, they said he was starting to get his vision back.  Now he's got his vision back to the point where they feel confident to release him.  He's going to be fine?   
  Q.  Will he go home with you tonight?   
 COACH JAY WRIGHT: Yeah, he's going to go home with us tomorrow.   
  Q.  Will you take a guess as to whether or not he can play in the next game?   
 COACH JAY WRIGHT: I don't know.  They said day-to-day.  I got to feel very good?   
  Q.  Say anything about the cornea?   
 COACH JAY WRIGHT: No, no.  They said they're going to release him.  No scratched cornea.   
  Q.  What's the official injury?  What are they calling it?   
 COACH JAY WRIGHT: Soft tissue injury of the right eye.   
  Q.  Stitches or anything?   
 COACH JAY WRIGHT: No, no.   
  Q.  Basically he got poked in the eye?   
 COACH JAY WRIGHT: Yes, yes.   
  Q.  (Inaudible)?   
 COACH JAY WRIGHT: I feel great for him right now.  When I came to see you guys, they said this is very serious.  They said they'll keep checking.  When I got back, they said, "Hey, great news.  He's got his vision."  Everybody knows what everybody saw.  They just said it just looked a lot worse than it was.   
 I sent my assistant to tell him (inaudible).  I'll be with us tonight.  It's good.  We have to go day by day to see how he is, but this is the best possible -- there were a lot of scenarios.  I guess they had to be cautious first, that's what they hit me with.  This is the best possible scenario.  So it's great news.   
  Q.  Medications are to help the swelling or prevent infection?   
 COACH JAY WRIGHT: That, I don't know.  Just drops.  Just drops.   
  Q.  Is it hard for you the second half, is that in the back of your mind the whole time?   
 COACH JAY WRIGHT: You know what, honestly, I didn't know how serious it was.  You know, I tried to move the guys away from him, they didn't bother the doctors.  I just concentrated on the team.  Kept asking where he was.  Finally, someone said they took him to the hospital.   
 I still just, for some reason, assumed he was going to okay.  They were being cautious.  I didn't know until after we met with the team.   
  Q.  (Inaudible).   
 COACH JAY WRIGHT: I feel great right now, exactly.  Exactly right.  I feel great.  I mean, as you all know, you think about this season, you're thinking about -- I didn't ask if he could play.  I was more worried about his future.  They said he's fine (inaudible).   
 They said day by day now.   
  Q.  (Inaudible).   
 COACH JAY WRIGHT: I don't know.  I don't know.  You know what, right now, like they said someone else had a scratched cornea.  That would have been more serious than what he is right now.  They just said it's the best possible case.   
  Q.  Doctors on site thought it was serious and took him to the hospital.   
 COACH JAY WRIGHT: Well, over time, his sight, he couldn't see when he was here.  Then being there, they did a great job there.  Everybody did a great job.  Our trainer got right to him.  They explained to me there was pressure on it right away.  Got him down to Saint Vincent's immediately, got an ophthalmologist rushed in there, took care of him right away.  Then they just had to wait to see.   
 When I first saw them, they said his vision was starting to come back.  Now they said his vision's good and they're going to release him.   
  Q.  Did you talk to him?   
 COACH JAY WRIGHT: No, I haven't talked to him yet.   
 Thanks, guys.
