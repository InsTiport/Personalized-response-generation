<p>	Q.  Taliek, can you tell us a little bit about that three-pointer, how far out you think it was.  You knew it was going in? </p>
<p>	Q.  Does it mean a lot to do it here in New York where you're from? </p>
<p>	Q.  When did you realize the shot clock hadn't reset and there was only two there? </p>

<p>	Q.  Caron, yesterday you talked about, you know, your team being the kings of your division and them being the kings of theirs.  Can you sum up what you have been through on this floor tonight in winning this championship? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, in the second half, at some point I think you took Ben out when he got in foul trouble.  Tony Robertson started to play Knight.  It looked like Knight started to get a little frustrated.  Was that because of what Tony was doing?</p>
<p>	Q.  When Brandin went out, their defensive effort didn't lapse at all.  Did that surprise anyone?  Or, you know, what was it like playing them without Brandin Knight on the court for basically two overtimes?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jim, you can only do so much film study of a team that you haven't faced.  What was chief among your concerns in facing this team for the first time in this type of setting?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you expand on that.  The stretch in the second half, period of about nine minutes, the defensive execution on the part of both clubs was just spectacular.</p>
<p>	Q.  When Brandin came back in the game with 1.7, he couldn't walk.  What were you thinking at that point?</p>
<p>	Q.  Caron, can you talk about how much this three games helps you guys for what you're about to get into this week coming up? </p>
<p>	Q.  Ben, could you talk about playing against the defense.  Were you frustrated early on?  You got free a little bit later in the game.  What was it like playing against that type of defense? </p>
<p>	Q.  Taliek, you said that you knew there was two seconds left.  You had the presence of mind to take a dribble, square up and shoot.  Were you feeling any pressure? </p>

<p>	Q.  Coach, what are some of the words that you might use to describe Pittsburgh's effort to keep up with you without their star player in mind?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jim, major conference tournament weeks sometimes become a lesson in bubble talk, where seedings are.  Can you talk about how special a night like this at a conference championship level is.</p>
<p>	Q.  Jim, I was just wondering if you can again put this in perspective.  What does the fifth one mean?  You didn't know whether you wanted clear your bench, not clear it.  What was going through your head?</p>


<p>	Q.  Jim, you may have partially answered the question.  When did you finally exhale?</p>
