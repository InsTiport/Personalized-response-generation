Q. Anything that he (Kevin Garnett) can do that you wish you could do?
ANDREW WIGGINS: No, I like my game.
Q. How does it feel to be a teammate of his?
ANDREW WIGGINS: He's a great teammate.  He's like a big brother to all of us.
Q. So has he ever passed down any experience to you?
ANDREW WIGGINS: Yeah, every day.  Every day he's saying something different, trying to get us to a different level.
Q. What is the message to them when he's talking to guys?  Is there something he kind of hits on with you guys?
ANDREW WIGGINS: Yeah, maybe you can say it resonates with the young guys more because they're very successful.
Q. Your thoughts on Kobe?  It's his last season, and you've had a chance to play with him a little bit?
ANDREW WIGGINS: Kobe, you're talking about one of the all-time greats now.  What he did for basketball, no one will ever do it again.
Q. Does he do anything for your game, and is it possible he may work with you?
ANDREW WIGGINS: He did a lot for my game.  I watch him a lot of times when I was younger, and I got older too.  I would love to work out with him.  To be honest, to watch him work out and see what his work ethic is, and see what he's working on.
Q. What does it mean to have the game in your own backyard?
ANDREW WIGGINS: It feels good.  I get a chance to play for my family and friends.
Q. What do you think of Karl-Anthony Towns?
ANDREW WIGGINS: I think he's a great talent, great big man.  He's been dominating every big man we play, so I like playing with him.
Q. Has KG or anybody given you any advice about this year's All-Star Game?
ANDREW WIGGINS: Have fun.  He told me to have fun.
Q. Have you ever thought about coming to China to visit?
ANDREW WIGGINS: I have before.
Q. How do you like it?
ANDREW WIGGINS: I liked it.  It was nice.
Q. What do you think about the possibility of you being still a Cavalier player under David Blatt and about your trade to Minnesota?
ANDREW WIGGINS: I don't really think about it no more.  I like where I'm at.  I feel like I have a better chance here than I would have there.
