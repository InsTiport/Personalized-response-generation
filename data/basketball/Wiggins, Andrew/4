Q.   Do you think you'll perhaps next year be part of the big game, in your hometown of Toronto? 
ANDREW WIGGINS:   That's a dream of mine.   That's a goal, obviously.   I hope I can make it happen. 

Q.   Andrew, how would you say the season has gone? 
ANDREW WIGGINS:   I think we got off to a slow start.   All the injuries (Inaudible).   I think when everyone came back, we got better.   We're a different team now. 

Q.   How do you feel like the season is going for you personally? 
ANDREW WIGGINS:   I think I started slow.   Picked it up. 

Q.   Do you think that being in Minnesota and having more and more freedom you can grow? 
ANDREW WIGGINS:   I think so. 

Q.   This is a weird question:   But perhaps have the injuries to some of the few guys on the team helped you in your development in terms of being the go‑to guy for a long period of time in terms of the offense? 
ANDREW WIGGINS:   I would say yes.   I will become more of a scorer.   Just trying to impact the game a lot of different ways.   It's made me grow up fast.   There was not a lot of people on the team.   With Ricky gone and K‑Mart, Zach, a lot of people had to pick up a lot of the slack.   So I think that helped me a lot. 

Q.   Coming in with the pressure of being the first overall pick, how did having Anthony Bennett with you, his experience going through it, how did that help you deal with that pressure? 
ANDREW WIGGINS:   It was great.   He taught me a lot.   If I had any questions, I've known him for a long time. 

Q.   What kind of things do you guys talk about? 
ANDREW WIGGINS:   Just the process.   The basketball side and the business side. 

Q.   What goes through your mind when you think about being on the big stage of the All‑Star game in Toronto next year? 
ANDREW WIGGINS:   I don't know.     I just know it would be crazy. 

Q.   Who has been your biggest influence so far this season? 
ANDREW WIGGINS:   On my team? 

Q.   Would it be a player?   Bennett?   A teammate?   And how, I guess. 
ANDREW WIGGINS:   Going forward early in the season I would say it was Coach Flip.   Corey Brewer taught me a lot on the defensive side, the game of basketball itself. 

Q.   Do you have any memories from Greece, where your father played? 
ANDREW WIGGINS:   I was too young.   I don't remember anything. 

Q.   Do you feel that you combine the athleticism of your mother and the shooting touch of your father? 
ANDREW WIGGINS:   Definitely.
