  (No. 25 Overall Selection, Houston Rockets)

 Q. Talk about your feelings about being picked and would you describe your style of play, please. 
 NICOLAS BATUM: I'm feeling great. You know, that's it, I'm in the NBA. I'm in the NBA now with the Houston Rockets, a great team, and I think it's one of the best opportunities in the NBA. 
 It's a great team with Yao Ming and others and it's great and I want to play with this team very quickly. 
 My style of play, I think I can play on this team, I can play two or I can play three and I can score baskets and get the ball or get some assists and try to help on defense. 

 Q. How familiar are you with the other players from France that are in the league now, like Tony Parker, Boris Diaw? Do you know those guys or do you just know them from seeing them play? 
 NICOLAS BATUM: I don't know the other players in the NBA. 

 Q. Just talk for a second about what it will mean to play with Yao Ming, one of the best international players of all time and being on the team with him. 
 NICOLAS BATUM: We all know, it's great to play with a big guy and normally I watch him on TV the last five or six years and now I'll play with him, Scola. I think it will be incredible to play with him.
