 THE MODERATOR:   We are joined by Rhyne Howard.  Questions, please.
 Q. Obviously tough day for you guys today.  What was different today from earlier in Athens when you beat Georgia?
 RHYNE HOWARD:   All credit to Georgia.  They came out a lot more intense than they did the last time.  We dug ourselves a hole early in the first quarter.  Then they just stayed on our necks.  We tried to make runs, but things just weren't going our way.
 Q. Was there something that Georgia was doing to you guys, especially down low, that made it difficult for you?
 RHYNE HOWARD:   They definitely interrupted us down low.  Jenna Staiti being down there, she's a big body.  But some of it is us as well.  We got to lock in and we got to be able to finish down there.
 Q. There's a huge gap between now and when you guys get your NCAA tournament seed, when the tournament starts.  What do you do in that big gap to stay together as a team and get ready?
 RHYNE HOWARD:   We're definitely going to reflect on this one, go back and see where things went wrong, what we can do to get better.  We just keep practicing, staying up, keep our heads up, look forward to the next one.
 Q. Obviously you knew that the NCAA tournament is in your future regardless of what happens at this tournament.  How much fire does this give you to lose in this quarterfinal round?  Is it more motivating for you guys to get back in the gym and be better or does it matter?
 RHYNE HOWARD:   It's definitely always some motivation that can come from anywhere, but this is motivation.  We knew that we were going to have to win this game and we should have won this game, in my opinion.  But we know we're a better team than what we showed today, so we're going to prove it next time we step on the court.
 THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
 RHYNE HOWARD:   Thank you.
