<p>	Q.  Coach, do you believe you won this game after going 9 and change without scoring a point in the second half?</p>
<p>	Q.  This question is for Marcus.  Did you know how much time was left on the shot clock when you took that shot?  Are you going to tell us that as soon as it left your hand you knew it was good? </p>
<p>	Q.  Why did you shoot with so much time left on the shot clock? </p>

<p>	Q.  You found a lot of different ways to win this year.  Today, free throws was a big part of it.  Can you talk about that aspect of the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was going to ask about the free throws.  But during that drought in the first ten minutes of the second half, for the players, did you kind of feel it slipping away?  Was there a frustration, and how big was it when Donald got that slam?  Did that kind of right everything for you guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  How frustrating is a game like this for the players?  There's been a couple recently where, you know, there was a sequence where all three up there tipped and missed and rebound, all like four or five shots in a row.  You just couldn't get it to fall.  What goes through your head at that point? </p>

<p>	Q.  Do you think you're in the NCAA tournament? </p>
<p>	Q.  Anthony? </p>

<p>	Q.  Throw in your two cents, Coach.</p>
<p>	Q.  Are you going?</p>
<p>	Q.  NCAA tournament?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, your 20th win tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  You're in a tough conference?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about what it means to win 20 games?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)?</p>
