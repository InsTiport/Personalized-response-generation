 Q.   What's this experience been like?  
BRADLEY BEAL:   It's terrific.   My brother is here and he's getting to experience this lifeâ€‘style.   It's all fun.   My parents have come down and they just enjoy it all.   To see how far I've came, they're real proud of me.   
   
 Q.   There's so much food down here, how do you separate the food from playing basketball?  
BRADLEY BEAL:   I won't be eating nothing healthy, I can tell you that.   I'll be dragging on the court and you'll know why.   But you got to do a little gave and take here.   
   
 Q.   Did you get any tips from your mom?  
BRADLEY BEAL:   No, she will probably give me a lecture here tonight.   I'll be ready to hear that.   
   
 Q.   Did the legends make an impression on you?  
BRADLEY BEAL:   I think it's kind of cool like where some of them are real laid back.   They don't think of themselves highly or anything like that.   
And if they know who you are, they will speak.   And if they don't know you, they will still speak.   So that's pretty cool.
