THE MODERATOR: Congratulations, Brad.  What does it mean to use your platform to touch the lives of others?   
BRADLEY BEAL: First, praise my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.  It's an honor.  As professional athletes, basketball players specifically, we're forced to be these role models, these heroes to kids.  And little do they know they have a bigger impact on me than I probably do on them, teaching me lessons and instill in my son in the same way that I interact with them are lessons and things that I have to teach my son one day when he's old enough.   
I just embrace it.  It's always important to give back to the community and I appreciate Ron Brown [College Preparatory High School] and the whole school for accepting me and allowing me to mentor them.   
 Q.  I'm from St. Louis myself.  Can you tell us how your upbringing led you to what you're doing right now?  
BRADLEY BEAL: For me, my parents, man, I give them all the credit.  They raised me the right way and to be able to utilize my platform to stay humble, you know, through everything that you've been through and hungry to achieve more, that speaks volumes.  For me, you know, I've been in the same situation as these guys, so whatever knowledge I can instill I'm always willing to pass it along.   
 Q.  Congratulations, Brad.  It's one thing to give those kids two pairs of sneakers during the holidays, but what was your message to them about a month ago when you brought them into the practice facility and ultimately sent them to the bowling alley, but there was a message specifically you wanted to give to them.  What was it?  
BRADLEY BEAL: It was don't cheat yourself in nothing.  Because I feel like their opportunity to succeed is really greater than a lot of other kids in D.C.  They go to a college prep school, and I went to a college prep school; it cost $20,000 to 40,000 grand to go there a year, but their school is a public school so they got the same education for free.   
If that's not something to take advantage of, then I don't know what is.  You guys have a great education system.  The school has only been open for three years, they don't even have seniors, so next year will be the first year that they have seniors.   
It's just realizing what you have, realizing opportunities you have.  Realizing the system that you're in, just taking full advantage of it.  Every person that you meet, your resources, whatever path you cross, just make sure that you're respectful, you're appreciative and you continue to work hard and achieve your goals.   
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.
