BRANDON CAICEDO: Brandon Caicedo, Cavaliers, Legion Gaming.
Q. Congratulations on the draft.
BRANDON CAICEDO: Thank you.
Q. Can you tell me what it's like to now be a part of a real NBA franchise?
BRANDON CAICEDO: It's a surreal feeling.  It's a feeling I can't really describe to you.  It's crazy.  I feel almost numb to this.
Q. Yeah.
BRANDON CAICEDO: Yeah.
Q. How long have you been playing NBA 2K?
BRANDON CAICEDO: I've been probably playing 2K for like over 10 years, competitively for all 10 years on different websites, stuff like that, and now on a professional video game.  It's crazy.
Q. What kind of regiment does it takes to become that?
BRANDON CAICEDO: A lot of hard work, dedication.  I put 10 hours a day into this day until this day, so definitely hard work.  Hard work definitely paid off.
Q. Do you have advice for someone who wants to become a professional gamer?
BRANDON CAICEDO: Don't give up on your dream.  There were a lot of people that told me I couldn't do this.  They'll tell you stuff to put you down.  Keep working.  Keep working.
Q. What's your favorite game that isn't NBA 2K?
BRANDON CAICEDO: Definitely on the Fortnite train right now.  I feel like everybody is probably giving you that answer, but definitely --
Q. Everyone else said they were good, too.  Are you good?
BRANDON CAICEDO: Oh, I'm the best.  I'm the best console player there is.  People that play on PCs, you know, they just move a keyboard around.  It takes no skill.
But come see me on some real sticks, because I'm the best.
Q. Did you set out to be the best dressed guy here at the draft?
BRANDON CAICEDO: I feel like I definitely showed out today when it comes to the outfit.  It's a once in a lifetime experience, so I had to stand out today for sure.
Q. What kind of conversations did you have with Anthony [Muraco] and the guys at the Cavs leading up?  Did you think it was going to be a good fit for you?
BRANDON CAICEDO: Personally I didn't think I was going to drop this far; I thought I was going to land in the top 10.  I had a conversation with Muraco a couple days ago, and he told me if I did drop he was going to pick me.
So, I mean, I'm ready to get started in Cleveland.  Definitely.  I'm excited.
Q. How did it feel to have your name called?
BRANDON CAICEDO: It's like a feeling you can't really explain.  I just felt almost numb to the fact that my name was called.
To see all these people cheering for me, it was great.
Q. What are you most excited to bring the Cavs?
BRANDON CAICEDO: Winning, definitely winning.  I feel like I've done it at the highest level, and I feel like I'm going to continue to do it in Cleveland.
