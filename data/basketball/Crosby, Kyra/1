South Carolina   57
  Alabama   38

THE MODERATOR:   We're joined by Alabama head coach and Kyra Crosby.   Coach, some opening comments.
COACH HUDSON:   I thought it was one of those games where South Carolina, we were playing pretty good, South Carolina went on a run right before the half, five‑minute period there where they scored 16 points and we didn't score.   We struggled a little bit. 
I thought we played hard.   But it's hard to come back.   We were not able to score.   I thought Kyra did a really good job in the post for us, was a bright spot from an offensive standpoint for us.   South Carolina had something to do with the way we played. 
I just thought we had opportunities and didn't take advantage of the opportunities.   But as far as playing hard and giving a good effort, I thought both teams played very hard.   South Carolina shot the ball better.   You look at their shooting percentages, wasn't much better than ours.   They went to the line and converted those free throws.   That was kind of the difference in the game. 
THE MODERATOR:   Questions. 

Q.   Kyra, talk about what they were doing in the first half that stifled you offensively. 
KYRA CROSBY:   I believe we beat ourselves.   We weren't patient on offense.   We needed to attack them and do what we planned to do.   All teams get ruffled in tense situations. 
I think next time or next year we can do better because we learned from this. 

Q.   Coach, there were some bright spots tonight, almost matching them in rebounding.   The positives you take away from this, how do you take this away and go into the next season, how to improve?
COACH HUDSON:   One of the things I think we talked about a few minutes ago about next year, it already started at the end of this game.   We have to take those positive things. 
I think Kyra was one of the big things we can take into next year, get her healthy.   If we can get her healthy, with the effort we got out of her tonight, nobody know how much pain she's been in, not able to practice, come back.   That's the good thing for us because we know when she's healthy what she can do.   From that standpoint, that's something to build on for next year. 
There's a couple other things.   Rebounding the basketball at times, we wasn't bad.   And getting the open shots.   We didn't make them, but we got the open shots.   We have to step up, make those shots, have people step up and make them, especially perimeter shots that would open up the inside so she wouldn't be double‑teamed.   Those are positive things we have to look forward to next year. 
KYRA CROSBY:   I mean, next year I hope we all have the same mindset, that we're going to go hard in every practice, in every game.   Every game is different.   But it's also in the same sense new.   We have some new girls coming in. 
I just hope that next year we more focused to go against our opponents and to know we have it at the end of the day.   Doesn't matter what our record is, we can't let those teams determine our fate.   So that's how I feel. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
