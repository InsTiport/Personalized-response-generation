  Arkansas - 64 
  
 THE MODERATOR: We've got Vanderbilt head coach Melanie Balcomb. Coach, if you could make an opening comment about tonight's game.   
 COACH BALCOMB: I just felt it was a tremendous game on both team's part. I thought both teams fought very hard on both ends of the floor and made big plays when they needed it. It was a tough game I think for anybody to lose. You hate to see anybody lose a game like that.   
 But somebody has to move onto the next round. As even a game as I've ever been in.   
 THE MODERATOR: Questions.   
  
  Q. Coach, there's been a lot of talk about the parity in the SEC this year. Did the seeding make any difference?   
 COACH BALCOMB: No. That's the way it's been all year. When you look at the scores every night, I can't believe this score and that score. Everybody has been surprised all year. Nothing is going to surprise us.   
 We had a really tough time at Arkansas, as well. I knew in a one-and-done situation this might be the most exciting SEC tournament that we've experienced.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about what your game plan was for the overtime.   
 COACH BALCOMB: Keep the ball in Jence's hands as long as I could.   
 You know, really shutting down their three. They hit huge shots from three. Then they went into the post, and the post was scoring. It was tough to make a defensive game plan. When we doubled, they kicked out three. We were trying to make game-time changes all night on offense and defense.   
 I think we hit a spurt on offense where we couldn't make a shot and that hurt us and they got the lead.   
 I loved our fight back in that situation to get it to go to overtime.   
  
  Q. How important is this game to LSU tomorrow?   
 COACH BALCOMB: I'm always one of those people that thinks about the positive not the negative. Going in, what I like is that we've already played on this court, so this is our home court now and they're just playing their first game. That's the way I look at it.   
 We already have our feet wet on a neutral court and are comfortable, and a victory on it. Sometimes I will take that, if you look at it in the scheme of things.   
 We take one game at a time. You always want rest if you can have it. I like that we've won on this court already and feel comfortable on it.   
  
  Q. Rebecca, your post play has improved considerably. Can you talk about the change.   
 REBECCA SILINSKI: It's just all about confidence in practice and being prepared for the game-time situations, and then going in knowing that I'm ready to be able to play and to contribute, so...   
  
  Q. I haven't looked at the box scores yet. Jence, are you high scorer?   
 JENCE RHOADS: Yeah.  
  
  Q. High scorer again. What do you have to say about how difficult this game was tonight?   
 JENCE RHOADS: Arkansas battled. It was a battle from tip to end. They are a good team. Even though they were the 12 seed, they came to play. They gave us a good game, and luckily we were able to come out on top.   
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
