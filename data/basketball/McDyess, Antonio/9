<p>	Q.  Could you tell what the Spurs doing differently? </p>
<p>	Q.  Seemed like there was more switching in the second half in the pick-and-rolls?</p>
<p>	Q.  Guys are not used to getting hammered in the fourth like you did last night.  How do you respond?</p>
<p>	Q.  Not to make an excuse, but do you sense --</p>
<p>	Q.  So with a chance to get your legs under you and get some rest a little bit and thinking about what Ginobli and what Parker were able to do in the second half, do you think you'll be much more physical with those guys particularly in Game 2? </p>
<p>	Q.  After seeing the Spurs, how they played against Phoenix, up-tempo and now they come in and kind of play your guys' game and they beat you, what do you think of their ability to be so versatile? </p>
<p>	Q.  What do you need to do in Game 2? </p>
<p>	Q.  As confident as this team is, losing a game like that, do you just say, "hey, we can play so much better"? </p>
<p>	Q.  How do you think Rip will adjust to Bowen's defense? </p>
<p>	Q.  Point guard matchup in this series, how do you feel?</p>
<p>	Q.  Where did you watch the game last night, in your room?</p>
<p>	Q.  How often do you do that? </p>
<p>	Q.  What do you have to do for Game 2? </p>
<p>	Q.  Why didn't you come out more focussed?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would you be surprised if you went home down 2-0? </p>
