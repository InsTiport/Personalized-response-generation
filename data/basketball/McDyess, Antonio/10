<p>	Q.  Ben, Bruce Bowen is known as being a great defender, you two, I guess, different kind of styles or do you think you're equivalent?</p>
<p>	Q.  Any worries about being prepared? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the challenges. </p>
<p>	Q.  Nobody is easy, but in some way, does he provide an easier assignment than Shaq was or not? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think it's appropriate the two best defensive teams in the league end up here? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is it going to be a pretty Finals with all of the defense or is it going to be an ugly final?</p>
<p>	Q.  Some guys have written that there's no glitz and glamour in this thing, is that offensive to you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Not personally but team to team they are saying that as well. </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there a rallying point for this team this year, no matter what the adversity, you overcome it no matter where you are?</p>
<p>	Q.  You almost seem to like the "us against the world" mentality because you seem to play your best that way. </p>
<p>	Q.  How has your game changed since before the injuries, you get by a lot more on smarts and stuff now, can you talk about how different your game is? </p>
<p>	Q.  Has this been the perfect fit for you at Detroit; you don't have to start and you can monitor your minutes and all that? </p>
<p>	Q.  The give your thoughts on the 2003 champions playing the 2004 champions? </p>
<p>	Q.  This series doesn't have the megastars, but a lot of people are touting it as a series that's played "the right way," pure basketball.  Your thoughts on that? </p>
<p>	Q.  The whole concept of these two teams playing basketball the right way, and it may not be that glamorous with the megastars but these two teams are going to play a pure series. </p>
<p>	Q.  Probably an interesting matchup, you on your side, Bruce on the other side. </p>
<p>	Q.  People say that Chauncey, he's a quiet leader; does he ever talk to your team in a forceful way?</p>
<p>	Q.  Any concern from the team's perspective, eight days' rest, seven days' rest for the Spurs, and you only had one day to get over Monday night.  Any concern there?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do the Pistons as a team respect the challenge of taking on the Lakers last year, the Spurs this year, the best coming into the finals? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the challenges, the differences in preparing for Miami, as opposed to an San Antonio?</p>
