  Q. You seem to be the guy that benefitted the most when they sent the ball to the weak side. Just talk a little bit about that.   
 ANTONIO McDYESS: I mean, they left me open. I was just in the open spots, and Chauncey kept giving me the ball in the right spots and I just had to convert off of it. I think with KG and those guys, their four and five, they love the help. So just getting in the right spots at the right time was good last night.  
  
  Q. Is there any added pressure knowing how they like to load up on that strong side and knowing you're usually the guy that's going to get some good looks?  
 ANTONIO McDYESS: No, no added pressure. I just know what I need to do in this game. I know I'm going to be an open guy. I know how much they help out on everyone, and it's just left up to me to go out there and do it and make shots and knock them down.  
  
  Q. What's the overall mindset? I know you're probably kicking yourselves a little bit because you played bad last night and had a chance to win, but overall you have the bad game under your belt?  
 ANTONIO McDYESS: Of course not; it's the first game. They just took care of their business, what they need to do at home. It's just up to us to try to get the second game. I think we still was in the ballgame even with the way we played. We played a horrible game. We felt we played a horrible game, and we just can't continue playing that way. I think tomorrow is going to be a little different.
