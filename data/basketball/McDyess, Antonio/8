<p>	Q. Antonio, it's hard to tell I guess, but how close are you to what you were physically and if you could just summarize what an ordeal this has been to get back to this point?</p>
<p>	Q.  Game is tied 63, late third, you guys went on a 21-6 run, what keyed that run for you guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  After one of your baskets in the fourth quarter you had a big smile on your face.  Going back last year when you had to decide where to go, why did you pick Detroit?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the last two games where it seems as though the confidence has just been there. </p>
<p>	Q.  How close were you to quitting after your third knee surgery?  And two, how did you mentally get it in your head that you had to change your game and not be the dominating, physical player you used to be? </p>
