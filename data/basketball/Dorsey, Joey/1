		  (No. 33 Overall Selection, Portland Trail Blazers)

 Q. If you could start with talking about getting picked by Portland? 
 JOEY DORSEY: Just to be picked by an NBA team is a special feeling for me. I'm going to live it. I'm going to live it up for a minute. 

 Q. We talked in Orlando about this opportunity, and now that this opportunity is here and the Portland Trail Blazers, how do you feel about that? 
 JOEY DORSEY: This is crazy. Me and Greg are going to be playing with each other now, so this is going to be great fun for me. It's an exciting team and very young team. 

 Q. What do you think about playing with Greg? You do have some history together. 
 JOEY DORSEY: It's going to be fun. I'm going to enjoy it and became a good player on defense and now I have a chance to go up and play with Greg and we can provide some great defense for our team. 

 Q. Did you expect to get pick in the first round? You did show up here, and I know you wanted to have a good time with your surroundings tonight. 
 JOEY DORSEY: It was from 21 to 29, Detroit, but yeah, I'm just happy being picked. Still excited.

 Q. Are you surprised that Chris has not gone yet? 
 JOEY DORSEY: Very, very surprised. Me and Chris talked, and he was like -- he wasn't going to watch it. Right now he's in the air flying right now. He said he wasn't even going to watch the draft. 

 Q. As you know, second round contracts are not guaranteed, so what do you need to do this summer to make sure you're going to get yourself a spot on this team in Portland?
 JOEY DORSEY: Just like I always do, work my butt off and stay in the gym and keep working at it. This is my dream now to live it, so I've got to stay in the NBA now.

 Q. Any particular aspect you need to tone up for the NBA?
 JOEY DORSEY: Defensive specialist.
