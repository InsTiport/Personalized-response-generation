<p>	Q.  Will Bynum, he hit maybe the two biggest shots for you both games.  Has he made a habit out of that?  Secondly, could you discuss his influence since he's joined the team maybe in helping the other guards, that sort of thing?</p>
<p>	Q.  Both teams are athletic, depend on defense.  Are they similar?</p>
<p>	Q.  You looked at some tape.  The Eddie Sutton defense, how impressed are you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the problems of overcoming the numbers game when you first got there, the eight-five rule, maybe specifically about a certain player?</p>
<p>	Q.  Now that you're here, can you talk about what's the toughest part of reaching the Final Four, then talk about maybe how you've been able to compensate for this being your first time here, facing Eddie Sutton who has been here three times. </p>
<p>	Q.  I know you're concentrating on your game here.  What sense is there, if any, of maybe rooting for Duke in the other game because of the ACC connection?</p>
<p>	Q.  The experiences you've had in this tournament, your team specifically.  You mentioned how you've had some tough games and yet when you came out of Milwaukee, you were the highest remaining seed in that region.  How do you think that those tough games you played prepared this team for this experience?  How is BJ's ankle? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've played Connecticut and Duke.  You watched Oklahoma State on tape.  You've probably seen your team a time or two.  Could you pick a Final Four favorite? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the specific challenge of going against Coach Sutton, a veteran who has been here several times before?</p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of people are talking about the perimeter match-ups.  I was hoping you could look inside a little and talk about that match-up.  I think in the past you said Luke might be one of the most improved players in the country this year. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you address the conversation you had with George Raveling before the Kansas game?  What could you take away from that soon before the game?  Will you try something similar Saturday?</p>
<p>	Q.  When Clarence Moore left the team, how confident were you that he would return?  How different is he here for the experience?</p>

<p>	Q.  Jarrett, I know Chris Duhon said he called you to congratulate you on getting to the Final Four.  Are you guys rooting for Duke because of the conference connection? </p>
<p>	Q.  Marvin, Coach Hewitt said one of your keys would be when you run through the lane, get bumped by a physical Oklahoma State team, to not let that distract you.  Has there been anyone else you played this year who that reminds you of, against whom that also has been a key? </p>
<p>	Q.  Luke, any of your family going to make it here?  Do they understand the Final Four?  Do you have anything to do with those T-shirts of you?  Do you have one yourself? </p>
<p>	Q.  T-shirts. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the way you guys have won, a lot of different people stepping up, scoring for you guys, winning close games in the tournament.  What has that done for your confidence coming into the game tomorrow? </p>

<p>	Q.  Jarrett, could you talk about your play in St. Louis, how offensively you may have more confidence now than you've ever had in your life? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jarrett, Luke is a big man in the middle on a team that's guard-oriented.  How does his presence work into the overall theme of your team? </p>
<p>	Q.  Following up on the defense, the individual defensive effort of this team.  Your four opponents in the tournament, you have held each top scorer individually under 25% shooting.  Talk about your individual defensive effort as it fits into the team defense. </p>


<p>	Q.  Marvin, can you talk about in this tournament run what maybe you've learned about the whole tournament experience that maybe you didn't know two weeks ago? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jarrett, when a player like BJ goes down at such a critical time of the year, how does that bring the team together?  What was your role in helping with that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you tell us about Oklahoma State, what you've seen of that team so far on the tape? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jarrett, you watch a lot of ball.  Coach Hewitt said of the four teams in the Final Four, he liked you guys best.  Is that just him being a coach or do you think you're the favorite here? </p>
<p>	Q.  Oklahoma State had a practice this year where they wore football helmets and shoulder pads to toughen up their rebounding.  What's the craziest thing you did in practice this year? </p>

<p>	Q.  Marvin, you've seen Coach Hewitt now through four years.  How has he evolved as a coach in a big-time league?  Do you think there's some personal vindication for him getting to the Final Four here this year? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the idea you're coming in here basically with nothing to lose, nobody's expecting you to win this game tomorrow. </p>
