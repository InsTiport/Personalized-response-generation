  Q.  It's a rumor that congratulations are in order.  Is that correct?   
 BRUCE BOWEN:  Yes.   
  
  Q.  Don't be shy.   
 BRUCE BOWEN:  I'm a proud papa again.  I had a son this morning.  It went well.  My wife allowed me to come to practice after that, and here I am talking to you lovely people.   
  
  Q.  I'm sure that's just exactly what you want to be doing right now.   
 BRUCE BOWEN:  I'm glad that my wife is doing well and the baby is well.  So, you know, what a gift during quite a time.   
  
  Q.  Is the name --   
 BRUCE BOWEN:  [] Cuban, Cuban name.   
  
  Q.  This is your second child?   
 BRUCE BOWEN:  Second son.   
  
  Q.  Is it better the second time around?  Can you kind of describe your thoughts and what you've been going through?   
 BRUCE BOWEN:  It's nice.  It's a waiting process.  You know, you've had one before, and you want the health of your wife and child, more than anything, you want that to go well.  Everything went well, but it's just the waiting process.  There's nothing that you can necessarily do in that time but wait, and that's what we did.   
  
  Q.  Were you in the delivery room and all that?   
 BRUCE BOWEN:  Yes, therefore I got to hold him and take some pictures, and proof of that so that he won't be jealous when he gets older and hears that his brother got in here and he didn't.   
  
  Q.  What time?  Was it early?   
 BRUCE BOWEN:  9:19.   
  
  Q.  So this has been quick?   
 BRUCE BOWEN:  Yes.   
  
  Q.  Any concern that had it been a little delayed that you might have been missing the game?   
 BRUCE BOWEN:  You know, there's definitely no need to speak in hindsight or anything like that.  I was fortunate enough to be here.  The thing that I'm most happy about is that with our first child, he was born after The Finals in 2005, and this child was born during The Finals of seven.  I'm a happy gentleman today.   
  
  Q.  You've got title babies.   
 BRUCE BOWEN:  I hope that's prophetic.
