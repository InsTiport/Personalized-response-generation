 Q.  Does anybody have a harder job than you in the league? 
 BRUCE BOWEN:  I'll allow you all to be the judge of that.  I don't think it's necessarily my place to say, oh, yeah.  You guys have to look at the job I do.  Whenever you hear a player doing something like that, it sounds like sour grapes, and maybe they didn't do the job they were supposed to do.  You all do the reporting of the game and you all tell it how you all see it, and that's more or less what it's about. 

 Q.  What you guys did against LeBron last night, was that best-case scenario in terms of limiting his effectiveness?  Can you get much better than that against him? 
 BRUCE BOWEN:  I think we did a great job, and they're going to come out and make adjustments.  I think it's a good job, but it's not the end.  We still have a long ways to go as far as -- they're going to make adjustments, and that's the thing you have to guard against more than anything else at this time of year. 
 It's really about adjustments.  They'll adjust to some of the things that we did, and we'll have to adjust to the things that they're doing.  It's a situation of adjusting right now. 

 Q.  How do you prepare for those adjustments, obviously not knowing exactly what they're going to do?  Do you try to do the same thing you did? 
 BRUCE BOWEN:  Basically you try to do the same thing, and one thing I can try to do night in and night out is try to make things as tough as I can on them.  That doesn't mean taking things away, but it means doing the little things.  Maybe it's denying him the basketball at certain times, getting a hand up on each and every shot.  Those are the things that you can control.  You can't control if they start doing a different type of pick-and-roll.  It's still left up to you as a basketball player to come out and give 110 percent on whatever it is that you're doing.
