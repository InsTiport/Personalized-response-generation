<p>	Q. How fun is it to play this game when you guys are hitting 3-pointers like that? </p>
<p>	Q.  You're guarding Rip on one end, how do you still have legs down on the other? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you sense Rip getting a little frustrated with your defense sort of like Carmelo and Ray (Allen)? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you do any extra shooting after Game 1?  Did you get in the gym? </p>
<p>	Q.  the Pistons got it within eight and you guys just blew it open, it was like a 16-2 run or something.  Can you talk about your team's ability to close games out and make it easy at the end. </p>
<p>	Q.  You guys are playing at such a high level right now, how big of a challenge is it to continue in Detroit playing to the degree that you are right now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Tell us about how big the win was tonight in terms of heading into Detroit.  But Pop says that the defense, it goes through you, it starts with you, and when you see everybody else doing extra hustle and stuff, how does it make you feel?</p>
