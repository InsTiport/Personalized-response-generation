  Q. Bruce, how do you gauge whether you are playing tight? Obviously you can't look at box scores?  
 BRUCE BOWEN: Box scores doesn't say it. I think whenever -- if he is going to score big numbers and other guys are not, he's going to get his numbers regardless. You want to make sure to do your best as far as paying attention to shooters and not allow easy baskets for the other guys.  
  
  Q. Last night you did a pretty good job of that.   
 BRUCE BOWEN: I was happy with it. We got the victory. That more than anything is the deciding factor of how we feel about things.  
  
  Q. Kobe said he felt the biggest problem was offensively missed a lot of bunnies. Do you have a problem with that?   
 BRUCE BOWEN: I don't have a problem with that. In this game, you know, it happens. You miss some layups. Whereas, it is a six-point lead now. It may turn into an 8-point lead or you can cut into a lead if you make some shots.   
 I know they went on a 9-0 run when we were in Los Angeles. And we got great shots. We missed them. Had we made those shots, maybe we wouldn't have gone into halftime down as much as we were at that particular moment.
