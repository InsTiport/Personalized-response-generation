  Q.  What was last night like for you?   
 BRUCE BOWEN:  It was fun.  It was great to be in a situation like that.  It's The Finals, and a lot of people would love to be in our shoes right now, and it's about experiencing and really enjoying that time while you can.   
  
  Q.  Was that a foul on the last play?   
 BRUCE BOWEN:  I don't know.  Did the official blow the whistle?   
  
  Q.  Was it a foul?   
 BRUCE BOWEN:  If the official blows the whistle, it's a foul.   
  
  Q.  Was it your intent to foul?   
 BRUCE BOWEN:  It was my intent for him not to shoot a three-pointer.  He got off the three, he got away from me quickly.  The play before he had drove real fast and I was thinking maybe he's going to try to drive and get the foul as soon as we get the ball in.  But he did what he was supposed to do as far as getting off the shot quick.   
  
  Q.  Was there any fear in your mind of a four-point play?   
 BRUCE BOWEN:  No.   
  
  Q.  (Inaudible).   
 BRUCE BOWEN:  It just says that it doesn't matter for all the guys that are over 30 how it starts out in the NBA, but whether you can get in there and find a niche, and that's something that I've been fortunate enough to do, and I relish the opportunity that I do have in being able to be able to lead my team in minutes right now at this point in the season.  So I'm really happy with that, and it's due to all the hard work that I've put in in preparation with my body.
