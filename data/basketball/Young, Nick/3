 Q.  Nick, you're known as a something of a good scorer, is there anything you're going to teach Gilbert when you go in there, or are you going to let him show you a thing or two? 
 NICK YOUNG:  I'm going to let him show me a lot.  I could teach him my fadeaway.  (Laughter). 

 Q.  How good does it feel to be in a situation like with the Wizards where they have made the playoffs the past few years and you are not going to be going into a rebuilding situation? 
 NICK YOUNG:  It's a great feeling just to be drafted.  Going to a team like Washington is great. 
 I watched them over the past years and I watched what Gilbert did to the Lakers, so it's a great feeling going there. 

 Q.  You grew up in the San Fernando Valley and went to school in downtown Los Angeles, a little nerve-wracking coming 3,000 miles across the country on your own? 
 NICK YOUNG:  Yeah, but me and Gilbert come from the same area so he'll show me the ropes.  I'm just glad to be in this situation and it's a blessing. 

 Q.  It's been a very big year for you, documentary film coming out about you; how does it feel as a culmination of your year? 
 NICK YOUNG:  You know, this is great.  It ended up just the way I liked it.  It's a great feeling to get drafted in the first round and knowing where you're going.  The hard three weeks of workouts and plane rides and delays is over now.
