THE MODERATOR:   Joining us now from Arkansas is head coach Tom Collen, Keira Peak and Sarah Watkins.   We'll take an opening comment from coach.   
COACH COLLEN:   I'd like first to congratulate the University of Florida.   I thought they played a good basketball game.   Obviously we just played them down there, and it was a great game.   We went out, lots of runs back and forth.   Give them credit, they made big plays down the stretch, they came from behind.   You got to give them credit for the win.   
It was a big game I think for both of us.   I think both of us feel we were on the NCAA bubble trying to find a way to prove that we belong in the NCAA tournament.   I think we knew the winner of this game probably had the opportunity to be a little bit higher on the bubble.   
So Florida has earned that right and they'll go on and hopefully do whatever they need to do to get in the NCAA tournament and represent the SEC.   If they do, we'll be their biggest fans, even though we might not like them right now.   
So we give them credit.   
As far as our team goes, I got a great basketball team.   This team has played tough all year long.   I've said this over the last two weeks:   I know there's a lot of things that have to happen for you to get in the NCAA tournament.   Realistically speaking we probably with this loss today might not get invited.   
But the one thing I can say about the SEC and this team, without any doubt in my mind, the University of Arkansas is good enough to get in the NCAA and get in and win games and advance.   
But the criteria is the criteria.   You have to do what you have to do in order to make that easy.   
I'm proud of my team.   They came from behind several times in this game.   They did everything that I asked them to do.   We just came up a basket or two short.   That's kind of been the story of this team all year long against top‑notch opponents, especially in the SEC.   
THE MODERATOR:   Keira.   
KEIRA PEAK:   It was by far a tough loss.   It was just hard 'cause we knew we could go out there and if we played our hardest, we would win.   
We just fell short the last few possessions or whatever.   
THE MODERATOR:   Sarah.   
SARAH WATKINS:   We've had a great season in the SEC.   We haven't come out with a lot of wins that we thought we should have had.   Played a lot of close games.   It's just another game that slipped out of our hands that we didn't finish the way we should have.   Maybe could have gotten the win if we tightened up on some turnovers.   The SEC is a tough conference to play in.   
COACH COLLEN:   I guess I'm going to repeat myself here again.   If there's no media here this is probably not going to go out on the news wires.   
I think the SEC is the best conference in the country, no doubt about it.   There's no conference in the country that could try to argue in this particular year.   We've had five teams ranked in the top 15 all year long in the polls and RPI.   No other conference comes close to that.   With LSU moving up in the polls, now they're sixth.   
This conference is good enough to get nine or 10 teams in.   Realistically speaking, I don't think it's going to happen.   I think some of us are going to have to try to win the NIT.   But this is the best conference in the country, and hopefully the NCAA committee will take notice and decide they want to put the best 64 teams in the tournament.
