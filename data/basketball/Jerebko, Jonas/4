 Q. Could you just go into your style of play and what you'll bring to the Pistons? 
 JONAS JEREBKO: A lot of energy, first of all, defense. I'm just going to try to do what's best for the team. 
 I'm looking forward to it. Detroit has got a great team, and I'm going to have to contribute to the team. 

 Q. And what do you know about your teammates, who are you looking forward to playing with? 
 JONAS JEREBKO: I was there and I had a really good principle. They have Tayshaun Prince in my position and can learn a lot from a guy like that. I know they have a great team and I'm looking forward to going there. 

 Q. How do you feel after waiting a long time?
 JONAS JEREBKO: No, it's been a long time, but when I heard my name, I got very happy. 
 So that's what matters. 

 Q. How close are you to Tony Ronzone?
 JONAS JEREBKO: He's watched a lot of my games. I've seen him at camp. I like the Detroit organization and Joe Dumars. It's going to be a good experience.
