<p>	Q.  If you could just take us through that last shot? </p>

<p>	Q.  That was the play you were supposed to be somewhere around the top of the key or just inside the paint for that shot? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the difficulty that Ruth presented tonight for you?</p>

<p>	Q.  If you could just explain the frustration of just getting in foul trouble and trying to stay in it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just talk about how the future looks bright for Purdue with how well Shalicia and Shereka played tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel like you fouled Ruth?  Just talk about the call? </p>
<p>	Q.  The first half, you guys dominated the rebounds so much, did you really feel like that was maybe when you should have kept  -- had a chance to put them in a bigger hole going into halftime?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think you should have extended your lead, with doing all that on the boards?  Do you feel like the first half was when you had a chance to really extend a lead and build an insurmountable lead?</p>

<p>	Q.  Do you feel like on the last play from Notre Dame you had them pretty well defensed?  She (Ruth) had to make a pretty difficult catch? </p>
<p>	Q.  On your last defensive possession?</p>
<p>	Q.  What was the last play that you called, and what went awry, if anything? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about your perimeter defense? </p>
<p>	Q.  You had 13 offensive rebounds in the first half and only  a few in the second; did something change tactically at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you just talk about any concluding thoughts on just how good a season you have had and some thoughts on the future with the freshman that you have this year? </p>
