Q.   Do‑or‑die situation, you've been there, done that in the past.   Can you just speak about tomorrow, what's going to happen? 
DEREK FISHER:   I don't think I have that kind of talent. 

Q.   But psychologically how do you prepare and use your influence to help your teammates, so to speak?
DEREK FISHER:   Obviously we're down three games to one, but I don't think the mindset changes dramatically.   I think your goal is still to win a basketball game.   You can't try and do more than that, can't try and win the series in one game.   It's really just a matter of focusing and bringing it together for one game and allowing everything else to take care of itself.   We've had good opportunities to do that in Games 3 and 4, but we haven't been able to finish the job, and so we're in a position now where we have to finish the job.   It's that simple. 

Q.   How do you finish that job? 
DEREK FISHER:   Just finish.   You know, there are obviously a number of plays and things that happen throughout the course of the game that lead to the score being what it is down the stretch, but you just find a way.   There really isn't a script or a plan for it.   You just come up with a loose ball, you come up with a rebound, you come up with finding a way to get a basket when you need a basket, and you just make it happen.   We've had some chances to do it, and we haven't been able to do it, but we still believe in our ability to be back in that position to give ourselves a chance to win, and we feel like we can do that tomorrow, and then obviously either you do that or your season is over. 
We want to continue to play.   We want to give ourselves a chance to get back home in front of our home crowd and extend this series and keep it going.
