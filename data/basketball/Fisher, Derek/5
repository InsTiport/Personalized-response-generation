 Q.   You said a long time ago to me that one of the things you really liked about this team is the way they just enjoy playing together, and when it came down to the hard times, that sticking together was going to help them through that.   Do you feel like this is one of those times?   
DEREK FISHER:   For sure.   You know, this is another great opportunity to show what becoming a champion is all about.   You know, it's not something that ever has come easy.   Every team that has won a championship has earned the right to be champions.   And so we're faced with another opportunity again tomorrow night to come together as a team and be confident in who we are and figure out a way to come out here and win a game.   
You know, things turn a great deal in these series with one game, and we have the opportunity to turn it tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   When you're down 2‑1, is there any looking back to the last series and being down 2‑0 and figuring out what changed at that point, or is this a totally different situation?  
DEREK FISHER:   I mean, I think you can always use your past experiences individually, collectively, to help you maneuver situations you're in currently.   But still respecting the fact that this is a new team, a new series, the circumstances are different, the stage is bigger.   But you know, we're confident in our ability to put together the type of game that can get us a win tomorrow night.   We're not a team that is shaken in any way in terms of not being able to win a game, and the next game is tomorrow, so that's the game we're concentrating on right now.
