		   DEREK FISHER: Have a great coach, lead this team into a position to have good shots. I think once you're in position, you have five guys out on the court, somebody is going to find a way to help the team. When you've coached as many great teams as he has, that gives us more opportunities to have those special plays. 
 He's definitely seen a lot of them. 

 Q. Now that the emotions have subsided, what are the details you want to focus in on as you're going for Game 6? 
 DEREK FISHER: Continuing to limit turnovers, especially on their floor. Turnovers for a team momentum shift, when we had the leads, two or three possessions where we turn it over, sometimes a quick shot is like a turnover. It really allows them to really stay in the game and get back in the game. 
 If we can keep our turnovers low, you know, continue to really lock in on the things we want to do defensively, then we feel like we can give ourselves a chance to win tomorrow. 

 Q. Pau has been a top player. Has he raised his game even another notch in these playoffs? If so, how important is that? 
 DEREK FISHER: I don't know if Pau has necessarily done more than what he's always done, at least since he's been here. He's been amazing. He's been consistently there for us, scoring and rebounding. He has the ability to read the floor, make great passes, just being a great teammate. 
 I don't think what he's doing now is out of character, per se, or something we haven't seen him do before. I think he's doing fully what he's capable of. 
 Just because they're playing a lot of zone, he might not be popping out with 28 points or those things, but it's only because they're playing the zone. There's not really that many guys that can match up with them.
