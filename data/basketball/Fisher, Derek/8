		  DEREK FISHER:   We're not here by accident, those guys aren't here by accident.   They've capable of getting a lot of special things done.

Q.   A lot of attention in this series are going to go on Kevin and LeBron.   What do you think that match‑up will be like? 
DEREK FISHER:   That's for you guys to discuss.   I don't really spend a lot of time thinking about individual match‑ups.   It'll be a lot of fun for you guys to go back and forth with that, and obviously because of how great they are and guys that are one and two type players, etcetera, it makes it more exciting.   But for us, it's truly a team game.   We're not expecting Kevin to be supernatural for us to win.   We just want him to be who he is and the rest of us to be who we are and be the better team.

Q.   You guys are sort of the people's choice.   The Heat is sort of the heavy for a lot of different reasons.   Does it feel any different in terms of the national perception of the team you're on right now? 
DEREK FISHER:   Not really.   I guess if the people's choice helps us win games, maybe I'd feel differently, but with all due respect, there's not much that can do for us on the court when we're playing against the Miami Heat.   We're in a good position in terms of the people's choice being on our home court and having our home fans to be here to open up tomorrow night.   But overall, at the end of the day, it's about our mentality and our approach to the situation, and we'll let those parts of it kind of take care of themselves.
