 Q. This is more quiet before the storm because you've had a couple days to get ready for Game 2 now. 
 DEREK FISHER: Yeah, today was a good workday for us. Obviously this time of year you don't physically put yourself through too much the day before a game like tomorrow. But we watched some film and got adjusted out on the court and covered a few things. Anyway, we just talked about bringing that laser focus back after having a day yesterday where we got a chance to step away from it and relax a little bit. 
 We plan on being ready to go tomorrow evening.

 Q. Because you will see a completely different Orlando team. 
 DEREK FISHER: Yeah, you can't count on them shooting 29 percent again from the field. Even on film we saw shots that they missed that they're capable of making and will make as the series unfolds. We didn't see anything that tells us we're just going to be able to go out on the court and win the game just because we show up. There are some things we still want to tighten up defensively and some of our offensive execution has to be a lot better, because we also don't expect Kobe to have to score 40 points for us to win games. 
 There's some things on both ends we know we can improve on, and we have to carry that out tomorrow evening.

 Q. Are there some psych games that go on during the playoffs?
 DEREK FISHER: I guess there are at times, but I think once you get to this point, I don't know -- at least for me personally there's not enough out there that can push any more buttons or have me any more psyched up or ready to play than I already am. You shouldn't need anything from the outside to motivate you at this point of the season. The ability to win comes from within. It's about you managing yourself and being ready to play when the game starts.
