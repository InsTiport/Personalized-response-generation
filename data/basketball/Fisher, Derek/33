  Q. Let's talk about the presence of Lamar last night, because not only did he prove something to himself, did he prove something to his teammates?  
 DEREK FISHER: I've never questioned Lamar's abilities to do what he did last night. I just think as a team we provided the space for him to do that. With the way we played the game last night as a group, we allowed opportunities and space for guys to step in and play the game as they're capable of playing. And Lamar was phenomenal last night, and we'll need him to be that way tomorrow. But we'll have to do the things around him to make sure he's in position to do so.  
  
  Q. He played like a monster last night.   
 DEREK FISHER: He did. He controlled the boards. There was a stretch in the game where every ball that came off the rim was going to his hands. And when he's doing that for us and rebounding that way, that takes our game to another level as a team.  
  
  Q. You know, they're going to be crazy wild; they do not want you to celebrate on their floor.   
 DEREK FISHER: Elimination games and close-out games on the opposing team's home floor absolutely are the hardest games to win in the post-season.   
 And it's a great test for us as a team. And I'm excited about this opportunity and I think our team is going to be excited about the opportunity we have in front of us tomorrow. The crowd is obviously going to be excited and intense. The Nuggets players are going to be intense and ready to go.  
 We'll not have to match it, we'll have to exceed it in order to win.
