		   DEREK FISHER: It's time to play. We've been talking and preparing and strategizing for quite a few days now, so we're all excited and anticipating the start tomorrow night.

 Q. Anxious?
 DEREK FISHER: Yeah. This is an exciting opportunity. All the dreams that you had as a kid, getting the opportunity to be in the NBA Finals and play for a world championship, definitely anxious to get started.

 Q. What will the rest of the day and especially the night be like?
 DEREK FISHER: Pretty chill. Nothing out of the ordinary. Probably spend some time with the family just to make sure that we reconnect and realize that we're all in this together, and once I get started tomorrow we're locked down and locked in for the next two weeks. Hopefully we can get the results that we want and really be able to put a cap on what we feel like has been a really good season and complete the goal that we started at the beginning of the season.

 Q. Seeing the banners and the flags and everyone here, are you having flashbacks?
 DEREK FISHER: Yeah, whenever you have a practice or shoot-around and the media numbers are much larger and you see The Finals banners and see the gold trophy on the back of the basket, it's just a great time of year. All we need here in LA is for the weather to cooperate and things will be a lot better and it will remind me of the old days. But six o'clock tomorrow night is all I'm looking forward to now.
