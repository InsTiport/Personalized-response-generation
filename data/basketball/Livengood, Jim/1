<p>	Q.  Cheryl, was wanted to get an idea of what was it about St.  Louis that made it attractive?  I know it hosted a Final Four in 2001 to rave reviews, what were the things that people liked about St.  Louis and why are you returning? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jim, the 2011 site in Houston will coincidentally mark 40 years since the '71 Final Four in the Astrodome, which I believe was the first stadium setting for the Final Four.  Was that just coincidental that you had to slot them in at that point, and could you talk about the trend again toward holding them at larger arenas that began with the Astrodome? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there a shot at getting a regional before 2010, or is that probably the first opportunity for an NCAA event to be here? </p>
<p>	Q.  So by 2010, any possibility before 2010 or would that be a little bit ambitious at this point do you think? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you expand on the Detroit bid?  They have never hosted one in the modern era, basically, and they have never hosted anything like that.  They will have a Super Bowl, obviously, but what made that really stand out? </p>
<p>	Q.  What about the idea that they have not held anything of major significance at that building when you're making the decision now? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just talk about the fact that Ford Field is hosting the game with Kentucky and Michigan State this fall, if that played into your thinking and is this sort of like an audition to see how things will go? </p>
<p>	Q.  What were the elements that you feel like perhaps kept New Orleans from getting a Final Four this time around?</p>
<p>	Q.  Tulane would have been the host institution.  Did what it went through recently in deciding whether or not it was going to stay at IA or not have any influence on the committee, do you believe? </p>
<p>	Q.  St.  Louis, were they leaning one way or the other to the Edwards Jones or Savitz Center, or do you have the flexibility of looking at either one and what will that decision hinge on what facility to use?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you elaborate on one other point, in some ways is St.  Louis hurt by the lateness of 2005 as these next ones come up, the immediacy for a city that has not had a Men's Final Four for many years?</p>
<p>	Q.  Cheryl can you elaborate on what was attractive about Tampa, and also does this mean that a regional will be headed to Tampa the year preceding the event? </p>
<p>	Q.  They might have early-round games, not necessarily regional?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you tell me what Denver needs to do to either tweak or refine its bid for a tournament past 2010? </p>
<p>	Q.  Strong point of saying the tournament had never been in a mountain time zone site and wanted to make that a big part of the presentation.  How effective was that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Just wanted to see what the factors were  -- a lot of folks here of course ecstatic that we got a couple of bids here for a Men and Women's Final coming up over last couple of years, what were the factors that went into awarding a men and a Women's Final? </p>

<p>	Q.  So the experience that you had in the past, both on the men's and women's side, played into it pretty big? </p>
<p>	Q.  Are you going to domes in 2009, 2010, so I'm wondering what tipped balance in behavior of Tampa versus Denver in 2008 when you are talking about two traditional-size buildings?</p>
<p>	Q.  I assume going by your response to the St.  Louis question that you are definitely going to be in the Alamodome in 2010; is that correct? </p>
<p>	Q.  And for Jim, could you talk about some of the organizers here, talking about one of the biggest questions you had was the future of the Alamodome, making sure it was maintained even though the Spurs are out of the building, did they ease your minds in that regard? </p>
<p>	Q.  Will you talk about the Indianapolis bid? </p>
<p>	Q.  What creative things did Houston do to attract your attention? </p>
<p>	Q.  I would think that perhaps spacing, you would want to come back to Texas for a Final Four two times in a row or two times in three years so that might be a reason for putting one Texas site in 2011?</p>
<p>	Q.  By San Antonio only having a four-year gap between Final Fours is that a sign that that city has now moved in the league with Indianapolis as one that might not have to wait quite as long in the rotation as other cities do? </p>
<p>	Q.  What about Detroit was so creative if you could expound on that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did the committee  -- Detroit is one of the cities on the upswing and there's a lot of potential here.  Were you sort of tapping into something before it became the next big spot, next big city?</p>
<p>	Q.  Cheryl, could you let me know what the difference was in the capacity of the two buildings in Tampa and in Denver, the comparison?  I believe you suggested that the size of the Tampa facility gave Tampa an edge? </p>
<p>	Q.  You had mentioned you went through a list of things that was very, that, were very attractive here.  You mentioned youth programs.  What did you mean by that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you discuss the future of the Indianapolis Colts and the future of the RCA Dome? </p>
