<p>	Q.  One of the factors talked about from year to year has been the performance of a team down the stretch, the last X number of games.  When you look at a Cincinnati or a Notre Dame or an Alabama, teams that did not finish particularly strong, but all made the field, have people tended to overemphasize that factor? </p>
<p>	Q.  Looking at Butler's seeding, it suggesting Butler was fortunate, (inaudible) wasn't in the field?</p>
<p>	Q.  As far as the conference tournament results, obviously a lot of upsets, how much of a factor does that play into the Big-10 situation with Ohio State, how much of a problem was that?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  I know you can't share all the deliberations with us, but can you share some of the most challenging elements of making the selection this year, some of the tough calls you had to make?  I know it came down to the wire. </p>
<p>	Q.  On the list that you released of other teams considered, Texas Tech is not on that list.  Are we to take from there they were never particularly strong in the consideration?  Secondly, much was made on the TV broadcast about the possibility of Arizona and Kentucky landing in the same semifinal.  I believe your answer was that the committee does not look ahead.  When you have something like this where two teams are so clear-cut from their body of work, is there any temptation to do that at all?</p>

<p>	Q.  In terms of the west bracket, it seems a lot of strong teams, traditional NCAA tournament type teams, are out there.  Is that just the way the brackets fell?  Is Luke going to talk to you on Monday? </p>
<p>	Q.  Just in terms of those who think that Butler might have been a makeup call for last year, what do you say? </p>
<p>	Q.  Question about the south region, Texas didn't win the Big-12, got knocked out in the quarters, didn't win it regular season.  I'm wondering how they ended up as the No.  1, the thinking there. </p>
<p>	Q.  I think on TV you said there isn't a true No.  1 team in the field.  Are we wrong to assume that whoever plays the play-in team, that's not the No.  1?</p>
<p>	Q.  The strength of schedule argument.  On television you spoke about Alabama and their body of work over the season, you're rewarded for playing the strong schedule.  It would seem a team like Auburn, whose non-conference schedule wasn't that great, should have worked against them.  Can you explain that?</p>
<p>	Q.  I assume assessing Gonzaga must have been something of a challenge with them having lost to two sub 200 RPI teams.  Having played a strong schedule, can you explain that. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you discuss Tennessee and losing John Hagen academically?  Did you take that into consideration?</p>
<p>	Q.  The Big-12 situation, obviously they had a pretty strong top three teams.  The fact that the conference was apparently so strong all year, was that one of the things that them played into getting two No.  1 seeds?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk, it seems you don't have the situations you had last year with the pods where you have some lower seeded teams playing close to home against higher seeded teams.  Did you do that consciously?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk a little bit about, maybe this is Bill's realm, about contingency plans in the event that we go to war this week?</p>
<p>	Q.  I'm sure you're familiar with the situation at Georgia, the pending hearing tomorrow in court, whether to file an injunction.  One of the attorneys said he'd been in contact with the NCAA.  Was that even a discussion point for y'all or was it even possible to consider?</p>
<p>	Q.  About the Big-10 situation, there was talk last year among people in the league that when Ohio State won the league, because it happened so late in the day, that wasn't impacted in where they were seeded.  Is that the same case with Illinois this year, where maybe they weren't rewarded because that game ended so late?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you comment, my assumption would be that Alabama was rewarded for its strength of schedule, especially the way it improved its schedule over last year?  The second question would be about the pod system having Pittsburgh winning the Big East, but seeded towards its regional final towards Minnesota as opposed to Syracuse getting knocked out earlier and having a potential regional final in Albany. </p>
<p>	Q.  With Florida, was that a case, as you mentioned earlier, three losses at the end of the year, the early conference schedule was a strength for them, non-conference schedule?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just address Florida after the three losses late in the year.  Was it the strength of the non-conference schedule?</p>
<p>	Q.  Back to the pod system.  This year Duke, No.  3 in the west, opens up against Colorado State in Salt Lake City.  There are also a couple 5s, Wisconsin, UConn, both out in Spokane against BYU (inaudible).  Is it just that you might try to protect the top five lines, but it is virtually impossible to do that given geography of where sites are? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there anything specifically you can point out that separated Oklahoma and Texas from Kansas as far as the Big-12's two No.  1 seeds?</p>
<p>	Q.  Kansas beat Texas head to head, if that's what you're referring to. </p>
<p>	Q.  I understand you have to leave the room when Arizona is talked about, but was there any jeopardy of Arizona not getting 1 seed after the loss to UCLA?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just in talking to your peers afterwards, did you get the sense that Arizona might have been moved to a No. 2 spot at any time?</p>
<p>	Q.  Considering how tough and strong the Big-12 was, how close was that league to getting seven teams in?  What was the biggest thing that kept Texas Tech out?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you say what were some of the bigger factors that kept a team like Texas Tech out?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was just hoping you could comment a little about the fact (inaudible) Boston College and Seton Hall out of the tournament?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talk about strength of schedule.  Seton Hall played Texas and Louisville but lost to both of them by 20.  Is that a factor as well?</p>
<p>	Q.  The fact that they played tougher teams but were blown out?</p>
<p>	Q.  The question would be about the SEC and the fact that with Georgia out, how helpful was it in the selection process that Auburn had a head-to-head game with Tennessee, won that game?  In a sense, was that a play-in game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Also was Oregon in after they beat Arizona State or did they have to win in the PAC-10?</p>
