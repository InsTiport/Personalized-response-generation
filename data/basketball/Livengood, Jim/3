<p>	Q.  I was wondering your opinions and perhaps how troubled you are by some of the recent incidents that have occurred at Fresno State, St.  Bonaventure and Georgia, and how much, if any, that kind of puts a black mark on either college basketball or the NCAA tournament?</p>
<p>	Q.  Last year the committee went to a system where they were trying to locate first- and second-round games with teams that had the local interest.  Can you look back at that, how do you think that worked out?  Are you going to do anything different this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there any way to measure if that was a success other than attendance?  Do you chart how much schools may have saved or things like that in terms of travel cost?</p>
<p>	Q.  I've got a couple questions for you.  The first one, there's been a lot of publicity recently about incentives and disincentives being offered for graduation rates.  One such penalty that has been talked about has been taking the ability to play in the NCAA tournament away from some schools that consistently fall below a certain level of graduation rate.  I'm curious, what's your opinion on using this as a possible penalty, as well as maybe some extra incentives like extra tournament money for schools that might go over a rate?</p>
<p>	Q.  Secondly, there was a release that was given by the NCAA yesterday that apparently all the games that are being played at regionals aren't sold out yet.  I'm curious, does that concern you?  Also, should that be tempered in any way about playing future regionals in dome facilities?</p>
<p>	Q.  From that standpoint though as well, there is a difference playing in a dome facility than a regular facility at the regional level.  You said that you prefer to see full buildings.  I wonder if you can explain the situation if you do have a dome facility with four or 5,000 empty seats, compared to maybe a full traditional arena?</p>

<p>	Q.  Most of us are aware that the committee's informed of situations when a team goes without a player for an extended period of time because of an injury.  Out here, Gonzaga has had a couple of situations where it lost close games when two different all-league players were out briefly with injuries just for a one- or two-game stretch.  I'm wondering if the committee is privy to those brief injury situations for any team where it might affect the team getting in.  And, secondly, is that a factor to be taken into account?</p>
<p>	Q.  If I could follow up, it appears we could, again, have a debate this year on some of the mid-major teams that appear to be on the bubble and whatnot, versus going deep into a power conference.  Is there any different take of what we might expect this year on that?</p>
<p>	Q.  It's big (laughing). </p>
<p>	Q.  This is a hypothetical, but if Georgia had done everything, taken all the action it had taken except pulling out of the tournaments, how would that have affected the way that the committee would be looking at them? </p>
<p>	Q.  Will anything about Georgia be taken into consideration? </p>
<p>	Q.  I have a question about the site assignments again, especially for the smaller schools.  I know the bracketing rules prohibit Top 5 seeds in each region from being assigned to home crowd disadvantages for the first round.  But for some of the smaller schools like (inaudible) or Boston University, who are going to be low seeds, are they prohibited from playing in Indianapolis or Boston even though they probably wouldn't affect the crowd much?</p>
<p>	Q.  I'm going to read you something very specific here.  I know you can't talk in general about Georgia, but I'm going to read you something specific about what their lawyer is requesting.  I just spoke with him.  He said they are requesting that you could pick 64 teams, have a 65th on standby so that if they win their injunction on Monday, that you slide Georgia in, the other one out.  How feasible is something exactly like that? </p>
<p>	Q.  I guess the bottom line is, the bracket that you're going to put out Sunday night, is that final?</p>
<p>	Q.  Well, I know this is unique, certainly.  But there would be no plans to have any kind of contingency plan?  You're going to put the bracket together with the teams that are eligible.  Is that correct?</p>
<p>	Q.  No, I know.  I respect that.  I just want to make sure you're also not going to deal with hypotheticals in that room; that you're only going to deal with eligible teams when you meet?</p>
<p>	Q.  As of now, Georgia is not eligible?</p>
<p>	Q.  Not asking about specific teams, but the forfeitures that some teams received from when they were supposed to play St.  Bonaventure, will that factor in at all into power ratings?  Could it adversely affect a team if it won 2-0? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you readjust RPIs that you do because St.  Bonaventure's record changed? </p>
