<p>	Q.  Kim, what do you guys need to do better to beat these guys?  They have beaten you twice.  What do you need to do better?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think playing hard and rebounding hard is going to be the difference?</p>
<p>	Q.  What about the three points in the first half?</p>
<p>	Q.  You were hitting a lot of them, Kim. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel like the edge you have on BYU is similar to the edge New Mexico has on you in any way right now?</p>

<p>	Q.  Elaine, I'll ask you the same question I asked them.  What do you guys need to do better as a team to beat these guys this time?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does that mean that you need the freshman and forwards to play better?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just talk about the three-point shooting.  They actually had more field goals than you did.  You had nine more three-point shots.  They were early on the clock.  Is that your game plan, to shoot when you are open on those?</p>

<p>	Q.  They kind of shut down Kim the second half and Shona the whole game.  Just talk about the contributions of some of your players like Heidi and Perry and some of those people that come through with some big shots?</p>
<p>	Q.  What are you going to say to get your team motivated to beat New Mexico?</p>
<p>	Q.  Congratulations.  Do you think this year there is no doubt you are an NCAA team?</p>

<p>	Q.  Do you feel like New Mexico and Utah deserve to get in?</p>
