<p>	Q.  You were like Cool Hand Luke.  Talk about that.  What was that whole deal like in the last 10 minutes of the game for you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kendra, why didn't the team get rattled when you fell behind 17-0? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kendra, given the emotional nature of coming back from 17 down, what's left to come back in the finals? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kendra, talk about Brie tonight. </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about your mindset as you're going up against Jamie Carey. </p>
<p>	Q.  Kendra, I couldn't help but see you at halfcourt doing the chest bump.  That was a pretty cool moment.  A lot of people here probably are thinking about, "What is going to happen once this senior class leaves?"  Can you talk about Twiggy. </p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of big shots in that comeback.  Can you put your finger on one?  I'm thinking of Mahoney off-balance shot.  Does somebody want to comment on that one? </p>

<p>	Q.  Given the circumstances, down 17-0, do you think this is the biggest win in the program's history? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Twiggy's game coming off the bench tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Brie tonight. </p>
<p>	Q.  You guys have been pretty good when you score 70 points.  Can you talk about that?  Is there a key to that? </p>
<p>	Q.  What makes Baylor so tough?  Why have they been able to pull out so many close games this year, including tonight?</p>
