Q.   How big was it for y'all to get off to a big start in the first quarter today?
DWIGHT HOWARD: I just think it was good for our confidence for us to be able to get out, get off to a big lead.   It felt good to start the game off like that because I don't think we've had one this whole series. 

Q.   Can you take us through that Bogut play, and are you concerned the NBA might upgrade that to a flagrant 2? 
DWIGHT HOWARD:   Well, you know, I don't mean to do anything intentional, to hurt anybody on the floor.   My reaction was just to get away from him, and I was glad I didn't hit him.   You don't want to see anybody get hurt.   I saw Steph go down, and it kind of hurt me to see him on the ground laying down for a while.   We want to play teams when they're at their best and they have their best players on the floor.   It wasn't any of my intentions to do anything to hurt any player on the floor. 

Q.   Jason said about when they were trying to provoke you, it's part of his job to remind you to keep your composure, and he said you know it's coming, you've just got to do a better job of not letting it get to you.   Thoughts about that?
DWIGHT HOWARD:   Yeah, he's absolutely right.   Everything is out on the line, and I'm super emotional when it comes to playing and wanting to win, and my teammates understand how much I care for them and how much I care about our season and what we're trying to accomplish.   So they're always trying to remind me to keep my head, even though it gets frustrating when guys are doing whatever they can to frustrate you.   I've just got to continue to just try to stay mentally strong. 

Q.   Any concern the league upgrades that to a flagrant 2 tomorrow?
DWIGHT HOWARD:   Well, I hope not.   But there's nothing I can do about it at this point.   But like I said, it's never my intention to hurt anybody on the floor.   My reaction was try to get him off me, but I can't react that way.   Just try to do my best to get away from the situation as quick as possible. 

Q.   Can you talk about the play of the bigs tonight early, the way Josh came out and what a difference that made for you guys?
DWIGHT HOWARD:   I thought Josh did an excellent job of just coming out and playing with confidence.   He took some shots that we're like, oh, no, but then when he made, we're like, oh, yes.   That's Josh.   When he plays with confidence like that, it's hard to guard him.

Q.   How does it feel to have extended the series, stay alive, have a shot to go to Game 5 now?
DWIGHT HOWARD:   Well, we've just got to win one game, and that has to be the mindset.   Win the one game.   We're going to the lion's den, but we feel like we can overcome.   We go in there with the right mindset, and we finish each possession and just go from there. 

Q.   This is a big of a dÃ©jÃ ‑vu for you guys, just overcame a 3‑1 deficit in the last series.   What do you take from that experience since you overcame it and came out on top to this particular situation?
DWIGHT HOWARD:   Well, I would say any time you're going through some tough times, you've got to really appreciate the journey of going through it and how hard you have to fight to overcome.   But just to overcome any type of situation. 
We became closer as a team by going through what we went through in the last series, and we're back in that same position, so I would just say we've got to appreciate being able to go through this journey together, take it one game, one possession at a time, and continue to look at the big picture, which is to win a championship, and with our backs against the wall, we have to fight. 

Q.   How big was it to see such an aggressive James Harden tonight? 
DWIGHT HOWARD:   It was great.   It was great to‑‑ I think for his confidence, just to see him‑‑ for him to just put some threes down, get to the basket, get to the free‑throw line.   I thought it was good for him and his confidence.   We're going to need him to be big next game, continue to do what he's been doing, attacking the basket, shooting well from the three, and just playing with a lot of confidence.   I think it's good for him.
