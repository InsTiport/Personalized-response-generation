   DWIGHT HOWARD: It was a lot of fun. We had a lot of fun out there. I think everybody expected so much from last year, but it was -- all around, we had a lot of fun. Hoping the fans enjoyed it.

 Q. Why did you agree to help Nate out in the final there?
 DWIGHT HOWARD: It is all about having fun. 
 Hey, he won fair and square. The fans loved it. We tried to put on a good show. That's what it is all about at All-Star Weekend. It doesn't matter who wins or loses. It is all about having fun.

 Q. Any thought to saving that toss out the side of the backboard for your last one? It seemed like that was a real show-stopper for you. 
 DWIGHT HOWARD: No, I wanted to do that and I had two more dunks that I thought about doing, and I came up a little short from the free throw line. I was supposed to right step on it. I gave it my all, you know. 

 Q. When you were waiting for Cheryl to announce the winner, even you were pointing at Nate?
 DWIGHT HOWARD: I saw it already (laughter). He did a good job. I'm not mad or anything. I guess the shorter man will win in a dunk contest because it looks real hard for him, it looks easy for me. 
 Hey ...

 Q. How much time do you put into all this? You have the costumes?
 DWIGHT HOWARD: I have been doing this -- practicing for three years, since I was in the first dunk contest, coming up with a lot of ideas and I still got more. 
 Like I said, the better man won tonight and he had the crowd into it. I'm happy for him.
