 Q. Favorite thing about All-Star Weekend? 
 DWIGHT HOWARD: Just happy to be here. It's fun so far. It's the best weekend that we could have for the players, just being around all of the All-Stars and the rookies and sophomores. Just the whole experience, it's the best. 

 Q. Best memory as a kid and now as a player?
 DWIGHT HOWARD: Well, I wasn't a kid but I would say Vince Carter's Dunk Contest, that was the best moment. And for me, being in the Slam Dunk Contest myself. And then also watching Vince Carter in the Dunk Contest and then being on his team; it was amazing. 

 Q. A lot of the players are saying it's a little more competitive. 
 DWIGHT HOWARD: Yeah, it is. You know, especially in the east, you've got four guys from Boston on one team, and then you've got the 3 guys in Miami, and then every team that we play against, our rivals, they are in the All-Star Game. So we kind of want to out-shine each other and we also want to beat the guys on the West. It's going to be a lot of fun and I can't wait.

 Q. Trash talking in the locker room amongst you guys? 
 DWIGHT HOWARD: Not really. We know that we are going to see these guys in a couple of months, so we just try to keep it light. 

 Q. Is it difficult playing with all of these Celtics and Heat players?
 DWIGHT HOWARD: It is. I really don't like wearing green, and they have got me wearing the green. It's tough, I play on the same team with these guys but it's fun, it's all about the fans and our appreciation to all of the fans who voted for us. I really appreciate it. 
 So I'm just happy to be here. I'm going to make the best out of it.
