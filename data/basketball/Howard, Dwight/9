Warriors   115
      Rockets - 80

Q.   What do you think was the main issue with the rebounding tonight? 
    DWIGHT HOWARD:   I don't think that's why they won the game. 

Q.   Why do you think they did win?
    DWIGHT HOWARD:   They just played harder than us. 

Q.   Does that surprise you considering you're at home?
    DWIGHT HOWARD:   Yep, it did.   It surprised me. 

Q.   This team has played with such resolve throughout the regular season, through all the injuries, the Playoffs.   Do you anticipate the resolve coming back now that you guys are down three games to none?
    DWIGHT HOWARD:   I mean, it better or we're going to be going home. 

Q.   I know you're obviously unhappy about this, but are you angry about the way the team came out tonight? 
    DWIGHT HOWARD:   We just can't quit on each other.   As much as we went through, as great as they played tonight as a team, we can't give up on each other, and we done come too far, we've been through too many battles to just allow it to end like tonight.   I mean, we've just got to man up.   We can't quit on each other. 

Q.   You had 12 and 10 in the first half, only two points and four rebounds the second half.   Did your knee feel okay in the second half?   Did it give you any trouble, stiffen up on you, or was it just how their game was flowing?
    DWIGHT HOWARD:   My knee was great.

Q.   What gives you the confidence that you guys are probably going to have to make some history to advance?
    DWIGHT HOWARD:   We just can't stop believing, no matter how hard it gets.   We've got to continue to fight.   I mean, it's the only way.   We can't quit.   Can't quit. 

Q.   Corey said it's embarrassing to lose like this at home.   Would that be the word you would use or would you use a different word?   How would you view it? 
    DWIGHT HOWARD:   There's a lot of words I could say about tonight, but got to keep my teammates together.   We can't fold.   We can't quit because we're down.   It's easy to just give up and say they're playing great.   It's easy to do that.   But they're going to have to take all of us out on a stretcher.   We ain't going down like that.   I mean, we've got to fight for our lives.   We're down 3‑0.   It's the Western Conference Finals.   I mean, the only thing we can do is fight.
