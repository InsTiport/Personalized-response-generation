Warriors - 104, Rockets - 78
Q. What did you think of the chippiness today, the physicality of the game especially early on?
DWIGHT HOWARD: Well, I think it's a part of the game.  It's playoffs.  Most of it we're going to get chippy up there.
Q. (No Microphone)?
DWIGHT HOWARD: I think we allowed it to get us a little frustrated, and we've got to learn to play through that.
Q. What led to the offense breaking down so badly in the first half?
DWIGHT HOWARD: We've just got to continue to move against the team.  When you stand still, you allow them to think.  You've got to move around and make plays throughout the possessions.
Q. Dwight, were you surprised or frustrated that the ball didn't come in to you earlier in the ballgame?
DWIGHT HOWARD: I can't get frustrated.  If I don't get the ball, I have to try to find another way to get it, try to get rebounds.  (No Microphone).
Q. What you just described about stagnation offensively, that's been an issue throughout the year.  Can that be turned around in 48 hours particularly against this defensive team?
DWIGHT HOWARD: Well, we've got one choice, you win or lose.
