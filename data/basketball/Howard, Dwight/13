 Q.   What do you remember from 2006?  
DWIGHT HOWARD:   I remember that game.   Shaq, they ran this one play, that just ‑‑ it worked every time.   It just rolled down the lane and sealed Carmelo under the basket.   There was nothing that we could really do about that.   I remember it like yesterday.   It's one of the games that we wish we could get back.   
   
 Q.   Was it a nice memory?  
DWIGHT HOWARD:   It was.   We had just gotten together.   The chemistry wasn't there.   It was a lesson for us.   But we developed that chemistry and then we ended winning a gold medal.  
   
 Q.   What do you think about Michael Jordan?  
DWIGHT HOWARD:   He's amazing.   He's Michael Jordan.   He's one of the reasons why we played basketball.   He inspired us to do great things.   I hear his voice sometimes on commercials, it makes you want to get out there and try to do something.   He's amazing.  
   
 Q.   Do you think he's a real Superman?  
DWIGHT HOWARD:   Michael Jordan is Air Jordan, I think that's his real name.   He is a Superman.  
   
 Q.   How do you feel about Kobe playing point guard?  
DWIGHT HOWARD:   Well, Kobe has done a pretty good job on offense, trying to get everybody involved.   And when he does that, we are at our best.  
   
 Q.   You said you're uncertain about your future.   Is it based on what ‑‑  
DWIGHT HOWARD:   I didn't say that.   
   
 Q.   So you know what you're going to do next season?  
DWIGHT HOWARD:   I'm not going to talk about it.   
   
 Q.   What happens in the rest of the season, can that affect your decision or have you already made it up?  
DWIGHT HOWARD:   I'm not going to talk about that now.
