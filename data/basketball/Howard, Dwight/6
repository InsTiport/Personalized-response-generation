  Rockets - 90

Q.   Dwight, just some overall thoughts on this one and kind of not being able to get it going early.   I know you guys tried to get the comeback late but your overall thoughts on the game and how it turned out. 
DWIGHT HOWARD:   It was a tough one.   A tough battle.   They closed it out in the end. 

Q.   What was the mood in the locker room?   Did you guys try to talk to each other?   What was the situation like there? 
DWIGHT HOWARD:   I mean, we were disappointed.   But we've got to get ready for next season. 

Q.   How do you sum up the season, the regular season and the postseason, in words? 
DWIGHT HOWARD:   Well, you know, we should be proud of ourselves.   We didn't complete the season with the goal we had in mind, but we got close to it after all the things we've been through.   You know, we did what we could for our city and our team, and we got as far as nobody expected us to.   They had written us off from the beginning of the season until now. 
We've got to hold our heads high and come back stronger next season. 

Q.   I know we can't predict the future, but how much would you like to see this group stay together in light of what you guys were able to do together? 
DWIGHT HOWARD:   Well, you know, we just want to win, and you know, I'm all about guys who want to get in there and fight and never give up. 

Q.   Along those lines, the theme across the locker room, the players all talked about wanting to try to keep the group together.   How important is that and what does that mean as one of the key guys on this corps?
DWIGHT HOWARD:   You know, like I said, I'm pretty sure everybody wants guys who are just going to fight and never give up and believe, no matter how hard it gets, no matter what happens on the floor, stick together and fight. 

Q.   In light of what you went through this year with the injury and coming back and then having another injury in the Playoffs, how tough is it for you having to kind of overcome those things and then get to this point and have to stop? 
DWIGHT HOWARD:   You know, it's tough, but I won't stop fighting.   I want to continue to push myself to the limit and remember that no matter how the season ends, I'm still a champion.   I won't let anybody tell me anything different.

Q.   Is this one of your tougher years from a physical standpoint just because of all the stuff you had to come back from?
DWIGHT HOWARD:   I mean, every season is tough.   It's tough to get to this moment.   It's tough to get to the Playoffs.   But you've got to fight through to the end, no matter how hard it gets.   I've been through a lot of turmoil this season with injuries and all that stuff, but despite that, I'm going to give my team and my city everything I've got.

Q.   When you look at it, series over after five games, were the Warriors just clearly a better team or did you guys just not play your best basketball in this series? 
DWIGHT HOWARD:   They just played better.   Plain and simple.   It wasn't our time.   But we gave it everything we got.   We fought until the end, and I think we built a lot of character through all these trials that we had this season.   It just made us better.   I think our city is very proud of the fight that we gave every single night, no matter how tough it was.

Q.   James came over and kind of gave you a hit on the head in the locker room, kind of like consoling you during this tough loss.   Could you speak to that a little bit and the camaraderie of you and your teammates? 
DWIGHT HOWARD:   I mean, we care.   We care about winning.   You know, when we have a disappointing loss, you know, you try the best to console your teammates.

Q.   Could you share with us what Kevin had to say to you guys in the locker room afterwards?
DWIGHT HOWARD:   To be honest with you, I was zoned out, boss.   I was zoned out.   I mean, all I heard was great job this season.
