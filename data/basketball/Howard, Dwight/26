 Q. Talk about your performance, and critique Patrick. 
 DWIGHT HOWARD: Patrick is going to be coaching tonight, and he's ready. He has the place set up. He has the schemes of everything down. I think Patrick is going to be a great coach. 

 Q. What does it mean to you to be on this team?
 DWIGHT HOWARD: To me it's still just a basketball game. I just like being a part of All-Star weekend and being able to interact with the fans and just enjoy myself. This is one weekend out of the whole year where we can sit and enjoy ourselves with the fans but also be with the other All-Stars. It's something I really enjoy. It's not just the game, but we enjoy playing with the best of the best and just being a part of it with the fans. 

 Q. (Inaudible). 
 DWIGHT HOWARD: You know, Shaq, Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, all those guys, they just made the All-Star game and All-Star weekend something to watch, and all those guys just made everything great. 

 Q. What would you say to a kid sitting at home who has a lot of talent, a lot of potential? He's looking at you the way you looked at Shaq and Jordan. 
 DWIGHT HOWARD: Hopefully one day they'll be sitting in my position doing the things that I'm doing, and I can look back and say I remember doing those things and just try to inspire the young generation to be great.
