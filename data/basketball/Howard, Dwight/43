  Q. Are you done breaking stuff around here?   
 DWIGHT HOWARD: No, not yet.   
  
  Q. LeBron said he told you he is going to get you guys back in Orlando and try to bring down the board or something.   
 DWIGHT HOWARD: Yeah, we'll see. When Shaq broke the post, they said they couldn't break it no more. I don't think it will break no more. There's nothing to worry about.  
  
  Q. What about the Quarter Pounder, do you enjoy onion on the Quarter Pounder?   
 DWIGHT HOWARD: Craziest question.  
  
  Q. You are earning him more dollars.   
 DWIGHT HOWARD: No onions. I just get the Quarter Pounder with cheese. I will have it tomorrow. It is my pregame meal.   
  
  Q. (Question regarding home court advantage.)  
 DWIGHT HOWARD: It is just one game, and we understand that. Going into tomorrow -- we had a great chance of doing that in Boston after we won the first game. But Boston came out with a lot of energy, so we learned a big lesson from that.  
 I think tomorrow we have to come out like we did in the second half and play great defense. At the end of the game, you play hard, we should be up.  
  
  Q. Van Gundy showed a lot of stamina on the sideline last night. How important is all of his talking?   
 DWIGHT HOWARD: It is great. He actually tricked us yesterday. Usually he's (indiscernible). Yesterday he was (indiscernible). For real, Stan? He is just like that.   
 He is a great motivator. Does a great job of keeping guys loose but at the same time motivating us to get the job done.  
  
  Q. What was your reaction when he said that you guys were all witnesses?   
 DWIGHT HOWARD: I was really upset. I didn't want to be a witness. He really upset me. I wanted to come out in the second half with be a better effort, and I didn't want to be a witness.   
  
  Q. And you weren't.  
 DWIGHT HOWARD: We still witnessed 49 points. Crazy.
