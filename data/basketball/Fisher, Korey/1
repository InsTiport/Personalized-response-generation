Washburn - 53
  Kansas   85

Q.   Korey, what's the game plan when you come into a situation like this?
KOREY FISHER:   I just say play harder.   I mean, KU is a great team.   Bill Self has a great team.   He always does.   And for guys that are small in stature I guess you could say, we just have to play tougher.   First half kind of got out of hand, but I thought we played really hard second half, and we've just got to build from that.

Q.   Jeremy, can you talk about what it's like to go up against Alexander inside? 
JEREMY LICKTEIG:   Mean, those are big guys.   I tried to give him a pump fake once and he semi‑shot out to the stands.   It's always good to play against those guys.   They've obviously got a lot of skill along with a lot of talent.   But it's good preparation for us because we're used to playing against each other, beating on each other and we're going right into the belly of the beast playing one of the best teams in the nation. 
It hurts a little bit now and we definitely know what our weaknesses are, but this will give us a little bit of insight into the best preparation we can get.

Q.   You guys play a Big 12 schedule almost; what's that experience like?   What's that do for you? 
KOREY FISHER:   Well, it lets us really see where we are as far as us going into our season, just to see where we are.
JEREMY LICKTEIG:   I'll just add on Korey; I mean, we're going to have three tough games, obviously KU, Oklahoma and K‑State, two top 25 teams.   K‑State arguably could be up there, yeah, and then after that it's more of a way to gauge ourselves.   If we get deep in a hole like that we can't go away from each other.   We've got to stick as a team.   I think that's the biggest thing you can say is stay together as a team. 

Q.   Obviously you have history here.   How much does that play into it when you're out there or how much does it play into it right now? 
KOREY FISHER:   Well, you want to go out and do good, of course win the game.   Those guys are big.   It was tough, but we just wanted to get out and just wanted to get out and at least play hard. 
JEREMY LICKTEIG:   When you're in the moment, you can't let it get to you.   I played against Terry in high school.   You play against good talent in AAU, so when you're in the moment of the game you can't get caught up, but now looking back it's a good experience, but it's really important to just take it as a normal basketball game and get those struggles out of the way. 

Q.   What do you think you'll remember the most about this whole experience? 
KOREY FISHER:   I'd definitely say it's just the atmosphere.   As a native Kansan, you always watch KU on TV, but you don't really grasp what it's like until you get on the court and notice like‑‑ it might not be the biggest stadium, but as far as I can tell it's probably one of the loudest.
