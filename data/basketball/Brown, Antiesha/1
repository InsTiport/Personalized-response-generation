Boise State   66
  New Mexico - 60

THE MODERATOR:   We're joined by New Mexico. 
Coach, some thoughts on today's game. 
COACH SANCHEZ:   I first want to congratulate Gordy and Boise State.   They played a tremendous game.   Had a great season.   They definitely had the pieces in place to win this conference.   They did a great job. 
My hat is off to them.   They did a terrific job.   They took us out of what we wanted to do.   Yeah, that's a tremendous team. 
They're going to represent the Mountain West Conference very, very well. 
THE MODERATOR:   We'll now take questions for the student‑athletes. 

Q.   19 offensive rebounds for Boise State.   Were they doing something different, catching you off guard? 
KHADIJAH SHUMPERT:   I would have to say that it's not just the post, it's a team effort.   All five people have to box out. 
With that being said, I think they went hard and they went for the boards.   We know next year coming into it, we have to work harder, can't give up boards.   That's something we talked about as a team we needed to do and didn't get done. 

Q.   You shot just 30% from the floor.   Why do you feel like you couldn't get a rhythm offensively this game?
ANTIESHA BROWN:   I think Boise State did a terrific job of taking us out of our offense.   We just weren't cutting very hard.   We weren't making contact on screens.   They just out‑played us.   They took us out of our rhythm.   We just didn't hit 'em back. 

Q.   They had some opportunities in the second half to extend to 13, 14, really put you guys away.   You did keep bouncing back.   Was there any point in the second half, or the whole game, that you thought maybe it had slipped away? 
ANTIESHA BROWN:   The only thing that could make me believe that it was done was whenever the buzzer went off. 
There's no way there's a point in the game that I believe we lost it.   We've come back from far worse deficits in our games.   I didn't think it was over until the last buzzer. 
KHADIJAH SHUMPERT:   I'll also agree with Antiesha.   If anything where there was a time where we were like we really need to get it together, it would have been the first half.   Because the first half is where we ended up digging that hole. 
The second half we were clawing our way out the whole time.   I think me and my teammates worked hard in the second half to come back. 

Q.   This tournament is over obviously.   Are you two players hopeful there will be another game? 
ANTIESHA BROWN:   Absolutely. 
KHADIJAH SHUMPERT:   Most definitely.   Basketball never stops.   That's my mentality.   Ever since we were young, we've always played.   I don't see it being done for any of us. 
THE MODERATOR:   We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time.   Thank you, ladies. 
We'll continue with questions for Coach Sanchez. 

Q.   The 19 offensive rebounds.   How big a factor was their second‑chance opportunities?
COACH SANCHEZ:   We got to yell shot and box out.   They were mostly long rebounds.   That's the guard.   That's not necessarily the post play.   Guards stood and stared instead of boxed out.   If you don't box out initially, the ball goes over your head.   Three‑point shooters, you're going to have rebounds.   That's what happened initially.   Bounced over our head.   They got too many second chances.   The two factors were that and eight for 22 from the three‑point line. 
If you look at the rest of the stats, everything else is pretty even.   We're not a three‑point shooting team.   We did manage to get a three.   We ran that play for Josie so she could bank it in.   I thought that was a pretty good play for her.   I'm kidding really (smiling). 
You know, you have to credit Boise State.   Every run we made, they responded.   Good teams do.   It was a great game, it really was.   I just wish we would have played better obviously.   But it was a good game. 
They got the best of it today. 

Q.   They did have the 19 offensive rebounds, but only 10 second‑chance points. 
COACH SANCHEZ:   Right. 

Q.   So they didn't gain the advantage in points.   When you're having to defend on a possession three shots, did that wear you guys down a little bit?
COACH SANCHEZ:   I don't know if it wears you down.   It takes ticks off the clock.   When you need that precious time, you don't get an opportunity to go down and score, they get the possession for a minute, or a minute 30.   One they got four offensive rebounds.   That really hurts. 
Even if you get a stop on that, they still took time off the clock.   It's time we needed there at the end of the game.   That hurt a little bit. 

Q.   You only shot 30% from the field, never got into an offensive rhythm.   Why do you think that was?
COACH SANCHEZ:   It's tournament time.   We played them three times.   They shot 36%.   We know what they're running.   They know what we're running. 
We had some good looks, they didn't go down.   We had some layups that didn't go down.   Our effort from the free‑throw line was good, 89%.   We got to the basket. 
You wanted to shoot a little bit better, and we didn't. 
I'm proud of this team.   This is just a tremendous group.   They exceeded probably everybody's expectations but ours in that locker room because we wanted some special things this year, and I think we got it done. 
But we're not done yet.   It's got to be something to build on because I don't want to come to championship games anymore and lose.

Q.   How about Antiesha's performance.   Every time you needed a bucket, she gave it to you. 
COACH SANCHEZ:   Look at both of them.   Khadijah was 17, 11 for 11 from the line.   Antiesha started out, I think she had two points in the first half.   She got 21 in the second half.   She tried to put the team on her back and will this team to win.   That's why she's a senior.   That's why she's a leader.   That's why she's going to be playing beyond college. 
Hopefully we're not done yet.   There's still maybe another tournament we can go win.   But I think those two performances were exceptional today. 

Q.   You've already alluded to today's effort.   You told me yesterday regardless win or lose today you would be content with what this team has done this season if you knew they left it on the floor.   Do you feel they left it out there today?
COACH SANCHEZ:   There's no question.   We made some mistakes, missed some assignments.   But in terms of their effort, there's no question I think they left everything on the floor.   I told them in the locker room, I'll live with the results if you do that. 
They never gave up.   They never quit.   It's like Antiesha said, we have the philosophy if there's still time on the floor, there's still time you can win the basketball game. 
You keep coaching, then the buzzer went off, and that was it.   There wasn't a point in time where I thought we were going to lose, there just wasn't.   We've had that mentality all year. 
But you have to credit Boise State.   They had a heck of a game.   They played well.   They have a great team.   Like I said before, they're going to represent the Mountain West Conference very, very well. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you very much, coach. 
COACH SANCHEZ:   Thanks.
