		   GARY PAYTON:  We're very confident in our team.  I think both of these teams have gelled together as two good teams.  So I hope my chances are good, I hope I can get to four before they can get to four. 
 Q.  Talk about the challenges you face? 
 GARY PAYTON:  They are a team that can get the to the basket, especially with Terry, he's a pull-up shooter, if you try to pressure up on him, he'll go by you and hopefully you can stay in front of him. 
 It's going to be a test for all of us. 
 Q.  What makes Avery such a good coach? 
 GARY PAYTON:  Well, I think he's a players' coach.  He works with you.  He understands what he went through the same way. 
 Because when I got in and came in the league, he was in Seattle and we were together.  He's going to pep you up, he's going to talk to you, he's not going to break you down.  He's not going to do that stuff.  He's always going to pat you on the back to make sure you perform the way you're supposed to perform.  And that's what you want from a coach, a coach that's going to pat you on the back and give you an opportunity to play basketball. 
 Q.  As a coach, almost overnight -- 
 GARY PAYTON:  He always had a good mentality with basketball.  He wasn't worried about that.  He won a championship with San Antonio.  Doesn't matter how you get it as long as you got it. 
 Now him being a successful coach, it's like starting year when he took over, you knew he was going to be successful because I think he's that type of person that makes players want to play for him. 
 And look what he did this year, he got Coach of the Year and he's in The Finals.  So it was no surprise.
