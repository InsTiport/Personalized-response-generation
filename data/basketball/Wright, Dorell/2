  Q. When they made the coaching change, were you worried at all that they would change the style?  
 DORELL WRIGHT: No, I wasn't worried, because the type of players we had, we have that style, you still have to play up-and-down. You have a guy like Monta, you still have to play up-and-down, and David coming from the system the same way. You've got to continue to play like that.   
  
  Q. Are you surprised with how much playing time you've been getting this year?  
 DORELL WRIGHT: You know what, not really. When I made my decision, that was my main thing was looking at the roster being where they lacked and they lacked in the 3-spot and I thought I could come in and get major minutes. Finally getting the opportunity, just put a lot of confidence in me to go out there and play my full, total game.   
 Another reason why I decided to go to Golden State, we are young and have an opportunity to go grow together. Me being here the next three years, we have an opportunity to grow together and get better each year and we are going to grow with each other.
