<p>	Q.  Coach, can you talk about the defense they put forth on Troy?  Once again we've seen Pittsburgh maybe defend him better than any opponent you faced all year.</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, yesterday you overcame an 11-point deficit.  Today you had a 12-point deficit.  You weren't able to overcome it.  What was the difference between yesterday and today? </p>
<p>	Q.  You got off to the quick start, 14-6 I believe.  Did they turn it up a notch defensively after that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Uka, really a tremendous game for you.  I know you're not in good spirits, but you went 13 for 13.   It's a career high for you, 25 points with 6 rebounds in 38 minutes.  You're playing in your hometown.  I know you're frustrated about your loss, but your thoughts on your own individual game today? </p>
<p>	Q.  You love playing here?</p>
<p>	Q.  How confident are you about your NCAA chances, Al? </p>
<p>	Q.  Would you have liked to see everyone else get to the line more, Uka?  You had 13 free throw attempts.  The rest of the team combined for 8. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you discuss the Pittsburgh defensive scheme and their execution?  This is the second game where they have been an outstanding defensive team in terms of execution and defensive fundamentals as Coach Skinner alluded to? </p>
