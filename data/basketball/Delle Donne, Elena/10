  ELENA DELLE DONNE: Every day my workout routine I shoot a lot.  It's really not about the short game and the shot.  It's all about that half-court shot.  Hoping one of us can hit it.Q. What's it like working with a Chicago legend, Scottie Pippen?ELENA DELLE DONNE: It's amazing to be working with Scottie Pippen.   Scottie Pippen.  I've looked up to him my entire life.  I'm a huge Jordan-Pippen fan.  So to be on the same team as him is pretty unreal.Q. And you're going to be judging the fashion show for the NBA players.  How much are you looking forward to that?ELENA DELLE DONNE: I'm really excited to be judging the fashion show.  I think it's going to get pretty funny.  It should definitely be a lot of fun.  I'm just thrilled I get to be there and do that.
