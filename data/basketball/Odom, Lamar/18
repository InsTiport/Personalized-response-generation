 Q. What do you think about the Magic being in this position?
 LAMAR ODOM: I'm not surprised. I'm not surprised at all. They played great. Turkoglu and Lewis and Cook, the way they all played in the middle, I'm not surprised.

 Q. Mo Williams in the last series said he thought they gave them too much respect and it's a team that's now in the NBA Finals.
 LAMAR ODOM: You have to respect your opponent if you're smart. You can't be in awe of them.
 You have to go out and play and compete just like any other game.

 Q. The regular season wins against you, what they did, winning two games, does that mean anything?
 LAMAR ODOM: To them, yeah. To the winner, of course you're going to say yes. And then to the loser you're going to be like -- of course it does. It gives us something to learn from, a building block to start from, to watch tape, analyze it and make adjustments.
