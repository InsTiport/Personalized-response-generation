  Q. What did Derek Fisher say to you guys at the start of the fourth quarter?   
 LAMAR ODOM: Fourth quarter he gave one of those speeches about us being in a really good position about -- I think we might have been up six. We just told everybody take your time and play hard and make plays. He was the one that kind of led the way.  
  
  Q. Now you have your confidence back because you have home-court advantage again?    
 LAMAR ODOM: We always remained confident, even coming in here last night, even after the Game 2 loss. It's important to remain confident, not cocky but confident, believe in yourself as a team and your ability.   
  
  Q. What do you expect from them in Game 4?    
 LAMAR ODOM: I expect a fight. We respect these guys. They're tough competitors as well as great basketball players. We expect a fight.   
  
  Q. Are you surprised by anything you saw last night?  
 LAMAR ODOM: Not really. As far as being around them for a couple years now and practicing, just being with him every day, not at all. He's a man.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible).   
 LAMAR ODOM: He has so many leadership skills. I think the faith and the trust that he shows that he has in us is really important, keeps everybody feeling good about themselves.  
  
  Q. How much does Fish help Kobe in that respect? I know Kobe can be intense at times and can get on guys and then you have somebody like Fish who comes around and can be more supportive or positive.   
 LAMAR ODOM: I wouldn't take it as Kobe being negative or unsupportive. Their styles are just different. You know, we all need balance in life, and I think as far as leadership is concerned and our locker room is concerned, Derek is the perfect balance. They've been in many wars, and they respect each other, and it kind of trickles down to us.
