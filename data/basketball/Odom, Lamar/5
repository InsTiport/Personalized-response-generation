 Q. (Indiscernible).
 LAMAR ODOM: Just execution, going over -- in particular on the defensive end and the offensive end, just getting things down pat. It's all about playing hard and executing right. 

 Q. How do you expect them to adjust going into Game 2? 
 LAMAR ODOM: I'm not sure, but I just expect the game will be a lot harder, a lot quicker, a lot tougher. I'm not sure. Who knows. Maybe double Kobe a little bit earlier, get the ball out of his hands. 

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 LAMAR ODOM: Every possession, every game is important. Every game is the most important game of your life, especially by the time you get to The Finals. 

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 LAMAR ODOM: Got the ball inside, penetration off the dribble and to kickback in. We didn't give up too many second-chance opportunities. That's important. We didn't give up too many fast-break points, so that's important. 
 So if we can get back, clean the glass up, we'll give ourselves a chance to win both games. And of course not turn it over as much. 

 Q. (Inaudible). 
 LAMAR ODOM: Just good defense, spacing the floor, space guys out, space the floor, run our offense, and we should be in position to get offensive rebounds.
