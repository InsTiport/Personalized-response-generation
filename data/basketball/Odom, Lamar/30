 Q. Is the week more difficult because you are on the road in San Antonio? 
 LAMAR ODOM: The opportunities are right there. I know what I need to do, move, get to the paint, just finish it.

 Q. In Utah you said that you didn't watch a game twice. 
 LAMAR ODOM: I watched it last night.

 Q. You watched it just once? 
 LAMAR ODOM: Just once. It didn't change at all, but it will help me make shots.

 Q. How many times did you watch the game? 
 LAMAR ODOM: Just once, just once. 

 Q. Lamar, you are a very calculated guy. 
 LAMAR ODOM: Doing my homework, go in, study the film and get ready for the next one.

 Q. You seem to take that loss hard. Why is that? And the way you play, why do you take it hard?
 LAMAR ODOM: Because it was an 8-, 9-, 10-point game in the second quarter, beginning of the third. 
 I thought if I could make some plays -- but that run that Kobe went on (indiscernible) a little bit more upset, because I know if the game is tight or it's close, he can get us out of the hole, but last night was too big.

 Q. After a couple hours, any thoughts change? 
 LAMAR ODOM: No, I still feel the same. That's why I will be ready to play against them.
