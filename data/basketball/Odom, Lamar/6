  Q. Is there any revenge factor going into this series?  
 LAMAR ODOM: I think it's important for us to kind of worry about the present, not get too emotional. They talk about Lakers versus Celtics, and both teams are looking forward to play against each other.  
  
  Q. How important is the match-up technicality in this series?  
 LAMAR ODOM: It's important for us to play our game. Whatever that is, that's what we have to do. We have to play our game.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible).   
 LAMAR ODOM: Both teams, they like to block shots.   
 They penetrate well, Rondo does a great job of penetrating. Hopefully we can get them to take some charges. Glen Davis takes charges. It's important for us to make that play so we can stop penetration.   
  
  Q. How much do you think Andrew Bynum can contribute and what do you expect from him tomorrow night?  
 LAMAR ODOM: I expect him to play. How long and how much, only Andrew knows. It was a tough injury for him to have, especially at this time of the year. Hopefully he'll be all right.   
  
  Q. What needs to be done specifically to protect this home court?  
 LAMAR ODOM: Well, we have to play our best in terms of every game. Every game is the biggest game in your life at this point, take care of the basketball, take our shots, we'll be all right.   
  
  Q. What do you think is different about this team compared to last year's?   
 LAMAR ODOM: We're coming off a championship, a little bit more experience.   
  
  Q. Do you have more peace about you that you've won a championship and your life has changed since then?  
 LAMAR ODOM: Myself?   
  
  Q. Yeah.   
 LAMAR ODOM: Of course. It's an incredible accomplishment.
