 Q. The first two games you kind of got taken out of the game with fouls. Have you started to get into a rhythm?
     LAMAR ODOM: I have, but I'm going to have to play much better than I've played in this series for us to win tomorrow, have a chance to win the series.

 Q. Game 4 toward the end (Inaudible).  LAMAR ODOM: Yeah. Pick my angles. Watched a lot of film. I found out some things I need to do to kind of get myself going offensively so I can attack these guys from all over the court. I'm going to try to rebound as much as possible, push it. 

 Q. What makes Davis such a tough guy to defend?
     LAMAR ODOM: Well, he's doing a great job at playing without the ball. Most of his points are not coming just from like dunk-downs and playing well one-on-one. They're coming from moving the ball and penetrating our defense. He does a great job of playing with his back to the baseline. Kind of cleans up the shots that they miss, or on penetration, gets stuck down, two hands on the ball, strong, going to the hole. They don't really run much offense through him. It's not like he just gets the ball like, say, how they go to Garnett or some of the other post players, or Sheed. They go to Rasheed even more.
