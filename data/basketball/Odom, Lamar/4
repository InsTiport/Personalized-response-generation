  Q. (Inaudible).  
 LAMAR ODOM: Guys that have been coached by him, I'm one of those guys, stuff that he lived by and coached, his philosophies, all that stuff. We'll miss someone like that.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible).  
 LAMAR ODOM: So many things, faith in yourself and in God. He was a good man.  
  
  Q. How do you expect them to come out and play in Game 2?  
 LAMAR ODOM: I expect a tough game. I expect the game to be played underneath the basket. I think the referees did a great job of controlling the game, making the calls they needed to make so it didn't get too out of hand. I expect another fun game.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible).  
 LAMAR ODOM: When guys are throwing elbows at eye level, it's tough to call, but I expect them to let us play underneath the basket.
