 Q. It seems like you guys have played much better on the road than you did in San Antonio and Houston. 
 LAMAR ODOM: Well, we had a great road record during the regular season. Like I said, experience of winning in Utah, winning in San Antonio last year, same, winning in Utah this year, has prepared us for this type of situation.

 Q. How much concern is that players like Rafer and Pietrus who didn't do anything offensively in the first two games --
 LAMAR ODOM: Well, they're good players, and they're going to play well. You can't expect good players to play bad. What you have to do is even when they play well, find a way to win the game. 

 Q. How have you grown as a player since you got to LA? I guess what's the biggest way that you've changed do you think? 
 LAMAR ODOM: Taking my time, my mental focus and approach to the game. I don't let bad calls get to me. Phil's method, his way of thinking, taking my time has paid off for me on and off the court.
