  Q. How do you guys improve defensively. When you hold a team to 30 percent from the floor, what do you expect the next night out?  
 LAMAR ODOM: Got to hold them to 25 percent.  
  
  Q. How do you do that?  
 LAMAR ODOM: Will. You will yourself. You've got to play harder, try to do everything right, strive to be perfect. That's one of my goals.  
  
  Q. Do you expect Dwight to try to catch the ball closer to the basket?  
 LAMAR ODOM: I expect him to be a lot more physical, maybe force some shots.  
  
  Q. Starting with the last two games in the Denver series, you seemed to have found another gear.  
 LAMAR ODOM: You know, during the playoff series you tend to feel a team out, play good, play bad, just try to get better at everything, taking open shots, feeling the defense out, picking my spots. I feel like I can always have a big game if I rebound aggressively.  
  
  Q. How tough is it for you guys to match Kobe's intensity?  
 LAMAR ODOM: Not at all. I think that's why we're a good team. It started in training camp. Kobe leads by example, and we love to compete, as well. We have competitors in everything we do whether it's cards, shooting games, practice. It carries over. That's why we've gotten so much better this year is because of the way we practice and do everything.
