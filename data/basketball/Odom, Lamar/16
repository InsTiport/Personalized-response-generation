		   LAMAR ODOM: We've been playing for seven months, eight months now. We want to get out there and put on a show and entertain and of course try to win the championship.

 Q. It was almost like last night's Game 1 was a continuance of Game 6 in Denver with your dominance.
 LAMAR ODOM: Well, we have great momentum. We expect those guys to come out and give us their best shot, play their best game. It's going to be really competitive and I'm looking forward to it.

 Q. They've had one of the best bounce-back games in the league this year, only losing two games in a row three or four times. Are you guys concerned about that at all?
 LAMAR ODOM: Not concerned. Cautious. We're looking forward to it. We love to compete, they love to compete, and this is the grand stage, I guess, for the ultimate competition.

 Q. You're probably aware that they're not going to shoot the same kind of Sunday?
 LAMAR ODOM: We expect them to play better. We'll play better, as well. We feel like we can play better. There's some things, we watched the tape, we feel like we can do better. We're preparing for a great game, to be competitive as heck. They're well coached, disciplined, they've got shot makers.
 We know they're going to play better.

 Q. Does it surprise you you played as well as you did last night?
 LAMAR ODOM: Not surprised us. We understand our potential and how good we can be.
