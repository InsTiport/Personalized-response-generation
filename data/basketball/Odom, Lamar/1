 Q. Talk about the enormity of tomorrow's game. 
 LAMAR ODOM: Historic, when you're talking about these organizations and these teams, what they stand for, the pride. This is what you envisioned when you were a kid playing in your backyard. This was what it was all about.

 Q. When you talk about pride, what do you expect from the Celtics tomorrow?
 LAMAR ODOM: It's going to be a fight. It's going to be a fight. We expect a tough game. You know, all these games have been tough. Even with last night's score, to me that's misleading, sometimes the games just go like that. That team still plays hard, still makes you work.

 Q. (Inaudible). 
 LAMAR ODOM: It's hard to answer that question. A championship is a championship. Any time you have to fight - this team really makes you fight - I guess you appreciate it a little bit more. 

 Q. If Perkins can't go tomorrow does that make life easier on you? 
 LAMAR ODOM: You know, it's funny, I was sitting on the bench, and they got Rasheed Wallace and Kevin Garnett on the court at the same time, and those guys have had great careers. Glen Davis is a fighter, as well. I mean, their team is still really competitive. 
 Of course any time you lose anyone, especially at this time of the year -- but it happens. It's something we have to go through as a team. I just wish him well.
