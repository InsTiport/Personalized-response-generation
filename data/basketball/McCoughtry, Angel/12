 ANGEL McCOUGHTRY: I thought we played hard tonight, I thought we gave great effort. This is a great opportunity. A lot of people don't get to have this opportunity. Of course we wanted to seize it, but like I always say, at the end of the day as long as you gave it your all, win, lose or draw, that's all that matters.   
  
  Q. Angel, in the Washington series until tonight what will you take from this seven games?   
 ANGEL McCOUGHTRY: This is definitely a great learning experience for me being my second year as a professional. I just learned, you know, it's a different ball game in the playoffs, it's a new season, it's very physical and you really got to -- every possession matters, and that showed in the Seattle series.   
 You know, we lost by 3, I think, each game, I believe, so, you know, we feel like, gosh, if we would have got a stop on defense or made this shot or made this free-throw, we could win the game. So every possession matters in trying to win these games in the playoffs.   
  
  Q. Angel, I want to know out of the three games that you played Seattle, which one was the toughest and why?   
 ANGEL McCOUGHTRY: I can't really say which one was the toughest; they were all tough if you ask me. I'm only 24 years old, and I feel like I'm 40 years old! They were all tough. You've just got to commend Seattle for playing a tough game and being physical and doing what it takes to win, you know? They're a great team. But to answer your question, they were all very, very tough.   
  
  Q. Angel, I think you had 9 points in the last 2:30. Can you talk about that 3 with less than 6 seconds left? Did you think it was in?   
 ANGEL McCOUGHTRY: I felt like the game was slipin' away so I felt like I needed to do something about it, and I tried to get points on the board to get us in there. I wish I would have made all three of those free-throws; that might have helped us a little bit, but just trying to do what it took to win. You know, that's all you can ask for.   
 THE MODERATOR: Angel, thank you for your time.
