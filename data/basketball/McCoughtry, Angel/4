THE MODERATOR:   We have Angel McCoughtry and Armintie Herrington.  
Questions.  
   
 Q.   Angel, how do you bounce back from this tonight?   
ANGEL McCOUGHTRY:   We've been through this before, first game against Washington, it was the same thing.   We bounced back, we regrouped, we'll figure it out.   That's the type of team we are.   
It's going to be a dogfight.   We're here to fight to the end.   People are doubting us already, but that's okay.   We will be back for a dogfight on Tuesday.   
   
 Q.   Angel, 6‑for‑24 tonight, what do you have to do to improve your shooting percentage?   
ANGEL McCOUGHTRY:   Just need to get in the gym, it happens, everybody has cold days.   This was a cold day today.   We will get in the gym and get some shots up and we'll shoot better on Tuesday.   
   
 Q.   Armintie, can you talk about what they were doing defensively?   
ARMINTIE HERRINGTON:   They were ready tonight, they came out ready to go.   They looked good, they were sharp, and we got hit in the mouth.   We're going to be ready on Tuesday.   Our shots wasn't fallin' and that happens.   They shoot really well at home, and when we come back Tuesday, we got to be ready to go and just give it more effort and get the loose balls and a lot of "O" boards.   
   
 Q.   What was the mood in the locker room like after this game?   
ANGEL McCOUGHTRY:   The mood in the locker room?   We are not going to be down, what's the point?   It's over.   We're movin' on.   
We're going to keep our heads up and we are going to continue to believe and we have confidence in ourselves.   We believe we can win a series.   
THE MODERATOR:   Ladies, thank you.
