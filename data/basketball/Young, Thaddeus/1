  Q. Who is boss of the league now? You got some advice for Marreese (Speights)? Obviously he's going to be here next year.   
 THADDEUS YOUNG: He will definitely be here next year. My advice is keep working hard and keep doing what you are doing.   
 He has just scratched the surface. He doesn't realize how good he is yet. He is always playing around. I said, You just don't realize.   
  
  Q. Do you think he will be the guy that really makes a difference?   
 THADDEUS YOUNG: He has some big shoes to fill. He has to get a double-double for his career. Marreese, I think he is going to be a great player. He might be the X factor that we need.  
  
  Q. Is it nice for you having been such an active part of his early year to see the success?   
 THADDEUS YOUNG: All the success goes out to him. I'm just somebody who has helped him out.   
 I think it is from his hard work. He goes out there. And it doesn't go to me, it goes to him.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about this year, you have been swinging back and forth. You were working on jumpers all summer.   
 THADDEUS YOUNG: I pretty much knew -- it is good. I'm not really worried about it because I played four all the time. I'm used to playing the position. I had to get used to playing the three spot. I think it will work out. I think it will be fine.
