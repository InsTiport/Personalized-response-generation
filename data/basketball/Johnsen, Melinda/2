<p>	Q.  Melinda, on that last play, the set up, Ambrosia for the three, is that kind of a set play or do you get the credit for that?</p>


<p>	Q.  Julie, could you talk about how you handled the pressure that came after you on the dribble about three-quarters court and some of the adjustments that you tried to make with bringing in some help, another point guard? </p>
<p>	Q.  Julie, could you talk about last year?  You missed a couple of free throws and you were upset and this year you came back and made them.  How good was that redemption for you? </p>

<p>	Q.  Can you just talk about the shot Ambrosia, she hit a couple big threes for you tonight.  It just seems like she's not afraid to shoot in very key situations. </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about Julie's performance?  It just must really feel good as a coach when you're over there and you know the ball is in her hands down the stretch and she's not going to make mistakes with it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about your adjustments on your defense?  They did have some success inside.  You went to a zone and then was it Hunter just on or did she get lost in the zone?</p>
<p>	Q.  Considering the start and everything, you know, you win two games against CSU and I know your players are dying to play Utah again.  Was that start, even though it came back and tied up, was that big to get off to that lead?</p>
<p>	Q.  How important is it to have time off tomorrow before a Friday game in a tournament like this?</p>
