THE MODERATOR:   We'll take questions for Coach. 

Q.   What did you make of the happy birthday singing for Bill Russell and all the players gathering around him to shake his hand?
COACH BROOKS:   I thought that was one of the more special moments in All‑Star history.   You're talking about one of the greatest winners of all sports.   What he exemplified is just what you want your team to be:   Teamwork, about the team, about the city. 
Just an amazing player.   That was a great moment to watch that all of our guys really honored him, and rightfully so. 
My birthday is July 31st, so maybe...

Q.   Kevin Durant put on another show in the All‑Star Game.   What did you see from him tonight in the All‑Star Game with the kind of performance he had from downtown and also a lot of dunks? 
COACH BROOKS:   K.D. is a great player.   What I did see tonight‑‑ or what I didn't see tonight, what he has done all season long, is defend.   He didn't defend tonight. 
But it was a great game.   It was‑‑ they were very‑‑ it was very competitive. 
K.D. is a great player.   He's a great teammate, he does all the things that we have asked, works hard.   He leads.   He impacts the game both ways.   He doesn't want to be just a scorer, he wants to be a playmaker, a defender, and that's what he's done all season for us. 

Q.   A lot of coaches talk about how difficult it is to manage the minutes.   They have a plan going into the game.   Were you able to execute what you wanted to as far as getting each player the right amount of minutes and who to go to in the fourth quarter?
COACH BROOKS:   You can't please 12 starters.   But 12 players deserved to start, deserved to play minutes, deserved to get fourth quarter minutes, deserved to get play calls.   You just can't.   You just try to do your best.   You try to give the respect of the veteran guys, the starters, and the guys that have been here multiple years. 
And then some guys you talk to before, they might be banged up, you don't want to throw them out there and play extra minutes. 
But it's hard.   It's hard.   It's stressful.   At the same time it's exciting to be around 12 of the greatest players in the conference. 

Q.   Did you ask the guys to play defense?
COACH BROOKS:   No.   But they played enough.   Obviously it's an All‑Star Game.   You're talking about just amazing talented players committed to the game they love at an early age to just really‑‑ I marvel at all of their talents.   It's really cool to see them all come together and within 15 minutes of practice or 45 minutes of practice really 42 assists, 46 assists, that's not easy to do.   And they did a great job of playing with one another. 

Q.   Now that it's all over, how did this one compare to your first time?
COACH BROOKS:   I liked the first one better, we won.   But it's special.   I'm fortunate, it's a privilege to be in this league, as a player and as a coach, and I love the opportunity that our organization has given me. 
I got a great group of guys to work with.   Special.   It is.   It's special. 
Another thing, I really admire the guys.   Everybody has a family, but this is a family environment, which helps to during this break where you can spend some good times with your family and have a good moments with all the other stars. 
THE MODERATOR:   Okay.   Thank you, Coach.
