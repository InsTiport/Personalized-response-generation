SCOTT BROOKS:   First off, give credit to the San Antonio Spurs and Coach Pop, their players, their organization.   They're a class organization.   They competed to win.   They beat us, did a lot of good things.   I'm proud of our guys.   I'm proud of our guys, and I thought our guys competed throughout these Playoffs, and I thought they did a great job even in the series.   We didn't play well on the road, but we competed.   We kept bouncing back and having great games at home.   Tonight's game was another great effort by our guys.   Just didn't do a few things well enough to beat this team, but as I said, I'm proud of our effort tonight.   We competed, and we competed until the last second of this game.   
   
 Q.   Can you just talk about the last shot Kevin had?   It looked like it was everything you would want but it just came up short.   
SCOTT BROOKS:   Yeah, it was a good look.   Serge did a good job with screens, Kevin did a good job of setting him up.   It was a good, clean look.   That's what you want in that situation.   Nothing we could have done better on that.   He got a good look.   He had an opportunity to drive and kick out to an open three or we get the foul, free throw, we get it.   But no, I take Kevin's decision on that shot.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the third quarter.   You made a great rally and all, but Tony Parker doesn't play to start the second half and they perhaps had their best quarter of the series.   What happened there?  
SCOTT BROOKS:   Yeah, you know, we didn't come out.   We started settling for too many jump shots and then we turned the ball over.   I think we turned the ball over 12 times in that second half.   I don't know how many times in the third quarter, just seems like we couldn't get enough good looks at the basket.   We couldn't get to the free‑throw line in that first half, and we started getting to it later in the second half.  
And then defensively they had us scrambling around and they made some big plays at the end.   They hit a big three and got fouled in the last seconds of that third quarter to put them up 12, and that's when we went to switching everything.   I thought the energy‑‑ that created enough energy to get enough points on the board, but we started doing that and we created a lot of stops, opportunities, but the third quarter, I'm disappointed in it.   It was the only 30‑point quarter of this game, actually of all of our home games, of all the 12 quarters, that's the only 30‑point quarter.   
   
 Q.   It looked like you guys had Tim Duncan pretty well contained for most of the game, but then he really started to hit his stride in overtime.   Was he doing something different or was he just being the usual Tim Duncan that he is?  
SCOTT BROOKS:   He's a great player.   You know, he's a great player.   He made a couple of tough shots, made a tough shot and he got fouled on one, a tough call, but I thought he‑‑ he's a terrific player.   He's going to go down as one of the greatest players ever to play the game, just a class individual.   But he made some big plays down the stretch.  
   
 Q.   Defensively, you guys numbers‑wise had some of your better numbers in the series, but in the end didn't quite get the stops you needed.   Was it just not quite enough defensively in this game in this series?  
SCOTT BROOKS:   Well, it's just really the third quarter, 37 points.   Other than that it's 22, 22, and then 11 in the five‑minute overtime.   But the third quarter hurt us.   That's the thing about this basketball team we're playing against.   If you relax for two or three minutes, they can go on a 12‑2 run, and I thought they did that late in that third quarter.   They made those threes, and then we turned the ball over just too many times.   
   
 Q.   You've gone through so much this year as a team with injuries, Durant gets his MVP, all these things going on, it's a hard way to lose now, but you got a long way.   Would you consider this season a success?  
SCOTT BROOKS:   Absolutely, absolutely.   It's hard to win a championship.   I was fortunate enough to be on a team‑‑ there's a lot of great players, and I played with a lot of great players that never won, and it's somewhat unfair because they're labeled as not champion, and I'm labeled as a champion.   And I didn't really do much to earn that other than cheer.   There's a lot of great coaches that never won it.   
So it's a special thing.   There's only one team that stands every year.   We've worked every day since July to be in this position, to climb to the top, and we came up six games short.   We have to keep our heads up and move on.   
   
 Q.   I know you said you feel the season is a success, but when Kevin and Russell get up here, do you think they'll feel the same way?  
SCOTT BROOKS:   They should.   We've improved.   We've improved as individual players.   We had a lot of individual growth, and we've improved as a team in a lot of areas.   I know we still have a ways to go.   We're not where we want to be, and our guys know that.   Kevin and Russell, they should be proud.   They've led us to places that we want to get to, and I'm proud of what they've done.   I'm proud of who they are, and I'm sure our fans feel the same way.   They're great character guys, great leaders, and they're great teammates.   That's all I can ask for.   I couldn't ask for a better two guys to coach.
