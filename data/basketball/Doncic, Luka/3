 Q.  Luka, just tell us how much fun you had out there tonight, and also walk us through that half-court shot that you made.  
LUKA DONCIC: It was fun. You know, those games, fans want to see a lot of dunks, a lot of long threes, fun stuff.   
The half-court shot, you can ask Deandre Ayton will tell you, I called it before the timeout. So you can ask him.   
 Q.  Luka, you had a really long day today, and you met Obama. How did that pump you up for the game tonight?  
LUKA DONCIC: Oh, yeah, it was a pleasure. It was very nice meeting him. I hope to hang out with him soon. So it was a pleasure.   
 Q.  What did President Obama say to you? And what do you think about his little joke about Jason Kidd's shooting?  
LUKA DONCIC: He just came to me and introduced. Obviously, I know who he was. He just said, "You do a fantastic job." That really inspires me. He said, "Don't shoot like J Kidd." (Laughter).   
 Q.  Just wanted to know if you could say anything to all the Mexican fans. You were there a couple of months ago. You saw how many fans you have. There will be a lot of people watching you this weekend. What can you tell them, if you can say anything in Spanish or in English, as you wish.  
LUKA DONCIC: Whatever you want, English or Spanish. [ Speaking Spanish ].   
 Q.  I was at the tech meeting today. Did you know who Bill Murray was, and what did you think about him in general?  
LUKA DONCIC: Yeah, of course I know. He's a funny guy. I watch a lot of him. He always make jokes, and it was a pleasure to meet him.
