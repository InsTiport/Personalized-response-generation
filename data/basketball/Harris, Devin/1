  Q. Compare playing in New Jersey as compared to playing in Dallas.  
 DEVIN HARRIS: Obviously Jersey is a little bit smaller town, but you do got the city right there that you can go to. Dallas is very laid back but still a big city.  
  
  Q. Do you appreciate this a little more, after being in the league a few years?  
 DEVIN HARRIS: Definitely had to work towards it, hard work coming through, a little adversity being traded midseason for Jason and whatnot. I think you appreciate it a little more.  
  
  Q. There was a lot of speculation that he wanted you out.   
 DEVIN HARRIS: It doesn't even matter. That was a year ago, over and done with. I have moved on. He has moved on. Obviously he is in a different position. Don't need to speculate. I'm looking forward to the things I can do now.   
 Obviously I took what he taught me and putting it toward my game now. Only they would know behind closed doors. Nobody has come out and said it but nobody really knows besides the guys that were there in that room.  
  
  Q. Do you feel comfortable here?   
 DEVIN HARRIS: Oh, yeah.  
  
  Q. Not intimidated by the surroundings?   
 DEVIN HARRIS: No, I don't intimidate easily. Guys are human just like me.
