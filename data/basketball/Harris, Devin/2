 Q.  Talk about this year, coming from training? 
 DEVIN HARRIS:  This year, you know, coming from training camp, everybody knew what to expect.  Defensively everybody was on the same page and we just have the same defense for each team. 
 Q.  What will be your routine tomorrow, your game day routine?  What's your schedule to go to be like tomorrow? 
 DEVIN HARRIS:  Get up, grab some breakfast, shoot around, go home, take a nap, eat and get ready for the game. 
 Q.  What's it been like for you being such a young player on this stage? 
 DEVIN HARRIS:  It's been great.  This is a blessing.  We played hard all year long and really came together. 
 There's a lot of young guys on the team that's been able to put together along with the other guys to really put in a team effort. 
 Q.  The other guys on the team have a no-fear attitude, we're in The Finals. 
 DEVIN HARRIS:  That's the attitude that you have to have.  You're on the stage and we got here but we're not satisfied.  We came here and we're four games away from getting that trophy.  We're definitely capable of doing it.
