 THE MODERATOR: We have South Carolina. Coach Staley, if you could make an opening comment about this afternoon's game.   
 COACH STALEY: We'll just take questions.   
  
  Q. The final shot, the three-pointer, was that the design play or how did it turn out?   
 COACH STALEY: It was one of 'em. She was wide open. We wanted to get the ball inside to Kelsey, but they were kind of crowding her space. They left Ieasia wide open.   
 I'm satisfied with the shot. It was on the mark. She had her feet set. Looked like it was going in. Unfortunately for us it didn't.   
  
  Q. Kelsey, your viewpoint on that last play.   
 KELSEY BONE: It was a good shot. You know, she's knocked that shot down for us several times this year. The play was to come inside for me, but we expected for me to be crowded. So that was the shot that we needed at that time, and it just didn't go down.   
 So, like coach said, we're satisfied with who we had taking the shot. Just a bad bounce.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 COACH STALEY: I mean, for us, you know, we didn't shoot as many as we usually do. You know, when you get 56 out of 53 points in the paint, that's where the ball needs to go. And that's what our concentration was.   
 Unfortunately, we didn't shoot the ball as well as we average from three. I think Mississippi took enough of 'em or hit enough of 'em for both of us.   
  
  Q. What do you have to say about the season?   
 COACH STALEY: I mean, it's disappointing in my eyes. You know, although we're not where we're used to being, we're not where we want to be, there is progress inch by inch.   
 But certainly not for the players that we have, not for the talent that we have. We're a better team than 14-15. We got our work cut out for us in the off-season. You know, that starts next week.   
  
  Q. Same for both the players. Kelsey, what do you think of the season?   
 KELSEY BONE: Definitely not where we wanted to be at the end. But I think it's better than the previous year. So we take the good; we observe the bad; we move forward.   
 We're all making a commitment to spend our summer in Columbia to get better, be a better team so we can be one unit next year and make more improvement. It's all about getting better and that's our focus.   
 CHARENEE STEPHENS: Like Kelsey said, we just want to get better. Coach talked to us about getting better in the off-season. We're going to work hard and make an effort to develop our team over the summer and in the off-season to just be a better team coming back next year.   
  
  Q. You put a pretty tough schedule together. Do you look back on that and say that was a good thing to do, even though maybe you could have had a few other games you might have won? Is that still a part of building towards where you want to go with this program?   
 COACH STALEY: For us, you know, we're always going to play a tough schedule. For us, I think you just have to measure yourself in November and December so you can be prepared for the rigors of the SEC. We don't shy away from it. I know it's a tough conference.   
 But in order for us to get better, you know, to know that there's another level of basketball being played out there besides our conference, we got to play them.   
 I don't regret the schedule that we had this particular year. We came out of it pretty good. You know, minus some teams that we probably should have won, you know, I thought the schedule was right on point.   
  
  Q. What do you think is the area of progress you really need to make? What do you think are the things that need to be shaped up, and what's good that you're going to take out of this year?   
 COACH STALEY: We got to become winners. We have to have a sense of urgency. I don't think our team had that every time we took the floor. Whether it's youth, whatever it is. At this point, you know, when you're playing in this league, if you can't get up to play every team in this league, then obviously your competitive juices aren't flowing in the right place.   
 So, you know, you're going to have a difficult time playing for our coaching staff. You're going to have a difficult time just in general. Life is just not going to be great for you because we're competitive people. You know, we want to win every single game we go out and play.   
 At the same time, you know, we did get better. It's hard to see right now sitting here right after a loss in the SEC tournament. But we got better. We're more talented than we were last year. We want to get more talented in the years to come. Hopefully, as I told our crowd in Columbia, we're going to make what we experienced here right now just a memory at some point.   
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.
