Q. Utah is a young team trying to find their way, clearly.  How do you think they've grown since the start of the year?PAUL MILLSAP: I think they've grown.  The most important thing about them is that they play hard.  They're well-coached.  I feel like especially a young team like that, guys come out and play hard every game.  If they are down 20 or up 20, they'll find a way to continue to compete.  They're a very competitive group of guys.Q. Paul, congrats for being here.

Once you get caught up in superstitions -- let's talk later.Q. Millsap is not a common surname.  I know the country singer Ronnie Milsap.  He only spells it with one L.

I like where we came from, where we're going.Q. Do you think there's a risk of disrupting chemistry?PAUL MILLSAP: I don't think so.  If we do, I think they will learn to adjust.  I think they'll fit in somehow.  The way that our team is predicated upon.Q. Being here again, do you still feel a sense of accomplishment?PAUL MILLSAP: A little accomplishment, but there's still a lot of work to be done.  There's still room to improve for myself, and obviously for the team.
