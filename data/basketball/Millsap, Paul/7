Q.   What's the one goofy thing you're definitely going to do this weekend?
PAUL MILLSAP:   I don't know.   I don't know.   I have better things to do. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
PAUL MILLSAP:   I'm a little bummed about it.   That would have been great.   But, no, I'm very excited about it.   And it's about time that it happens.   He's one of the greatest coaches of all times. 

Q.   Just his work schedule, the way he works, his work ethic.   His style seems to fit the team pretty well. 
PAUL MILLSAP:   Yeah, it does.   He's a great guy to play for.   He wants us to be aggressive, to work hard, put your time in on the court like it's practice or games.   But I learned a lot from him.   I'm very blessed that I was able to have him as a coach. 

Q.   Is his style kind of similar to Jerry's?
PAUL MILLSAP:   It's similar.   But he wants to have his own way.   He doesn't want to be a copy cat.   So he is still trying to find his way and coach in his style of coaching.
