  Q.  Can you talk about what kind of an honor it is to be here this weekend?   
 PAUL MILLSAP:  It's a great honor.  I was surprised when my name was called.  When I look back, I didn't really see myself here, but I'm going to enjoy my time here.  I'm going to go out there and play hard.   
  
  Q.  It has to be even sweeter with the team's success you've enjoyed this year?   
 PAUL MILLSAP:  It is.  I credit the team and the coaching staff for a great season so far.  That helped a lot to get me here.   
 Hopefully we can continue to carry on our winning streak.
