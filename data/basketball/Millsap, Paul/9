   PAUL MILLSAP:  I don't think there is anything we can work on for that, just get out there and continue to bust our tails on the court.  That's the only thing.   
  
  Q.  Is it just effort when you get off the bench, you just need to bring more effort?   
 PAUL MILLSAP:  Coming off the bench there is supposed to be energy.  There isn't too much energy coming off the bench right now.  We just got to get back on track with that.   
  
  Q.  You haven't lost in the playoffs at home.  Can you talk about getting back here?   
 PAUL MILLSAP:  It is going to be a big game for us.  It is going to show us where we're at right now.  We just have to come up with these two wins.  Go back to San Antonio, get a confidence booster and come back home.   
 A lot is riding on these two games.   
  
  Q.  Is San Antonio being able to take you guys out of your game because as a team you guys just really haven't seemed to gel in the first two games.   
 PAUL MILLSAP:  They are a great team.  They are a championship team.  They play as a team.  We play as a team, too, but there is just some things out there we have trouble doing.  Pick-and-roll games is killing us right now.   
 They get easy layups.  If we can stop the layups, we can win the game.
