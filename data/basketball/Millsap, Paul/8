		   PAUL MILLSAP:  Every minute is my last minute, so I treat it as my last minute out there.  So I go out there and give 100%. 

 Q.  Was the second quarter on your mind at all last night?  You had two debacles in San Antonio. 
 PAUL MILLSAP:  Well, yeah, it had been on my mind.  That was our main focus.  I am trying to keep the game close through halftime. 
 If we can keep it in reach, we can win the game.  That's what we did.
