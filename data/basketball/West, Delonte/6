<p>	Q.  Jameer, how motivating has the underdog status been for this team, especially considering you're the No. 1 seed?  For some reason, y'all can't seem to shake it. </p>
<p>	Q.  Jameer, in terms of a match-up on offense and defense, do you think you'll be matched up with Paul?  Will that just be an occasional thing?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible). </p>
<p>	Q.  Jameer, could you just talk about from seeing Chris Paul on tape.  You were such an impact player as a freshman, what do you think of the job he's done for Wake Forest? </p>
<p>	Q.  Tyrone, do you think the loss to Xavier in the conference tournament actually worked beneficially to you guys, giving you more rest for the big dance? </p>


<p>	Q.  Aside from the Xavier game, any point in the season was it not fun, the streak, when it got to be work? </p>


<p>	Q.  I'm sure it's not lost on any of you that two of the No. 1 seeds are already gone.  For all the heat you took for being the No. 1 seed, do you think it's time to think what is a big conference? </p>


<p>	Q.  With how strongly Coach Martelli reacted after Packer's comments addressing the crowd on Selection Sunday, the fact that he's analyzing the game.  He's going to be here this weekend.  Can you respond, any extra motivation to prove what the rest of the national audience heard that day about what he felt about Saint Joseph's? </p>



<p>	Q.  Jameer, you are the No. 1 seed in this regional.  Can you talk about carrying the mantle of being No. 1 and having to keep that and to move on? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jameer, you talked about it doesn't matter what the seed is.  How much does experience -- you are a more mature, older team than the Wake Forest team you're going to be facing.  How much does that factor in? </p>
<p>	Q.  I know y'all look at the same tape, but individually you must take something away from it, and from talking to the coaches individually on how you're going to approach this game.  What impresses you most about Wake Forest on an individual level? </p>


<p>	Q.  You talked about having fun earlier.  It would seem like Saint Joseph's is a fun place to be going to school this year.  Can any of you talk about, a small school like that, do you feel more like perhaps a regular student than students in some large universities? </p>


<p>	Q.  Delonte and Jameer, Coach Martelli mentioned on Monday for all the attention being given to the back court match-ups, he thought it would be somebody else, another player or if you, who would decide the game.  Do you agree with his assessment?  If so, who are your leading candidates? </p>

<p>	Q.  You guys have a really late tipoff tomorrow night.  What are you going to do all day? </p>




<p>	Q.  Obviously the big elephant, Billy Packer is calling the game. </p>
<p>	Q.  That's right. </p>
<p>	Q.  Yeah, right.  How ironic.  Can you discuss the excitement of all of this? </p>

<p>	Q.  We asked the kids earlier, do you think the loss to Xavier in the conference tournament could have maybe proved to be a little more beneficial by getting more rest leading up to the big dance? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you see the way early entry is going now, there might be 12 or 13 high school guys going in the draft this year, do you think down the line you may see more programs like Saint Joseph's, Xavier, UAB with upper class dominated teams advancing further and further in the tournament?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you scout a team, get your team ready, I know you prefer looking at the individual player, comparing him to another player.  If you could step aside and look at this team, Wake Forest, do they are resemble Xavier more than any other team or less?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jameer, flirted with going to the NBA last year.  Where would this team be this season if he did decide to go to the NBA last season?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about when Jameer was a freshman, obviously you gave him the keys.  You see a kid like Chris Paul, what he's doing.  How special is it for a kid to be take over and run a program as a freshman point guard?</p>
<p>	Q.  So with that, what do you anticipate seeing from the match-up of those two guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  Player of the Year, Jameer Nelson, undefeated regular season record, why is so little expected from this team?  Why does it feel like the thought process is they're overachieving? </p>
<p>	Q.  You and your players seem to fully embrace the excitement around the program.  Has it ever been a problem in the last week or two getting your team focused on preparation for a game? </p>
<p>	Q.  I don't know if you have any relationship with Mike Montgomery or not.  Was there any slight feeling of satisfaction that they went out first?  Your league has two standing, the so-called power conference out there is watching on TV. </p>
