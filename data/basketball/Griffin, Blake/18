 Q.   Blake, did this remind you of Game 1 at all?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN:   Yeah, I thought we both, both teams played poorly.   I thought Game 1 they played a little better.   We played pretty bad.   I mean, at the same time, like I said, I don't think both teams were hitting a lot of shots really.   I think they just grinded it out a little more than us, obviously.  
   
 Q.   Blake, I know both you and Chris would like to finish this thing off tonight, but do you take any solace in the fact that you're going home now to play on your home court as opposed to having to play a 7th game on their court?   
BLAKE GRIFFIN:   Yeah, that's why you work so hard to get as high a seed as possible and to have home court in situations like these.   But not happy about the way we played, but we have to forget about it because we have a big one coming up.  
   
 Q.   Could I ask you both to respond to the news that Donald Sterling is battling cancer at present?   
BLAKE GRIFFIN:   I honestly didn't know that.   If that is true, my thoughts and prayers are with him.   Nobody deserves to go through something like that.   
CHRIS PAUL:   Yeah, that is the first I've ever heard of that, and that is truly unfortunate.  
   
 Q.   In the locker postgame couple guys were really upset with the loss, and it looked like Jamal was going around to guys trying to pick guys up.   Does that process have to start right away with Game 7?   
CHRIS PAUL:   I think so.   I think it would be a problem if we were okay with it.   Anytime you lose, guys are down, guys are mad and upset.   You always try to run through your mind what you could have done differently for us to be so close.   But, yeah, we've got to let this one go and get ready for Game 7 and go back home.  
   
 Q.   Chris and Blake, I know you guys are in the moment, but you played these guys ten times this year.   Now the familiarity, I know there is not any love lost, but how about the respect and enjoying the opportunity to go head to head against these guys?   Because it's just been great drama throughout the regular season and the postseason.   
BLAKE GRIFFIN:   Yeah, it's been great games.   They're a good team, obviously.   You look at their lineup, look at what they've done, they're a great team and we've had some good battles.   It's fun.   It's fun to have competition like that.  
   
 Q.   Chris, was there a fatigue factor you were battling tonight?   It looked like late in the first half there was a trainer kind of working on your hand or maybe your thumb.   Could you tell us what happened there?   
CHRIS PAUL:   Yeah, I'm okay.   I'm okay.   Tough game, bumps and bruises, you get through it.   But we've just got to be ready for Game 7.   Every game is different.   Me and Blake both battled foul trouble tonight.   We've just got to be ready for Game 7.  
   
 Q.   Blake, could you talk about or elaborate on the challenges that Draymond Green poses against you?   
BLAKE GRIFFIN:   Just missed some easy shots the past couple games here.   Whenever you have a smaller defender, it's not so much the one‑on‑one match‑up just because they're constantly running people at you.   I've got to do a better job of reading the double teams and passing out of them, things like that.  
   
 Q.   Piggybacking on that, what do you have to do to get back to the offense that you guys played?   In the early season you had the most efficient offense in the league.   Is it ball movement?   What are the things you guys need to recapture most?   
BLAKE GRIFFIN:   Yeah, I think just ball movement and trusting our offense.   I think, honestly, it starts defensively for us.   When we get stops, we kind of get into a better flow and a better rhythm.   It's not just coming down and a matter of calling a play and doing what we do; it's a lot of things.   
To me and I think other guys would agree, it starts when we're all as a unit playing better defense and not giving so many easy looks and easy shots.   It kind of fits into our offense a little bit better.
