  Clippers - 107

Q.   Blake, are you and your teammates in a state of shock and angry at each other? 
BLAKE GRIFFIN:   No, not angry at each other.   Disappointed with how we played as a team, but there's no pointing the finger with our team.   They outplayed us in every sense of the word down the stretch.   We took our foot off the gas, stopped defending, a lot of things.   Got to be better.

Q.   What did it feel like the final seven minutes or so when nothing would fall and it seemed like kind of everything went wrong? 
BLAKE GRIFFIN:   I mean, it's just not a good feeling.   It's not an ideal situation to play in where you're missing shots.   Seemed like they were hitting everything.   But we've got to do a better job of just making it tougher on them on the defensive end, when we're playing defense.   When the shots aren't falling we've got to buckle down on defense and play better.

Q.   You were hoping not to have to play Game 7 but you have before and you guys have won.   Can you draw on that?
BLAKE GRIFFIN:   Yeah, we've been in this situation several times now, a couple times at home, once on the road.   You know, we've got to come out and play.   I mean, there's nothing more to it.   Game 7 is Game 7; it's about who wants it more.   I expect us to be ready. 

Q.   You've been playing every other day since Game 2 against the Spurs.   Now you have an extra day off.   Is that a good thing after what just happened or is it a bad thing, that you guys have more time to think about it?
BLAKE GRIFFIN:   You know, we'd like to get the taste out of our mouths, but at the same time we need rest.   We have guys that are a little banged up, like you said, playing every other day for almost, I guess, three straight weeks maybe.   So yeah, we could definitely use that, but we need to use it to our advantage, get rest, and come out and show that we've had two days' rest. 

Q.   You guys had problems closing out games, Game 5, obviously tonight.   Was it something like putting the cart before the horse, kind of anticipating it so much that‑‑
BLAKE GRIFFIN:   I don't know, we played well there in the third.   We played well.   We did some things we needed to do.   We didn't play well early.   Kind of a hot‑and‑cold game for us.   I think we've just got to‑‑ once we get up‑‑ we talk about it all year, putting the pedal down and really keep going, not just playing to not lose, just play to win and do the things that got us there.   We didn't do that tonight. 

Q.   You talked about keeping the pedal down.   You built big leads against this team in Games 3 and 4.   Tonight was there a shift?   What was the turning point?
BLAKE GRIFFIN:   Probably couldn't pinpoint one exact point, but they trusted each other and they played very freely, and we didn't.   We kind of‑‑ you could tell we kind of got stunned, and we didn't respond well.
