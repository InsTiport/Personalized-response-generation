Q.   What type of performance are you hoping for tonight?
BLAKE GRIFFIN:   I'm just looking forward to being out there.   It's an honor to be on the list and to be a part of this game.   I'm just trying to have fun and learn a little something while I'm out there.

Q.   What's the difference from last year's All‑Star Game to this year's All‑Star Game?
BLAKE GRIFFIN:   We get to breathe a little.   It's a little more relaxing.   I know what to expect this year.   Last year I didn't really know what to expect, and then going into it, it was nonstop every single minute, and this year, the way it's set up, hopefully I get a little downtime to see my family and stuff like that.

Q.   Is there anybody you're expecting to play with that you really want to have a chance to play with?
BLAKE GRIFFIN:   Yeah, I mean, all the guys that weren't on the team last year.   It's always fun to play with new guys and some of the best guys obviously.   Having those guys out there will be fun.
