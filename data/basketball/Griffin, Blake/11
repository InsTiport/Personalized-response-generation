      Clippers - 107

Q.   Blake, how tough is it to emotionally regroup after another tight loss and now you have to go into an elimination game in two days? 
    BLAKE GRIFFIN:   It's tough, but the series isn't over, and we can't think like that.   We've got to be ready to come play.   It's going to be a hostile environment in San Antonio.   And, like you said, close‑out game, elimination game for them, so we've got to be ready to go. 
    Series isn't over, though. 

Q.   Blake, you guys did a good job of cutting a seven‑point deficit down to one there.   Why couldn't you guys get over the hump? 
    BLAKE GRIFFIN:   You know, just missed some shots, missed two free throws late.   I can't do that.   Some things didn't go our way.   But we've got to be better. 
    If I had the answer for why we didn't get over that hump, it would probably‑‑ probably would have been a lot easier, but we'll look at it and try to improve upon it. 

Q.   Blake, heading into Game 6, does it help knowing that you guys have already won on their court? 
    BLAKE GRIFFIN:   Yeah, it's a gettable game.   It's not going to be easy by any means.   I mean, this is what they do.   They're a great team, a well‑coached team, and they've been in this situation before. 
    But we've also been in tough situations.   We've also played some tough games, some games on the road that we needed to win, and we did. 
    I expect us to be ready. 

Q.   Is fatigue a factor at all, and what was your view of the last play of the offensive?
    BLAKE GRIFFIN:   Yeah, down the stretch everybody is tired, but it's a factor.   But it's a factor for everybody, so it's not really an advantage or disadvantage for anybody, I don't think.   The last play going in, I couldn't tell if D.J. touched it or not.   Obviously that was the call, but I don't know.   I thought it was good.   But it didn't happen. 

Q.   Is this one as tough as that Thunder Game 5 last year that you guys couldn't quite pull out? 
    BLAKE GRIFFIN:   As far as the result or the game? 

Q.   Just the way you feel right now. 
    BLAKE GRIFFIN:   You know, I don't really believe in looking back and comparing games like this. 
    This loss is tough because we needed it, but at the same time, just like that Game 5, that series wasn't over right there.   We came back home and didn't play the way we should have, and that's what eventually lost the series for us. 
    Like I keep saying, the series is still alive.   We just have to go execute, and we have to go take care of business.
