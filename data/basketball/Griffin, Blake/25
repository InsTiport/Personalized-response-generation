  BLAKE GRIFFIN:   To be honest I don't know when the Slam Dunk Contest is, but this game and then during the Allâ€‘Star Game and then having stuff every day, I kind of just want to take a break and give my body a chance to rest tomorrow night. 

Q.   Talk about Ricky Rubio. 
BLAKE GRIFFIN:   Very exciting.   He's a great player, great basketball player, good fun.

Q.   Do you have any good luck charms? 
BLAKE GRIFFIN:   I don't really have any good luck charms.   Before every game that I play, there's one thing that I always do. 

Q.   If you couldn't play basketball, what would you do?
BLAKE GRIFFIN:   Play football. 

Q.   What has been the best part of this weekend?
BLAKE GRIFFIN:   The best part of this weekend is talking to you right now.   This is the best part right now, so far.
