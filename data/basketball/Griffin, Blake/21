THE MODERATOR:   Take questions for Blake.   
   
 Q.   You guys were up by 18, what kind of happened there towards the end of the second half?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN:   They started making shots.   And we didn't get stops and we went a little bit cold.   And once a team gets hot, especially a team with so many good scorers, it's tough to stop them.   And down the stretch we just made a few key mistakes, but, you know, it's all good.   
   
 Q.   How special was the Bill Russell moment?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN:   That was very cool.   Obviously one of the greatest players to play the game.   Most decorated.   All those championships and the type of leader he was.   For the entire arena, for all the players and even the legends that were at the game to show that much respect is‑‑ it says a lot about him as a player and as a person.   
   
 Q.   With 4:24 left you had 38 points, which is only four points shy of the all‑time record.   But you didn't, I don't think, hit another shot and certainly didn't score any more.   Was that frustrating to you or just the fact that perhaps you lost the game also?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN:   It was more so that we lost the game.   That's actually my first loss in the All‑Star Game.   But you never want to lose, even if it's an All‑Star Game.   It's kind of a friendly competition.   It's better to get the win.   So that was a little frustrating.   
   
 Q.   This kind of game really showcases your skill set as an athlete.   Do you worry, though, that that will pigeonhole you as just being a dunker?   You had a few jump shots out there.   Is there any fear of that, or is it just go out there and have fun and put on a show for the fans?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN:   Yeah, I'm terrified of that.   
(Laughter.)  
I don't care, man.   People are going to say whatever they're going to say.   I just take the points as they come.  
   
 Q.   Do you like being able to showcase for the fans out there some highlight‑reel dunks?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN:   It's fun, man.   This game is for the fans.   And to be able to do the things that they want to see, they don't really want to see me shooting jump shots, so it's cool to be able to get up and down and have fun with it.   
   
 Q.   You got to close the game with Chris, and even though he didn't start, did it mean something to be able to play the final eight or nine minutes with him on the court together?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN:   Yeah, it's always nice playing with somebody you're familiar with, especially somebody like C.P. who is always looking for you and always trying to set people up.   
So I couldn't pick a better person to be on the court with in the last final minutes or whatever it is.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, Blake.
