THE MODERATOR:   We'll get an opening statement from coach. 
COACH COLLEN:   It was obviously a tough loss for us.   I felt like it was a game that we had in hand, you know.   I don't know whether we necessarily let up.   I don't think a team ever purposely lets up at the end of the game, but we probably made some poor decisions in the latter part of the game that allowed them to get more possessions on us.   Ultimately those possessions probably caught up with us. 
Give them credit, they made a play at the end of the game.   We had a good look at the end of the game.   Probably could have won it. 
It's a tough one for us.   I think this team deserves a little bit better fate.   I said all year long I think it's an NCAA tournament team, but you got to earn the right to get into the NCAA tournament.   In order to be able to do that, you've got to be able to win these close games.   We just didn't get that done. 
THE MODERATOR:   Jessica? 
JESSICA JACKSON:   Well, we went out there to play hard.   We made a couple mistakes, but we fought hard at the end.   Just couldn't come up with the win. 
THE MODERATOR:   Calli? 
CALLI BERNA:   It's tough.   I think we did fight hard.   But we can't let up at the end.   We can't have those defensive mistakes we had.   Ole Miss is a good team and they're going to take those opportunities. 
I'm still proud of my team.   I know how good we are.   We didn't show that tonight, but I know how good my team is.   It's upsetting we came up short. 

THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
