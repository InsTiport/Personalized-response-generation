THE MODERATOR: It's my pleasure to introduce Clemson head coach, Amanda Butler. Coach?   
AMANDA BUTLER: Yeah, just got beat by a really good team. They're having an outstanding season. We knew this was going to be a battle of not just skill but will and that is a great credit to the way I regard both teams. Joanna has done a tremendous job. They definitely earned the right to advance. It's always disappointing when you love a group so much like we do, team 45 to see it come to an end but a lot of things especially down the stretch to build on and to push our seniors into, you know, the next phase of their life feeling good about themselves.   
 Q.  You played a lot of people and you kept coming at them, even when it looked like they were about to pull away you would always answer. Playing two nights in a row did it catch up with the team or was it Boston College's resolve?  
AMANDA BUTLER: I didn't feel like fatigue was that much of a factor. Obviously we try to keep the right people on the floor that match the moment and give us the best chance each moment and coach moment by moment and do a really good job with that. It was hard for us to get some of our players that we depend on offense civil, to get them going. Again, you have to credit Boston College for that.   
I think they just played better than us in the right spots. We played better than them in some spots but they played better than us in more spots.   
Thanks, Coach.
