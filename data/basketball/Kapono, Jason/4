 Q.  What are the keys to the Three Point Contest? 
 JASON KAPONO:  I just need to start out well.  You need to come out and have a strong first rack or two. 
 So therefore you're not rushing or pressing at the end, you just have to make sure you get up quality shots every time.  You don't want to be at the end having to force up shots.  That's the thing that you have to try to do the best, keep your patience. 

 Q.  For a guy who was a star player at UCLA, having to work your way up in the NBA, was that a shock and has that been difficult? 
 JASON KAPONO:  Not at all.  It doesn't matter where you get drafted, some players are given a chance to play as soon as they get drafted and some have to wait.  So it's just one of those things where I had to wait a couple of years and I'm just glad I'm getting a chance to play now. 

 Q.  This is a new experience for you, what does it feel like being a part of All-Star Weekend? 
 JASON KAPONO:  It feels great.  It's good to come out here and take part in an event that you've watched as a kid, that as you grew up you were always hoping to be a part of.  I guess I get to live the dream on Saturday.
