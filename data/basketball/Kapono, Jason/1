  Q. Will you get a three-peat this year?   
 JASON KAPONO: Am I going to three-peat? I guarantee you I will take part in the contest tomorrow night. That's the only guarantee that I will make.  
  
  Q. What's the key to winning it?   
 JASON KAPONO: What's the key to winning it? Making the most shots, having the most points towards the end.   
 On a serious note, really it is just catching a rhythm and trying to limit the back street. If you are going to miss, honestly, you can probably afford to miss two in a row. Once you start going downhill, then you start to get pressed for time and you start to panic a little bit and then after that, you are pretty much done.   
 If you limit the bad streak and catch a hot streak, then you have a good chance.
