 Q.  Talk about this being your first trip to The Tinals.  
 DONYELL MARSHALL:  It was funny because we got here yesterday, and it was like a travel day yesterday.  All right, today, now being here, being part of this, and now I'm starting to really feel it.  As you see, I'm starting to sweat and everything. 
 But it feels good.  It took 13 years to be a part of it.  It's funny because we were on the bus, and LeBron asked the question, "What's media day like?"  And nobody could answer him because nobody has been here before.  It's starting to kick in now. 

 Q.  How big a factor is that, that they have so much more experience at this than you do? 
 DONYELL MARSHALL:  Obviously a lot of people look at that as a factor for them, but we're a confident team, we've always been confident, and we feel that we can play with anybody.  We're going to come in here.  We've got just as much of a chance to win it as they do. 

 Q.  Distractions, how are you guys handling it? 
 DONYELL MARSHALL:  Actually it's been pretty good.  It's been pretty good.  Right now when we have family members call, the members that have been following me throughout my career, so they're not a distraction.  Obviously being down here with not too many Cavs fans, you don't have that other distraction yet.  Right now it's been pretty good so far. 

 Q.  How about LeBron and the immense scrutiny and everything that he's going to be under over the next couple days?  What advice will you give him? 
 DONYELL MARSHALL:  Well, if I was here before, I'd be able to give him some advice, but I haven't been here, so I really wouldn't know -- he's taken scrutiny the last years I've been with him, and he's always come back from it.  I think he knows how to do it.  Obviously in Game 1 when he passed up the shot, people scrutinized that, and he's come back from that to help us get here.
