<p>	Q.  Geography, is it more myth or fact that the committee wants to keep teams closer to home?  My example this year, would Stanford necessarily end up at Santa Barbara?  Does Arizona go to Tempe?   Does the committee looking to keep teams closer to home which seems to have been inconsistent the last couple of years?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you just talk about the No.  1 seeds this year, there's always debate and some suspense, but does this seem like there are teams in the running this year and maybe as a result, more difficult decisions to make? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you look at teams in conferences and they have a losing record in conference, how does that affect your decision, and what other factors do you have to take into account and does that hurt them? </p>
<p>	Q.  So when it comes to geography is that more or less important than keeping teams as close to their natural place on the s-curve as possible?  In other words, would you move a team more than one spot, more than one seed line to accommodate geography or the other way around? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much does a team  -- do appearances factor into the seeding of the tournament, they are having a great year, the team, any team, it could be any team, but they are having a great year, does their lack of NCAA appearances have any factor of any of that into seeding? </p>
<p>	Q.  It's Houston now because that's their circumstance.  But any team that has not  -- they have no NCAA experience on their team, does that at all factor into any  --</p>
<p>	Q.  I'm talking about how high their seed would be.</p>
<p>	Q.  The tournament seeding situation, and it's sort of been a slide at this point, is that a negative to them or any team? </p>
<p>	Q.  With the longest winning streak in the nation now, do you feel like this Chattanooga team has positioned itself to be better seeded than it has in the previous three years?</p>
<p>	Q.  I wanted to ask you, if you consider match-ups when you decide where to send a team, maybe on the men's side would be Bobby Knight going back to Indiana and things like that?</p>

<p>	Q.  I'm just wondering, the people would maybe look at a matchup like if Maryland and Minnesota, if Maryland were to get in, obviously that would be a draw, is that something that might be considered?</p>
<p>	Q.  Following up on the question about coaching match-ups, I guess there's in interest in Nashville about Vanderbilt and about they can potentially land in Columbus and perhaps face Ohio State, which is coached by their former coach, Jim Foster.  I guess you say that's not something that you pay attention to?</p>
<p>	Q.  Wondering if you could discuss the general criteria for choosing the sites and also how much does having  -- I'm speaking specifically of the Bridgeport side, how much does having a team like UCONN with such a strong fan base play into choosing that particular site?</p>
<p>	Q.  The League Championship and tournament champions, do either of those figure into the discussion?</p>
<p>	Q.  What is the status of using the predetermined sites as it sits right now?  I know there's discussion on changing the format and where there would be 16 sites per region and shrinking things as opposed to the eight sites per region  --</p>
<p>	Q.  The No.  1 seeds, considering they have sort of beat up on each other through the season, what will it come down to when you have to narrow it down to those four? </p>
<p>	Q.  On the eight sites next year, is it possible that different regions could play at a site similar to what the men do, like for geography and things like that?  So geography would be a pretty good factor? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much do you look at a conferences RPI rating when determining the number of teams that will make the field from that conference?</p>
<p>	Q.  We do.  Just to make sure I heard you correct, you have no problem that a conference that might be rated fifth overall has three more teams than the conference that's rated third overall? </p>
<p>	Q.  Looking at what happened with UCONN last week and how things have been the last four or five years, in women's basketball, how much do you think the gap has closed between the haves and have nots?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would you talk about what advantages are gained from having eight sites as opposed to 16 sites?</p>
