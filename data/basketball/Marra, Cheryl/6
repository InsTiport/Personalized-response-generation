<p>	Q.  Can you mention about the fact why Duke got slotted so close to home.  They actually are, of the teams that don't have to travel, they are the closest to home.  Were they rewarded for being the number one?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about Miami and how close they may have been to falling out or what that quarterfinal went up there at Rutgers.  Was that the one thing that put them over the top and put them in?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering how much consideration Sienna College got and were they on the bubble?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talk a little bit about Miami.  Were there any other factors that went into selecting them?</p>
<p>	Q.  My question was on Baylor, what maybe kept them out of the tournament and was there any specific thing that you looked at there?</p>
<p>	Q.  And when you talked about Miami earlier you talked about their big wins, was that another factor with Baylor that maybe they didn't have enough of those top wins?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned about trying to keep teams close to home.  Especially number one seeds.  What about LSU having to go to Eugene?</p>
<p>	Q.  Two questions.  One, do you think you're moving in a direction where a situation like perhaps befalls Tennessee, where they can play four games on their home floor before getting to the Final Four, where you can eliminate that?  And the other question just is about how the Big East not only got seven teams in.  I know you said they were the number three conference, but they got seven teams in and five of them in the upper half of the draw.  Can you sort of talk about that situation?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk specifically about Oklahoma, they get to be a host for one thing as a number 10 seed, and they look like they might have been kind of on the bubble.  What sort of led them to be selected?  And also you seem to kind of reward them and maybe not reward a team like Villanova or GW, by sending them to Norman to have to play.</p>
<p>	Q.  Looking at the West Region, it looks like that one is pretty beefed up there, with nationally ranked teams in like the top eight or nine spots.  Could you talk about was it just that there were slots available in the West, because it seems like every so often the West seems like that's one of the toughest Regionals to get out of.  You send a lot of teams from this part of the country, the eastern part of the country out there.  How did that get to be so loaded down with teams of that caliber, especially the top two seeds?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk a little bit about, you have five teams from the Big 12 and five from Conference USA, are you saying by that is the committee saying those conferences are comparable and also, you said that the fact that Oklahoma is hosting never played into your decision, how is it that you can't play that into your decision when you're sending a No. 2 seed to potentially face a 10 on its home court?</p>
<p>	Q.  I have two questions.  Was there ever any consideration on giving Chattanooga a higher seed than a 12 and did you discuss sending them back to University Park where they played last year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Looking at the Big 10, you have Ohio State as a fourth seed and Minnesota as a six.  I'm wondering if that points to the fact that Minnesota did not do well in the conference tournament?</p>
<p>	Q.  I wanted to ask you specifically about Charlotte.  BCA Summerville RPI has been called the 8th strongest conference and as far as Charlotte's numbers, RPI and strength of schedule, there are seven at large teams that did not get in in favor of Charlotte.  I wanted to first ask you if Charlotte was one of the last teams that got into the tournament and what were some of the things that got Charlotte into the tournament.</p>
<p>	Q.  Were they one of the last teams to get into the tournament?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just wanted to ask you, how close was Texas to getting that number one seed with LSU or was it clear cut because of their head to head matchup?  Was there ever really any doubt about that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk to me about the factors for Michigan State getting in?  There was -- ESPN popped up a little graphic that said they were on the bubble before they started their show.  What put them over the top as far as them getting in?</p>
<p>	Q.  I wanted to touch base on the idea of a lower seeded team, a 10 seed in Oklahoma's case, hosting and potentially playing a 2 seed with 12 or 13,000 people.  Doesn't that seem to punish a team that's earned a 2 seed?</p>
<p>	Q.  So in other words you're saying you didn't slide Oklahoma up or down because they were a hosting team that kind of thing is what you're saying there?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did Oklahoma's seed change up or down because of that?</p>
<p>	Q.  My last question, did this new process or the new predetermined sites, did that make it a little bit more difficult to select the teams and put them in places this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  I wanted to ask you a couple of questions in regard to the Wisconsin Green Bay women.  First of all obviously it looks like the committee gave them a little more benefit of the doubt for what they did this regular season, bumping them up to that 8 seed as to somewhere in that 12 to 13 range.  At the same time, however, they are in the top 20 in both polls, yet slide down to a number 8 seed.  Can you talk a little bit about what went into that slotting process for them?</p>
<p>	Q.  Along the same line, did they have to win their conference tournament to get in?  Is the Horizon League weak enough where what they did across the course of the season wasn't going to be enough unless they won that conference tournament?</p>
<p>	Q.  I just wondered about the concentration of Big East teams in the East Regional.  I was wondering if there was four of them there that you had tried to split them up any other way or that was just the only way you guys could put it together?</p>
<p>	Q.  Every year people strengthen up their schedule and take that risk that it will pay off in the end.  But in the case of a team like Virginia, how many losses is finally enough and maybe it's a good question to put to the men and the women.  I mean at what point is there enough losing to not get into one of these things?</p>
<p>	Q.  I had a couple other questions that sort of came up to me.  How important is non-conference scheduling in terms not only of who you invite to the tournament but also in determining seeds and so forth?  That's one.  Second, and I hate to be cynical about this, but someone may note that the two times that Georgia Tech has been invited to the tournament have happened to be the times when the Final Four is being hosted in Atlanta and they were hosting.  Is that just a coincidence?</p>
<p>	Q.  And to follow-up, does that also affect seeding also?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would I be correct in inferring from some of your earlier comments that the final number one seed and the top No. 2 seed, did that come down to LSU and Texas?</p>
<p>	Q.  And could you tell us who the number 1 seeds in order prior, prior to LSU?  Was Duke number 1?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you tell, were you number one set before last night's Big 12 championship game, was that already set and there was no way of Texas could have gotten a number one regardless of them winning last night?</p>
<p>	Q.  And you mentioned, if I could follow-up on that.  You mentioned Tennessee came in ahead of LSU, so are you putting a little bit more weight on the regular season in that case than the conference championship game, which LSU just beat Tennessee?</p>
<p>	Q.  What about the fact that they lost to Duke, lost to UCONN and lost to Texas.  I mean they played a tough non-conference but they lost all three of those games.</p>

<p>	Q.  My question is for Scottie.  Scottie, have the television times been, are they -- will they be released relatively shortly here?</p>
<p>	Q.  So they won't be available until tomorrow?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just a follow-up, how soon do you think the predetermined sites might evolve into true neutral sites?  Is there any way to settle that?</p>
<p>	Q.  So you guys will really be watching that Oregon Regional.  I mean Duke is obviously playing real close to home.  If not actually in their own gym.</p>
<p>	Q.  One thing is that since Duke was the only one of the four Final Four teams from last year that did not get a home site, Gail G. said today that they had that for next year.  What's the likelihood that Duke will be getting a home site next year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Cheryl, does ESPN need the predetermined sites in order to do the 63 games?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering if you could go over the safety net issue again and in particular how it affected your seeding in the East Regional, because I was noticing that the 1, 2 and 3 seeds are the same as the Milwaukee bracket from last year.  Including even having Old Dominion as a Cinderella in the same bracket with those schools again.</p>
<p>	Q.  Well, what I was referring to is you were talking about potentially preventing rematches from occurring and you could have a rematch of the Eastern Regional final or a matchup of a regional final from last year in the regional semi-finals this year.</p>
<p>	Q.  In regards to LSU having to travel all the way out to Eugene, I know you guys mentioned you wanted to keep those number 1 seeds on a neutral court, and in the case of Duke and LSU, but wouldn't it have almost made more sense to maybe send LSU just up the road to Reston, Louisiana and reward them for being the number 1 seed with a short trip and then maybe sending somebody else out to Eugene?</p>
<p>	Q.  Right.  But along the same token doesn't that create an inherent advantage for UCONN and Tennessee because they are on their home court, whereas LSU is having to travel three quarters of the way across the country?</p>
