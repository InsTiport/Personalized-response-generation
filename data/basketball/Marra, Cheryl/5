<p>	Q.  Cheryl, was one of the thoughts of the predetermined sites that you all would be able to boost attendance and if so how did you feel about the end result of that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Cheryl, there is a lot of grumbling about the predetermined sites; can you address those concerns and also if there will be any changes for next year or beyond?</p>
<p>	Q.  To follow up on what you just said, how long do you feel like you will have to stick with predetermined sites before you can go to the neutral sites?</p>
<p>	Q.  Cheryl, the biggest complaint among the coaches seems to be the issue of have highly seated teams in some cases seated as high as three having to travel and play on the home court.  Has that been taken into consideration and if so how might the process be tweaked to address that concern?</p>
<p>	Q.  Cheryl, do you see any chance when you all get back in and look at all of the pros and all of the cons, any possibility of saying, hey, maybe we do need to get back to top 4 seeds hosting?</p>
<p>	Q.  One of the other things you have for consideration is looking for future sites for Final Four's.  I understand you are picking three more years this year; could you talk about your experience, or your feeling about teams after the two experiences that have you had and how that might factor in how you select for the next process?</p>
<p>	Q.  You spoke about the advantages for ESPN and the host in terms of having the predetermined sites; can you talk about marketing to bring in people, into the stadiums themselves, in terms of what the NCAA as well as the host can do for outreach and getting attendance up?</p>
<p>	Q.  Cheryl, do you feel like the NCAA is doing too much to create parity other than letting the program do it themselves?</p>
<p>	Q.  Juggling the sites and setting up situations where a higher seed may be able to -- or a worse seed may be able to pull off an upset, that kind of thing?</p>
<p>	Q.  Cheryl, you had a situation in the Middle East this year where Tennessee was able to advance playing four games on its home floor.  Philosophically, how do the other members of the committee stand on the issue of teams hosting registration naturals?</p>
<p>	Q.  Cheryl, you talked about any time you have  something new you have criticism, but you have 4 coaches here including 2 of 1,600 plus wins and it wasn't just criticism but all 4 of those coaches hated it, Geno called it a stupid idea, is the committee going to keep swimming in the face of the tied in all of the top coaches in the game as far as predetermined sites?</p>
<p>	Q.  You spoke about how ESPN exposure has helped and how there is parity growing win the 64 teams, can you talk about outside influences that the NCAA can't control, Title 9, and what you see outside of the federal government influence in how you can support continuing growth?</p>
<p>	Q.  Well, the championship benefits from Title 9, and the relationship, you know what you can control within the NCAA, and how you can grow the game from the inside, what can you all do on the outside in influencing Title 9's growth?</p>
<p>	Q.  For next season do you anticipate on-court changes in the structure of the game, what do you think the point of emphasis will be?</p>
<p>	Q.  A 10-second back court, moving the 3 point line, things of that nature?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about your hands being tied as far as institutions making bids for regionals and everything, how proactive is the NCAA, meaning not just waiting for people to make the bids but really going out and almost forcing the issue?</p>
<p>	Q.  What is the process for selecting a site when they bid?   What are you looking for?</p>
<p>	Q.  Or regionals?</p>
