<p>	Q.  In giving Minnesota a No.  7 seed, did the committee give any break to Minnesota just because of likelihood of Lindsay Whalen's return? </p>
<p>	Q.  It appears, as you look at the bracket that the University of Maryland was one of the last at-large teams to receive  -- they have a low seed.  Would it be safe to assume that they were one of the last teams chosen?  And could you talk about the fact that there's that  -- went into selecting the No.  1 seeds in, particular, how Texas ended up  -- how you delineated between Texas, Penn State, Purdue and Connecticut? </p>
<p>	Q.  It appears Texas got  -- appeared to be the last No.  1 seed, so I would ask what were the factors perhaps that gave them the one, as opposed to, say, a Purdue or a Connecticut? </p>
<p>	Q.  Just wanted to ask you, a little bit surprised to see a No.  1 seed, Penn State, being assigned to Virginia Tech and having to possibly play against Tech in the second round.  What went into making Tech a No.  8 seed?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was there any concern to make them play on the home court in the second round?</p>
<p>	Q.  Penn State was the worst of the  -- inaudible?</p>
<p>	Q.  Stanford, not only seeding at No.  6, but also it's placement in the Midwest as opposed to the West region.  But starting with the No.  6 seed and how after winning the Pac 10, how that seeding sort of got pegged on the Cardinal?</p>
<p>	Q.  As far as the regional placement, I know that sometimes as far as date and things, maybe Stanford and Seattle seemed more logical, certainly, than Stanford and Norman? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you just clarify the order of the No.  1s, was it Tennessee, Duke, Penn State and Texas? </p>
<p>	Q.  Pat Summit had a question, noting that the Midwest was so heavy with teams that they have played.  Any thought to have maybe switching Vanderbilt and Purdue, putting Vandy in the West? </p>
<p>	Q.  Five or six years ago most of the top teams seemed to win their conference tournaments and it was pretty easy to pick or easier to pick the top seed.  How difficult was it to pick the top seeds, because they lost some of the team lost in their conference tournaments and there were more bubble teams this year.</p>
<p>	Q.  I wanted to ask you about Louisiana Tech, 27-2, beat Penn State at Penn State, in the Top-10 in both polls and they get a 5 seed and have to play at Montana.  What's the reasoning behind that?</p>
<p>	Q.  So it's a situation with them, they know that they lost those two games, maybe if they had beaten Tennessee and won that overtime game, say they were undefeated, what's the highest they could get with that schedule?</p>
<p>	Q.  One of your safety nets, there's a cup of sites where you could have two conference teams meeting, Blacksburg, and a  Penn State match-up and it looks like Tempe, Missouri  -- Missouri and Oklahoma in there.  Is that something you try to avoid or how is that working out there?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about how much talk the expectation of Penn State  -- inaudible -- interpreting the integrity of the bracket winner, how much do you look at all of the teams that are around, in the field?</p>
<p>	Q.  The point you made about putting Tennessee, Vanderbilt in the top two again in the Midwest, a couple of years ago, you had a situation, maybe it was that same year, where you had three Big 12 teams among the Top-4 seeds in the same regional.  I know you want to protect the integrity of the bracket, but at what point do you look at this and say, you know, we are repeating ourselves here, you basically got almost a mini-SEC tournament the in Midwest regional. </p>
<p>	Q.  Just looking though, you've got two Top-4 SEC seeds in the Midwest and same thing in the West where you don't have any SEC teams in any of the East or the West, does that go back to the bracket integrity?  Or did you feel like you were locked in and couldn't really change that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just curious if there was any particular consideration given against the top 50 opponents, an example, Vanderbilt being the 2 seed over Houston, or Notre Dame getting a 5 over Stanford's 6, would those teams be the only advantages  -- than higher-seeded teams had over the lower-seeded teams relative to the rest of the criteria, was there extra emphasis?</p>
<p>	Q.  Please explain which factors gave Penn State a nod over Connecticut as the No.  1 seed? </p>
<p>	Q.  Why would Penn State be rated No.  1 over Connecticut? </p>
<p>	Q.  What about Connecticut?  Why were they considered not qualified to be No.  1? </p>
<p>	Q.  I was surprised to see Houston was only a No. 3 seed, having won 12 in a row and their conference tournament and the regular season championship; and how did Memphis and Louisville, particularly, get left out? </p>
<p>	Q.  What about Louisville? </p>
<p>	Q.  Exactly. </p>
<p>	Q.  A comment on the Big East placing eight teams in the field, and also, just whether there was any discomfort having the 2 seed Connecticut hosting the final to Penn State No.  1?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've been saying how difficult it was this year, I'm trying to get a sense of comparison, when you say "very difficult this year," as maybe compared to some other years.  Did this year stand out as maybe one of the toughest ever, or are we talking last five years, where does that fall?</p>
<p>	Q.  I wonder if you could address whether or not the sites that didn't have host schools, like, for instance, Iowa or Tallahassee, any consideration to trying to have a team from that conference, having a Big  12 team in Ames or did that not even come into consideration?</p>
<p>	Q.  So, for instance, the Kansas State, Oklahoma, Southwest Missouri State, any of those schools that are within driving distance that, was not even considered as far as from an attendance factor or anything like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you break down the order as far as the No.  2s went? </p>
<p>	Q.  Would you go through the Big East again?  You talked about the top seven teams being in the 30 RPI, just curious what made West Virginia -- to put them in at 11 seed?</p>
<p>	Q.  Northwestern State was kind of surprised to have to play Duke after it played Duke in the regular season.  Also very surprised by a No. 16 seed, and the matchup with Duke, as opposed to sending them over to Austin, Texas to play Texas and what would certainly seem to be a lower RPI team in Southern, getting together in its neighborhood in Austin to play Texas, as opposed to going to Durham to play a team it did before...</p>
<p>	Q.  What you're saying is Northwestern State was the 16th seed in the tournament?</p>
<p>	Q.  I'm not understanding the geographics of Northwestern State going to Durham if they are a Southern University team; judging from every RPI I've seen, they wouldn't be.</p>
<p>	Q.  I'm trying to figure out how Northwestern State ended up with the 16th seed when there were seven tournament teams in the index that were lower in WVCA (ph) RPI than Northwestern State was? </p>
<p>	Q.  I know there is some difference but some pretty striking differences.  Thi sis not something that's endorsed by the WVCA.</p>
<p>	Q.  Does the committee take into account at all the phrase "student athlete experience? " And I can't believe this is a very good experience for either Duke or Northwestern State to replay a game that was a 60-point game in December. </p>
<p>	Q.  It's again difficult for people here to understand why they are not going to Austin and why Southern is not going to Durham. </p>
<p>	Q.  And you didn't factor in the student athlete experience?</p>
<p>	Q.  Wondering in regards to Missouri, with them having 7 and 9, what considerations were given to them? </p>
<p>	Q.  Tennessee received the overall No.  1 seed but curious as to why they were placed in the Midwest regional and not the Mideast regional which would appear to be closer to their home area than the Midwest.  Second question is going forward, the men's tournament is adopting the "pod system" for the first and second round games.  As you move to eight sites next year, is that something that perhaps would happen? </p>
<p>	Q.  What's the advantage of Penn State being No.  1 when the path they need to take in the tournament dictates that they would meet one of the most dominant programs in the country on basically their home court? </p>
<p>	Q.  But you UCONN and Penn State would meet in Hartford and not Bridgeport.</p>
<p>	Q.  LSU as the No.  4, going back to maybe the other four No. 3s that you did select did more than they did and possibly their last ten games, did that have something to do their seed?</p>
<p>	Q.  Why is LSU not a 3, did the four teams do a better job than they did, did the finish factor into it?</p>
<p>	Q.  With a team like Rutgers, their RPI around 20, strength of schedule, Top-10, how did they end up as a 7 seed? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you factor publicity or injuries this season?  Did that weigh into it at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Going back to the top eight seeds, the four No.  1s and the four No.  2s, of those, Duke and Texas play at home, Tennessee is on a neutral court no matter what happened, Purdue is on a neutral court, Connecticut is in its home state, Vanderbilt is in its home state.  Penn State and Kansas State, both, if seeds hold, have to play a team that has won on its home court.  Is that really fair?  It seems out of those eight, Penn State and Kansas State, it seems, have a significantly more difficult path than any of the other top eight seeds. </p>
<p>	Q.  Why would Vanderbilt, with the way you rate it, Vanderbilt would be the eighth team?  Again I would say they are getting a significant advantage versus your third No. No.  1 seed at Penn State, it looks like out of all of these Penn State would have  -- to play at Virginia Tech.  And to call Hartford not UConn home court is a little -- they play several games there, they will have to play  -- is Penn State's position really fair for a No.  1 seed?</p>
<p>	Q.  So are we supposed to believe there's any chance in the world Connecticut was not going to be in Bridgeport?</p>
<p>	Q.  That was actually on the table; that they might have been moved out of there?</p>
<p>	Q.  We've heard about parity in year probably more than eight or ten years I've been doing this.  Having said that, you've got the possibility of thinking that  -- Atlanta last year in the Final Four, Final Four New  Orleans, is that ever any kind of a consideration discussed during the committee deliberations?  And regardless of that  -- with this whole parity talk, if those four teams got back to New Orleans? </p>
