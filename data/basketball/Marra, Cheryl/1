<p>	Q.  Just looking at how the tournament played out in terms of the regionals and choices on who was hosting, it's been a question that's been raised the balance between having fans in the stands and a balanced court.  Can you talk about where the NCAA is balancing the need to earn money and build the game and also making an even playing field for teams that are playing. </p>
<p>	Q.  Was there any predetermined sites this year that pleasantly surprised you in terms of attendance and on the flipside of that was there anything there any particular site that was a bit of a disappointment?</p>
<p>	Q.  Towards that end, do you almost by necessity have to use the pod system that the men are using to try to perhaps, would that help you in a certain sense maintain the integrity of the bracket?</p>
<p>	Q.  When are you going to determine when these 8 sites are going to be?  Is there a cut-off date?  And a second question I have is that part of the way the men have gone is tried to make it a little bit more geographically sensible and it didn't seem like there was a lot of geographic sense in this year's tournaments.  For instance Iowa State is hosting, you have 7 Big-10 teams in the tournament plus Southwest Missouri, and none of those are at Iowa State.  In the pod system is there going to be a little bit more attempt to make geographic sense as far as fans being able to get to a site that's near to them?</p>
<p>	Q.  Cheryl, can you explain the decision that was made in Norman not to permit the referee's to speak to the pool reporter after the Tennessee-Baylor game?  That was a controversy that stuck around for a few days.  It went far beyond the bound of the sport and a lot of people wondered why that was not, why there was no more explanation for that. </p>
<p>	Q.  If I could just follow-up real quickly.  I understand that.  What would have been the harm in just doing it anyway ?  I'm thinking if this is a men's game, there was no way you guys could have gotten away with that.</p>
<p>	Q.  You opted this year to play the Final Four here at a basketball arena instead of next door at the dome.  For the Final Four in Indianapolis next year it's the other way around.  Can you just kind of explain the thought process involved in that?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you go to the 8 teams next year, in terms of the playing schedule, will they all play day-night doubleheaders one day or would you have, if you have two different type regionals there would you have it just kind of like the way the schedule was now, four will play one day and four will play the next day, etcetera, etcetera?</p>
<p>	Q.  Much was made coming into the Final Four of the parity in women's basketball this year, yet tomorrow night we're going to have Tennessee and Connecticut in the championship game.  From the NCAA's standpoint would it have been better to have a fresh face such as LSU or Minnesota in the championship game and especially as far as television ratings are concerned?</p>
<p>	Q.  If you look at an Iowa State, Kansas State, Penn State all of them have been in the top-10 in attendance for several years now I know in Kansas State's case they can't even bid for this 8-team pod because they don't have enough hotel rooms in Manhattan.  I'm going to assume that Texas Tech might be in the same position.  I know they went with a bid with Texas for Dallas, is that what some of these schools that have had traditionally great attendance or like a Louisiana Tech and Ruston, are they going to have to maybe bid with another school for a neutral site in order to be part of this process?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you say if there's any other item about Texas Tech and Texas can you see if there's any other like two schools that bid together for a site?</p>
<p>	Q.  Looking ahead to 2009 in St. Louis, I think the capacity right now in the manual is listed at 43,000.  They can do more, they can do less.  I'm just wondering at what point do you decide what they will seat in there for that year?</p>
<p>	Q.  I don't know if this is for Sue or for Cheryl.  It's actually looking at benchmarks of growing the women's game and I look at attendance, I you look at parity, I'm not going to look at money because I'm wondering when and if there's looking at when conferences in the women's game can start benefiting from the attendance for the money.  I honestly don't know what the timelines are in terms of as the game gross and the finances gross and revenues become generated when can women programs and conferences themselves start benefiting. </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there a pro and con with revenue sharing and not revenue sharing?  What are the two camps, saying no, saying yes. </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there any chance you guys would think of assigning these early round more multiple years at a site.  For instance, say if you're going to have a site at Dallas you say for the next three years you guys are going to be the host of this as a way to encourage people to become maybe or institutions or conferences to be more invested in it and also to maybe grow that event in an area?</p>
