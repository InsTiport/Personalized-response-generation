<p>	Q.  You have three teams that are, as I see it, in contention for Division I seeds, being LSU, Duke and Texas that will not be hosting first- and second-round sites.  If any of those teams are No. 1 seeds, will there be any effort on the part of the committee to protect those teams by sending them to a site that maybe doesn't have a host team playing in that regional, even if it means sending them somewhat farther away or out of their, you know, traditional geographic region to do so? </p>
<p>	Q.  Good morning.  Along that line, what kind of role overall do you think that geography is going to play in placing some of these teams? </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm curious as regards to the Sunday-Tuesday format.  I just want to understand, is this a one-year kind of like experiment with this, or are they looking to make this a permanent thing now for the women's championship? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think the predetermined sites are fair to these teams like Duke and LSU and even North Carolina, a team up my way here?</p>
<p>	Q.  I guess Connecticut and other teams get to stay on their home floor; obviously, Tennessee has a chance to stay on their home floor until the Final Four, whereas in the past these teams feel like they've earned the right to this home-court advantage.  Now you're giving some a home-court advantage, and you're not giving home-court advantage to other teams like Duke who went 31 -1.</p>
<p>	Q.  Is this something you guys will tweak as you go along? </p>
<p>	Q.  Some of the coaches in the larger conferences are fearing that the committee is trying to maybe manufacture  - if that's not too strong of a word  - parity by perhaps lumping conferences together in the regionals like they did last year with Vanderbilt, Tennessee then the three Big 12 teams last year, in addition to moving some predetermined sites to places like Cincinnati, New Mexico, whatever.  Could you respond to that concern, that there's a feeling that there might be some major conference lumping again this year like there was last year? </p>
<p>	Q.  If I could quickly follow up about the integrity of the bracket, have you or anybody else on the committee maybe gone through a dry run of that to see exactly how that's looking so far? </p>
<p>	Q.  Thanks for coming on here with us.  I was just wondering what the integrity of the seeding  -- suppose you have, say, Texas as a 2 seed and they have to travel first and second round.  Now, they would have to be bracketed with a 7 and a 10 and a 15, is that correct, if you're a 2? </p>

<p>	Q.  Okay.  My question is, what if the teams that are in the sites that are available, there's no team that fits into one of those particular seedings, how do you address that?  Do you see what I'm saying?</p>
<p>	Q.  I'm hoping that you can help me get a better understanding of some of these changes that had been made.  I guess my question is more philosophical in a sense of you talked about the broader picture of women's basketball and where you're trying to take women's basketball.  A lot of people are saying you're trying to make it more like the men's game.  Can you address that.  And what are sort of the visions that maybe these decisions are being made in to  -- where are you taking this sport? </p>
<p>	Q.  What about in a situation where maybe like at a site like Oregon, if you have four teams there, and it's a difficult thing for their fans to travel to that site and you have almost no one in the stands when those four teams are playing, is that what you really are looking for?  Is this maybe a jump too soon to be taking? </p>
<p>	Q.  Right.  I'm sorry, the predetermined sites then eventually to the neutral sites.  Is this really what you're looking  -- is this a little ambitious, maybe is what I'm saying?</p>
<p>	Q.  I had a question.  I cover Texas Christian, and I covered the Conference USA tournament, and you mentioned as far as the parity in women's basketball, and especially Conference USA, it seems like it's really on the rise.  Some coaches were saying they could see five teams going into the NCAA tournament.  I was just curious about the NCAAs and how they are looking at Conference USA and what they've done over the last couple of seasons?</p>
<p>	Q.  As good as that is, does it make it harder also? </p>
<p>	Q.  A technical question.  I notice that in the official bracket for the first time since the early years that it actually shows, you know, in terms of Final Four Sunday, the regions already matched up ahead of time as opposed to deciding who might see who if they got to the Final Four in the past.  What was the thought process to restore that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Another question although it's kind of an answer, what do you see as the most difficult challenges this year?  Every year it kind of shifts a little bit.</p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering if the home sites, they're being at home, will that be a factor in their seeding?  For instance, New Mexico might be a more formidable team at home than they would if they had to travel.  Would that affect their seeding? </p>
<p>	Q.  This sort of relates to what Cathy was asking about before, about the vision for women's basketball.  I wondered what went into the decision of having a Sunday-Tuesday format for the Final Four.  And what do you think it will do for women's basketball? </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm not sure what the men's schedule is, but are the finals going head-to-head, or how is that going to work?</p>
<p>	Q.  I just wanted to ask really quickly, looking at geography in the bracket, will we see teams  -- because of predetermined sites, will we see teams go to areas perhaps that you might not have considered sending them to before? </p>
<p>	Q.  I suppose in terms of when you spoke earlier about trying to keep them within an hour time zone and that type of thing, how are the sites going to  -- will that take precedent over sending them, you know  -- for example, a team from maybe Texas going to the west coast as opposed to somewhere that might be closer? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned Cincinnati on a couple of occasions.  Just kind of looking at some of the information that's out there, it doesn't look as though they're going to be a Top 4 seed.  I'm trying to understand, given everything that you've said throughout the conference, how it advances the game if, say, Cincinnati winds up being a 6 seed  - just hypothetically speaking  - they have a 3 and 11 and a 14 coming there.  You have the potential for a 3 having to play a 6 on their home court.  Other than, again, manufacturing parity, I'm not real sure that I understand how that benefits the game.  If you could maybe explain that...</p>
<p>	Q.  So then those things in that particular situation then take a precedence or a priority over the competitive aspect of the game? </p>
<p>	Q.  So all or a lot of this then stems out of the television exposure issue then?</p>
<p>	Q.  Again, with regard to Stanford, which may be in a unique position, I don't know, they're hosting the first and second and, I believe, a regional.  Is that correct?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could the Cardinals, in a sense, stay in their arena all four games, or is this something that, in fact, probably won't happen in the format that you're discussing now? </p>
<p>	Q.  I see. </p>
<p>	Q.  Okay.  So this is the only time this can happen?</p>
<p>	Q.  Okay. </p>
<p>	Q.  Kind of along that same line, I mean, is the committee comfortable with that, that possibly three teams could have a chance to go to the Final Four playing four games at home, and would you anticipate some backlash? </p>
<p>	Q.  Again, sort of staying along this line, do you envision any scenario in which a team that will host a predetermined site would not be placed at their home site?</p>

<p>	Q.  This may be something that is too complicated, but you do have some sites, your first- and second-round sites, that are geographically very close to some of the men's first- and second-round sites.  Is there any way, for the purposes of trying to boost attendance for both, that you guys can coordinate with the men's committee and try to in some way maybe to place a team, if it's within the parameters of seeding, place a team very close to the other team and they would, maybe, you know, boost their attendance?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just too complicated?</p>
<p>	Q.  It's possible, say, Texas or of course I'm thinking of LSU since I cover them, both their teams could wind up in the Oklahoma City area, it's possible.  It would be just kind of, "Oh, look what happened." </p>
<p>	Q.  Back to this line of questioning about these teams that have the potential of playing first and second round and then hosting regionals, being on their home floors, how much thought was given to maybe not allowing these teams to be one of the predetermined sites for those first- and second-round games? </p>
<p>	Q.  Just following along this same line again, how can you say that the tournament is trying to take steps toward some sense of neutrality when you still have regionals on people's home floors and you still have this possibility of three teams potentially being able to play at home the whole time on the way to the Final Four?  I mean, I know this has happened in the past, but you made this great declaration of taking some steps to try to do it a different way, yet you're still playing regionals on people's home courts.</p>
<p>	Q.  Yet you've got future regionals within the state of Tennessee, within the State of Connecticut, I believe they're going to be going back to Albuquerque in the next few years, are you just not getting enough other people to bid for these regionals?  Are you going with what you think will be able to sell some tickets?</p>
<p>	Q.  Along this line of trying to take steps towards neutrality, can you see a point where you would ideally like to get more regional bids that aren't on someone's home floor or aren't so close to someone's fan base that you could say it's somewhat neutral? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've talked about early ticket sales.  I've been to a few of these places that are hosting regionals or sub-regionals.  They say they have maybe only sold a thousand or two.  Would you consider that a low number, a high number, maybe better than it was under the old system?</p>
<p>	Q.  Along these lines, could you get to a point like the men in terms of, say, it might be the best of both worlds, get eight teams to like a super sub-regional then mix and match where you may have different regions, geographic regions in one place, then they go into the Round of 16 for the separate geographies?</p>
<p>	Q.  One other question.  You don't hear the individual teams on these calls being discussed.  But there's been a different emphasis in some years.  Some years what you did in the regular season might help you more if you happen to stumble in the conference tournament, and other years teams get hot in conference tournaments.  How does it look this year in terms of how it's coming out in terms of the total process?</p>
