<p>	Q.  A lot of the fans took a step back when you went down with the screen towards the end of the game with fear regarding recurrent head concussions; where were you, how physically were you at that time end of that game?</p>
<p>	Q.  For any of the players, Taurasi is the national player of the year, she's got the big reputation as a clutch player, what did you think of her ability to inspire and lift her team in that comeback?</p>
<p>	Q.  Stacy, can you talk a little bit about the physical nature of the game.  A lot of pushing and a lot of shoving </p>
<p>	Q.  Nina, you had a 9-point lead, seemed to be cruising and they were missing all of their shots, what happened?</p>
<p>	Q.  To expand on the physical nature of play, in the last couple of minutes like Connecticut just seemed to get that extra rebound.  Can you tell us how difficult it was?	</p>
<p>	Q.  Nina, you played in high school all star games the last year, how does this stage compare to those games?</p>
<p>	Q.  Stacy, you were talking about the physical nature of the game, were you surprised as physical as it was that you picked up that fourth foul there, that was sort of critical near the end, the charged call on you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jody, I wonder if you would describe that last play, what happened with Alisha there at the end?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, according to the score board you had a time-out.  If did, why didn't you use it to maybe freeze the shooter, maybe use it to set up a play and why was Alisha the one at the end when she was not the focal point of the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, on Tuesday night people are going to see a matchup, the perception is these are the two premier teams, the two best known coaches, I'm just wondering if this is really good for the short or a case of the rich gets richer, and it's tougher for all of the other schools to catch them now because they are back in the spotlight again which this game.  This game will probably draw the biggest TV rating because it's known?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, if you could talk about Nina Norman's performance, a young player on a big stage?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jody, up 9 with 12 minutes to go, up 6 with 3, your defense did a lot to keep them in check in that second half and then they went on that run; at any point did you think that you had the game at hand?</p>
