Q. Since Summer League, what's kind of the last month, two months been like trying to acclimate yourself before actually having to practice and everything?
JACOB EVANS: Really just taking care of my body, trying to get in the best shape I could be in, and just getting -- making sure my living arrangements and everything off the court is fine so I can just focus on basketball.
Q. I know you'll have that moment on the court as the year progresses, but have you had that off-the-court welcome-to-the-NBA moment yet where you're like, wow, this is real, this is what I do for a living now, it's a little different from Cincinnati?
JACOB EVANS: Yeah, probably the first time KD came and played, just watching him warm up and stuff, going through his routine, shooting routine, and then playing against him in like pickup runs.  Just seeing like the level of competition just being that much higher.  I've had my welcome-to-the-NBA moment off the court, obviously.
Q. Do you see potential opportunity as a rookie here, not just going to Santa Cruz but actually getting some real playing time on this team this year?
JACOB EVANS: Yeah, especially just being in the right place on offense, keep the game simple for me, play defense, have that hard-nosed, tough mentality on defense, and just playing my IQ, playing freely and confident, I feel like there will be some minutes for me.
Q. Without having gone through it, do you have sort of -- any sort of concept, or has anybody sort of filled you in on all the things that a rookie can't know until they happen to him?
JACOB EVANS: Yeah, I tried to talk to Jordan Bell, Damian Jones, Quinn -- I just tried to talk to those guys, knowing that they were in my shoes not too long ago and just try to take any tips I can get from them guys and just put it in my back pocket and try to keep learning.
