  Stanford 92, USC 53
 Q. Just what were your emotions at the end of the game at the final buzzer?
 ALISSA PILI:   It definitely was disappointing that we lost, but I couldn't be more proud of my team and the fact that we just stayed together throughout all the adversity that we've been going through.
 You know, it's sad to end the season on a loss like this.  We're just happy that we've gotten this far.  We just remain together and just we want to work and get better for next season and prepared for that next season.
 Q. What did Stanford do well defensively that made it so difficult for you guys to hit shots today?
 ALISSA PILI:   I mean, they're a really disciplined team, I think.  I think they did a good job of just loading up when someone would drive or double teaming, helping the post when we got it down low.
 We've had better days of shooting, but I think today we just kind of struggled with making shots.
