 Q.  I guess it must be exciting to go to New Orleans now, your family is probably wishing the Hornets had never left Charlotte? 
 CEDRIC SIMMONS:  Yeah, I grew up watching the Hornets when I was younger, when they was in Charlotte and then they moved to New Orleans.  Now they are in New Orleans and Oklahoma City.  I've been a Hornets fan for a while. 

 Q.  Is New Orleans a place that you expected to go coming into the draft? 
 CEDRIC SIMMONS:  I knew I had a good chance to go there.  We run the same offense at NC State as New Orleans runs also, so I kind of know the offense already.
