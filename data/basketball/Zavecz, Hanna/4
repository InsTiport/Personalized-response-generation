<p>	Q.  This is for both of you.  Do you feel like when the game is tied a couple times late that one of those shots goes that kind of turns it around, sometimes you just need to lead to go from there?</p>

<p>	Q.  Toward the end of the game over the last five minutes, Ashley, the last shot you took was the three that rimmed out at the buzzer.  Did UNLV do anything in particular to try and limit your touches?</p>

<p>	Q.  Coach, what made the zone so effective during the first half?</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys were able to take that shot to hit the lead and they come back and make a couple three pointers.  When you talk about momentum, that's really what lifted them the last couple of minutes?</p>
<p>	Q.  Last season you won your first tournament game in the Mountain West Conference history, and it was such a step forward for the program.  I wonder if you could elaborate -- I know this isn't going to be a step backwards.  How do you approach that heading into next season with a young team?</p>
