Q. Talk about what you're going to bring to your team.
JAWUN EVANS: I'm going to bring to my team a hard worker, somebody who wants to get better.  I'm looking forward to playing with the Clippers behind Chris Paul, someone I've modeled my game after, so I'm going to learn a lot from him and just take it day by day and just work hard.
