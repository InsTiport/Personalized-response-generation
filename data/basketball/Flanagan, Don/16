<p>	Q.  Dionne, one of those games when nobody else was hitting really.  Did you feel any extra pressure because of that or did you just continue to play your game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did they get more physical in the second half trying to limit your touches?</p>
<p>	Q.  Mandi, considering the four years you have had and this season, breaking 0-26 and breaking the 0-12 at Colorado State, did you feel this would be a team of destiny to win this?</p>
<p>	Q.  How would you compare the atmosphere at the Pepsi Center having some fan support?</p>

<p>	Q.  Utah cut it to four points.  Katie came down and hit the point.  Elaine Elliott, the Utah coach, called that the dagger.  Do you feel that way?</p>
<p>	Q.  Lindsey, talk about what you want to achieve out of this NCAA tournament?  Where do you think you ought to be seeded since you won?</p>
<p>	Q.  Dionne, being a freshman on a team with upper classmen, was MVP a little more than you expected in your first conference tournament?</p>

<p>	Q.  Dionne, you haven't played much in a game, that many minutes.  Did fatigue ever come into play?</p>

<p>	Q.  Don, when nobody else is hitting, is that a lot to ask to have a freshman even though she is playing her 30th game to carry the offense for a while until somebody does start hitting?</p>
<p>	Q.  Lindsey thinks you guys might be a six seed.  What do you think about that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Let me ask you the same question I asked the players about Katie's three pointer that kind of broke a lull.  In fact, Coach Elliot went on to say it has been a trademark for you guys to make the big play all year. </p>
<p>	Q.  I think everybody has seen teams dominate back to the basket, score and kind of get stagnant.  Did you see any of that today?</p>
