<p>	Q.  Jenny, obviously this isn't the last game for you, but how does it feel to have a game like this to kind of go out on as a senior?</p>
<p>	Q.  Dionne, you got in foul trouble early and then you got in foul trouble early again.  Were you beginning to think your debut was going to have a five-minute spurt? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mandi, can you talk about the next game, either Wyoming or UNLV?  Can you talk about those match-ups and what that means for y'all?</p>

<p>	Q.  Don, is it fair to say that if you were worried about Dionne's foul trouble that Jenny pretty much took care of it?</p>
<p>	Q.  I think 24 of your 31 were from within three feet, so you obviously did a great job spacing and getting those one-on-ones.  You assumed you had match-up issues that you could exploit in there, but did it happen even better than you might have thought?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just to follow up, I believe you did go to Jana first when Dionne got her second.  Did you just feel maybe Jenny was the answer?</p>
