COACH QUENTIN HILLSMAN:   Obviously everybody who watched the game can see it was with Gatling and without Gatling.   She's an unbelievable post presence.   And she did a very good job of getting deep post position in the second half.   She just did a great job and Wes did a great job of getting the ball inside to her.   I thought we did a good job of making her taking two and three dribbles to score.   
Just give her a lot of credit.   She came up big.   Because if she doesn't do that, we win the game.   Have to give her a lot of credit and give NC State a ton of credit for just not laying down at halftime, being down and come out and played hard, and that's why they had the season they had.   They play hard and did a good job.  
As far as our kids, just really, really proud of our effort.   We have a young team and a lot of young players.   And sometimes we get a little unorganized in situations, but they keep fighting.   And that's what I like about my team.   We really compete at a high level.  
So overall I'm really happy with our effort.   Great conference tournament.   It was great to be here and obviously going home a little bit earlier, taking a whole lot of clean clothes home, so that's not good.   But just very happy to be here.   Very happy to have a chance to compete against some great teams and great coaches.  
   
 Q.   Coach, I'm sure you felt good about your team when you were up 48‑39.   It's about a 9‑minute span of clock time, and I think probably a lot longer than that in real‑time with the power outages, before Briana Day got the field goal that was the first ‑‑ I think it was about a 20‑1 run.   What took place with your team during that span?  
COACH QUENTIN HILLSMAN:   They went to their four out.   We were prepared for that.   We knew they were going to go four out and try to punch and throw the ball inside.   We really felt that we could do a pretty good job of getting Gatling out of the paint, making her take two or three dribbles to score.   I thought early she got very good deep post position and we talked about doubling at some point.   We talked about shrinking the floor.   We didn't double it, but we did shrink the floor.   
She made a lot of one catch and shoot opportunities inside.   It was more of her taking two dribbles, missing it, they get an offensive rebound.   A lot of things went wrong during the stretch.  
The biggest thing that went wrong is we didn't score.   If we continued to score being up 7 it would be a different ballgame.   
   
 Q.   As a follow‑up to Bob's question, did they change things specifically during that 25‑1 run that took things away from you?   
COACH QUENTIN HILLSMAN:   We got shots.   We got shots that we didn't make.   We did a really good job of getting to the paint, getting shots, we had 10 turnovers, we got plenty of shots.   We took 70 shots.   They took 63 shots.   We shot 26 percent, they shot 45 percent.   If we shot 40 percent I think we would win the game.   We would have stopped scoring.  
   
 Q.   Brittney, what do you hope to learn out of the ACC tournament to take to the NCAA tournament play?  
BRITTNEY SYKES:   We learned a lot from our first ACC tournament.   We enjoyed our time here.   We're in a competition in a tournament of great teams.   And to face them, I think we're well prepared going into the NCAA tournament in postseason.   
   
 Q.   Coach, you have a lot of depth, why didn't you foul Gatling more?   
COACH QUENTIN HILLSMAN:   I think you get into a situation where you look at our stat sheet and Shakeya Leary had four fouls.   And Briana Day was in the game, she had two fouls.   And as you're playing Gatling, you don't want to get into a total fouling match with her.   We could have fouled her, we could have double‑downed, we could have fronted her.   
It was really about her scoring.   I really believe that.   She had a monster second half, no doubt about that.   But it's more about us not scoring.   We don't throw the ball inside and say we just start fouling people.   
They did a very good job keeping us spaced out.   I've got to give Wes amount of credit, making sure his team understood what the game plan was the second half.   It was obvious; go four out, get her inside, throw the ball to her.   So we give her a lot of credit.   
This is not what we do, we don't just throw the ball inside and start fouling and take our best scorers off the floor and play a player that can't score at the other end.   We can't afford that.
