San Antonio   93
  Memphis ‑ 89, OT

Q.   It seemed like there was a lot of frustration and a lot of bad body language on you guys.   How did you get through that and punch your way back into the game?
MARC GASOL:   We finally got stops.   We finally got stops in the fourth quarter, and we were able to make a couple shots and got back into the game.   But when you've got to fight all the way to get back into the game, it takes a lot.   It takes a lot.   And you've got to be more‑‑ you've got to execute better down the stretch.   You've got to make‑‑ you've got to think about the game a little more both ways to beat a team like that. 

Q.   What are your thoughts now?   I'm sure you're disappointed with the loss, but do you feel like there's something you saw that makes you more confident the rest of the way as opposed to Game 1?
MARC GASOL:   Well, we played better than we played first game, even though we lost, and we were more Memphis Grizzlies.   We were more us, especially in the second half.   First half we started playing good but then we got away.   We had to scramble offensively, we started playing offense and they took advantage of that.   They ran at us, they got easy buckets, they got hot, too, from the three.   But second half I think we played more our basketball.   We shared the ball better, we moved the ball, we attacked, and of course everything works better when you make shots.

Q.   Did you feel like in the second half when you had Quincy and Jerryd and yourself and Mike and Zach in there that that unit found something offensively?
MARC GASOL:   I don't know who was on the court.   We got back into the game because we got stops.   If you don't get stops and they score 100 some points like they were on pace to do, you'd have no chance.   So you've got to get stops, get rebounds and be able to run. 
Offensively of course we can play better, of course we should play better, but if you're not getting stops, we just don't play that way.   We don't have the firepower to score 120 points against this team. 

Q.   Can you talk about the offensive rebounds?   You had a 19‑4 advantage on the offensive glass but only eight second‑chance points. 
MARC GASOL:   I'll take that.   I'll take the hustle and the effort.   They had a lot of blocked shots.   I thought some of them, everybody just tried to throw the ball up to the basket.   I think there was four or five in there that we should have brought back.   I think we had a full shot clock.   But that's just play.   Everybody is trying to score.   Everybody is trying to help the team.   I am not mad at nobody for that.   It was a good effort. 

Q.   It's still early in the series, but how crucial is getting a win in the next one?
MARC GASOL:   It's always crucial.   It's the Playoffs.   It was crucial tonight.   It was crucial first game.   Every game matters a lot.   Every game means a lot.   But you can only play one game at a time.   You cannot get too far‑‑ you cannot get too low, you cannot get too high.   You've got to play one game, that's all you can do, play next game and try to win it.   Everything else just does not matter.   There's nothing you can do about it.   You've got to play the next game, play to the fullest, be us, we're going to have our crowd behind us and we can't wait for that.

Q.   What was the most frustrating aspect of the first half to you? 
MARC GASOL:   Good question.   Good question.   They were getting easy stuff, and that always frustrates a defensive team like us.   We were breaking down too easily.   They were picking us apart, getting to the paint, driving and kicking, driving and kicking, until they found the shot they wanted to take.   A couple times they ran at us and they scored some tough baskets. 
But it's a great team.   We've got to give them credit.   They do what they do and they're really good for a reason.   But we've got to take some stuff away in order to be able to beat them.
