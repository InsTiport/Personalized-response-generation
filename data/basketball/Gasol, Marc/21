 Q.   Who is going to win the Olympics this summer?  
MARC GASOL:   Oh, it's going to be interesting.   There's going to be a lot of fights.   A lot of teams are going for the gold medal.  
   
 Q.   Is there any added pressure to stand up to the guys that won the World Cup?  
MARC GASOL:   No, I mean, we've been doing it for a long time.   We've been having that kind of pressure for quite some time, so we don't really look at it that way.   We know how hard it is to get to The Finals, much less winning the whole thing.  
   
 Q.   What about this week for you?   Is it kind of bittersweet because Pau is not here?  
MARC GASOL:   Definitely bittersweet.   I'm looking to enjoy every moment of it.   I wish Pau was here.   He knows that, because that would have made it very special.   But you know, now it's a different time.  
   
 Q.   Ricky, he has had an unbelievable season so far.   Did you expect this from him?  
MARC GASOL:   He's very talented, and what I can say, first of all, he makes his teammates better.   He makes his team a lot better, too, and he's fun to watch.   He's just going to get better and better, in my opinion.
