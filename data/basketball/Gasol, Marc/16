		  MARC GASOL:   It's always good to be home, but you know, we've got to play the game, we've got to play the way we're supposed to.   We've got to bring a lot of energy, swing as hard as we can and play the game.

Q.   How about the atmosphere with the crowd?   What can they do for you?
MARC GASOL:   Well, they've always been great.   They've always been there for us, and we know they're going to be on the game on every play.   We know that because that's how always it's been here, and we love it.

Q.   Are you surprised that the game is not a sellout yet?
MARC GASOL:   It's not? 

Q.   No. 
MARC GASOL:   I'm sure it will.   I have no doubt in my mind it will.   We're just taking our time.   I would think it would be‑‑ I thought it was sold out a week ago.

Q.   Not according to Ron. 
MARC GASOL:   Ron doesn't know much, so... sources say.   Sources say Ron doesn't know shit.   (Laughter). 

Q.   Will you be surprised if there were a lineup change just to shake things up in the 0‑2 situation? 
MARC GASOL:   I would.   I would.   But we've got to play the game.   It doesn't matter who plays more, who plays less.   We've still got to play our game and play the way we're supposed to and execute and run and be more the aggressor.

Q.   I know you always say you guys got to help Zach, but what have you learned about going up against their front line? 
MARC GASOL:   You know, they don't give you anything easy.   They don't give you one side like most teams do.   They come from the baseline, as always.   If they try to front you, they do a good job of denying the ball to the high post and come from the weak side.   They're very disciplined, and on top of that you've got to make them work, you've got to move the ball, you've got to keep them on the move all the time because if not they're going to load up and they're good at that.
