  Q. You obviously showed considerable potential as a rookie, played very well. This year you've kind of really taken it up a notch. Has the game slowed down for you even more in the second year? Were you just seeing things even better?   
 MARC GASOL: I guess you know more stuff and you try to learn from everybody you see, try to learn from better players. You always try to get better and be able to improve every year. So that was pretty much my goal this year was to get better every opportunity I could, so that's what I did.  
  
  Q. What's been the real key to the chemistry with this team because you guys are all playing well at the same time?  
 MARC GASOL: Everybody is on the same agenda and everybody is trying to point to the same direction, but that's the biggest thing we did. We all tried to go in the direction that the coaches are pointing us, which is winning.  
  
  Q. Did having Lionel Hollins for a full training camp really set a tone?  
 MARC GASOL: Definitely, definitely. We set the tone last year at the end of the season how we played, how we started to bond more together. We created something. And after that I think with Zach coming in and some rookies stepping up into the team, I think we made a pretty consistent team.
