  Q. How are you feeling?   
 MARC GASOL: I feel good. This is my first time in an All-Star Weekend and just trying to fit in. Just trying to relax a little bit. You try to rest a little bit, too, and try to get away which is hard in the All-Star Weekend.  
  
  Q. And it is Valentine's day.   
 MARC GASOL: I don't really celebrate that.   
  
  Q. Any advice from Pau how to deal with this weekend?   
 MARC GASOL: Not really. It is the All-Star Game. It is not like a real game that you must win.   
 You go out there and have fun, just try to fit in. That's about it.
