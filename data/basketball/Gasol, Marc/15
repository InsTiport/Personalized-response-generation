 Q.   Mindset coming back into Game 4?  
MARC GASOL:   Just like we always say, one game at a time.   If you look at the series before, in both series we won four in a row, so now you have no margin of error.   You've got to do it.   You can only do one game at a time.  
   
 Q.   Has this series really been about you guys needing 48 full minutes in a game?  
MARC GASOL:   Definitely.   The farther you go in, the tougher it gets and the better the teams are.   They don't gamble, they don't give you anything easy, and got to play through it.   
   
 Q.   No one has come back from 0‑3 but is there an idea that somebody is going to have to do it for the first time?  
MARC GASOL:   Yeah, the only way‑‑ it's like I said, one game at a time.   You've got to play Monday, play the best you can, try to win, come out the way we came out in the third game, but we've got to carry it on and we've got to play consistently defensively.   As soon as you give them stuff, easy stuff on the break or lay‑ups, stuff like that, they get a lot of confidence, they get the run back, and they set their defense, and it's hard to attack them.   You play good D, you're able to run at them, it's a whole different game.  
   
 Q.   How about the pride factor of not getting swept on your home court?  
MARC GASOL:   We have a lot of pride, and we don't quit.   You can try and get swept, but you've got to play as hard as you can.   We play hard.   If you look at the last two games, both went to overtime, they played better than us in both overtimes, but we fought back and we came out the way we're supposed to, and we had a lot of pride.   I don't care about the sweep and stuff like that.   But we're going to play the hardest we can and we're going to try to win like we have been doing for the whole year.
