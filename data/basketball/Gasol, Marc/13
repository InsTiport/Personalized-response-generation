		  MARC GASOL: It goes different ways.  Pau's career has gone one way.  My career has gone a different way.  We both (Inaudible)  aside from my family, South America and Europe and -- Chicago, back to -- people are happy Pau did so well.  There's a lot of people that's genuinely happy for him.  It goes beyond basketball.  It goes to where he stands as a man.Q. (Inaudible) .MARC GASOL: I've been fortunate to see how he plays, to see how he acts.  How he arrived in Memphis when we all first got there, I thought I was fortunate to see the NBA lifestyle really close.  And I had a chance to do the same thing, I had -- I knew how to look at things in a different way, try to do it my way. Hopefully we're going to be a little loose.  We've been standing around for so long.  Not going to be the normal basketball -- normal NBA routine.  I don't think it matters who wins it.  I know we both will go for it whatever we say right now.Q. Pau is obviously a more accomplished player.  Was that kind of discouraging for you?MARC GASOL: No, no.  I was really happy for him.  Every time I felt that Pau won and I was able to be in those Finals and watch him play, I felt like -- it was incredible.  I knew how he felt, how he was feeling.  I watched his face when he lost the first time.  And then to come back and do it again and win it with back-to-back.  I was just happy for him.  And I felt like i was with him in a way down there.Q. (Inaudible) .MARC GASOL: I don't look that far -- I never look that far.  I always thought about the next challenge right in front and wherever that took me I was happy with.  I took my job seriously.
