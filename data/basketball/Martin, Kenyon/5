  Q. Number one being rebound and number two being transition defense?  
 KENYON MARTIN: Be cautious of those things. Try to eliminate them. Do a better job. Guys that are starting, situations like that. Work on it and be ready for tomorrow.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 KENYON MARTIN: Going to get it back. Gotta get ready for the next one. I think the guys know that. A little frustrating the way the game went, not able to finish it out, execute. And another game tomorrow. There's a lot of things we didn't do the right way as well. So we gotta do it.  
  
  Q. Talking about rebounding.   
 KENYON MARTIN: Yes. Both teams are very talented and both teams are going to come back and give 110 percent. Whoever wins in that department, loose balls, steals, situations like that, I think they have an opportunity to win the game. We just gotta make sure we finish in those areas, especially rebounding.  
  
  Q. In the first three quarters, the Nuggets did really well, 23, something like that. What were some of the things you were doing well?  
 KENYON MARTIN: Just always having people around you. Making them take those jump shots, tough 2s, things like that. Just late in the game, I think we've got to eliminate some of the easy things late in the game. Keep them off the line as much as possible.  
  
  Q. Besides keeping them off the line, what other things defensively do you guys need to do better in the fourth quarter?  
 KENYON MARTIN: Just making sure that we don't let them play one-on-one.
