Q. All-Star Weekend, big Dunk Contest.  What's your plan?
MILES BRIDGES: I've got a lot of plans for the Dunk Contest, a lot of creativity.  I can't wait.
Q. Do you have any secrets ready?
MILES BRIDGES: I can't share that with you.  You'll have to see it in the Dunk Contest.
Q. How did you prepare last night?  Did you get more sleep?
MILES BRIDGES: I was up all day yesterday, so I'm kind of tired.  I need to get some treatment before the Dunk Contest.  I think I'll feel better if I get some treatment.
Q. Have you been working on anything for tonight for a while?
MILES BRIDGES: I really didn't start working on it until last week.  You don't have time during the NBA season.  I started working on it last week, and I feel comfortable right now.
Q. When you were growing up, did you imagine yourself doing this?
MILES BRIDGES: Yeah, for sure.  I definitely imagined myself being Vince Carter in the 2000 Dunk Contest, because he killed it.  I'm going to try to do that today.
Q. Who's your favorite dunker of all time?
MILES BRIDGES: My favorite dunker of all time is Vince Carter, for sure.
Q. Which one is your favorite one?
MILES BRIDGES: His first one in the 2000 Dunk Contest, when he threw the 360 windmill.  That's my favorite one.
Q. How about one of your favorite ones from you?
MILES BRIDGES: Myself, against the Hawks beginning of the season when Vince Carter dunked and I dunked right after him, and I did a celebration.
Q. How cool is it to have you and Kemba here together?  Obviously, you're going to work together in this Dunk Contest.  How special is it?
MILES BRIDGES: It's definitely special to have Kemba here.  I think it's good for the city of Charlotte to have me and Kemba for All-Star Weekend, just putting a good name out for the Hornets.  I feel like it will be great for us.
Q. Did you see John Collins play last night?
MILES BRIDGES: Yeah, John Collins can get up.  I was hoping he would use all his energy.
Q. How is it being at all-Star Weekend?
MILES BRIDGES: It is great just being around.  I met a lot of legends yesterday.  Being around all the NBA players, All-Stars.  It's great for the city, and it was great for me too just to be around in that environment.
Q. Did you get a chance to rest?
MILES BRIDGES: No, not really.  I was busy most of the day.  I need to get some sleep today.
