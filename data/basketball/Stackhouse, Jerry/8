  Q.  (Inaudible)?   
 JERRY STACKHOUSE:  It started off a little slow, had a great training camp and ready to go and then last day of training camp I had a little knee issue, sore right knee and missed 20-some games.   
 It was kind of hard to watch and watch the guys go on and compete knowing that I could be out there helping them, wish I could help them.   
 You know, as the season has just moved on, I did see a lot of changes.  I've seen growth between our players, our younger players watching them grow and develop during the course of the season has been great and just watching our team come together.  We had guys, I was out, Josh missed some time, Devin missed some time and it seemed like the end of the season it all seemed to come together at the right time.   
 It's divine intervention -- we've got a lot of spiritual guys on this team and I think because of that factor, that's why, you know, God has a plan for us and I'm just happy that it's happened.   
  Q.  (Inaudible)?   
 JERRY STACKHOUSE:  You know, like I said, God put him here in the right place at the right time.  He could have maybe went and still been a good coach on another team or maybe not as -- had the level of success that -- but I think that because of the type of person he is, the character that he represents, that good things happen for you it.  May not happen exactly when you want it to, but I think the same in my situation.   
 As players come to this league, you want it to happen right now, you want it to happen then.  I came to Philadelphia in '95 and -- but staying the course, I think, and believing in in yourself and believing in your ability, I think that's what Avery has, and all of a sudden, here he is.  He won a championship in San Antonio, played on two other teams after that.  You know, he just kept going and.   
 You know, his ability to relate to all 15 guys, all of these guys and what they bring to the table is an important part of why we're here.  Without the things that he does and what he brings to the table, without them, we wouldn't be here.   
  Q.  How does it make you feel when all of the other guys look to you as a veteran?   
 JERRY STACKHOUSE:  It makes you feel good, all of those guys, Josh Howard, Josh Powell, come in here, start talking to them a little bit, we really got serious about basketball.  They are fortunate, they have been to teams that have won 50-plus games and been to the playoffs.  They haven't haven't seen the side of, you know, starting to shift cars in April.   
 But I think that that's my job to make sure that they don't take that for granted and really understand the situation that they have been blessed with.   
  Q.  Do you think the tempo this series will be a lot like San Antonio, more of a halfcourt game?   
 JERRY STACKHOUSE:  I hope not.  I think hopefully the onus will be on us to try to force it a little bit.  I think people underestimate the fact that Miami is a team that likes to get out a little bit, too.  When Wade gets the rebound or Shaq gets the rebound, he's looking up to try to get them some easy opportunities, too.   
 So hopefully the fact that we played Phoenix and the way we were able to handle their fast break, hopefully this is a team that doesn't run anywhere near as hard as them, defense will not be a topic of conversation for us in this series hopefully.
