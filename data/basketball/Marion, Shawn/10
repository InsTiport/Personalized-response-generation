  Q.  Your mother is helping to build a house this weekend with Habitat For Humanity.  Are you impressed with her carpentry skills?   
 SHAWN MARION:  She's talented.  She's always been a hard worker.  I guess that's where I get some of my working skills from.   
 But she loves doing stuff like that and I do, too.   
  
  Q.  Is there any pressure for you this weekend being a former UNLV star?   
 SHAWN MARION:  No, not at all.  I think it's an honor and a privilege.  I played my college ball here after I transferred, but to just come back and represent UNLV, I think I'm holding it down real strong for them.
