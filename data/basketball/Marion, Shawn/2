  Q. How are you feeling?   
 SHAWN MARION: I'm feeling all right. Minor aches and pains.   
  
  Q. Your limp says otherwise.   
 SHAWN MARION: It's a little tight right now.   
  
  Q. Why have you guys been able to defensively frustrate LeBron?   
 SHAWN MARION: We collectively as a team we're doing a good job of helping each other and communicating and keeping guys uncomfortable. When you make guys uncomfortable out there, it's a little more harder.   
  
  Q. Is it weird to see him struggle? I'm guessing it brings a smile to your face, but is it kind of strange?   
 SHAWN MARION: I don't even know right now. We are just trying to make sure we do what we have to do to win games.   
  
  Q. Six times in the playoffs you guys have trailed in the fourth and come back to win. 21-9 run last night. Why are you guys able to do that?   
 SHAWN MARION: I don't know. We're a resilient team. We're focused. We go out there and we play till the end. The game is not over until the final buzzer sounds. That's the way we play. At the end of the day, that's all you need.   
  
  Q. LeBron's struggles, how much of that had to do with the defense?   
 SHAWN MARION: Our team defense collectively are doing a good job. (Indiscernible) we're going to give up something, but as long as we make them jumpshots and try to keep them off the free-throw line, we're doing a good job.
