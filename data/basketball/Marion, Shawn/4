  Q. (Indiscernible).   
 SHAWN MARION: At the same time, it's not the ultimate goal. It didn't matter, good things were going to happen. We have to play ball. We have to take advantage of a lot of things. We have to take advantage of it. We only did it for maybe a minute or two. It happened in Game 1.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).   
 SHAWN MARION: We got to take advantage. Come out in a quick spurt. We haven't even done that in practice. A few days off, the shots are going to be there. At the same time we have to play ball. We can't worry about -- we have to go out there and play (Indiscernible).  
  
  Q. How does it change things for you if Haywood can't go at all in Game 3?   
 SHAWN MARION: We have to step up. It's their time. We have to be ready. We might use Brian or something. I don't know. We have guys ready to play. They have to step up and be ready to play.   
  
  Q. Between Games 1 and 2, you guys made the adjustment and were better on the boards. The turnovers, you were able to fix that problem in the fourth quarter. How key was that to realize, we're giving this ball away too much and clamp down?   
 SHAWN MARION: As I said before, a lot of our turnovers were our turnovers. They weren't forced turnovers. If you cut down on that -- I think they scored 31 points on turnovers that game, if you cut that down in half, it's 15 points. 15 points is a big difference. We watched our turnovers in the game and we watched the ones that were unforced and we watched the ones that were forced. They're really good at checking the passing lanes and getting deflections. You have to make sure you pass a lot and create something, you see the person and sometimes it fumbles. We have to take care of that and we should be okay.
