  Q. What is the danger there for them if they double-team Dirk?   
 SHAWN MARION: It's a lot of things. (Indiscernible) it's about picking them apart when they do, we have to make sure they pay.   
  
  Q. You played for the Miami organization. This team was very different when you were here. What is the feeling that you are dealing with going against an organization that you did play for?   
 SHAWN MARION: Well, you know, I was here for my stint, one year. When I was playing, 2005-06, in the hallways, if you're not around, you don't know what happened. I know what it feels like. I was here watching them. We (with Phoenix) had gotten beat by the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals that year. Of course I'm here playing now. It's a different feeling for me.   
  
  Q. When you were here, the wheels were in motion as far as what they did last summer. You were part of the trade to Toronto. Did you get the feeling then that everything they were doing then was all about two years from now?   
 SHAWN MARION: This is a business. Things happen. Who am I to say what's about to happen? You make trades and have free agents. At the same time, Chris and LeBron, bring back D-Wade, of course. It's worked for them. (Indiscernible).  
 Talking about the Mavericks right now, we're in the NBA Finals as well. We've done a great job of getting here. With all the naysayers and everything else.   
  
  Q. You and Dwyane are neighbors in Chicago now. Can you put that aside right now?   
 SHAWN MARION: Yes. It's all business now. We're competitors. We separate being friends and going out and being enemies on the floor. We have respect for each other. When we get on the floor, it's the Miami Heat against the Dallas Mavericks.
