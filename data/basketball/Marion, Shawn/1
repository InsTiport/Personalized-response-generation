  Q. Did you all watch that video of LeBron and Dwyane walking around at shoot-around the other day coughing and stuff?   
 SHAWN MARION: No, we didn't watch that video of it. I seen it on TV this morning. It's nothing.   
  
  Q. Any thoughts?   
 SHAWN MARION: Not at all.   
  
  Q. Do you think Dirk cares about that stuff?   
 SHAWN MARION: It's nothing. We know the bigger picture this year. And that's all that matters?   
  
  Q. You all have your own motivation?   
 SHAWN MARION: That's it.   
  
  Q. Shawn, you have been playing great defense on LeBron James, and overall having a great series. Basically we can expect LeBron to have a big game, this Game 6 here at home. What do you do differently now on him defensively as you have been?   
 SHAWN MARION: It's a collective thing we're doing. We're helping each other as a team. Individually we're taking the challenge when we need to. At the same time, it doesn't matter. All we keep doing is executing the same game plan we have set in stone. We're going to be fine.   
  
  Q. Talk about the way you've been able to close out games.   
 SHAWN MARION: Well, I think everybody knows we're a resilient team. In their head or not, it doesn't matter. We know what we're capable of. We know what we want to accomplish. So at the same time we are staying focused and we're just staying on plan, and the game is not over until the final buzzer sounds. That's been our mojo the whole season. That's why we're staying active and staying aggressive.   
  
  Q. Is it tough not to look at the big picture, one win away? It's been your dream.   
 SHAWN MARION: It's not difficult at all. We know what to expect. We got to be aggressive on both ends. We got to go out there and we know it's going to be loud in here tomorrow night. We have to come ready to play.
