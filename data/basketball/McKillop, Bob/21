Marquette  Â– 59
  Davidson - 58

THE MODERATOR:   Thank you for joining us, ladies and gentlemen.   Davidson will go first in the post game.   We will begin the news conference with an opening statement by Coach Bob McKillop and have questions for the student-athletes.
Coach McKillop.
COACH MCKILLOP:   Our guys gave us a sensational season, and they emptied their tank today.   They played 40 minutes as competitively and as passionately as any coach to ever want.
Credit Marquette, they made three big plays down the stretch and they earned that victory.
THE MODERATOR:   All right.   We'll ask for questions for the student-athletes.   We have Nik Cochran and Jake Cohen.

Q.   Jake, please just describe the last minute or so of the game and what you saw.
JAKE COHEN:   Well, we felt comfortable with our lead and we knew they were going to try to get some 3s up, and for the most part I think we did a pretty good job defending them.   They just made really big shots when they had to.   And down the stretch, our game plan is get the ball to this guy, the best free throw shooter in the country, and for the most part we did that, but ten seconds left, Da'Mon threw it a little too far.   That's how it goes sometimes.

Q.   Jake, how should Davidson have defended that last play by Vander Blue?
JAKE COHEN:   I'm not sure.   I got switched and he got by me.   Hindsight is 20/20.   It's real easy to look back at it now, draw up something different, but he made a good play and made a big shot.
THE MODERATOR:   Any other questions for the student-athletes?

Q.   Going into the last four, five minutes, was getting time off the clock sort of a priority on your possessions?   Because it seemed like a lot of the time you waited until there was ten seconds before you put one up.
NIK COCHRAN:   No, we don't necessarily look at it like that.   We want to keep attacking if we can.   We're not going to look to get up a quick shot.   I wouldn't say it was a priority of ours, but again, we're not going to take a quick one.
THE MODERATOR:   Any others for the student-athletes?

Q.   The last shot, can you just describe a little bit about what the feeling is like when you see it fall through for each one of you guys?
JAKE COHEN:   You can tell by our faces we're not to happy about it.   It's just devastating.
NIK COCHRAN:   There's -- there was.   We realized we had one second left on the clock and had another chance.   We got to regroup.
THE MODERATOR:   Anything else?   Okay.   Thank you very much.   Nik and Jake, thanks for coming.
Now we'll follow up with questions for Coach McKillop.

Q.   Bob, the officials had to check the monitor obviously to get the time from 5.5 to 6.7 but it did give Marquette sort of an unofficial timeout.   How do you view that kind a situation where they get time to actually collect themselves and draw up something?
COACH MCKILLOP:   Unfair advantage.   We certainly knew they didn't have a timeout and that's why we didn't call a timeout there when they made that 3 because they didn't have one.   We got it into Jake, a great foul shooter, De'Mon, normally a great foul shooter, and thought we could get it to Nik.   So, we knew they didn't have a timeout and there's not much we can do about that.

Q.   Coach, what did you tell the guys during that timeout about how to defend that last play?
COACH MCKILLOP:   We wanted to make him catch the ball going away from their basket.   We were going the switch every screen.   We thought they were going to go to the ball screen and into the alley and try to score, and that's what they did. 
And I think Jake -- I didn't see a replay of it, but he went up, challenged it and he's blocked that shot in the past.

Q.   Coach, pretty devastating way to end the season.   What did you tell your players immediately afterward?
COACH MCKILLOP:   How proud I was of what they accomplished this entire year and how much they played, how hard they played today and how well they represented us and what a joy it was to coach them.
THE MODERATOR:   Any other questions?

Q.   Coach, can you just talk about the multiple 3-pointers Marquette had?   I think they had four in the game but the three right in a row there.
COACH MCKILLOP:   You know, they ran a ball screen to get the other one.   We switched.   We switched and I thought the kid made great shots.   I'd like to see the replay, but they were just great shots and they had to make great plays to beat us and I thought they did.

Q.   Can you talk about your seniors?
COACH MCKILLOP:   They had a magnificent career, all four of them.   Wonderful to see Clint Mann get a chance to participate in this his final game.   They got better and better as their careers progressed, and here we were five seconds, six seconds away from advancing in the NCAA Tournament, and that's the mark of terrific players, when they get better and better as they go through their career.
THE MODERATOR:   Any other questions for Coach McKillop?   All right.   Thank you, Coach.   Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
