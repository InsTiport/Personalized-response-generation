Davidson 78, Saint Louis 60
BOB McKILLOP: Absolutely thrilled with our performance to it into.  I thought we executed remarkably well.  You look at our shooting percentage and it's an indication of that.  I think our turnover ratio indicates that, as well.  Making shots clearly helps, and Travis Ford does a really great job of switching his defenses and mixing his defenses and we don't make shots, we're in a lot of trouble today.  So making shots really saved the game for us.
Q. The double-bye can affect teams at times.  What did you maybe make an emphasis on?
BOB McKILLOP: Believe me, I understand that dynamic very well; coming from a southern conference where we consistently did receive a bye, and it's kind of a new experience for us to get a double-bye here in the A-10.
We just focused on getting better, and Saint Louis had our attention.  They had our attention because they played us such a tight game January 2 or 3 or whenever we played them, it was a three-point game and they hit a shot at the buzzer that could have tied it.  So they had our attention because how good they are.
Q. What did you emphasize from that last meeting, that your maybe learned from them?
BOB McKILLOP: Patience and poise with the basketball.  The last time we gave them 15, 20 points on turnovers, and tonight, points off turnover was 22-4 in our favor.
