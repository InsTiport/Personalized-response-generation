Notre Dame 88, Purdue 80
MIKE BREY: What an afternoon of growth for our game.  I'm really proud of our team.  We were heartbroken in Los Angeles the other night.  To finish the way we did, I thought we put two halves of offense together.  We haven't been able to do that in the last three games away from our building.  So many guys in new roles made big plays in a big game, in a big atmosphere.  I feel we can grow off of it.
This guy to my right continues to look like one of the best frontline players in the ACC.  He's just getting better and better and better.
Going to do a little MRI next week.  So we don't know.  That's the one thing that's really sad because he was fabulous.  He jump-started us with his play making.  You know, it didn't look good.
Q. (No microphone.)
MIKE BREY: I thought we swung the ball and moved the ball better.  We didn't hold it.  We have a tendency sometimes after three passes to hold it or ball screen too early.  I thought we got post touches to Johnny and Juwan.  That helps our offense.  I think we had 20 assists today, which that's a little bit of how we play offensively.
But I actually felt even with the second halves last week, the three days of practice this week, we were finding our flow offensively.  We did it for 40 minutes tonight, which is something to build on.
Q. (No microphone.)
MIKE BREY: No question.  Whew.  This is huge for us.  Again, we lost to two good teams away from our building in Oklahoma and UCLA.  If you get out of this stretch 0-3, you're digging out of a hole for a while.
But this is a quality win for us.  Purdue is going to have a heck of a year, especially when they get into the Big Ten.  For us, are there must wins in December?  We certainly were staring at one probably today.
Q. (No microphone.)
MIKE BREY: Yeah, we were moving good.  I think, again, it's something to look at.  But I think we've been trending that way.  I think we've been trending better offensively.  Starting with the DePaul game, up to UCLA, it's been second half offense.  We haven't been able to do it for 40.
Today we got out of the gate, played good offense, smart offense, for 40 minutes, close to 40.
Q. (No microphone.)
MIKE BREY: Big-time.  He's one fearless guy.  As you can see, we're really, really confident in him.  He has been coming in there early.  We even downshift our lineup and put him in there as the four man.
He is a fearless winner.  For him, he's got to be even more confident after this afternoon.
Q. (No microphone.)
JOHN MOONEY: Yeah, it's huge.  I think every time since I've been here we came -- we've been up at half by about 10, then we've kind of let it get away from us in the second half.  Kind of a similar situation today.
But we closed it out.  Like Coach said, they're a great team.  That's definitely big for us.  Hopefully we can keep trending upwards.
Q. (No microphone.)
JOHN MOONEY: Yeah, just guys making plays.  We're kind of a younger group right now.  With time, down the stretch, the last five minutes, guys are going too start making plays, like we did today.  Made free throws, made some big shots, got key stops.  That's definitely good.  Hopefully we can use that as momentum moving forward.
Q. (No microphone.)
JOHN MOONEY: Yeah, just moving the ball.  Our guards were really good today.  Especially Rex, T.J., Prentiss setting the tone, finding us.  I think Rex had 10 assists, which is insane.  They're doing great.  Starts with them moving the ball.  I think we did that today.  So that's something to build on, too.
Q. (No microphone.)
JOHN MOONEY: No, I don't think so.  We're a confident group.  From 1 to 12, everyone kind of believes in each other, believes in themselves.  We're a confident group.
Yeah, they did kind of get it close there.  It's just a matter of getting the guys together, calming everyone down, taking a deep breath, just playing.  We did that.
Q. (No microphone.)
MIKE BREY: Yeah, you know, I think it's been a hallmark of our program, that we've been able to make big free throws.  We went through a stretch in some of our home games where we didn't shoot it as well.  I just always felt that would be a great weapon for us.  To make game pressure free throws, different guys do it in the last couple minutes, is I think something that will help all guys' confidence, young guys especially.
Thank you.
