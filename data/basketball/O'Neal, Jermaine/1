  Q.  You've been an All-Star before, does it have a different feel because it's in Vegas?   
 JERMAINE O'NEAL:  It does.  It's funny, because guys were talking about it last year, about this year's All-Star Game.  I think a lot of the guys are really excited about being here.   
  
  Q.  How has the adjustment gone after the big trade with Golden State?   
 JERMAINE O'NEAL:  It's coming along.  I think the biggest thing with Troy (Murphy) and Mike (Dunleavey) trying to fit in -- I think the biggest thing was trying to fit in, instead of just coming in and doing what they do.   
 And I told those guys about a week ago, actually, that we just needed them to play their game and not try to fit in and be passive about shooting, just do what you do.  But I think once we got our feet stable, which I think we're very, very close to doing, we should be able to make a run at the Eastern Conference.   
  
  Q.  Do you think that you guys needed this break?   
 JERMAINE O'NEAL:  As a team, no, I think it might have hurt us a little bit because we were just starting to gel together.  But physically we have some guys that are really banged up and I think it came at a perfect time.   
  
  Q.  Who's leading in your MVP race right now?   
 JERMAINE O'NEAL:  I would say Dirk, Dirk Nowitzki is the leader, because their team has been phenomenal all year.  Steve Nash has been phenomenal all year.  Gilbert Arenas has taken his team to another level.  And I'm going to go with Detroit with either Rick Hamilton or Chauncey Phillips.
