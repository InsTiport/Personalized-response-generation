Minnesota Lynx ‑ 86, 
  Atlanta Dream ‑ 77 

Q.   Talk to me about rebounding.   Obviously it was an emphasis, and tonight for the first time of the series you guys took control of the boards early.   Talk about that priority for you. 
TIFFANY HAYES:   It's always a priority for us.   We just crash the boards, try to get in there when we can.

Q.   Did you have any different matchups tonight that you tried to exploit, that you tried to take advantage of?
TIFFANY HAYES:   No, I mean, we just got the ball into E, like we always do.   She did her thing every time she touched the ball.   That was one of the good things that was happening for us.

Q.   Talk about momentum, late first half you guys just about take a lead and you're playing obviously possession for possession.   Talk about what you did to get so close. 
TIFFANY HAYES:   We played our game, and I think it was evenly called both ways, and we were able to stay within distance of them, and like I said, we were always fighting.   Everyone expected us to give up, but we kept fighting, and I think it definitely showed in this game. 

Q.   Any thoughts about the Minnesota Lynx?
TIFFANY HAYES:   They're a good team.   They're a good team on their own, so they have a lot of weapons, and that's about it.
