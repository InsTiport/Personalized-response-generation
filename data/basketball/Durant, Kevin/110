Q.   You're going to get a chance to play alongside Kevin Love this weekend.   Talk about what he brings to the court.
KEVIN DURANT:   Well, I've known Kevin since we were in high school.   The great thing about it is he's the same player as he was then.   He's gotten better, as far as who he is on the court, he rebounds the basketball, his shooting abilities.   I had an opportunity to play alongside him in USA.   He's a great teammate, as well.   I'm looking forward to having fun with him.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
KEVIN DURANT:   Yeah, we played him in the second game of the year.   They do a great job, man.   Ricky Rubio is great alongside K Love, and Coach Adelman is a great coach, as well.   They have a lot of great people, man.   It reminds me of us when we were‑‑ like two years ago we made the playoffs for the first time.   Our division is tough, man, and going through Minnesota is going to be tough.

Q.   A busy weekend for you.   You coach tonight in the celebrity game, three‑point shooting and then play in the game.   What are you looking forward to the most?
KEVIN DURANT:   I always look forward to playing in the game.   As a kid the only thing you really see is the game.   That's the thing I was dreaming about, coming to this league and being an All‑Star.   It's exciting to be in all the other festivities, as well, the Three‑Point Contest and coaching tonight.   So I'm just trying to soak it all in and have fun.

Q.   Talk about your new movie coming out.
KEVIN DURANT:   It's going to be a cool movie, man, stepping outside the box a little bit.   It's something I don't normally do.   But it was fun.   I'm glad I did it.
