		   THE MODERATOR: If you wouldn't mind making a comment, each of you, playing in tonight's game.
 RODNEY STUCKEY: It is an honor to be here. This is the first time I experienced something like this. I didn't come last year. Just to play with all the guys in the future NBA All-Stars. Like I said in our interviews, we wanted to win.
 KEVIN DURANT: First off, I'm blessed to be in this position, being a part of this game and also represent my family, myself and Oklahoma City. 
 I'm just happy to play with these guys I came in with, and we had a lot of fun.

 Q. Kevin, what was it like? It looked like you were just having a lot of fun. Was it competitive at the end? They made a push. 
 KEVIN DURANT: It definitely was competitive I think the whole second half. We said we wanted to have a better defensive effort, which we did. We came back. 
 It was a lot of fun. It was a great opportunity, a great experience. 

 Q. Are you going to wear the shoes again? 
 KEVIN DURANT: Unfortunately, I can't.
