 Q. What do you look forward to about this game?
 KEVIN DURANT: Just coming out and enjoying your break, it is going to be great to play with some of the players you came in the draft with. That will be exciting. It is one of the bigger stages. We just do want to do it justice by coming out and playing hard.

 Q. Where did you get those sneakers? 
 KEVIN DURANT: These are All-Star edition. It is what I wear in the game, just different color. I love them. 
 We are just going to come out and play hard. We drafted up a couple defensive assignments and hopefully we come out with a win.
