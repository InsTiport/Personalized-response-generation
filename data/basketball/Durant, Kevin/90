Q.   Is he the best point guard in the league or who do you think holds that title?
KEVIN DURANT:   Well, I'm biased.   I think he's the best. 

Q.   Do you think that relationship is symbiotic?   You think you guys compliment each other almost perfectly?
KEVIN DURANT:   Yeah, I think we do.   We won a lot of games.   I like where we're going right now.   We're moving in the right direction. 

Q.   (Inaudible). 
KEVIN DURANT:   I never liked to be singled out.   I'm with 14 guys, and I try and shy away from this. 

Q.   (Inaudible). 
KEVIN DURANT:   It's respect, but it's sometimes about the story.   The voters love sports.   If I weren't in sports, it would be something that I really enjoy. 

Q.   How much time do you invest in the offseason skills and drills that helps you do what you do best in the league?
KEVIN DURANT:   That's my whole summer, just trying to find out ways to get better, whether it's bike riding, whether it's ‑‑ just trying to find ways to challenge myself.   I've been working on drills, ball‑handling since I was eight years old.   That's all I did is work out.   Trying to find ways to continue and get better.   Every summer, the offseason, that's my job.   I dedicate all my time to it.

Q.   How about being one of the guys tonight watching the Dunk Contest and watching Russ in the Skills Contest?
KEVIN DURANT:   I'm looking forward to it.   It's going to be fun.
