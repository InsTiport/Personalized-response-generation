  Q. Can you guys run more at home? Do you need to run more consistently at home?  
 KEVIN DURANT: We didn't get any stops in the first quarter, but after that we seemed to get a little bit of fast break points. Those guys did a great job of making shots and putting pressure on them, so we've got to just try to make it tough on them on the defensive end and just get rebounds and get some easy buckets.   
  
  Q. If they push you and exhaust you all the time how do you not let it affect you?  
 KEVIN DURANT: I try not to let it affect me. I get upset a little bit and it kind of sticks on my game a little bit, but I know that no matter what I've just got to play through it, especially if we're in the bonus and shooting free throws. It's all about pushing through it. That's something I've learned to play through.
