 Q.   What's it like for you to be here with Reggie and Steve and the coaching staff?  
KEVIN DURANT:   It's always good to see a familiar face on Allâ€‘Star weekend.   It's good for our organization, good for our city, and I'm looking forward to watching Steve tonight and watching Reggie tomorrow night and looking forward to representing it well on Sunday night.   
   
 Q.   What do you do in your free time in New Orleans?   Do you get together with other guys from other teams?  
KEVIN DURANT:   It's a lot of obligations that we got to attend to, so we just try to get it out of the way and we talk if we see each other, but I don't know about the going out and partying and eating, but we keep it cordial.   But there's a lot of stuff we have to do as well.   
   
 Q.   If you had the Four Horsemen on Mount Rushmore, who would you put up there?  
KEVIN DURANT:   If I had four it would be Michael, Larry, Magic, Kareem.
