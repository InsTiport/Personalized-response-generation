  Q. I know this is a tough loss, but you've got a game on Wednesday. How do you move on? How do you put this behind you?  
 KEVIN DURANT: Just be positive. Like you said, it's not over yet. We have a game on Wednesday, so -- we won in there before, so we've got to try to do it again.  
  
  Q. What's your explanation for what happened the last five minutes after you guys got up 15? What do you think happened?   
 KEVIN DURANT: They made shots, we didn't. Dirk Nowitzki was great, making threes and contested jump shots, and they played great defense. We lost.   
  
  Q. I was going to ask you to describe the shot that you put up that I guess Marion got a hand on. The shot was taken a little bit early, but there were really no other options. Could you walk us through that?  
 KEVIN DURANT: I didn't have anything else to do. I caught the ball almost at the half court line, seen three Mavericks in front of me and had three seconds on the clock. I didn't know what else to do. I tried to get a shot up. I didn't want to run into their defense and get another turnover. I didn't know what else to do. He played good D.  
  
  Q. We asked Scott if you think that the youth of your team got in the way at the end with turnovers, missed shots. When they started their comeback, were you guys unable to stop what they were doing?  
 KEVIN DURANT: This is basketball, man. Our youth has nothing to do with what we were doing on the floor right now. We've showed we can play on this level. They played good defense, man. We missed some shots. Our youth has nothing to do with it.   
  
  Q. I know this is a very tough loss for you, and you played so hard and so well. What's it like for you to be in a zone like you were in tonight, where instead of making big plays and making huge shots at the end, you were turning it over and missing huge shots?   
 KEVIN DURANT: Like you said, I was trying to play with so much force and play so hard. You know, early on I was getting the ball where I wanted to, and they were just playing straight-up defense. But later on I got the ball where I wanted to and I seen three or four guys around me and I had to make a pass, some passes were tipped, some passes I got offensive foul. A few of those, my swipe move, I didn't get the foul, and I got turnovers.   
 You know, late in the game, that's my timing. A few of those times it was just too clogged up. I didn't want to force a bad shot. I wanted to pass to my teammates. I believe in my teammates. I trust in them, but we just weren't making shots and they were.  
  
  Q. It was a little bit hard to lose today, but you were playing here at home and the fans stayed with you the whole time. Could you talk a little bit about the fans and what they meant in this game for you?  
 KEVIN DURANT: It's such a blessing to have great fans because they could have easily just walked out on us. You know, we were up 14, 15, five, six minutes to go. They could have -- they stuck with us when we were on our way back. They didn't boo or nothing.   
 Just having fans like that behind us means the world to us, and I feel upset because I think I let them down. I let the city down. I just want to come back next game and play even harder. I think I played hard tonight but push it up another level for these fans and try to bring it back here to OKC.
