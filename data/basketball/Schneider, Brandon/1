 Q. Coach, talk about the constant fight that your team has shown throughout the course of year. A lot of up and downs, but you guys just always seem to pull through the tough moments despite the adversity.
 BRANDON SCHNEIDER:   Yeah, I think that's what's the most encouraging thing about our young team is we played with a lot of freshman, sophomores, and a lot of adversity this year as a result of the pandemic. We had a lot of people playing out of position, but I think their constant fight and faith in one another -- even being down I think today what was 10, maybe with three minutes to play -- they found another gear.
 I just think that it speaks a lot to their character as young women, their loyalty to one another and to the program, and I know I'm excited about what the future holds for this bunch.
