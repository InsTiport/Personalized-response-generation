Q. What does this say about your team?

ALONZO MOURNING:  I've said this since day one, we're a very resilient team.  One thing about this team, we're very confident in the guys that come off the bench.  I trust any of the guys that come off that bench, they're going to come in and get the job done.  We've said this since day one since the playoffs started, we're going to need contributions from anybody.  Everybody has to be ready at any given moment, and we've proven that thus far throughout the playoffs.  Yes, we need plays from D. Wade, we need plays from Shaq, we need plays on defense.  But you ask Stan, when he turns to that bench, he knows that guys are going to produce because we know what's at stake.  I think we've seen the growth of our bench as the playoffs have progressed.  Guys were forced to step up, so I'm very confident in 1 through 12.  I know that regardless of what the situation is, we have enough in our arsenal to go to it and to get it done.

Q.  Why do you think a lot of people have been saying, "oh, yeah, Dwyane" --

ALONZO MOURNING:  I don't care what they're saying.
