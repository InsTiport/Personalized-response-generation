Q.  What was the difference with Dwyane's absence?

UDONIS HASLEM:  It was a lot of things, we missed Dwyane tonight, but just a lot of turnovers, you can see the errors.  We didn't play a complete game tonight.  Give credit to Detroit.  We're not going to take anything away from those guys.  They played a great game. 

Q.  Dwyane said he wanted to play and talked to the medical staff and was overruled, and he didn't argue, but how close was the decision, and how did you guys feel once you found out he was not playing? 

UDONIS HASLEM:  Just got to move on.  Obviously lost our one-, two-punch, but just go play the game. 

Q.  What about Game 7, are you confident he'll be playing?

UDONIS HASLEM:  I hope so.  The medical staff, they will try to get him ready and hopefully he'll be able to help us. 

ALONZO MOURNING:  We've got a game on Monday.  Just that's just going to decide everything.  It's really going to show a lot.  It's going to expose; anybody that steps into that arena that's not ready, it's going to expose.

Q.  How do you make sure that you guys are ready? 

ALONZO MOURNING:  Just knowing that it's a Game 7, I mean, that's enough. 

Q.  What are the most important things to do?

ALONZO MOURNING:  Play a lot better than we did.  Show up.  Just show up. 

Q.  Is there anything that you guys -- do you feel that you showed up tonight?

ALONZO MOURNING:  Didn't look like it, did it?
