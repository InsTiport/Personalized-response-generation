<p>	Q.  Zo, your defense was outstanding tonight.  Can you talk little about it? </p>
<p>	Q.  What you see when Dwyane went down? </p>
<p>	Q. When Dwyane got hurt, puts you in there a little bit more, do you have a different mind set knowing that you may be in there for the rest of the way and you don't know if he's coming back.</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about those two shots you hit, you hit the fade-away, and the one you beat the buzzer on; what kind of a charge does that give you personally to hit those shots?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you see the shot clock and the jumper with Chauncey? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk a little about this position right now, 3-2, obviously you've got to get one more win but because you know you can win in Detroit.  Is there any more comfortable feeling knowing that you've closed out on the road before?</p>
<p>	Q.  What was different, your intensity and energy as a team? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about how the finger is, double-double tonight, there was a finger roll on the left hand to the basket; so you're fighting through the pain. </p>
<p>	Q.  There was a fist-pump in there at the end as you were getting more dominant opportunities on the board, as you were pulling them down and getting offensive rebounds back in as well, was that a focus coming in due to the speed of Detroit and their domination with second-chance points from Game 4?</p>
<p>	Q.  You were not alone in the energy and effort that changed from Game 4 and Game 5.  Talk about Shaquille coming out and DJ playing on both ends of the floor?</p>
