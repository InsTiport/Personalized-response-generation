<p>	Q.  Deron, as you look at Louisville, scout them, do they look a mirror image of you with three guys on the perimeter? </p>
<p>	Q.  Luther, can you talk about as the run has gone on, if at all, has your coach changed, what you see in him as he's gotten to this first Final Four as a coach, person, and how he's acted towards you guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  Luther and Deron, is this Final Four going to turn into a 3-point shooting contest?  If it does, do you like your chances? </p>

<p>	Q.  Do any of you do a good impersonation of your coach?  Do you ever joke about his voice? </p>

<p>	Q.  Deron, I wonder how important turnovers might wind up being in this game. </p>
<p>	Q.  Deron, they've played a lot of zone.  Can you assess their zone, what they do well with it, does their length make it difficult? </p>
<p>	Q.  Looking around town, there's a lot of Illinois fans in town.  What does it mean to you to have so much support from so close by for this weekend? </p>

<p>	Q.  Earlier the Louisville players and coach indicated the inside game may be as important as the guard play.  Roger and Jack, your thoughts on your importance in the game tomorrow night? </p>

<p>	Q.  Can you talk about your Final Four experience so far, including last night's NCAA presentation. </p>
<p>	Q.  Luther, how is your hamstring?  It's been a few weeks since Bruce's mom has died.  Can you talk about what, if any, effect that's had on you, how important his family has been to you? </p>

<p>	Q.  Did you guys have to learn to be unselfish?  Did the coach pound it into you?  Did you come about it naturally? </p>
<p>	Q.  Roger and Deron, you are predominantly juniors and seniors.  What is the biggest impact that that experience brings to this club? </p>

<p>	Q.  Deron, what do you think of the movement to maybe move back the three-point line in college basketball? </p>

<p>	Q.  You had said last week that the pressure on your team to get here was fairly stifling.  Now that you're here and you've seen St. Louis and you've qualified for the Final Four, do you feel that your team is going to relax and play maybe even better than it has in the tournament so far? </p>
<p>	Q.  Because you've had to live being No. 1 all year, were one shot away from being undefeated, how big of a disappointment would it be not to finish off your goal?  Everyone's happy to be at the Final Four, but you're almost a special case considering you've been the top dog for so long. </p>
<p>	Q.  The way that you play, the way Louisville plays with three perimeter guys, bigs who can go out and shoot, is that a trend in college basketball, is it an outgrowth of the young kids that are big enough that immediately they go to the NBA? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about how you've been able to share this Final Four experience with Gene Keady?  I know he's been to a couple awards breakfasts with you.  What other things have you done to give him the experience that he never got? </p>
<p>	Q.  It's been a long road for you nonetheless to get here in your career.  I wondered if like in maybe year 12 or 13 as an assistant coach under Keady that maybe you wondered or resigned yourself that this kind of moment might not happen for you. </p>
<p>	Q.  What has last month been like for your family?  Has the success you and David both have had been any kind of a comfort at all in this time? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you remember back in 1980 when you were at Western, what your sales pitch to Coach Keady was like there? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the Orange Crush, they're kind of a unique organization raising money for charity, what they have meant to you.  Obviously, there's a lot of them out there. </p>
<p>	Q.  You shot 35 threes against Arizona.  Does that number scare you when you look back and see how many you shot?  Is that sort of in the range you are comfortable with? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about just being the sentimental favorite as you come into this tournament with all that's happened with your mother, your proximity to Illinois, all the Orange Crush fans here? </p>
<p>	Q.  Rick Pitino and other coaches, possibly yourself, have talked about moving back the three-point line.  I wondered, if that's done, does it risk taking away anything from what's been so much a part of March Madness with three-point shots or is nine inches not that big of a difference? </p>
