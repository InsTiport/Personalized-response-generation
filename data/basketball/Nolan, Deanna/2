 Q. Deanna, if you could talk just about you obviously were bottling up Becky and they were trying to bottle you up, and Bill was saying you really responded well to that offensively, and you looked to your teammates. If you can talk about your game on both ends of the court tonight. 
 DEANNA NOLAN: Well, they were switching out their post. Any time I came off a screen, I don't know, they wanted me to try to make a quick shot or you know, whatever. 
 But it was just me being patient, finding that mismatch, finding an open man, because it seemed like every time I wanted to drive or tried to drive, it was just like they closed in on the paint and that's about it on me. And with Becky, just making sure I was always with her, staying on her hip when she's coming off screens, taking away the 3-pointer for her. We knew she was going to get looks, but just making sure they were contested when she shot it. You know, every time she drove, there was always someone in the area or coming off picks or a trap just to get it out of her hands. 

 Q. You playing with Katie for a long time, just her game tonight, how much she just took it on her shoulders, especially in sections of that game? 
 DEANNA NOLAN: Yeah, Katie tonight, and Taj, set the tone for us at the beginning of the game. You know, in the last series, we had problems starting out making shots, and they wanted to get us going, especially Taj and Katie followed right behind her. It's not necessarily I have to always have to get off because we have other players that can help step in and fill that role. .
