   DEANNA NOLAN:  Well, tonight I thought, know, we hung in there, at the halftime we were only down ten.  Then the start of the second half was a little bumpy.  We had a lot of unforced turnovers, questionable calls, just a lot of things that didn't go our way.   
  
  Q.  It seems like Katie did come alive in the second half point-wise, did you feel like you had a bit too much responsibility heaped on you?   
 DEANNA NOLAN:  I don't think I had too much responsibility on me.   
 It was just me attacking every time I had an opportunity to.   
 You know, a lot of players when playing well, when hitting shots, you know, when someone -- especially when you're in a case of you're making shots, you're just making an effort to, you know, try to get open and try to get to the basket or create your own shot.   
  
  Q.  Can you talk a little bit about playing here in Arco Arena.  I believe that's seven out of eight games you've lost here and the last one you lost here was a 31- or 33-point loss?   
 DEANNA NOLAN:  Everyone always says it's hard to play here and get a win here, and it's because they have the crowd behind them and other factors.
