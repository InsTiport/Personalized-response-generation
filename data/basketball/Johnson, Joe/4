   JOE JOHNSON: I think the first time I made it I was more excited than anything, but it never gets old, and I always enjoy myself.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible).   
 JOE JOHNSON: It's all that and more, honestly. I don't even look at it as a job, I just look at it as coming out day after day and having fun more than doing work.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible).   
 JOE JOHNSON: It's a wonderful feeling, and it makes you feel like all the work you've put it is really paying off.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible).   
 JOE JOHNSON: I think more than anything just all the guys being together and pretty much having camaraderie. It's fun for me. I enjoy playing with all these guys.
