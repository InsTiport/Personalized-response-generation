  Q. Talk about the season thus far.  
 JOE JOHNSON: We haven't had a lot of time to play with our whole five for whatever reason. But here in the later part of the season, we are trying to pull it back together.  
  
  Q. Were you surprised Amar'e was on the trade block?  
 JOE JOHNSON: Definitely. I heard about it and I just -- I didn't think it was true, man. I thought it was just another rumor.   
 But everybody has been talking about him. I can't even believe that they got him in a block trying to trade him.   
 All of us are on the outside looking in, so we don't know what's going on.  
  
  Q. The last two All-Star visits have been good?   
 JOE JOHNSON: They haven't been that bad.
