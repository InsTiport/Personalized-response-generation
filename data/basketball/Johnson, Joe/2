Q.   (No microphone.)
JOE JOHNSON:   We're playing great, winning basketball games. 
It's fun.   We got to get back to that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
JOE JOHNSON:   I think there's a lot of guys that can make plays and who have been in those situations to take a last‑second shot. 

Q.   What's the goal for us?
JOE JOHNSON:   The goal right now for us, we set short‑term goals as of now.   And that's to get to .500.   And then when we get there, we'll go from there.   But right now that's one of our goals. 

Q.   Does every All‑Star Game have a memory?
JOE JOHNSON:   They definitely do.   I was here the last time when we were in New Orleans, and that was right after Katrina.   And that was a very, very memorable week.   So I knew that it was very important to be back here that week. 
But it's great to be back here, and I'm looking forward to it.

Q.   Is there anything in particular that you want to do in this All‑Star Game?
JOE JOHNSON:   Not necessarily in the All‑Star Game.   I mean, tomorrow night, the 3‑point shoot‑out, I was in the 3‑point shoot‑out in 2004 and I didn't make a great impression.   So I want to redeem myself from that.   And I'm looking forward to that. 

Q.   Any player that you particularly want to play with?
JOE JOHNSON:   Not really.   I played with pretty much a lot of these guys already.   It's always fun to get on the other end of it and compete with these guys, hang out with them.   I'm just looking forward to it.
