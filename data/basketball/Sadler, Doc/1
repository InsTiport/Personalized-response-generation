MODERATOR:   Coach Sadler will make an opening statement and then we'll go to questions for the student‑athletes.  
Coach?   
COACH SADLER:   Well, I thought starting the basketball game, I was really pleased with our effort, and I thought our guys played really hard and the game was going along there.   And there's about a six‑ or seven‑minute span there in the first half that we didn't get the ball inside and we got them in the foul trouble a little bit to where we could go with the bonus, but we didn't take advantage of it as much as we needed to.   But then we finished the first half pretty strong and kept the ballgame down under 10 and started the second half going inside and got some easy baskets, cut the lead and didn't‑‑ the whole night defensively they just kept us completely‑‑ they kept us completely off balance.   
I mean, we knew going into the game that we wanted to take away the lane, and that's something that we definitely didn't do.   And you give a team 13 threes, I think that's the same amount that we gave them before.   Maybe they didn't have 13 tonight, they had‑‑ yeah, 13 tonight also.   And you can't give them the lane and the 3‑point, and that's what we did, and we came up a little bit short.   
MODERATOR:   Questions for Brandon and Bo?   
   
 Q.   Brandon, just in general, how would you summarize this season?  
BRANDON RICHARDSON:   It's been a tough season, especially not playing with Diaz and Andre Almeida due to injuries.   But we didn't never use that as an excuse.   We went out there and we competed and we gave it all we got.   And we came up short for the most part, but I'm proud of our guys.   They stuck in there.   We fought to the end.   And I couldn't be prouder of our guys.  
MODERATOR:   Other questions?   Anybody?   All right.   Fellas, you may go back to the locker room.  
Questions for Coach Sadler?   
   
 Q.   Coach, can you just talk about the first season in the Big Ten and your overall thoughts about the transition going from the Big 12 to the Big Ten?  
COACH SADLER:   Well, again, I think obviously both leagues are very, very good.   And I've said on numerous occasions the Big 12 and the Big Ten is two totally different leagues, kind of like in football.   In the Big 12 it's a more athletic, faster league.   In the Big Ten I think the players are more mature.   They're older.   I think the teams are much tougher, and only because of the upper classmen.   
But both leagues are very, very good.   The five years that I spent in the Big 12, I mean, at times it was considered the best league in the country.   This year this league is considered the best league in the country.   So I've had the great opportunity to be in two great leagues for six years and it's been fun.   
Obviously we're disappointed in what we did in our first year, but at the same time it's a fun league to coach in because you've got to compete really, really hard.   Possessions are going to be very, very important.   It's just a totally different basketball game than it is in the Big 12.   
MODERATOR:   Other questions?   Anybody?   Okay.   
Thank you, Coach.  
COACH SADLER:   Thank you.
