<p>	Q.  Chelsea, obviously the last few weeks, you were a lot more aggressive offensively.  What is it that changed, that your game has changed so much in the last few weeks? </p>
<p>	Q.  Chelsea, was that last play designed for you?  Looked like the pass was to Sophia, looked like she was specifically looking for you?  Was it drawn up for you? </p>
<p>	Q.  I don't remember who the player was coming over, there was a bigger player coming over. </p>
<p>	Q.  Chelsea, y'all have won a lot of close games this year.  Can you maybe talk about the confidence y'all have in close games now? </p>
<p>	Q.  Steffanie, can you talk about that final sequence?  Were you trying to foul the girl before the inbound pass?  Was that specific there? </p>

<p>	Q.  (No microphone.) </p>
<p>	Q.  Sophia, you're down I think eight fairly late.  Were you starting to worry or were you already worried?  How confident were you there at the end? </p>
<p>	Q.  Chelsea, I think the LSU game back at the start of the year ended in a similar situation, broken play that didn't work.  I think you threw it up, desperation shot.  How much has this team changed from that game to this game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Sophia, Steffanie, can y'all talk about what Chelsea has done for y'all's offense?  Her being able to knock down the jumpers, coming up with a  play at the end, like she said in Nebraska</p>

<p>	Q.  Steffanie, it looked like there were times in the game when you got frustrated, like you were kind of forcing things inside.  Was that Tech's defense? </p>

<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about how this team has grown from last year to what they've done this year several times. </p>
<p>	Q.  There late when Niemann tried the 3-pointer, Blackmon put it back up.  Is that the right play?  Should she have kicked it back out? </p>
<p>	Q.  Yes. </p>
<p>	Q.  How different of a team are y'all when you don't hit a three, when you don't have the perimeter shots falling? </p>
<p>	Q.  Before your last play, they called timeout. </p>
<p>	Q.  Second day in a row you were out-rebounded.  Is that a concern?  Take the win and move on? </p>
