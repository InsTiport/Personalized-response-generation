<p>	Q.  Stanford is a team that continues to exceed expectations.  Are they better than people think they are? </p>
<p>	Q.  With the way Anthony had been shooting, were you comfortable with him taking that final shot?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are you surprised they played as much zone?  Were you expecting they would do that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Along those lines, obviously Matt had some stand-up moments in the tournaments, and maybe some freshman mistakes.  Is he playing to your expectations so far?</p>
<p>	Q.  Games you've won coming in here, the lop-sided margins, is that the best way to get ready for a tournament?</p>
<p>	Q.  Matt Walsh, obviously you made yourself really at home back in Gainesville.  Can you talk about this experience playing in the garden first game on the road? </p>
<p>	Q.  After that first game, your big college debut on ESPN in front of the whole nation, how much pressure do you feel now going into the game, or maybe you don't? </p>
<p>	Q.  With so many close losses in the past few years, how do you prepare yourself for that during practices?</p>
<p>	Q.  How is Nelson feeling?</p>
<p>	Q.  Matt Bonner, are you disappointed with the way you guys handled Davis and Little on the board? </p>
