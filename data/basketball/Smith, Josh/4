<p>	Q.  How much advice did Dominique give you going into this?  Did you receive some from him? </p>

<p>	Q.  When did you guys decide to take the jersey off and put Dominique's jersey on, and talk about the origin of that. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about, did you watch Dominique before, growing up, or see any footage of him and what he's meant to you as a mentor, if at all? </p>
<p>	Q.  You guys talked afterwards; what did you say to each other? </p>
<p>	Q.  After you saw Nash and Amare's dunk, throwing the ball off of Nash's head, did you worry a little bit?  Did you think you have to do something to top that?  Did it psyche you at all? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you decide to go with the Dr. J, the Dominique, was that your idea to honor the legends in the home of the dunk contest here?</p>
<p>	Q.  What did you think of his whole performance from beginning to end? </p>
<p>	Q.  There's only two ways that that dunk could have gone, sheer glory or true embarrassment, were you ever scared at one point?</p>
