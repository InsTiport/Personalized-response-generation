  Q.  You played some against the Sixers, what are your thoughts on him (Andre Iguodala) as a dunker and how much of a challenge will he be?   
 JOSH SMITH:  Like I said, people are talking about Nate and me.  I think that Andre is going to be some tough competition because I've seen him do some dunks this year that he can do in the dunk contest.   
 We're playing hard and we've just got to learn how to finish it off.  Normally if we're in the lead and it's a close game, but then we're losing at the end.   
  Q.  Being the underdog (Nate Robinson) --   
 JOSH SMITH:  Yeah, I'm the underdog.  Being so short, the things that he can do with the ball, dunking-wise, I think he's going to get the crowd into it.   
  Q.  What have you learned in your career as more time goes by?   
 JOSH SMITH:  Just patience.  My second year I had a lot of advice from other players, and I'm just going to take my time now, making plays.
