 Q. How important is it for you guys to spread the court and the energy that you guys have been able to bring to the offense?
     RAJON RONDO: It's going to take everything we can do to get the win. Those little key moments that we do have where we may get a second shot or we're out there spreading the floor, taking advantage of opportunities to score the ball.

 Q. Do you allow yourself to think of the scenario of how important Game 5 is, that if you were to lose you're going on the road to LA down 3-2?
     RAJON RONDO: No, just take it one game at a time. We're in Boston now, so we've got to take care of what we can take care of in Boston.

 Q. (Question regarding Andrew Bynum.)
     RAJON RONDO: If you ask any player in each game I'm sure he's had an effect.

 Q. If you know an opposing player is not 100 percent, do you do anything different on how you approach him?
     RAJON RONDO: No, in the starting five, I'm sure no one particular player is 100 percent healthy. Some are more injured or banged up than others, but there's no one 100 percent in The Finals right now.
