 Q. How does it feel 24 hours later?
 RAJON RONDO: It feels a little bitter. It's still sore. I got treatment again this morning, but it's getting better.

 Q. Can you put a number on it, percent-wise?
 RAJON RONDO: Not really. I'm going to get out here today and see how I feel. I'm going to go up and down. I probably won't do much running, but I'm going to go up and down and get a good feel for it, see how I feel.

 Q. Do you think you'll play tomorrow night?
 RAJON RONDO: I think I'll play.

 Q. What are your expectations for Game 4?
 RAJON RONDO: As far as what? 

 Q. Physically. 
 RAJON RONDO: I mean, nobody in this league is 100 percent, but I'm sure I'll play tomorrow night.

 Q. What do you have on your foot, is it a wrap?
 RAJON RONDO: It's like a little brace to keep my ankle in place.

 Q. How long have you had that?
 RAJON RONDO: I just put it on right before I got off the bus.

 Q. What did the X-rays say last night?
 RAJON RONDO: Negative. It hurts a lot, but like I said, it's not too painful. It's just a little sore.

 Q. How is the swelling?
 RAJON RONDO: It didn't swell up much last night.

 Q. Do you think it will affect you mostly on cutting?
 RAJON RONDO: Mostly, but like I say, I have 24 hours, so hopefully with the treatment I'm getting down, I'll be fine.

 Q. What kind of treatment are you getting?
 RAJON RONDO: Just icing it down, that's basically it, and elevation of my foot.

 Q. Right now are you able to put a lot of weight on it?
 RAJON RONDO: Yeah, I can walk on it. I was limping earlier. I made a walk around the hotel and I was limping a little bit, but farther I walked the better it got.

 Q. How important is it that you were actually able to get back into the game last night?
 RAJON RONDO: It felt pretty good, but I was just running off adrenaline. After the game it swelled up a little bit, it got a little tight. But other than that, like I said, it's just time. It's going to be all right.

 Q. How did it feel when you woke up this morning?
 RAJON RONDO: It was sore when I woke up this morning. I almost fell out of bed. But like I said, the more time I put weight on it, the better it got throughout the day.

 Q. Have you had an ankle injury like this before?
 RAJON RONDO: I've never had one. Actually it's the inside of my bone.

 Q. It's a bone bruise?
 RAJON RONDO: Bone bruise, yeah.

 Q. Never had one?
 RAJON RONDO: Never had one like this, yeah.

 Q. You broke your ankle before, right?
 RAJON RONDO: No, never broke my ankle. I've only rolled my ankle like once or twice in my career.

 Q. The brace you have on now, is that something you would wear during the game?
 RAJON RONDO: No, it's not comfortable at all to wear during the game.

 Q. You don't have a sprained ankle, you have a bone bruise?
 RAJON RONDO: No, I think I have a bone bruise.

 Q. So you'll just tape it up and go tomorrow?
 RAJON RONDO: Yeah, I'll just put extra tape on it before I go tomorrow.

 Q. Is it much like the case of Perk and Paul and where you are and the importance of the game, that there's no way you're going to miss this game?
 RAJON RONDO: There's no way I'm going to miss the game probably. I don't want to hurt the team and go out there and not give it my all, but I think I'm pretty sure I'll be playing tomorrow night.

 Q. As it feels right now, do you feel you can be yourself and be effective?
 RAJON RONDO: I think so. I'll just go out there and try to do what I've been doing all year, just try to do the intangibles. I don't try to do too much, just take an open shot when I'm open and just play basketball, run the team.

 Q. Do you think you'll have to manage the minutes tomorrow?
 RAJON RONDO: No, I mean, it's The Finals. I don't want to hold anything back. Like I said, if I'm going out there at 50 percent, I don't want to hurt the team. Eddie and Sam do a great job of running the team, so I'll let them have it.
