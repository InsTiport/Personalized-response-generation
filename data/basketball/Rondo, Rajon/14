 Q. Overall you've played in Game 7s earlier on. How different is this?
 RAJON RONDO: Well, you know, win or lose, the] last game is always exciting.

 Q. How do you overcome the loss of Kendrick Perkins?
 RAJON RONDO: I don't know, it's going to be different. We've got to find a way.

 Q. Rasheed is one guy who obviously, if Perk is out, will have to step up big in this game.
 RAJON RONDO: Yeah, they think a lot of Rasheed and I'm sure he'll get the job done. As far as the team effort he'll come out and do the right thing tomorrow.

 Q. Are there concerns going into Game 7?
 RAJON RONDO: No.

 Q. Coming off of Game 6, what do you guys have to do better, improve on, that you saw in that game?
 RAJON RONDO: Change some match-ups and get out in transition.

 Q. Did you guys get as many stops as you wanted --
 RAJON RONDO: No, we didn't get any stops. You can't run if you're taking it out every time. We have to do a better job of getting stops.

 Q. How does the game change without Bynum in the lineup, if he doesn't play much or he's out for a while?
 RAJON RONDO: The game will be a lot faster. Other than that, it doesn't change much. If they're running a triangle offense, they run through Kobe and Gasol, and Odom is a great offensive rebounder, as well.
 So it doesn't change a lot.

 Q. What's going to go through your mind as you get ready for this game?
 RAJON RONDO: I mean, I'll do everything.

 Q. Is this like another game to you? Do you approach it that way?
 RAJON RONDO: Yeah, it's do or die, win or go home. But at the end of the day it's still basketball.
