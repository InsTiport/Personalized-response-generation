  Q. Can you talk about how you were a point guard and how the position has changed over your career up to now?   
 RAJON RONDO: I don't think it's changed much. The game is slowing down for me a little bit.   
  
  Q. You always hear that the court vision changes with the experience, your own game --  
 RAJON RONDO: Just knowing the style of play that we run, knowing that when a pass is going to made and who gets the ball.   
  
  Q. So you're more comfortable knowing where everybody is on the court?   
 RAJON RONDO: Yes.   
  
  Q. The possibility of a work stoppage, how much attention do you pay to that?   
 RAJON RONDO: I'm very interested. You know, we are attending a meeting after this. It's a concern, but obviously want to continue to play the game. We have a contract to play out this year, so just focusing on that.   
  
  Q. What does it mean to have four Celtics in the All-Star Game?  
 RAJON RONDO: Definitely to be one of the four guys that's selected, it's definitely an honor. For the coaches to respect the team, it means a lot.   
 Our entire team has helped us get here, our bench has helped us get better.
