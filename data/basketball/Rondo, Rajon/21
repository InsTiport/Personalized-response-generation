		   RAJON RONDO: You can't run unless you get stops, and we didn't get any last night. It's only one game, but if they continue to score like that, then we'll be a half-court team.

 Q. Talk about the team concept like that, that you have to get rebounds in order to get the running game?
 RAJON RONDO: Yep, when they didn't score it seemed like they got offensive rebounds or got to the line. If we can do a better job in both of those categories we'll be able to get out there on the fast break and run a little bit more.

 Q. Talk about Tom Thibodeau getting the head coaching job. Talk about him as a coach and what you think he'll be like as a head coach in the NBA. 
 RAJON RONDO: I'm sure he'll be a great coach. He's a great defensive coach for us now. He's very vocal. He talks to the players and has a great relationship with his players. 
 If he does get the job, I wish him the best. I'm sure he'll be successful.

 Q. How has that been an effect in the locker room?
 RAJON RONDO: It hasn't. I'm not worried about it.

 Q. (Inaudible). 
 RAJON RONDO: Well, actually I watched it the same night. Perk and I, we watched it in the room right after the game. We seen a lot of bad things we did, and we seen a lot of good things, as well. We try to take the positives and learn from the negatives and the mistakes we made in Game 1.
