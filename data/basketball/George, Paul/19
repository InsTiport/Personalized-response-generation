  Q. Coming back and being a distraction -- do you think that having the opportunity to speak about this day after day will continue to lend to that message and make more -- lend to change?
 PAUL GEORGE:   Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I think, again, that's what we're here for, to continue to keep that in the back of people's minds, and -- murderers are still free.  Nothing was done yet and we're going to continue to, again, keep this fight going and use our platform to stand up for those that can't stand anymore.
 I have no answer for Orlando.  I still have no answers for Orlando.
 Q. What you were just saying about Brandon -- this is something you guys have talked about and continuing to talk -- how has that conversation been circulating?  Is it texts between just friends on different teams or is it an organized effort?
 PAUL GEORGE:   We're here.  We're here.  We see each other.  We're housed in the same areas.  It's very easy for us to come together and do this together, do this collectively.  The NBA is a wonderful platform and they have allowed us to use it and come together and use it.
 Q. Is it a topic of conversation when you guys are around each other often?  Is this something that comes up naturally in conversations?
 PAUL GEORGE:   Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Because this league is predominately African American, and people in these situations that are losing their lives are predominately African-Americans.  It just comes naturally.
