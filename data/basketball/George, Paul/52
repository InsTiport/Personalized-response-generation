		  PAUL GEORGE:   The pick‑and‑roll definitely helps.   That's the style we play.   We do do a lot of pick‑and‑roll.   That helps because now I'm able to play the pick‑and‑rolls and really make them with the right results for now.
I wasn't seeing guys that were open at that time and now I'm able to deliver the ball when they're ready for it and when they're open for it. 

Q.   Are you happy with what you've been able to do out on court this year?   What are you happiest with?
PAUL GEORGE:   A lot of things.   I'm really happy that I'm able to get guys open and create shots for other people as well as create shots for myself. 

Q.   Do you think your role is going to change when Granger gets back in the lineup?
PAUL GEORGE:   I hope not, but I'm well aware of the circumstances, and what he brings to the team and what he brings to the table.   Again, I hope we can play off one another and really be productive. 

Q.   (Inaudible)
PAUL GEORGE:   I think we have a lot of diversity.   We're able to rebound the ball as a team.   Our transition game is pretty good.   And we've got guys that can make shots when we need to.   I think we have the makeup for a team that can win the championship. 

Q.   Talk about how Indiana is under the radar. 
PAUL GEORGE:   This is our second time that we've done an excellent job and we've still gone under the radar.   But we're an in‑house team; everything stays inside our ballclub.   We all pull for one another.   Whatever the circumstances are as far as us not getting recognition, again, we just keep going out and trying to perform.
