Q. What kind of impact has Kobe Bryant made on the game?
PAUL GEORGE: A huge one.  (Indiscernible) play because of Kobe.  He's going to go down as one of the best to ever play the game.
Q. Why has he meant that much?
PAUL GEORGE: He was just fearless.  He's a champion.  To get to where you want to get to, you have to put the work in.  His work ethic is one thing that he has.  That's the reason why he's so great.
Q. Have you ever asked him why he works like that?
PAUL GEORGE: I think it's easy for Kobe.  It comes down to him wanting to be the best.  Him being an alpha male, he definitely saw himself as that and in order to stay at the top, he had to work.
Q. How are the emotions being back here at the All-Star Game?
PAUL GEORGE: I'm very grateful to society, especially coming from the road that it took to get here.  It's surreal.  It's a surreal moment.
Q. It's almost like you know that you've gotten to this level and now on to the next one?
PAUL GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, this is definitely a milestone.  This is something to check off the list.  It's kind of like a gauge to see where I'm at and how far I've come along.
Q. Paul, last year when you were out, how hard was it to sit and watch these guys all weekend?
PAUL GEORGE: It was really hard.  I only came for Friday and Saturday and left on Sunday.  I didn't watch the game.  For that reason alone I just didn't feel right being here and not being part of it.
