Q.   How does the MVP even work, just one guy gets going and then you guys just decide we're going to keep feeding this guy?
PAUL GEORGE:   Yeah.   I mean, that's exactly what it is.   The guy that has the hot hand.   That's with our regular game, as well.   You got a hot hand, you keep feeding them.

Q.   When did you guys determine it was Kyrie?
PAUL GEORGE:   I think when we seen he wasn't missing a three.   That's when we knew who was the hot guy.
