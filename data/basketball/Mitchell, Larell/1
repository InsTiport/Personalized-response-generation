Q. Tell me your name, your position, your team.
LARELL MITCHELL: Winner_Stayz_On, point guard, Memphis.
Q. How long you been playing NBA 2K?
LARELL MITCHELL: For about five years now.
Q. Yeah.  What is your regiment like?
LARELL MITCHELL: I just go in.  As soon as I get home or when I wake up in the morning time, if I don't have to work, first thing I do is go in and play as many games as I can.
Q. So you do work.  A lot of the guys here are in school or dropped out of school and are pursuing this.  You also work?
LARELL MITCHELL: Yes, sir.
Q. And you find time for both.
LARELL MITCHELL: Yeah, it's really crazy.  I have a Class A CDL, so I drive tractor trailers, and I just come back and I just have time to do everything.  It's just been really an amazing journey.
Q. What is your advice for someone that wants to go from casual to professional?
LARELL MITCHELL: My advice is just stick with it.  If it's something that you love it, something that you believe it, you'll have people that support you along the way.
Understand there's people that are not going to support you.  You just have to fight through.
Q. Do you play other games that aren't NBA 2K?
LARELL MITCHELL: No.
Q. Good answer.  You ever fight with your parents that they didn't want to play the video game anymore?
LARELL MITCHELL: For me, it's something I just can't give up.  I just can't give this game up.  I'm really passionate about and I really care about it, and hopefully I can win a championship this year?
Q. (Indiscernible.)
LARELL MITCHELL: Yeah, so for myself, I'm somebody that wasn't really known in the community.  I can say that dreams really do come true if you believe in it, if it's something you really want to do.
Hopefully you have the support of your parents or whoever is living with you, close to you.
Q. So you were driving tractor before this?
LARELL MITCHELL: Yes.
Q. How does it feel to know that 2K has changed your career?
LARELL MITCHELL: It's absolutely amazing.  Couple months ago I didn't think this was possible, but this is something that's worked out for me.  I'm just really thankful to be here.
Q. How did it feel to have your name called?
LARELL MITCHELL: It's a dream come true.  It's like, you know you're in the 102, you're going to get called, but you never know when.
To hear it in the first round it was absolutely amazing.  I just want to thank everybody who believed in me.  I'm just looking forward to the season.
Q. How did it feel to go through the whole process?
LARELL MITCHELL: For me, I love a challenge.  So this whole draft experience, the combine, everything I've been through, just has made me a stronger player, more prepared.
I just can't wait to get the season started.
