 Q.   Did you guys form an instant friendship over your last year or two being together?  
ANDRE DRUMMOND:   We both have similar stories and that.   And people really had faith in us.   We both did a good job of proving people wrong.   
And look at him, he's an All‑Star again, so I'm real proud of him.  
   
 Q.   Is it one of those things that it's a motivating factor, coming from a small school like did you, and so was it one of those things that now you guys like to look to prove people wrong?  
ANDRE DRUMMOND:   Yeah, he comes from Weber State, who would have thought he would have been an All‑Star in two years.   I watched him play in college and he's an amazing player.   What he's proved and what he's shown is, I mean it's above and beyond.   
So that's, I'm real proud of him, what he's doing and hopefully he'll do well in the All‑Star Game.   
For me, coming from UCONN, I didn't have the best year that I was supposed to have, but I knew what kind of weight I had on my shoulders, that I needed to prove to people that I could play in this league.
