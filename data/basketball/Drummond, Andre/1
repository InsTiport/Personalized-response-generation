Q. So you've been here before and seen some of this, but being in the game, how's that different for you in the last couple days and seeing what that's like?
ANDRE DRUMMOND: It took a while for me to really feel it.  I worked hard for this moment.  I worked really hard for this moment.  And now that I'm here, it's like, as the days and hours go by, I'm starting to feel more and more like I finally did it.  It's a great feeling.  I couldn't have done it without my teammates and the coaching staff.  We got off to a really good start, which we got it out there that somebody needs to be an All-Star on the team, and I'm just glad I'm representing my team.
Q. Can you talk about -- actually you've been here before, but does it kind of go through your head like a wow moment where you're walking through these hallways and you're in the main group of guys that are actually going to be in the game?  You've been in the rookie challenge, but can you talk about being part of that with Kobe, KD, all those great players?
ANDRE DRUMMOND: Yeah, like I just said, it's a crazy feeling, a crazy feeling to walk throughout the hotel and seeing myself on billboards in the street.
It's like, you know, just watching the All-Star Game last year in New York.  I told myself I don't want to come back to another one unless I'm in the game.  So it's a real feeling for me just being part of the game, and it's an honor too.  So it gives me something to really work for.
