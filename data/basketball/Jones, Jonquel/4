 Q.  Jonquel, specifically what was it about why you were able to play free and easy inside here in Game 2 versus Game 1?  
JONQUEL JONES: Yeah, I think I just got on the offensive glass a lot, and that allowed me to really get everything else going. Obviously my teammates were looking for me, and we talked about getting me the ball more in Game 2, and I just wanted to deliver.   
 Q.  Jonquel, you said yesterday, "We'll see." It's a point of emphasis to get you the ball. Just from moment one, it sounds like you took that upon yourself. Early on the shots weren't falling. Any hesitation or pause at all, or was it clear to you this was how the game was going to go for you?  
JONQUEL JONES: No, I just wanted to keep shooting. I said "we'll see" because I don't like giving away too much of our game plan to the media and stuff.   
But honestly, I just want to keep my confidence. I feel like people think it dwindles, but it doesn't, and I believe in myself, and I know they believe in me.   
 Q.  Jonquel, how important was capitalizing on second-chance points tonight?  
JONQUEL JONES: It was huge, honestly. I felt like in Game 1 I was in good position, but these people werenÂ’t missing like that, so it was tough.   
But honestly, yeah, it was huge, honestly, yeah. That's all I've got to say. I don't know what else to say.   
 Q.  Courtney, you hit the shot that you typically hit during games that you guys pull out, where 88-85 you're hitting that three to put a little bit of a cushion in there, but then Jonquel comes with one that is typically a shot that you take. I'm wondering if you could take me through what it meant to have Jonquel deliver that dagger blow this time around.  
COURTNEY WILLIAMS: Man, J.J. was going crazy today. I told her, I felt like I could pull the ball from half court and she was going to look out for me and get the rebound. That's huge when she has that mindset to go get every ball, every rebound. So that was huge for us.   
 Q.  Courtney, when they were going through their run in the third and fourth quarter, you were able to just kind of counteract. Can you talk about how you were attacking today and just that motivation.  
COURTNEY WILLIAMS: I mean, I think I was doing the same thing that I always do, taking my shots, my teammates was finding me, my teammates was setting great screens for me, so I was just taking my shots. I stay confident when I shoot the ball.   
 Q.  Courtney, Alyssa Thomas, we know she's playing through injury and she still hasn't left the court at all in two games. What do you think makes her such a dominant player that she plays the entire game?  
COURTNEY WILLIAMS: Man, she's tough. You know, she's the toughest player in the league. She's going to play. We get this question all the time, and AT is a dog, so she's going to play. It don't matter. Unless they're carrying her off, she's going to play.   
 Q.  Splitting the series going back to Connecticut, how do you guys feel right now, confidence level?  
JASMINE THOMAS: We feel good. This was our goal was to steal one on their floor, and now we get to go home and play two in a row, so this is where we expected to be.   
 Q.  Your coach, he spoke a little bit about the lift that Bria Holmes was able to give you guys off the bench as far as coming in, hustling, kind of doing the dirty work and then scoring offensively. Can you just elaborate on a little bit of how she was able to impact the game for you guys.  
JASMINE THOMAS: That's what she's been doing for us all season. Nobody can guard her when she's playing confident, getting downhill, getting to the basket, and she makes plays. She finds other people, as well. So she's been doing that all season, and we knew she would be key for us in this postseason, as well.   
 Q.  When did you realize that Elena was out of the game and not going to come back in, and what was going through your mind once you realized that?  
JONQUEL JONES: I mean, for us, we were locked in, so we just kept playing, honestly and truly. We were trying to win the game, so we weren't really focused on that, to be honest with you.   
 Q.  Jonquel, the sequence of events where you got fourth foul, fifth foul, I'm hoping you could take me through what Curt was talking to you about and what your mindset was, how you navigated that, especially that fifth foul. You didn't come out of the game for the rest of the game.  
JONQUEL JONES: Yeah, just being smart and understanding that I need to be out there on the court. I think I kind of got a little too caught up in trying to get the blocks and swinging versus staying straight up, and I think that's how I got the fouls.   
So just being smarter, coming out there and understanding that it was a tight game and I needed to be on the court.
