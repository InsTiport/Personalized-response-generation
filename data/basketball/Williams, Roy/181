<p>	Q.  Hi, Coach, two-part question.  In the past, you've been critical of the way some college coaches are terminated.  What are your thoughts about the way your good friend Matt Doherty was treated at North Carolina?  Now that there is an opening at Carolina, sources are mentioning your name again as a candidate.  Can you unequivocally state for Kansas fans you are not going to be a candidate, and you will retire at KU as you previously stated three years ago?</p>
<p>	Q.  Wouldn't ruling it out eliminate all of it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did he completely rule it out?</p>
<p>	Q.  How frustrating has the last 24 hours been for you?  How do you try to keep the focus on your team?</p>

<p>	Q.  Since this question's from North Carolina, I'll withdraw the question since it's already been answered.  Good luck in the Final Four.</p>
<p>	Q.  Two things, actually.  One is, can you talk about what it means for the Big 12 to have two teams in the Final Four again?  And, can you talk about when you first met Rick Barnes and what you thought of him then and how you guys have gotten along over the years.</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you talk to him at all after the seeds were given out to diffuse that a little bit?</p>
<p>	Q.  That's what I was talking about in his personality.  He's just kind of a funny guy in that sense?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering, Kirk's considered your best perimeter defender.  You're playing a great guard in Wade.  Do you use him on him?  With your lack of depth, do you worry about foul trouble and fatigue and all that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Back seven, eight, nine years ago when there was talk about this new Big 12, not everybody was really happy with it.  I'm just wondering if feelings have changed from then to now knowing  that it seems like everybody's gotten stronger by the whole league?</p>
<p>	Q.  One other thing.  New Orleans being the tough town it is, how close do you monitor your guys?  Curfews, how does that work?</p>
<p>	Q.  Roy, you've, at times, been beat up pretty good over the years for not having won a title.  I just wondered, with all that backlog of history and whatnot, do you have to sort of, during that process, kind of make a peace with yourself and say, "Hey, I'm still okay," "I'm doing pretty good here"? </p>
<p>	Q.  Right.</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, I wanted to ask you about Jim Boeheim.  You've been around, he's been around, and a lot of the same issues about being around for so many years, going to the Final Four and not winning.  Can you talk about him as a coach and just your impressions of him. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, it was a good-in, the prior question.  In comparison with Syracuse and Kansas, Syracuse got this far with youth being served; so many freshmen made it this far.  Your team, obviously, has more experience with Hinrich and Collison being seniors.  Can you talk about what advantage, if any, that is, having experience in this environment in college basketball where players are leaving early all the time?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering, personally, is it any different this year than it was last year for you, or in '91 or '93, the Final Four feeling, the sense of satisfaction? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you went into the Final Four last year with a freshman starter.  How do you bring along such a young kid so fast to have them be able to handle that situation?  What you did with Aaron last year, and what Jim will have to do with Carmelo this year?</p>
