<p>	Q.  Sean, can you talk about, y'all played Illinois twice, not this year, but two previous years, basically the same group.  What did you learn from that?  What do you think about the championship game match-up? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jawad, earlier this week your coach in a nice way said you guys needed more production from you.  Did that motivate you or is your hip feeling better?  What got into you today? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jawad, you and coach I think shared a moment after the Wisconsin game that he was very pleased with, a private moment.  Can you talk about what you've had to go through the last couple weeks and how fulfilling tonight was. </p>
<p>	Q.  Sean, would you talk about what you saw out of Jawad tonight.  He looked like a different ball player. </p>
<p>	Q.  Raymond, what was the message at halftime, and how animated was it?  What was it about getting going in the second half? </p>
<p>	Q.  How animated was he? </p>
<p>	Q.  Sean, I think you won the rebounding battle 51-42.  How important was that? </p>

<p>	Q.  To hold Alan Anderson scoreless, what kind of key was that tonight?  What did you do to make that happen? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jawad said his role changed.  How did it change?  How did you motivate him this week? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jawad hit your first field goal tonight, then he hit a three about midway through the first half.  First in a while.  Did you kind of realize at that point the old Jawad was pretty much back? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Rashad McCants' game tonight and the kind of player he's become. </p>
<p>	Q.  At this point in the season, do you have a feel for this season? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you follow up on what you were talking about earlier?  I think all of us could tell you were really super-intense coaching your guys late.  Every swing of the ball late.  Seemed like you were reminding your guys this was something you wanted to get a message on. </p>
<p>	Q.  What did you do in particular during that big second-half run that the team hadn't been doing for the first 25 minutes? </p>
<p>	Q.  Some people recently have questioned your team's defense.  You hold them to 29% in the second half.  Can you address the overall defense and how all that helps you going into Monday night. </p>
<p>	Q.  I don't know how much you've seen Illinois, but do you think they're the best team in the country?  Do you think you're playing the best team? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you say anything specific to Sean at halftime?  What was the biggest change in him in the second half? </p>
<p>	Q.  You were talking as if you gave motivational speaking at halftime.  We're in the Final Four.  Do these guys know a little too well how good they are?  Is that possible? </p>
<p>	Q.  Yes. </p>
<p>	Q.  I know you haven't had a chance to break down the tape.  Off the top of your head, can you give us a bit of a scouting report on Illinois and the keys that your club will need to accomplish against them. </p>
