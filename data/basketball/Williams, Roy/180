<p>	Q.  Aaron, you're back in the Final Four.  Coach Williams has said of all his players, you had the best game against Maryland.  Do you feel like you're kind of on a rollback in this environment? </p>
<p>	Q.  At times you've struggled from beyond 3-point arc.  You seem to have gone away from that, based your offense total inside, drives, pounding inside to Collison.  Are you at all worried about the fact that you do not shoot the three as well as you did last year? </p>

<p>	Q.  How do you feel about being the favorites?  Any more pressure this year than last? </p>

<p>	Q.  Aaron, could you talk about what the last few days have been like with all the rumors surrounding coach?  Do you worry that he might not be there for the rest of your career? </p>

<p>	Q.  Aaron is not going to brag about himself.  I'll ask you to do it.  Can you talk about what he's been able to do for your team the last couple years?  Do you feel like he's getting a little unfairly neglected?</p>



<p>	Q.  Do you think your experience from last year is an advantage?  Do you see any similarities between y'all and Maryland in the sense you have some outstanding seniors that have been through just about everything you can go through except winning the national title? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you came back, started practicing this summer, did you see any difference in Nick being with the NBA guys?  Can you talk about his development there, his development over his career? </p>
<p>	Q.  Your thoughts on the debate on whether players should be paid or not, college players? </p>

<p>	Q.  Aaron, can you talk about, especially last year when you first saw it, having a guy on the team who in stretches of the game could take over individually like Kirk?  How different does it make it as a team to have a guy that can do it?</p>
<p>	Q.  What makes your fast break transition game work?  What have teams tried to do this year to slow you down?  What do you think a team needs to do to try to slow you guys down from running?</p>

<p>	Q.  Could you comment on Dwyane Wade?  When did you first become aware of him?  Do you remember when you first saw him play, and what you think about him now? </p>

<p>	Q.  If Roy did decide to leave, what do you think the effect on that program would be? </p>



<p>	Q.  This is all new to them, something your guys have been through, and the program has been through.  How much of a factor is that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does Wade remind you of anybody else you've gone against?  How do you approach defending him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Last year after the Maryland game, you talked about Aaron Miles having probably the best game of anybody on your team.  Do you see that confidence in him coming back this year to this level?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much has Michael Lee been forced into duty?  How much of that duty has he earned?  How do you feel he's done with his added responsibilities this year? </p>
<p>	Q.  How many different ways have teams tried to take Collison out or limit him this year?  What, if anything, works because of the all he has in his arsenal?</p>
<p>	Q.  Two Big-12 teams here this year, like last year.  How much do you think that's a part of the equation in evaluating the strength of a conference?  Do you think the Big-12 needs to win a national championship to truly place itself at the top of the elite leagues? </p>
<p>	Q.  Three kids on your team that don't play a lot of minutes.  Is the Final Four experience the same for them as it is for Collison and Hinrich?  How important are they at this time of year to help your team get ready?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you seen a maturity or a growth in this team on the floor in these last three to four weeks?</p>
<p>	Q.  Some leagues have a rule that you can't make coaching changes during the week of the championship, the NFL has that rule.  Do you think college basketball should look at that rule and how bothersome is it to you that your situation has taken some of the attention from the kids? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think there should be a rule? </p>
<p>	Q.  Given that this is your fourth trip to the Final Four, given your stature in college basketball, and given all the North Carolina talk this week, do you feel like there's any more pressure on you this time, or the stakes are higher Saturday than in previous trips here? </p>
<p>	Q.  With the speculation that has been going on, you've had the opportunity to maybe curb that before you came down here in Kansas City.  You chose not to do so.  As reporters, we are somewhat skeptical.  I just wondered if you would address that. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Olson said last week they thought you guys got like 70% of your offense off transition or fast break.  Is that the way y'all see it or chart it?  Is the transition game or fast break, is that yours or from North Carolina?  How have you come about that?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much is Nick's game changed and developed this year?  Is he doing some of the things, facing the basket, that Drew did for you guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  Myles Brand came out yesterday, said he was thinking about revising the way the graduation rates are determined.  Do you have any thoughts on that?  Do you think they should be revised?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you went to the Final Four as a young guy, as an assistant, maybe not with a team or with a team, how much did you work the lobby, network for jobs?  How do you look back on that now as you've gone as a head coach? </p>
