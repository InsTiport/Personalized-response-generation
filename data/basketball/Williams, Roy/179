<p>	Q.  Keith, could you talk about your game, particularly getting out on the fast break?  Nick, what kind of spark can Keith give you guys today? </p>
<p>	Q.  Nick? </p>
<p>	Q.  Keith, did you change your shoes at halftime?  Can you explain the superstition a little bit? </p>
<p>	Q.  Keith, looking at your teammates before the game tonight in the locker room, did anybody ever look more focused than they had in other games this season or was it the same look in everybody's eyes? </p>
<p>	Q.  You kind of alluded to this a couple days ago, talking about Marquette might not be prepared for your slashing game.  You guys were doing that even when you weren't in your transition, getting that first quick step, blowing through them like it was a fast break. </p>
<p>	Q.  Keith, winning by such a large margin of victory, is that an indication that you guys on this night was better than Marquette or it was just your night? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Williams, at the end of the first half, you go 18-4, start of the second half the same.  Consider the circumstances and the day, can you remember a team of yours ever playing a stretch any better than they did, finishing the first half and the start of the second half today? </p>
<p>	Q.  How does it feel to be in the title game on Monday? </p>
<p>	Q.  Nick, did you guys talk today about blocking everything out, the speculation, just concentrating on this game, too? </p>
<p>	Q.  Nick, you guys have been attacking like that all year.  Why was it so effective tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  Nick, a year ago you all took a very strong team to the Final Four and lost a very disappointing game.  Knowing that you were probably going to lose Drew after that season, knowing how close you had come to being in a championship game, would you have dreamed that you would be back here a year later and winning a game as easily as you won it tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Williams said you feel like the end of the first half is important.  Could you talk about how you're able to demoralize another team with a run like that at the end of the half? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the way the team has evolved after that 3-3 start?  You received a lot of criticism early on. </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there any point in a game like that where you feel sorry for the opponent? </p>

<p>	Q.  Can Keith and Nick both comment on the fact that Coach Williams yesterday said he didn't show you the tape of the Marquette-Kentucky game.  Did you find that to be unusual? </p>

<p>	Q.  Roy, you've won the national championship as an assistant, you've lost it as a head coach.  What experiences do you take with you for Monday night?</p>
<p>	Q.  Keith talked about that every team in the country wants to run or can run.  Obviously, people try to run your break.  They're in condition.  There must be something that you do mentally to get them to have that kind of mental toughness to run as they do?  Is it through your drills? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you mentioned earlier that after the score was tied at 7, you stopped watching the score board.  At what point did you refocus on the score board?  When you did, you saw that your guys were so far ahead, what were your feelings at that point?  Did you feel sorry for the opponents? </p>
<p>	Q.  With Kirk and Nick being so high profile, do you feel like Keith gets overlooked sometimes, his importance to the team?</p>
<p>	Q.  What made your transition game so successful today and have you ever seen it better in a big game? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said one of the things that was keying the fast break was the defensive stops.  In the first half on more than half a dozen occasions, you scored within 10 seconds of them making a basket.  Is whether you stop them or not part of the strategy?  Do you hope it has a psychological impact on the opponent?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked yesterday about watching Marquette's tape, how it potentially would give you nightmares.  Does it surprise you at all that maybe they reached an epitome of their game in the Kentucky game and didn't have a second game like that in them?</p>
