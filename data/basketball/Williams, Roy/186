<p>	Q.  Congratulations.</p>
<p>	Q.  You have talked year two ago you said getting to the Final Four twice in your first five seasons kind of gave you a false sense of security on those that you didn't enjoy it as much as you should have because you kind of had the idea that hey, this is going to happen every couple of years?</p>
<p>	Q.  You were talking earlier in year about your motto was "enjoy the journey."  Are you going to be able to do that or is the tension and the pressure to win going to keep you from doing that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would you discuss just the matchups, some of us, I guess might think that you have a little edge in the front court; they might have a slight edge in the back court.  How do you see those particular matchups?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much has Hinrich recovered from his ankle?</p>
<p>	Q.  I have been talking to students about the many traditions and superstitions that surround this team.  I keep hearing you are the kind of the ring leader of that.  Share a couple of your favorite or more outrageous superstitions and how they got started?</p>
<p>	Q.  Two questions.  Talk a little bit about Nick and Kirk, the sacrifices they have made to the team as far as changing their games a little bit.  How much you think their being coaches' sons have to do with that as far as really understanding chemistry and how that works?</p>
<p>	Q.  More talking about Kirk I guess than him moving to -- away from the point guard?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about Drew, I get the sense that he really kind of takes to that leadership role.  Some guys might not be comfortable or good at it but he seems to really take to it; whether it is taking the big shot or talking  --</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think Gooden's candidacy for Player-of-the-Year deserves a boost by lasting longer in the tournament getting your team in the Final Four and how would you sort of assess it?</p>
<p>	Q.  There are a lot of former members of the big one Club, Dean Smith, Lute Olson to Jim Calhoun. Do you ever hear from any of them on that topic?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does Nick generally talk to the team before games?  There were a couple of contradictory reports out of your players, if so, does he usually get pretty wound up?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you think about the tournament, is there anything in particular that makes the tournament seem so wide open; certainly through the first three or four rounds?  Is it as simple as it is won and done; any other mystique to it that creates that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Speaking of Coach Smith as you did a moment ago with Carolina having had an 8 and 20 season do you at all feel you are sort of carrying the banner for the Carolina extended family of coaches or for fans?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you been in touch with Coach Smith or Coach Guthridge this week?</p>
<p>	Q.  This team seems to be a little sleaker, more athletic than some of your teams in the early mid-'90s.  Wondering is that by design or recruiting whims?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think that helps you in March?</p>
