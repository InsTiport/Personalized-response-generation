<p>	Q. You came out there, hit a few key 3s. Talk about getting in your rhythm.  We know D. Wade got in his, but you kind of got in yours, too.</p>
<p>	Q.  You watch Dwyane every day but when you see a fourth quarter like he had, taking charges, blocking shots, amazing left-handed hooks.  What are you saying to him as you're going back to the bench?</p>
<p>	Q.  How motivated was he?  Eddie said in the locker room said all the media said the Pistons have him figured out.  How motivated did you see Dwyane tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  Take us back on the play, on the alley-oop that gave you guys the lead late in the game, the alley-oop that you hit from half court. </p>
<p>	Q.  This game got close at the end.  You almost went down 0-2.  How big is it for you mentally to have won one?</p>
