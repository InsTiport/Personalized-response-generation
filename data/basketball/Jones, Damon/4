<p>	Q. Damon, can you talk a little about what your mentality was coming into this game.  You were much more aggressive, taking shots, challenging, can you just talk a little about that. </p>
<p>	Q.  It seemed like Shaquille was moving around better tonight and came out dominated early.  Did that ease your minds that the Big Fella is back?</p>
<p>	Q.  What was the mentality on the court when you guys saw Wade when he took that offensive foul and hit the ground?</p>
<p>	Q.  Zo was saying that it gets to a point with a player that sometimes you say "enough is enough" and he said basically that you told Chauncey "enough is enough" so to speak.  Did you come into this game knowing that you were going to be aggressive, that you were going to challenge him?</p>
<p>	Q.  What did it mean for you guys to go down the stretch without Dwyane, knowing there is the possibility he might not be available for the next game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about Shaq and D-Wade picking up their second fouls in that first quarter and your big shots to stabilize things and their ability to avoid that third foul in the second quarter. </p>
<p>	Q.  I know it's almost 48 hours away, but how do you think Dwyane and the team will deal with the uncertainty of his availability for the next game?</p>
<p>	Q.  What are your expectations for Game 6?  Do you feel Detroit has taken their best punch tonight and conversely you expect theirs on Saturday?</p>
