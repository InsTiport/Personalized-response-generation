<p>	Q. Damon, what's the mood in the locker room after a loss like this?  And how does everybody feel about going into a seventh game?  Do you think Dwyane will be with you or not?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the turnovers, the lack of fast break points, what specifically, considering you may not have Dwayne back, do you guys have to do to change that in Game 7 ?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you change that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Are there any particular difficulties in playing an experienced team like the Pistons?  They have been in the Finals last year and they have played New Jersey in a Game 7 and won it last year, does that bring any extra pressure I guess on you guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  What would be the formula for winning without Dwayne? </p>
<p>	Q.  How do you put a game like this behind when a lot of people thought, man, the Pistons sent a message tonight?  And what does it mean to you to play against some of your former teammates?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did Dwayne say anything to you guys about what he hopes for Game 7? </p>
<p>	Q.  Will you guys even look at film of this game or just try to put it completely behind and you concentrate on Game 7?</p>
