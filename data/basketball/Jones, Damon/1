   DAMON JONES:  We showed passion early on, and we showed composure for the majority of the game.  It just came down to a couple of plays there at the end that got us over the hump.  Everyone is saying now that no one has ever come back from 0-3, but I believe just because it hasn't been done doesn't mean it can't be done. 
 That's our focus going into Game 4, is to get to the next game and go from there. 

 Q.  You talked about a couple plays coming down at the end.  How much do you think it is the Spurs make those type of players, you guys don't.  They've won titles, you guys are learning, all that stuff? 
 DAMON JONES:  You know, I think the experience is what it is.  Those guys, the team being here, it is what it is.  I don't think at this point of the season when everything is on the line it has anything to do with experience.  It's just doing the things necessary to get over the hump, and we didn't do it. 

 Q.  What's your take on the sustained dynasty that the Spurs have had?  They have a chance to win their fourth in nine years.  Today with free agents and all that stuff, that stuff is more difficult.  What's your thought on how difficult it is and what they've been able to do over the years? 
 DAMON JONES:  I think it's very difficult for all those reasons that you described.  But one thing that I have seen from that basketball team is consistency and the way that they play, and when you have that type of consistency you have a great deal of success because you're doing the same things over and over again, so that means that you're getting better at doing those things.  The basis of their team is about team, it's not about one individual or two individuals; it's about how collectively five guys can go out and get the job done, and I think that that's very important with being the NBA champion.
