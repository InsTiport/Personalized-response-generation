SYLVIA HATCHELL:   I brought my three seniors because I'm extremely proud of these three young ladies, and I'd just hate for them that we weren't able to pull this one out.   I'm extremely disappointed.   I thought we fought hard.   We missed a lot of shots around the basket.   Really disappointed we didn't get to the foul line in overtime, but I thought we fought hard and missed a lot of shots around the basket, but I'm extremely proud of these three young ladies.   Brittany did a great job on Moore.   Last time we played them she got I think 28 and she got seven today.   But I thought we had the shots to win.   It was a hard‑fought game.   
   
 Q.   It seemed like you had an awful lot of momentum after Cherry hit the three‑pointer.   What went awry in overtime?   
SYLVIA HATCHELL:   Say that again?   
   
 Q.   What went wrong generally in overtime because it seemed like you had a lot of momentum.   
SYLVIA HATCHELL:   Yeah, we were trying to go inside.   I thought we got the ball in there some and we couldn't score, and we had some shots, Jessica had that shot in the corner that was wide open and she's a great three‑point shooter, and I thought we had some good things.   But they got on the foul line.   That was the biggest difference.   They got on the foul line in overtime and we didn't.   We kept trying to take it in there and everything, and we missed some shots, like I said, that I thought we would have made.   So it just didn't go our way.   But I thought we battled hard.   I thought we had some momentum, got the lead, but they just, again, got to the foul line and we didn't.   
   
 Q.   Coach, when Allisha Gray fouled out in the final minutes of regulation, did it feel pretty reminiscent of the first time that you played Louisville this season?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL:   Well, the first time she played really well.   This is probably the worst I've seen Allisha play.   Seven points and four rebounds in 30 minutes, that's not Allisha Gray.   I kept thinking she was going to get going and get going.   But she didn't.   But yeah, and that's what she said when she came to the bench.   They were targeting her a lot, but Allisha is a pretty tough kid.   But like I said, she didn't have her normal game.   
But we had a lot of other players step up and do a good job in there.   I thought N'Dea did some good things.   Even though Jamie didn't shoot that good, she made the big one that we needed to go into overtime.   We just needed a little bit more from some other ones.   Latifah usually has a little better game than she did today, but she had a little bit of a foot problem going on.   
But anyway, that's why it's called a team.   Everybody has got to step up when other people aren't playing that well.   
But I really felt like we was going to pull it out, especially after we went into overtime.   
   
 Q.   Danielle, how physical was that game in the paint?   
DANIELLE BUTTS:   To be honest, I don't think it was as physical as the Georgia Tech game.   I think in the paint‑wise, Georgia Tech was a lot more physical.   I just felt like it was just a regular battle in the post.   
   
 Q.   Brittany, when you see Louisville going to the free‑throw line at the end of the overtime period, what's going through your head about what you guys are going to do on the next play and everything?   
BRITTANY ROUNTREE:   One thing, we were talking to each other, remain confident and just go down and we were just ready to execute the next play because we were confident that we would get the win.   
   
 Q.   Danielle, what was the emotional difference there after Jamie makes the buzzer beater there at the end of the regulation and then with the game ending the way it did, what was the difference there in terms of the emotion displayed by you guys?   
DANIELLE BUTTS:   It definitely gave us a boost when Jamie hit that shot to tie and go into overtime, it was definitely a boost, and it was like, okay, we've got another chance to pull this one off.   The momentum carried us back and we didn't finish, but it was a big energy booster, confidence booster.   
   
 Q.   Coach, you had the 20‑5 run there in the second half, pushed the lead out to 10 but had a stretch where you turned the ball over five or six times in the span of four minutes.   How much of that was on your team and how much of that would you put toward Louisville?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL:   Well, again, we're running three different people at point guard because Latifah was struggling some out there.   But I think they stepped it up a lot.   They started going inside a lot more, and we came down and missed some shots, and they got some momentum going.   
We got some transition going during that time.   Jessica and Jamie were out there and really pushing the ball good, and we made some big shots and all.   But then it just turned the other way, and we couldn't get stops, and then they started getting on the foul line and so, you know ‑‑ but it's a game of runs like that.   
We were trying to rotate people and give people some rest, but of course eventually I went back with Latifah because of experience, but I did think that at times Jamie did some nice things, and then also Jessica, as well.   Jessica had 16 points, and I really thought that one in the corner was going in because she's a really good three‑point shooter, and that would have really probably gave us a boost, maybe could have helped us carry it on through.   
But again, that's just the way it went.   
   
 Q.   Latifah, tough night right now, but obviously you got a good little bit of time to get ready for the NCAA Tournament.   What are you hoping to take out of this?   
LATIFAH COLEMAN:   I just hope this loss brings us more together as a team and we just build on the things that we didn't do and just go and practice and regroup and come out ready to play in the NCAA Tournament.   
   
 Q.   Coach, with about 10 seconds to go in overtime you were down by three, Jamie drives in for the lay‑up, about four seconds to go.   Was your philosophy did you want to see a three‑pointer there?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL:   We were trying to run an early ball screen and we had, I guess, three‑point shooters in there, and they were spread out everywhere, so I told her to get the early ball screen and take it in there and get it to one of them because I think we had Jessica and Brittany and‑‑ who was in there, Latifah, Jamie, but there was one other one.   But yeah, they were spread out, so I told her to get an early ball screen and try to take it in there and dish it out to one of those.   But Jamie is a freshman and she took it in there, but she'll learn from it.   I thought we fouled the right people at the end.   We got the ball back and set some things up the way we wanted them, but just couldn't quite knock them down.  
We went in there, to start overtime, we went inside a couple times, with Stephanie because I really felt like Stephanie got going in there and she would score and we could get on the foul line and stuff, but it didn't work.
