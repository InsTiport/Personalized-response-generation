  Q. Have you had a chance to bond with your fellow countrymen?   
 LEANDRO BARBOSA: I have seen a couple. I really enjoy it with them. It is great to see everybody together.  
 I wish the best for the Suns. We have a good team. With Terry or without him, we will do okay.  
  
  Q. What's your take on what's going on with this team currently?  
 LEANDRO BARBOSA: I'm thinking not even me, nobody knows what's going on. We know we can do better than what we're doing. But we are not following through. We will work after the break and everything will be okay.
