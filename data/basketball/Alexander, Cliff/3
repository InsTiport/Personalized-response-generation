 Q.   You were really aggressive tonight, got going early.   Did it feel good?  
CLIFF ALEXANDER:   Yeah, yeah, I felt good going into the game.   Coach told me come out and play my hardest, and that's what I did.  
   
 Q.   Frank, can you tell the difference in the way this team plays defense compared to last year?  
FRANK MASON III:   Right now I'd say it's kind of too early, but I can say this year's defensive team, we try a little harder than last year.   That's what I think.   
   
 Q.   Frank, what did you think about Cliff tonight?   
FRANK MASON III:   Cliff was great the first half.   Got in, got offensive rebounds, defensive rebounds, and he even scored inside.   He was a big plus tonight.   
   
 Q.   Cliff, any nerves at all?   
CLIFF ALEXANDER:   Yeah, I had the butterflies going into the game and I loosened up when the game started.  
   
 Q.   How bad were they out there?   
CLIFF ALEXANDER:   They weren't that bad.   I dealt with it pretty good.   Just tried to keep my man off it.   
   
 Q.   Coach joked about you fouling a lot in practice.   How did you stay away from that?   
CLIFF ALEXANDER:   Just walling up, playing great defense in the post and moving my feet.   
   
 Q.   Devonte', any nerves for you?   
DEVONTE' GRAHAM:   Any nerves?   Of course, I was a little nervous before the game, but going out, warming up, it all went away quick.  
   
 Q.   Coach talked about how there's a lot of room to grow.   Do you feel like you're kind of scratching the surface?   
CLIFF ALEXANDER:   It ain't even started yet.   I think by the end of the season, I think I could potentially reach my peak.  
   
 Q.   What do you think that peak could be?   
CLIFF ALEXANDER:   Better post moves, getting stronger, consistent jump shot.   
   
 Q.   Frank, do you think it's a little more want‑to in the defense that we're seeing with this group?   
FRANK MASON III:   Yeah, I would say so because that's something coach emphasizes like every day at practice because we're young, and obviously the game is more faster at the college level.   He just emphasized that a lot with the young guys and with the returning players.   That's something we try to take pride in and do a better job of.   
   
 Q.   Did you sense from last year that that needed to take a step team‑wise?   
FRANK MASON III:   I would say so because I didn't think we were great last year on the defensive end.   We had Joe inside that protected the rim, kind of made us look a little better on the defensive end, but we don't have that size this year, so guys got to keep their man in front of them and play great team defense.   
   
 Q.   Devonte', as a freshman class where do you feel like you guys are right now?  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM:   I don't think we're where we're capable of being, but I mean, we're young, so we've got to grow and go through the freshman pains and just keep our heads up.   Coach is going to get on us.   He expects us to make mistakes and just keep playing and go to the next play.   
   
 Q.   Coach talked about playing multiple ball handlers.   When you're out there with Frank, is it just whoever gets the ball can push or how have you guys developed together as a combination?   
DEVONTE' GRAHAM:   We try to play fast, so it's like get the rebound and whoever they outlet it to we're pushing, trying to get transition buckets.   
   
 Q.   Frank, how do you think the team ran the fast break tonight?  
FRANK MASON III:   I think we're pretty solid.   We could have been better.   We pitched the ball ahead a little bit, but we could have done a better job.   
   
 Q.   The block where they called the foul on you, do you think you were pretty aggressive on that play?   
CLIFF ALEXANDER:   Yeah, I think it was a clean block.
