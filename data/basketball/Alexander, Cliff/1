FLORIDA   65
  KANSAS - 71

Q.   (No microphone.)
CLIFF ALEXANDER:   You got to stick with it and need to keep playing through it, even when you're missing shots. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
WAYNE SELDEN:   We have been at that point so far this season, as you know, we didn't handle it well. 
But we were able to do the total opposite thing, whatever we did at half time that last time, and then tried to do the total opposite thing and come out and really switch it.   And we did a good job with it. 

Q.   Is it tough to be patient when you can't make anything?   How do you guys stay so focused? 
CLIFF ALEXANDER:   It's just chipping away.   The TV timeouts, just going to try to win that four minutes, win that four minutes, and just chip away at it.   There's no 18 point plays or 10 point plays.   We just got to stay persistent. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
DEVONTE' GRAHAM:   Oh, we need him every game.   He's the big part of the team, of course, one of the best players.   So we feed off of him and you seen what happened, like, he played ‑‑ the way he played and shot the ball.   And we just fed off of it on the defensive end and it helped us a lot. 

Q.   (No Microphone.)
WAYNE SELDEN:   We were able to pressure their two small guards, because they got two quick guards as well, and it really takes the pressure off of us‑‑ me, BG, Kelly.
And when you got two point guards, and either one of them can bring it up, I can bring it up, it just really helps us. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CLIFF ALEXANDER:   Just working on it.   You're not going to make them every night.   You got to stay persistent, you know, your hard work's going to pay off.   You got to just keep shooting the ball.

Q.   How much does this help your confidence going forward?   Is that something that's maybe wavered over the last couple of weeks? 
DEVONTE' GRAHAM:   At times it would really‑‑ I would get unconfident last year, but there's no reason to be unconfident when you have confidence in your coach and your teammates.   So you just got to stay with it. 

Q.   Tell me what you were missing in the first half.
CLIFF ALEXANDER:   I think the first half, we gave up too many offensive rebounds and they are maybe more athletic than us and got to the offensive glass every time.   And we just couldn't make any shots and they were just going in the first half. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CLIFF ALEXANDER:   Just kept telling the team on the bench, we got to keep fighting, keep fighting.   We're not going to lose at home. 

Q.   What about you, Wayne? 
WAYNE SELDEN:   Definitely.   It's hard when‑‑ it's hard for them when you got 16,300 people going crazy like they did tonight. 
So it's not really like they're playing against the five on the court, they're playing against 16,305.   And so that's really to the fans and they really brought to us this win. 

Q.   Cliff, how did you adjust to Florida's size in the second half? 
CLIFF ALEXANDER:   We got to play more aggressive and be able to do what I usually do, just rebound the ball and send me to the line and just make consistent free throws. 

Q.   Is that something you've improved on, your free throw shooting?
CLIFF ALEXANDER:   Yeah, I work on it every day in practice. 

Q.   Devonte', what was the coach's halftime message, his main message and what was the tone? 
DEVONTE' GRAHAM:   It wasn't pretty good. 
But, it was just we had to be aggressive.   In the first half, we weren't‑‑ we were too passive, taking a lot of jump shots.
He got on, like, me, Wayne, and Frank for not getting in the paint and making plays.   We were being just so soft and not attacking it. 
So‑‑ and it was just come out and go play by play by play and get a stop and get a basket and run the offense and do what we had to do. 

Q.   Were you surprised how quick their guards were in the first half? 
DEVONTE' GRAHAM:   Not surprised because we watched them on film on them, we go over scouting reports.   So, we know basically everything about them.   I don't think we were ready to play at the beginning of the game. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
WAYNE SELDEN:   A lot of energy in the locker room, from the coaches standpoint.   We just had to just keep it together, that was the biggest thing. 
We knew that we just can't let what happened‑‑ that what already happened, happen again.   We were just trying to build.   We know we're nowhere near where we're going to be and we're just trying to fight until we get there. 

Q.   What kind of confidence does it give to you play those 15 minutes in the second half when you guys made that run? 
DEVONTE' GRAHAM:   What kind of confidence? 

Q.   For you to be in the lineup then. 
DEVONTE' GRAHAM:   I mean, it's a confidence booster knowing that coach trusts me down like through a stretch like that. 
I mean, the whole team and coaching staff have confidence in me, so I'm not really low on confidence, but it's a good confidence being in there at the end of the game like that. 

Q.   What's it mean to get a comeback victory like that for you guys? 
DEVONTE' GRAHAM:   Well, it's a good, it's a good teaching experience.   Learning experience.   But we shouldn't have been down like that anyway at home especially.   But like Wayne said, second half, the crowd definitely helped us win this game tonight.
