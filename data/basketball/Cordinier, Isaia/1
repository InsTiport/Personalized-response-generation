THE MODERATOR: If you could just start with an opening statement.
ISAIA CORDINIER: Hi, everybody.
Q. Speak about your game and what you bring to the Hawks, please.
ISAIA CORDINIER: I think I can bring a lot of things, a lot of energy, a lot of emotion on the court, like play hard on defense, and that's it.  Nothing fancy that you have to do on the court.
