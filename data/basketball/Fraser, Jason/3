<p>	Q.  Randy, you've been in that position a couple of times.  What is it like to finally get one? </p>
<p>	Q.  What was everybody saying to you when they were hugging you at the end of the game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jason, I know you never lose heart, but did you guys think you were going to ever get one of these to fall your way?  Was it frustrating? </p>
<p>	Q.  Randy, you said there have been times where you got the ball at the end of the game and things didn't turn out right.  Are there a couple of ones that were particularly excruciating for you to not have it go your way? </p>
<p>	Q.  What happened with Seton Hall?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jason, you describe that block, did you see him fully, was it out of the corner of your eye?  How did that come about? </p>
<p>	Q.  How do you get back for tomorrow against Providence, a question for all three? </p>


<p>	Q.  Randy, you had missed so many of those closing shots.  Did you feel it was about time you were able to make one of them? </p>
<p>	Q.  Randy is in that situation time and time again.  Why Randy? </p>
<p>	Q.  Randy, I'm sure Marcus is going to feel like you pushed off on that one.  Can you explain how that play went down for you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, when you came out here, you lost a lot of games which, quite frankly, were some bad breaks.  How does it feel to finally get one?  What were you thinking in those final moments of the game when things looked like they were unraveling? </p>
<p>	Q.  Again, Randy, you're a local guy.  You have a lot of people in the building.  How many people did you have in the building?  What will you do to celebrate tonight? </p>
