THE MODERATOR:   We have Coach Thompson, Jason Clark, and Hollis Thompson.   Coach, an opening statement?   
COACH THOMPSON:   Questions.  
   
 Q.   Coach, can you just speak to the intensity of that game all night long?   
COACH THOMPSON:   I mean, that's what you expect when you have the quality of the teams that are here.   I didn't see all the games, but I would guess most of them were very similar to that.   You have some pretty good teams here.   You have some competitive coaches and some competitive players, and that's what's going to happen.  
   
 Q.   You approached this game a little bit of a measuring stick for a young team.   How do you think they measured up tonight?   
COACH THOMPSON:   Not‑‑ it's frustrating.   That's a good team.   In as much as they don't have guys with a lot of starters, they have guys with experience.   With that being said, the things that we can control that we didn't control.   You're going to play against good teams.   They're going to do a lot of things to you that you can't do anything about.   
But there are a few things that we can control.   We're not going to be singing this young team song all year.   These guys are ready to play.   
So what grade they're in doesn't matter.   We have to take care of our business a little better.   Maybe there is a function to it, but I don't know.   We have to take care of our business better in key parts of the game.  
   
 Q.   It seemed both teams started a little bit slow, but then the intensity really picked up.   Did you guys learn anything about your team tonight?   
COACH THOMPSON:   I tell you after I go back and calm down maybe I can answer that better.   But the start was we were coming down and taking too many quick threes and not making them work and not getting different things.   I want to say the first two minutes of the game, first two minutes, I forget the exact timeframe.   Then we did settle down a little bit.   
But you come to this tournament to see where you stand.   You come to this tournament knowing that the games are going to be intense.   
So overall, was tonight a good experience?   In a couple of hours or days I might be able to say, yes, it was, but sitting here right now it's a tough loss.  
   
 Q.   What was your plan going in to defend Thomas Robinson, and how did you feel about the way you guys did with him?   How would you evaluate the way he played?   
COACH THOMPSON:   He played very well.   We wanted‑‑ we did not execute our plan.   We wanted him to take 12, 15‑foot jump shots0.   Now their guards did a very good job of getting into the meat of our defense, and our bigs probably stepped up a little bit too much and ended up with what feels like 14 dunks.   That's what I'm talking about, stuff that we can control.   Stuff that we talked about.   Stuff that we knew they like to go to.   We have to do a much better job on a go‑forward basis of executing the game plan and listening to things and talking about the scouting reports.   
But that's what he does.   He's physical.   He's aggressive.   They do a very good job of creating isolations for him.   They do a very good job of putting our bigs in a position where you have to make a choice.   
Do you step up on Taylor who is coming down the lane to make a lay‑up, or do you stay at home on Thomas?   That's what they did.  
   
 Q.   Hollis, it seemed like Kansas slowed you down a little more in the second half, and your stroke was going easier in the first.   So what did they do to change in the second half to switch that up on you?   
HOLLIS THOMPSON:   Took open shots, and I felt like we took a lot of early shots in the first half, and in the second half we made them play a little more open shots (Inaudible).  
   
 Q.   Coach, did you guys feel like you were better in the zone or out of the zone against Kansas?   
COACH THOMPSON:   It went in stretches.   It depended on the group we had in the game.   For parts of the game it was effective, and they had a couple of runs there where they went to the play that they go to a lot.   They put two guys on one block and screen, and they got that I feel like two or three times in a row.   
We just didn't execute at the defensive end, and we knew that's what they looked for.   But I think that our zone can be and will be effective.   It just wasn't for long enough stretches today.
