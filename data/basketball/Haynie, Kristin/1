   KRISTIN HAYNIE:  It always feels great to come back home and play in front of my friends and family.  It's too bad we didn't pull this one out today, but, you know, I think both teams fought hard.  Give credit to Detroit's defense.  They took us out of our offense.   
 Our offense wasn't as sharp as it was in Game 1.  We're just going to have a good practice tomorrow and watch film on our mistakes.   
  
  Q.  Did you just get tired there in the fourth quarter, the team collectively, or what was it?   
 KRISTIN HAYNIE:  No, I don't think we were tired.  You know.  We played a lot of people.  A lot of people played minimum minutes.  We have a good bench, we have great starters.   
 I just think we've just got to get over that mental toughness.  I don't think fatigue played a role in that, but we've just got to get our defense back and come back ready for Game 3 in Sac.
