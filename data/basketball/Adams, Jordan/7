THE MODERATOR:   We're joined by UCLA.   Jordan Adams and Norman Powell, and Coach, we will begin with a statement. 
COACH ALFORD:   I'm really pleased with our team.   Coming off the Pac 12 Tournament.   We played really well and shot the ball at a high level and I thought Tulsa did a great job in the first half in particular, and we got out of rhythm, and we didn't make shots we normally had been making but for forty minutes our defense was really consistent I thought and we held them to 34% on one half and 38% the next and to hold them to that and did a much better job on the boards on the second half.   I like the way these guys are guarding.   We've got a lot of guys scoring, we got a lot of balance, a lot of guys that can make shots and we take care of the basketball, we did that again tonight.   We go to another level when we guard and I thought we did a really good job of guarding tonight.

Q.   Norman, you had that baseline drive off the steal with about four minutes to go.   Can you talk about the lift that gave you guys and coming back to San Diego and playing, juror experience? 
NORMAN POWELL:   I thought it was a great energy boost for our team being able to make that play.   Coach emphasized getting out‑of‑bound stops and that's what we did and I was able just to make a good play and get the "and one" and lift our team and I felt that will energized us and helped to get them through those minutes.   To answer the question about back home it's a great feeling.   I'm glad I'm back home competing in front of family and friends and I'm glad we got the win with this team. 
THE MODERATOR:   Questions for the student athletes? 

Q.   Jordan, talk about the difference in the feeling this year in the lock we are room in preparation for this game as opposed to last year.   I know you missed out last year.   What was that like to be back in the miss and to win this one? 
JORDAN ADAMS:   This was my first NCAA Tournament experience and I would not like to do it with any other guys and coach, and I liked the experience and I hope we can keep it rolling. 

Q.   Norman and Jordan, did you guys feel in the locker room that you should have been up by more and let them hang around a little bit? 
JORDAN ADAMS:   They competed well in the first half and both teams battled hard.   We were just glad we were able to break away in the second half. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.   We will continue with Coach Alford.   Questions for him? 

Q.   Coach Alford, when Tulsa is at its best, James Woodard gets tons of touches both to make plays and get shots.   Was that central to your defensive game plan? 
COACH ALFORD:   Absolutely.   We don't do a lot of "no help" but we guarded him like we did Randall in the Pac 12 tournament and we weren't going to leave him.   I thought we did a poor job in transition and Norman had done a really good job on him and he was outstanding in the second half auto him but in transition he got away from us in the first half and we talked about that he was on pace for a 28‑night, to where he got 28 points and 8 rebounds and those are above his numbers.   We felt like we wanted somebody else to have to score.   We respect James Woodard and we thought he was their catalyst and you get this late in the year let's see somebody else make shots, make points and I thought the second half, holding him to 1 point and getting him off the backboard, we did a really good job in the second half on him. 
THE MODERATOR:   Any other questions for Coach?   Thank you.
