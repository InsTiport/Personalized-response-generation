  LA SALLE - 66 
  
COACH BOB McKILLOP:   I thought John Giannini and his team put us on our heels with an outstanding effort, and it's sad that a team that is winning for 39 minutes and 59 seconds has to go home and lose, my heart feels for John and his team.   
I've been with team, six, seven months, and after all we've been through, I'm still shocked to have a performance like we had today, come back like we did today, still shocks me.   These guys will forever be shocking me with how poised they are, how selfless they are, how team oriented they are, what extraordinary teammates they are.   So we are thrilled with this victory.   
   
 Q.   Tyler, take us through the last play.   
TYLER KALINOSKI:   You know, it went by really fast.   We brought the ball up.   Jack did a good job attacking.   Got it to Brian.   He passed it to me and when I looked up, there was about four or five seconds left.   I just told myself, you know, attack the rim, because if I attack‑‑ I can catch an open shooter.   
Then I made a move, saw the lane open, saw the shot‑blocker coming over and I knew I just had to get it high enough to get over him and give it a chance to go in, and luckily for us it did.   
   
 Q.   Jack, you guys were down 13 coming right out of halftime and they make two buckets and you hit those two threes which really started the friend for you guys to break it back into single digits.   Just talk about the mentality of coming out in the second half.   
JACK GIBBS:   We always think about coming out second half as momentum.   We want to get the momentum of the game switch to our end.   We had not had it for much of the first half.   Coach tell us to run our offense and if we hit singles, we'll get open shots, and we got open shots and we were lucky enough to make them.   
   
 Q.   Tyler, the ball lands awkwardly on the rim‑‑ were you going for glass or were you trying to scoop it in?   Did you feel it right as it was coming off your fingers?   How certain or uncertain were you?   
TYLER KALINOSKI:   I don't know if I was going for glass or not.   One thing we do in practice a lot, Coach always tell us to shoot it high, because if you shoot it high, you give it a better chance to go in the basket.   When I saw the shot‑blocker coming over, I definitely knew I had to get it as high as I could.   
But yeah, I don't think I was going for either one.   When I shot it, I knew it had a chance to go in, and luckily it did.   
   
 Q.   When you get the rebound, any thoughts of the time‑out?   Coach didn't call it but late in the shot clock you were out pretty far.   Any thoughts of a time‑out at that point?   
TYLER KALINOSKI:   Yeah, I did have some thoughts.   Just trusted Coach would put us in the best situation to win the game.   When Jack was bringing it up and he didn't call time‑out, I knew we just had to attack and that's what we did.   
   
 Q.   At any level, have you had a game winner?   
TYLER KALINOSKI:   I have.   The last game winner I think I had was middle school, so it was a while ago.   
   
 Q.   And was it even remotely comparable?   
TYLER KALINOSKI:   I don't think so.   I don't think so.   
   
 Q.   Do you remember it at all?   
TYLER KALINOSKI:   Yeah, I mean, it was in our like little city tournament in the semifinals and it was just a putback.   You know, it's pretty special, but I've been on a lot of teams, and this is probably one of the most special teams I've been on.   This one's pretty special.   
   
 Q.   I'd like you to go through the sequence on‑‑ you guys had a five‑point possession, could have been a six‑point possession but you made the three after Tyler's miss.   You had some free throw issues today but managed to fight through.   
JACK GIBBS:   Yeah, we got to the line, made one.   Jordan came up big with the rebound and then we went into a time‑out and Coach drew up a play.   They went under the screen, so I popped back and saw the guy closing down.   And lucky enough I was able to go out over his outstretched arms and lucky enough to go in.  
   
 Q.   Going back to the non‑time‑out call; is that a philosophy of yours, or do you just play it by ear?   
COACH BOB McKILLOP:   The way they were defending us, we were having a lot of time to create offense, and when you get a team in transition backpedalling, no communication from the bench because it's far away; our guys are talented enough that they could make plays.   
With Jack on the court and Brian on the court, and Tyler on the court, I had to trust in them, and that's probably the biggest word, trust; that I trusted something was going to happen.   
   
 Q.   You said it a couple of times this season, you just said it now, that this is a special group.   When did you first begin to sense that, and why?   
COACH BOB McKILLOP:   When we were‑‑ it happened in late November and in early December.   We had games in a one‑week span against Central Florida at Central Florida, and Montana at Montana.   
Now if you look at the records of those two teams, they didn't have banner years.   But we had outstanding performances in very difficult environments.   Montana was two plane trips.   And in both of those games, those teams came after us and knocked us to the mat hard and we responded back, blow‑for‑blow, and then went and fought, got them on the ropes and kept them there.  
I came back from Montana, and anyone who ever heard the post‑game press conference at Montana on the radio, I was exhilarated.   I was exuberant.   I was just out of my mind with how thrilling our guys were.   We put 110 points on the board and they made great plays, Montana.   They just hit us and hit us and hit us.   And we come back and make a great play; and then they make one; and then we make one; and it went back and forth.   I said, wow, these guys are pretty special.  
Then we go to Charlottesville two or three weeks later, and we went blow to blow with Virginia.   And we didn't have Jordan in that game.   He had a concussion.   Jake Belford had just tore his ACL, so he was out.   We bent blow to blow with them for about 32, 33 minutes.   
So as we turned the new year into conference, I thought, we might have something pretty special here.  
   
 Q.   Everyone is going to remember Tyler's shot but for the final 4:51 you hold them without apoint.   Could you talk about the defensive effort?   
COACH BOB McKILLOP:   Yeah, credit our assistant coaches.   They were masters at changing defenses and getting the right match‑ups in there.   My assistant coaches are extraordinary, absolutely extraordinary.   
   
 Q.   What were you able to do early on throughout most of the first half?   They obviously wanted to go down low with their big guys.   
COACH BOB McKILLOP:   We came out in the second half and we played the post entry a little bit differently.   We had played on the top shoulder of the post and then we sat behind his butt after that.   So that if we did catch it, at least he wasn't in a position where he was sliding off of us.   We had to actually put a wall up so that his only option was to turn into the paint, rather than drop baseline.  
I think that Andrew McAuliffe came off the bench to use his bulk and size to really be a force doing that.  
   
 Q.   Why has this small lineup been so effective for you guys?   
COACH BOB McKILLOP:   Because all five of them can make plays.   You see Jordan can put it on the floor and really get to the rim.   Peyton Aldrige can handle close to a guard and can shoot the ball from three.   And of course, the three other guys are point guards, shooting guard, body guards, lead guards, whatever you want to call them.  
   
 Q.   How big was the shot at the end of the half?   
COACH BOB McKILLOP:   I think the two possessions at the end of the half got us, I think it was back‑to‑back threes.   We went into the locker room, and we have this thing called "Big Mo."   We want to go into the locker room in that last minute and really dominate that last minute.   
So I walk into the locker room, and I'm, "Yay!!" And they walk into the locker room (indicating grumbling/barking).   
What kind of halftime talk are you going to have?   Well, mine is going to be pretty uplifting.   What's theirs going to be like?   (indicating grumbling sounds of frustration).   That's our whole theory.   
   
 Q.   How do you write that?   (Laughter) You went 1‑3‑1 at the end‑‑ did the assistants come up with that?  
COACH BOB McKILLOP:   Yeah, in fact, on our last possession, we were going to go man, and Matt and Will, the three of them just said, well, 4‑1, let's stay with the 1‑3‑1.   It was completely the assistants' call.   And there's the trust factor again.   I'm trusting these guys and it's extraordinary to have that relationship.
