Kentucky 86, Tennessee 65
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Tennessee.
We will start with an opening statement from coach.
KELLIE HARPER: We're disappointed. But Kentucky just played a terrific basketball game. I think the second quarter got away from us. We had a few too many plays that we needed to execute better both offensively and defensively. Allowed them to go on a run and get really comfortable.
When that team is comfortable, they make shots. I mean, we were throwing a lot of different defenses at them, but they kept finding people that put the ball in the hole.
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.
Q. Rennia, from your experience before in the SEC tournament, having to play last night against a team with fresh legs tonight in Kentucky, what impact might that have had on this game?
RENNIA DAVIS: I honestly don't think it had an impact. I really think it was all us. I don't think we executed as well as we could have, especially on the defensive end. So, yeah, I'm really disappointed in that.
Q. Lou, when you think about what this team is bringing back for next year, what are some of the highlights?
LOU BROWN: I think this team with Kellie's guidance, this team has a bright future ahead of them. They have so much talent coming back. You'll have freshmen that have a lot of experience under their belts now, big playing minutes, in the SEC tournament and throughout the SEC. I think that in itself will push the team ahead next season.
Q. Rennia, as you think about your off-season, what you want to improve going into your senior year, what does that look like?
RENNIA DAVIS: Just stay in the gym and keep working whatever the team needs me to do. Continue to crash the boards. Just continue to try to communicate with my teammates and build those relationships off the court. I think it will help translate over.
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you.
Coach, any final thoughts?
KELLIE HARPER: I don't think our season is over. Hopefully these players aren't thinking about next year right now. I hope they're still thinking about the NCAA tournament.
