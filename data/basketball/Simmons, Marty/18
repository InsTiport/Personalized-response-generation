 COACH SIMMONS: Like to give Missouri State credit. They battled. They are a tough team, and they made more plays there at the end than we did but I'm very, very proud of our basketball team, because I thought they competed extremely hard and they battled adversity a lot of different times this year. We didn't get the result we wanted, but it wasn't because of lack of effort.   
  
  Q. What kind of improvements did you see from your team this year from week one until now?  
 COACH SIMMONS: Well, I think we improved in most areas really. But probably the most important was just togetherness. I think through the adversity of what we had to go through with injuries and so on and so forth, I thought it brought these guys closer together. I thought they did a really good job of coming to practice every day with a good attitude to improve. I guess an area in the game of basketball I thought as the season progressed, we did a better job of taking care of the basketball and that's an important thing for us; if we do that, then more times than not, we are going to give ourselves a chance to win.   
  
  Q. This post-season, I know it's getting ahead of ourselves, but this off-season coming up, what does this team have to do to be more competitive next year and play the way it did here in the last few weeks the entire season?   
 COACH SIMMONS: I think we have got to learn from our mistakes, and we have got to get a lot stronger. I mean, we've just got to get stronger both mentally and physically. But there's a lot of individual, fundamental skills that I think right down the line that each player has to commit to to get better.   
 And I think they will.   
  
  Q. Denver, Kyle Weems looked like pulled you aside at the end of the game. Everybody was battling through the game; what did he say at the end?   
 DENVER HOLMES: I played at AU with Kyle and we are good friends and we've been talking this week just a little bit. He just told us way to finish the season out and we gave him a tough game and for a second there, he thought we had gone 4-down on him. He was just telling us that we finished the season strong and he's proud of us.   
  
  Q. The way you were playing better at the end of the season; it seemed like Lacey was 100% healthy, what impact did he have coming in and getting fully healthy?  
 COACH SIMMONS: I thought he did play well in these last three or four games, or more towards the end of the season there. I think he got more confidence. I thought our entire team did. I thought we played better the last month for sure. I just felt like each and every guy played with more confidence and you know, he's been -- he's battled injuries quite a bit early in the season, but really the last month or couple months, he was pretty healthy. I think it was more confidence than anything else.
