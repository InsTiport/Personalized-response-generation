 Q.  Any thoughts on the Pacific Northwest and just being in Seattle? 
 SAER SENE:  I'm sorry, I don't understand. 

 Q.  Any thoughts about Seattle, about the City of Seattle and also tell us, in Senegal, this must be a very big event, the fact that you're drafted in the first round of the NBA, this has to be big news back home.
