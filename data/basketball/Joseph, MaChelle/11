Duke   82
  Georgia Tech ‑ 52

COACH MaCHELLE JOSEPH:   Obviously we found out today exactly why Duke is one of the top ten teams in the country.   I really felt like their seniors stepped up and played extremely tough, especially on the boards and just ripping balls out of our hands.   I think we kind of got on our heels.   We hit a wall and we never really recovered. 
It seemed like we spent a lot of energy yesterday, and we didn't have much left in the second half and just felt like they were able to make some plays and we couldn't match their effort level on the boards. 

Q.   Coach, you played them toe‑to‑toe in the first part of the game.   What specifically happened that you were not able to sustain them? 
COACH MaCHELLE JOSEPH:   I think one of the things was we were not able to make shots.   We shot 26 percent for the game.   We weren't able to make shots.   When we can't make shots we can't set our defense.   We get our momentum from scoring, setting our defense, build on momentum from that.   We just weren't able to hit shots.   And when you don't hit shots, then it's difficult for us to maintain our intensity level on the defensive end. 

Q.   What lessons are you looking to give your team out of this since you're going to be in the NCAA after this?
COACH MaCHELLE JOSEPH:   I definitely think one of the things we've got to understand is the level of intensity and toughness it takes.   [Inaudible.]
I think when you have another 3‑point shooter that helps spread the floor, I think that really helps.   Obviously we were hurting today without Sydney Wallace.   She's one of our best 3‑point shooters and has been playing extremely well down the stretch.   It's just a different game for us against the zone. 
I think Kaela has learned a lot of lessons throughout the course of this year.   But I've been very impressed with the way she's come back from games like this, what her response has been.   You can knock her down, but you can't keep her down.   She's just a very tough player, tough‑minded player.   And obviously a very special freshman. 
I really think that she's ‑‑ no doubt in my mind that she'll learn from this experience playing Duke and all the top ten teams we played this year, we played over ten.   I think she's grown with each one of them.   I definitely think she'll come back in the NCAA tournament and have an answer.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
TYAUNNA MARSHALL:   Playing against the zone, like Coach said, without Syd today, so it was kind of a struggle.   Kaela being primarily the only 3‑point shooter on the floor, besides Aaliyah.   She just couldn't get shots today and it got wider and wider.   They had some height, but it was something, like I said, got spread further and further without hitting 3‑point shots and getting the ball inside.

Q.   You played Duke earlier in the season where they were more or less full strength in terms of their roster.   Can you compare Duke then and Duke now and what was different about them today? 
COACH MaCHELLE JOSEPH:   You know, obviously they were without their point guard, so I think that was a little bit different.   But I think it was more about us today as far as the difference in the game.   I really felt like we didn't make the plays that we made earlier in the season.   And I really felt like, again, we were playing without another 3‑point shooter, so we weren't able to run, and our point guard.   Both of us were without a point guard today. 
You really can't compare the two times we played them.   And we played a game yesterday and our starters played 38 minutes.   It's just kind of a whole different situation today than it was the first time we played them.   Obviously they're a different team, but I think their seniors have done a tremendous job leading them through this adversity that they faced.
