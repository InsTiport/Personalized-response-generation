 Q.  So you apparently knew about the trade before it was actually even going down, correct? 
 LaMARCUS ALDRIDGE:  No, I really didn't.  My agent had some kind of idea about it, but I really didn't know, and then, you know, once he found out that it was really going to happen, he kind of gave me the heads-up, but I really didn't know. 

 Q.  So when exactly did you get the heads-up? 
 LaMARCUS ALDRIDGE:  Right before they said my name.  They said, "They are going to call your name in a minute, but don't worry about it, they are going to trade you." 

 Q.  How excited are you to be entering the league? 
 LaMARCUS ALDRIDGE:  This is where I wanted to get my whole career and college.  So I'm just happy to be here in this new family and just try to do my best. 

 Q.  Going to the Portland Trail Blazers, Zach Randolph, how do you feel about that? 
 LaMARCUS ALDRIDGE:  I feel great about it because they are in the process of trying to rebuild and trying to start something new. 
 I feel privileged to be a part of that and just to be a part of something new and hopefully I can do well there. 

 Q.  What do you think your greatest assets are as a basketball player that you can bring to the team? 
 LaMARCUS ALDRIDGE:  Just to be able to get up and down and being long and being able to guard many positions and the 4 and 5; and on the defensive end, you know, I think eventually by my end of the career I'll be able to guard the 3, too.  And just developing and continuing to become the player that I want to be.
