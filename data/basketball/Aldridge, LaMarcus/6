Q. What's it like being at your first All-Star Weekend as a member of the San Antonio Spurs?
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: It's the same so far, just have to do media and take pictures.  No, it's been fun.  Having Kawhi [Leonard] here and the whole coaching staff here, it's been a good experience and it's been fun so far.
Q. This is Kobe Bryant's last All-Star Weekend, his last season.  What is your favorite memory of either watching him or playing against him?
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: That's tough.  He's had so many moments that guys would never really have in the NBA.  I think probably one of the moments that would stick out to me, we're playing in L.A. and we're in a stretch where he went 86 or whatever that stretch was, and I think we got 62, I don't know what it was in Portland.  And we were just trapping him and he was taking shots over two or three guys and knocking them down.  I think that's when I got to see firsthand how good he was.
Q. LaMarcus, every time you visit Toronto, do you have a favorite Canadian food?
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: I do not.
Q. How about Timbits or a Double Double from Tim Horton's?
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: Excuse me?
Q. Tim Horton's a favorite restaurant in Toronto.
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: Tim Horton's?  I've never heard of it.  I never leave my hotel when I come here.  I always order room service.  My favorite dish is room service.
Q. If you need me to bring you forty Timbits and ten Double Doubles for you, I could do that.
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: What's a Double Double?
Q. It's a coffee with two milks and two sugars.
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: I don't drink coffee, though.
Q. Well, they have smoothies, too.
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: I'll do smoothies.  Is it a Double Double smoothie?
Q. Yeah, and Timbits and Boston cream, anything you want?
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: Okay, I'm in.  I'll try it.
Q. What is the difference working with Coach Pop?
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: A lot of things are different.  He's just a different guy.  He looks at the game differently.  He approaches it differently.  I think the way he coaches is just different.
Q. And even though you don't score more than 25 points a game, it makes you feel better in the team system?
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: Yeah, it's about winning.  We've been winning, and we're putting ourselves in a position to be special.  So that's what it's about.
Q. Can I get your thoughts on possibly the NBA going with ads on the jerseys in a couple years?  What are your thoughts on that and how that will look?
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: It will be very different.  I kind of like my jersey clean and how it is.  So I'm thinking it will be a different look.  But I think if they did do it, it would be tasteful.
Q. You've gone against Karl-Anthony Towns a few times this season.  What are your thoughts on him as a rookie?
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: Very skilled, big man, a competitor.
Q. Can you name five Canadian celebrities since we're in Toronto?
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: Steve Nash count?
Q. Absolutely.
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: The one very famous hockey player?
Q. I don't know if I can give you that one?
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: It counts.  He's retired now.
Q. I know who you're thinking of.
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: Say his first name.
Q. Rhymes with Dwayne?
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: Yeah, Wayne Gretzky.
Q. That's two.
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: Okay.  Is Big Cat from here?  Jamaal Magloire?  You didn't even know that one.
Q. I didn't.  You stumped me.
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: Cory Joseph.  The young fellow in Minnesota, is he from Canada too?  Wiggins.  I knew those guys.
Q. LaMarcus, what do you think European players bring?
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: A different style, more movement, they're very skilled players.
Q. Last year I asked you if you feel underestimated.  You said yes.  Now do you feel more appreciated?
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: I think that the position is different, but the goal is the same and that's to win a championship and that's to have a great season, and we're doing that.
