Q. You look in the NBA now, who are some guys you feel are not getting the attention that should be in your position?LaMARCUS ALDRIDGE: A lot of guys.  I think Cousins should be in the conversation.  Now he's here.  James wasn't here at first.  Now he's definitely here.  I think it's the process.  I went through the process.  You stick with the process, it pays off.Q. (Inaudible) .LaMARCUS ALDRIDGE: He's grown a lot.  I've seen him since he first came in the league to now.  I think he's matured a lot on the court and off the court.  I think it's been good for him.  Shown him the culture of our team playing.  He's a very talented big guy.Q. His skill set?LaMARCUS ALDRIDGE: He can dribble, he can shoot.  He does it offensively.Q. You mentioned earlier the playoffs, you guys are focusing on fixing the little things.  Your weaknesses, what are they exactly?LaMARCUS ALDRIDGE: I told you, no, just trying to get better defensively, guard the pick-and-roll better.  Being a better team at the rim, not let other teams get to the rim.  Overall trying to guard guys better.Q. Are you happy that Damian is here this weekend?LaMARCUS ALDRIDGE: I'm ecstatic.  He's definitely played well and should be here.  And I'm happy he's here now.Q. A week ago you joked you were a boring All-Star.  What do you mean by that?LaMARCUS ALDRIDGE: Because I don't jump high.  I don't windmill.  I'm kind of like Dirk where I -- maybe even less than Dirk.  I don't do anything flashy.  It's just me being a regular.Q. Will you campaign with Steve to start?LaMARCUS ALDRIDGE: No.  If he wants to start me, he starts.  I'm not going to campaign.Q. It seemed like you came back and had a great game against the Wizards, the next three four games --LaMARCUS ALDRIDGE: Just my mindset.  I'm not going to be wishy-washy.  Once I knew I was in, I was in.  Once I went through the whole process, am I going to be in or am I out, when I was in, I was in.Q. Have you changed your game at all?  You have to catch the ball with your right hand more?LaMARCUS ALDRIDGE: Yes, I have to focus on using my right hand more.  But other than that everything is the same.
