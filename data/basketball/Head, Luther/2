 LUTHER HEAD:  It's great, having the fans behind your side, it makes you want to play, makes you feel good and gives you confidence. 
 I think that's what it did. 
 Q.  How much of this do you consciously try to put on, do you discuss about trying to put on a show for the fans and how much effort goes into that? 
 LUTHER HEAD:  It's all about the fans.  I mean, we play all out, going out there and trying to have fun for them, give them something to look forward to.  We want to have fun this weekend as well, so when we play, we want to try to give them thrills and excitement.
