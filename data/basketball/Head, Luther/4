<p>	Q.  Deron, I know this is hard to do on short notice, but do you think there will come a time that you will look back at this year finally and not remember this game so much?  Can you remember the season as a success? </p>
<p>	Q.  Luther, you did so much to get your team back into this ballgame, I think 13 points in the second half.  When you took that shot about 12 seconds left, what did it look like, what did it feel like?  When you saw the ball bounce that high and hit the backboard, what were your emotions? </p>
<p>	Q.  Luther, as a senior, how would you like to remember this basketball season? </p>
<p>	Q.  At the end of the game when you went over and sat on the Tar Heels bench, what was going through your mind in those minutes? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can any of you talk about if you were at all surprised when Carolina left Felton in with two fouls in the first half?  Bruce, can you also respond to that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Dee, obviously the emotions you went through this year, the way this ended, when do you start to allow yourself thinking about how you can get at it and do it next year?  How long does it take to do that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Dee, will the first half and the fact they jumped out on you, is that going to stick with you for a while, a "what if" thing you play in your head? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about that possession where you had the three chances, and that final turnover when Felton stole the ball? </p>

<p>	Q.  Coach, as a whole, how will you assess this basketball season? </p>
<p>	Q.  What are you going to remember most?  You got a lot of highlights this season. </p>
<p>	Q.  One of the toughest things I would imagine for a coach to do is to somehow console one of your star players who doesn't get that game winning or game tying shot.  What did you say and do for Luther? </p>
<p>	Q.  When it got close, a lot of people thought that you guys would get it done, you found ways when it got close.  Were you thinking that when it got to 70-70? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said on television that the guys didn't come out with much fight in the first half, but had a lot of fight in the second half. </p>
<p>	Q.  Looking back, was there anything that you saw in the locker room before the game or anything that would have indicated that to you? </p>
<p>	Q.  If you could just talk more about what Felton and May did for them tonight.  It seemed like whenever it got to be a pressure situation, those two came through for them. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Williams has been in your position tonight a lot of times.  Did you get a chance to talk to him?</p>
<p>	Q.  You have some guys, Dee and Deron specifically, NBA futures.  What role will you play in that?  When will you sit down and talk to them?</p>
<p>	Q.  The fans, the last couple months. </p>
<p>	Q.  You were down 15 a couple times in the second half.  The Arizona comeback is now legendary.  What did you say to them?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've obviously got a great team.  You had a wonderful season.  If you would, just assess North Carolina's team. </p>
