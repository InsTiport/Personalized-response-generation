  Q.  Talk about being here at All-Star Weekend?   
 LUTHER HEAD:  It's fun.  You always have to be proud of being a part of this.  I've been watching it so long, as a youngster and in college, watching the games.  Now being part of it, it's just special.   
  
  Q.  You and your former Illinois teammate, Deron Williams, get to play again.   
 LUTHER HEAD:  Yeah, I get to play with my boy again.   
 We do it a lot in the summertime, but to do it on the NBA level, it's really fun.
