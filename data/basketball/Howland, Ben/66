<p>	Q.  14-6, sluggish start.  Is that when you turned it up a notch defensively?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, did you have the feeling that early in the year people might not have known much about Pittsburgh?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about how meaningful it is to come in here and beat the team that was the defending champions.  Then to get one game closer of claiming your own championship?</p>
<p>	Q.  Julius or Brandin, people tend to overanalyze this time of year to see what the scenario would be to beat you guys or any team with your guys' kind of record.  The word is out there you can defend anybody on the perimeter.  But if a team has an interior horse like Ryan Humphrey, that might give you trouble.  What would you say to that scenario in the future of this tournament? </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible).  Can you talk about the play coming off the bench?</p>
<p>	Q.  Once you're up 10, 12, even with other teams they seem like they can blow it.  You guys don't turn the ball over.  Does that help that you that once you get the lead, you're not going to blow it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, can you talk about the difference between this team this year in the tournament and last year's team that played Boston College?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chad, for you, how special is this, you know, last year - the journey and this year the whole season?  How special is it for you as a senior? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can the two players talk about the difference between this year's team and last year's team going against BC?  They beat you by 22 last year in the title game.  You controlled them today.  Can you put a finger on what the difference was, and was there any kind of revenge on your mind because of what happened in the title game? </p>

<p>	Q.  Julius, what do you think your reputation is outside of the Big East?  What would you tell people who didn't know who you were?  How would you describe your team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you feel like you were frustrating them defensively?  </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) It seemed like they had their opportunities early. </p>
