THE MODERATOR:   Coach, an opening statement, please?   
COACH HOWLAND:   Yeah, I thought that we came out and got off to a great start.   I think we were up 10‑4.   There were a lot of turnovers early in the game.   Both teams had uncharacteristically number of turnovers there.   We had 14, which was pretty high for us over our average.   We only had, I think, 5 yesterday, if I'm not mistaken.   
But give Oregon all the credit.   Oregon did a great job today.   I thought they really did some good things defensively.   You know, their seniors scored 42 points, and their veteran guys really played well.   Emory, off the bench had 20, and he hit some big threes when they were down early in the game and got them off.   
I thought their point guard Jonathan Loyd was fantastic today, also played at Bishop Gorman where Shabazz went to high school.   Kazemi was a good pick‑up to get in September, to get him that late on the transfer from Rice and be immediately eligible.   He's been a huge addition to their team this year, and has done a fantastic job; and I voted for him, as I did Singler for All‑League this year.   
But I'm proud of our guys.   Our guys really battled.   We had it back to 54‑52, called a timeout to try to rest, and obviously, we were fatigued tonight having played three games in three days in a row, and we need to get some rest in representation for the NCAA Tournament.   
But I thought at that point right there they had a steal where Kazemi went and dunked it, they scored on another play, and give Oregon all the credit.   They were fantastic tonight, and they deserved and earned their victory.   
THE MODERATOR:   Any fallout from not having Adams?   
COACH HOWLAND:   Well, he's one of our best players, so I guess when you lose one of your best players, it's always something you've got to try to overcome.   And we'll get better at that.   We didn't have any time to prepare.   Offensively there were some things we wanted to do differently now because Kyle is playing more on the perimeter with the change in the lineup, and that is something that we'll have a chance to do this summing Tuesday and Wednesday and maybe Thursday, depending on where we're playing.   I don't even know who plays when in what region.   We've just been focusing on the now.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about the frustration with your suit jacket?   
COACH HOWLAND:   That's the first time I've had a technical in 11 years, and I should have mentioned that in my opening comments.   I was very embarrassed by that to lose my composure.   It's a terrible example for our team to have their coach behave in such a manner.   We're always going to have bad calls.   I definitely thought that wasn't a call that was called correctly.   You're going to have calls like that, and I told the team at halftime and after the game that that was a terrible example for them, that we have to play through adversity.   
We've done a great job all season long with all sorts of adversity as you're always going to have in every season.   That was really, really poor, and I deserved a technical foul.   I behaved poorly, and I'm embarrassed by it.  
   
 Q.   Just talk about how Norman did filling in for Jordan?   
COACH HOWLAND:   I thought Norman did a good job tonight.   I thought that Norman hit a big three to cut it to two.   He's going to get better playing more minutes and being more comfortable in that role, playing 35 minutes a game.   We hope that we have more opportunities.   
We know we're going to have one, and now you're at sudden death.   But I thought overall Norman did a good job as he's done all season long.  
   
 Q.   I know you were pretty high on Dominic Artis earlier this year when you saw him.   How impressed were you with Jonathan Loyd today?   Did he remind you at all of how Artis was playing early in the season?   
COACH HOWLAND:   They're different.   Artis is more of a scoring point guard.   I think tonight Loyd scoring 19 points, it's probably one of hiss his highs of the year.   But he was fantastic.   I thought Loyd played great.   He's at home, Bishop Gorman High School, playing in front of family and friends.   What a great experience for him to come in here and win the inaugural Pac‑12 championship in his hometown.   So congratulations to him.  
   
 Q.   There's been a precedent for key players getting injured and then the selection committee penalizing them from a seeding standpoint.   Do you anticipate that happening with Jordan?   
COACH HOWLAND:   I have no idea.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel that he should be?   
COACH HOWLAND:   Our players have done nothing wrong to be penalized, no.
