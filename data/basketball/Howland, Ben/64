<p>	Q.  Ben, just update on us on Brandin.</p>
<p>	Q.  He averages 36 or 37 minutes a game.  Can you talk about how compromised your team is?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you know what exactly happened to Brandin?  Looked like he slipped?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you tell us what you drew up in that final 1.7.  Was it for Brandin to take that shot?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did he have to do a good selling job to let him come back in the game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Ben, you guys played great defense all night.  Ben Gordon got free for some points at the end.  But he was stifled during the game.  Anything specific you did with him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ontario, you were very animated.  I saw you stomping around when you got the best of them inside.  Were you guys trying to unseat them and tell them, "You're here, and this isn't their league anymore"? </p>

<p>	Q.  I know you mentioned you had confidence in Brandin.  Did he ask you to go in?</p>
<p>	Q.  Last minute, second overtime, you were only down two.  Looked like you were going to get a stop.  Taliek hit that shot?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ontario, can you talk about how the players reacted when Brandin went down?  Did you talk amongst yourselves? </p>
<p>	Q.  Ontario, talk about how physical it was inside.  Looked like that all night long. </p>

<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)one of the more extraordinary defensive stops that any of us will see with the ball game on the line?</p>
