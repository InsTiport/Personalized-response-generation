<p>	Q.  I guess Farmar's ankle was okay; did you envision him doing what he did in the second half?</p>
<p>	Q.  I don't know if you -- I'm sure that you've looked at plenty of films of the games they have played this season. </p>
<p>	Q.  They have only played the two games.  Did you have any idea this guy Williams was capable of doing the stuff he did? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you expect him to be more in the low post? </p>
<p>	Q.  I don't know if John's analysis of it was exactly right, but he said that you killed them with pick-and-roll in the second half; is that something that wasn't there for you guys in the first half? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about your impressions of Drexel tonight. </p>
