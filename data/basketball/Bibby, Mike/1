 Q. How do you think this Three-Point Contest will compare?
 MIKE BIBBY: I don't know how they do it now, do they have two people shooting at the same time? I shot for, like, 45 minutes and waited for my turn. I was the second-to-last shooter. I don't remember how many shooters there were. 
 I waited 45 minutes. I was stiff and had to get up and stretch again. Being nervous, it was tough. 

 Q. What is it like for to you come back to the NBA All-Star? 
 MIKE BIBBY: It is good. It is fun to be around the family. It would be better if I can hold a trophy in front of the home crowd. It is just fun to be here, my son and my kids taking part in all the festivities.

 Q. Will you beat the kid from UCLA? 
 MIKE BIBBY: Everybody starts at zero, so we'll see how it turns out.
