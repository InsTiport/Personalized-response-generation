<p>	Q.  For Temeka, I would like to ask now that the team has gotten back here, you truly made it your goal to get back here this year.  Will the experience of the Final Four be a little bit easier?  Do you have some better ideas of what to expect and how to especially prepare for the semifinal games? </p>
<p>	Q.  Temeka, how different are you all from the game in November?  What are some of your strengths now maybe compared to then and things like that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Temeka, could you just talk about Sylvia and I guess her process when she's been here obviously it's all new to her, even know it's not new to y'all.  Have you guys been holding her hand, talking about the things outside the game, making sure she's focused on the game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Seimone, I think you said after that first Baylor game that it felt like March out there.  Obviously you saw that this was the kind of team that could be at this level.  What are some of the things that they do real well and match up with you guys real well with. </p>
<p>	Q.  Seimone, I would like to ask you also, getting here, last year, getting to the Final Four was one thing.  Now that you're back, what do you feel might be different or are some things a little more relaxed or even a little more focused than from last year's experience? </p>
<p>	Q.  This is for anyone:  How much do you guys joke about the Miami clique, the three players you have, kind of the Miami Pipeline, and do you joke with them at all? </p>
<p>	Q.  For Temeka and Seimone, after the first meeting, the comeback that Baylor made, their Coach and some of their players explained that as a team that plays with emotion.  Maybe you could just talk about the emotion that's within your team and what we'll see as far as the semi final game. </p>
<p>	Q.  Temeka, in your judgment, what's the most important thing or things a player has to do to be a good point guard at this level? </p>

<p>	Q.  Temeka, it's I guess a cliche in sports to say we're not worried about the other team; we're just worried about ourselves.  But is that a philosophy that this team really sticks to and I know whenever we ask about the opponent you guys just kind of shrug it off.  I mean you're just focused on what you guys need to do and that kind of thing. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Seimone's impact on the team, she's just named National Player of the Year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Seimone, do you think in that first meeting with Baylor that there was ever a time when both teams were playing their best against each other because you guys had the stronger first half and they had the stronger second half.  Did we get to see the best of play Baylor versus the best of LSU at the same time in that game?</p>

<p>	Q.  I wonder if you could talk a little about Kim Mulkey, tried to recruit you I believe when she was at Louisiana Tech and you guys were both point guards from the Bayou State.  Can you sort of talk about your similarity as much as you could remember her as a player.  Your similarities as players and maybe your similarities and/or differences as coaches. </p>
<p>	Q.  Same question I just asked Temeka about paying attention to yourselves instead of the opponents.  You said at the beginning that what did we learn from that first match-up and you said nothing.  I mean is this team even more than most a team that tries to set the tempo and dictate the way a game is going to be played and focuses on what you guys are going to do first?</p>
<p>	Q.  Pokey, Sylvia's had such great impact on games defensively.  I was curious as to why you continue to wait to put her in the game and don't start her. </p>
<p>	Q.  With the elimination of Connecticut there will be a new champion this year although it could be Tennessee winning a 7th.  The three other coaches, including yourself, do you all understand this is a big chance to put a new face on women's college basketball? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you just talk about your team's ability to handle all of the ancillary stuff, especially on a day like today.  With autograph sessions and how much has last year's experience helped in that process and I guess just your thoughts on viewing it or is it different from last year? </p>
<p>	Q.  If you could, talk about Seimone Augustus and for a player that scores that much she seems to be an unselfish player that likes to include her teammates and involve them in the game. </p>
<p>	Q.  Abiola Webara wasn't playing a lot for Baylor.  From what you've seen what are some of the problems that she can create especially on defense?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about Kim had recruited you; is that correct? </p>
<p>	Q.  Out of high school.  Was it ever tempting to play for her, knowing what she had done as a point guard and everything? </p>
<p>	Q.  Who really dictates whether it's time for Seimone to start shooting more and try to take over a game?  Is that something you try to avoid as coaches or she tries to avoid and as these games get tighter like when you were down against Duke and things like that, the first Baylor game, is that something important for her to do that she should take a few more shots? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there one aspect of the game that you really do not want to see Baylor dominate tomorrow night? </p>
<p>	Q.  I don't want to give all your strategy out. </p>
<p>	Q.  Specifically the defense board?  You don't --</p>
