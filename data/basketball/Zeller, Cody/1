 Q.   How's your day been, starting from the time you left Charlotte to right now?   
CODY ZELLER:   It's been a busy day so far.   We just finished practice.   A little less serious than our usual practices.   It's fun to be here in New York.   It's a great honor to be here.   And I'm enjoying it so far.   
   
 Q.   What kind of things do you work on at practice today?   
CODY ZELLER:   As Coach said, we put in a few plays that none of us will run.   It's just good to get out there.   I think the fans enjoy it more than anything.   So that's good.   
   
 Q.   I saw you were working with the All Stars in the wheelchair game.   What was that like?   
CODY ZELLER:   It's awesome.   I've seen them before.   It unbelievable to see what they are capable of even for a wheelchair.   It makes me‑‑ I'm very honored to be able to do this with them.   
   
 Q.   What was it like connecting with some of the guys and everybody else on the team?   
CODY ZELLER:   I know some of these guys since high school.   We played against each other in AAU and stuff.   It's fun to get on the same court and play against each other.   It's not so serious as it is during the season.   
   
 Q.   Of the players participating in All‑Star Weekend, who are you most looking forward to getting the chance to know?   
CODY ZELLER:   I've known a lot of these guys since high school.   We've played with each other and against each other.   It's fun to get around each other.   This game doesn't mean as much as during the regular of the season.   It's fun to play with some of the these guys and get to know them off the court.
