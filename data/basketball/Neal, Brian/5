DePaul   87
  Xavier - 53

COACH NEAL:   Well, I thought DePaul played like a really good team, a tournament experienced team.   I thought we played like a pretty average team.   It was not an experienced tournament team.   They just punish you for the things that you don't do that you should have done or the mistakes you make, and just put so much pressure on you in so many ways, and then of course when they get hot, it's a double whammy.   We got whipped, and I don't know how else you describe it. 

Q.   Coach, obviously this isn't the way you wanted tonight to go, but in the grand scheme of things, you doubled the win total from a year ago and you got your first winning season for this program since 2010‑11.   What can you say about all that you've accomplished this year?
COACH NEAL:   Well, starting the year, our goal, it might sound crazy, we knew we're not winning the Big East championship this year, we're not at that level yet.   But we are trying to make those strides, and I think the things you mentioned, our coaching staff knows where we are in the progression of things.   Certainly, we would have liked to have done a little bit better tonight, but we're not in DePaul's class right now.   They're in another world, and we've got to now take the growth we've had this season and move forward and hopefully narrow that gap a little bit next year.

Q.   Where do you see yourself next year?
COACH NEAL:   Well, I don't know.   We have a large corps of players coming back who have gotten some experience, and we have a couple nice newcomers.   We have a young lady sitting out who's going to give you more of a post presence for sure and then we have a freshman transfer, a freshman next year who I think is going to be a special player in the league one of these days.   So I'm really excited about those guys.
And then we have one of our best point guards who was out with an ACL in December.   So those three players, when we get those guys back, we're going to be a more talented team, a bigger team, so we'll see.   But we have a lot of work to do to get those guys involved.

Q.   What is it about DePaul's press that makes them so hard to deal with?
COACH NEAL:   Well, you know, I don't think the press was the problem tonight.   We had ten turnovers, and look, we've got a lot of experience turning the ball over against their press.   Tonight I thought we executed pretty good.   I thought when we got the ball to the other end of the floor is when our decision making went out the window. 
But DePaul, they play competently at a very fast level, and when we play at a fast level, it's incompetent.   It's bad decision making.   That's where we've got to learn to adjust to a faster speed.   But the press, normally after one of their games, they just overwhelm us with it.   Tonight I thought we had pretty good technique and did a pretty good job.   In the first half, I bet eight of our first ten turnovers were in the half court taking the ball out of bounds.
But they have good athletes, they play hard and they keep it on you.   That's I guess the biggest reason why it's successful in general.
