Butler - 48, Xavier - 47   
BRIAN NEAL: I thought Butler packed it in a 2-3 zone.  We looked like we'd never seen a 2-3 zone before.  Played very passive.  I thought Butler played very hard, and we just didn't.  I think that's my opening statement.   
 Q.  Were you expecting to take so many threes?  
BRIAN NEAL: I don't have a certain number.   
 Q.  You took 20 threes in the game.  
BRIAN NEAL: Yeah, I didn't have a number that we were going to take coming in, so no, I don't know.  I didn't have a certain number we were going to shoot or not shoot.   
 Q.  What did you feel like Butler did differently than in the first two matches you had in the regular season which you guys had won?  
BRIAN NEAL: Well, they had their whole lineup for one.  The second game they were missing Schickel, but we knew we were going to play a 2-3 zone, and I thought they pressed a little more than they did, and they just sat back in the zone and we just dribbled the ball on the ground or we just wouldn't attack it like we should have been attacking.  It resulted in poor possession after poor possession.   
 Q.  Take me back to the last minute of play, especially the shot-clock violation which you guys were dribbling around the perimeter.  
BRIAN NEAL: What's the question?  Take you back to it?   
 Q.  The last minute of the game when you guys have that possession --  
BRIAN NEAL: We should have shot the ball.  I don't know what you want me to say.  We ran a play and they're counting it down, ten, nine, and ball gets away, three, and they hadn't shot it.  So we should have shot the ball.
