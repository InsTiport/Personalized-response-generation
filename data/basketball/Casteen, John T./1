<p>	Q.  John and Gene, what is the stage of when you are all going to come in and when do you expect to have a final answer on that?</p>

<p>	Q.  Following up on that, has there been further discussion with the Big East in terms of the requirement of the exit in terms of the penalty fee or how many months it would be?  Seems to be some confusion on that. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have any idea as to when that declaratory judgment might come down?</p>
<p>	Q.  I just want to ask John, when in Charlottesville a few weeks ago, you came out with plans for next year, primary partners, how does this affect that and could you conceive of this happening next football season, 2004, or is 2005 really the earliest that this could work out? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mr.  Casteen could this have happened, this addition of Boston College in June, should it have happened then and can you give us insight as to why it did not? </p>
<p>	Q.  I wanted to ask can you discuss the continued pursuit  -- President Casteen just mentioned the attempt to get the waiver  -- to change the NCAA Rule 11 to allow an 11-team Conference Championship, do you think that has a chance?  Will you continue to pursue that?</p>
<p>	Q.  President Casteen, you just mentioned that it was apparent to everyone that at 11 that the league was an incomplete entity.  Were those primarily financial considerations that were propelling this forward for the 12th and sort of the Championship game and revenue?</p>
<p>	Q.  Mr.  DeFilippo, I am sure you have heard and/or read the comments from the Syracuse Athletics Director and the Chancellor Shaw earlier in the week.  I wanted to get a response from you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Gene, in light of the Syracuse peoples' comments however, can you -- could you see them really wanting to keep you around any much longer after the 2003 or '04 academic year? </p>
<p>	Q.  Gene, could you evaluate is it difficult for your coaches right now, particularly men's and women's basketball coaches who are in the middle of home visits and/or campus visits coming up soon to be asked by recruits what Conference are we going to be in?</p>
<p>	Q.  In terms of travel, for Boston College, for most of your road games, any additional burden in terms of the extra travel time?</p>


<p>	Q.  Gene, with the exit penalty being hashed out with the Big East, do you have concerns about the procedure that has been followed in terms of trying to determine that and if so, what were those concerns in terms of how the Big East has gone about determining changing the exit fees for teams leaving, it was one, if you had concerns about how they have gone about the meetings and everything trying to determine that. </p>

<p>	Q.  You guys are scheduled to play Wake Forest anyway in 2004, does this to mean you got to find another football team if that becomes a Conference game now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Dr. Casteen, you answered a question earlier about Conference expansion with talking about the academic aspects.  I am sure this is a naive question but what does an athletic conference alignment have to do with foreign student studies and how do you square that academic aspect with the fact that the ACC has severely weakened a fellow Conference? </p>
