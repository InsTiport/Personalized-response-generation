 THE MODERATOR:   Aijha, thanks for joining us this evening.  We'll take questions for Aijha.
 Q. What did you do to change the energy and the way the game was going in the second and third quarters after Alabama got off to that hot start?
 AIJHA BLACKWELL:   We just knew that the game wasn't going anywhere.  We were still in it.  We tried to pick up the intensity on defense because we know that's where we struggled in the first half.  So yeah, just came together.
 Q. I know this has been an up-and-down roller coaster year with COVID, close losses.  What is the learning lesson from this game in particular?
 AIJHA BLACKWELL:   You just got to start how you finish.  That's my thing.  I don't think we came out with a lot of intensity that we could have.  I think you start the game how you finish.  I think we had a strong second half as a team.  So yeah.
 Q. What is the mood of the team right now?  Obviously I'm sure you guys are disappointed.  There's potentially still more post-season play.  How do you take this loss and regroup here?
 AIJHA BLACKWELL:   Got a hurt locker room.  Everybody is pretty hurt (tearing up).  I'm sorry.  Just proud of everybody.  We came a long way, hard practices, tough games, close games.  Got a hurt locker room in there.
 We really built a sisterhood, so it really hurts for our seniors Shug and Shannon.  We're looking forward to post-season, though.  It doesn't stop here.
 Q. You kind of mentioned sisterhood.  What would a chance in the post-season mean to you guys to play together again?  Is that something you can look forward to?
 AIJHA BLACKWELL:   Absolutely.  Post-season is great.  We're wishing for NCAA, but WNIT, we still have a chance, like Coach said, to hang a banner.  We can do it together, and I think that's what's special.  This season was obviously not what we wanted, but it was a hard season, tough season.  The post-season will mean everything for us.
 THE MODERATOR:   Aijha, thank you so much for joining us tonight.
 AIJHA BLACKWELL:   All right.
