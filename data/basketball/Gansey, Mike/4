<p>	Q.  Standing out there alone, Mike, at the foul-line. </p>
<p>	Q.  Mike, do you feel like a team of destiny coming in here with a 1-8 record in the BIG EAST tournament?  To dispatch Boston College and win like that. </p>
<p>	Q.  Mike, talk about what happened on the last play.  Did you feel somebody push you from behind on that play?  What did you feel? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, did rallying from the 10-point deficit in the first half give you confidence? </p>
<p>	Q.  Ever been in anything close to that type of situation, Mike? </p>
<p>	Q.  Thrown into something like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  You beat a team that shot 65% with five turnovers.  What does that say about the general quality of play in this game? </p>
<p>	Q.  John, you don't have to say it, but I think a lot of us will, you're probably in the tournament at this point.  Can you give us some sort of sense of what a long, hard climb it's been since you came there.  The last team was in '98.  It's been a while. </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you realize that at the time, how tough it would be?</p>
<p>	Q.  You beat two opponents in a row.  This game was closer than the BC game, but what does that say about this team?  How have you been able to overcome the nerves playing in the league? </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just talk about at the end there, Joe makes that big three, the confidence these guys are playing with right now, no hesitation to take the big shots?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does it take a special player not to hesitate in that situation, with so much on the line? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you even think about the situation there? </p>
<p>	Q.  John, when did you (inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mike, would you explain that reverse layup in the first half. </p>
<p>	Q.  Who are you rooting for now? </p>
<p>	Q.  What about you guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you're a game away from being the first BIG EAST team to go in four days.  Has that been on your mind? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you give me the Reader's Digest version of transferring. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about overcoming adversity, Sally gets sick, Frank Young steps in.  Earlier in the year, Pittsnogle steps in. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, in this league you have to execute the lead in the second half.  You've been able to do that more in this month than in February, than you were in January.  What's the difference?</p>
<p>	Q.  John, does this team have enough left in the tank? </p>
