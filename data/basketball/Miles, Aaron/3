<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the challenges presented by that Syracuse zone, maybe what you guys are going to be looking at in terms of trying to break that thing down? </p>


<p>	Q.  You obviously have strong senior leadership on this team.  Could you discuss the importance of having the kind of experience that Nick and Kirk bring as you drive for a national championship. </p>
<p>	Q.  Your time with Coach Williams, it's been pretty extensive.  I'm sure you have answered questions about how you would feel to be a part of a team that wins him a national championship with Kansas for the first time.  Here you are on the eve of this thing possibly happening.  Can you share with us what it would mean for you guys to not only win this title but to also help your coach get this thing that he has been seeking. </p>

<p>	Q.  What has it been like for the four years for you to have been together, what you think of each other as players, your relationship, and what it means to culminate in the championship game? </p>

<p>	Q.  Nick, following up on the senior/freshman angle, you guys are a team led by seniors, your opponents are a team led by a freshman.  Are you comfortable with that?  Do you think it makes a big difference? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, wondering if you could talk about match-ups a little bit, who you might put on Anthony and also whether or not you might consider using a zone to slow down his one-on-one ability? </p>
<p>	Q.  As much as the players say how much they want to win it for you, how much would it mean to you to see Kirk and Nick go out with the national championship?  Second of all, how happy are you personally that you stayed around to witness these guys grow as players and as young men? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you explain your relationship with Coach Boeheim and how it feels to be coaching against him, that one of you guys is going to get the ultimate prize there on Monday? </p>
<p>	Q.  Does this team remind you at all of the '82 North Carolina team that brought Dean his first title?  What do you remember about Dean and his reaction after he finally got that first one?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach just said he probably yelled at you guys maybe handful of times.  What would be your estimate of that? </p>



<p>	Q.  Going back to Dean Smith, do you think the fact you were around him so many of those years before he won his first championship, observing the way he would respond year after year falling short, has formed (inaudible) a little bit of the way you've been able to react to disappointments?</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously, he's (Coach Boeheim) the best at coaching the zone.  Can you be specific to why it's so difficult to play against?  Are you impressed with the fact he gets kids to buy into it, to play it for their entire careers?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about times in your careers when you've used Coach Williams as an example of not letting what people are saying about you, writing about you, get to you? </p>

<p>	Q.  Jeff, I look at the whole podium, you're the only one up there that wasn't here last year.  What has this senior leadership meant to you over the season? </p>
<p>	Q.  Roy, three years ago when you made the decision to come back to Kansas or stay at Kansas, you probably came back for this moment, to be in this game with these kids.  I wonder, have you thought maybe that confirmed in your mind that you made the right choice and that Kansas is the definite place for Roy Williams? </p>
<p>	Q.  What were your thoughts when General Myers compared the coalition's strategy in Iraq with your game plan with Arizona?  Did you take that as an endorsement by the Joint Chiefs of your team? </p>
<p>	Q.  Keith, could you talk about the challenges of  you're facing a player like Anthony?  Have you faced anybody of his talent this year? </p>

<p>	Q.  Did you hear from Dean last night to congratulate you on the phone? </p>

<p>	Q.  Can you talk about how the underclassmen have matured this year? </p>
<p>	Q.  With one day to prepare, coaches are always talking about how difficult it is.  Isn't Syracuse preparing for basically the same thing they saw last night, whereas you're preparing for something totally different?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you sort of analyze and assess the strengths and weaknesses of Coach Boeheim's golf game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously everybody wants to win the big game.  What have you learned throughout the years about not winning the big game?  What's your philosophy on that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Any thoughts on the fact that Syracuse has beaten three Big-12 teams in the tournament, plus I believe they beat Missouri in the regular season?</p>
<p>	Q.  From what you've seen of Gerry McNamara's game, how would you assess it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously a lot of people have gone away from the zone.  Syracuse is really the only major team that plays it.  How much more difficult is it to prepare for that? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've been fortunate enough to be around a number of freshmen, see a number of others who have excelled on this stage.  Where does Anthony appear to fit in with that group? </p>
<p>	Q.  You used Kirk a lot to guard top perimeter players.  Carmelo starts out on the perimeter.  Can he guard him or is he not big enough?  Will he have to take a turn? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned in the past that maybe earlier in your career you put more pressure on yourself to win the national title.  What events, what was the process for you to maybe gain a little more perspective, put less pressure on yourself?</p>
<p>	Q.  As long as you've wanted to win a national title, to get this close, with a team like this, playing so well at the end, can you describe how you feel about that? </p>
<p>	Q.  With all that Carmelo Anthony can do, what is the biggest challenge he presents for your team? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about why you hate coaching the zone?  Tell a little bit about your feelings when Dean Smith didn't win compared to the criticisms of you not winning, how different they are?</p>
<p>	Q.  Why you hate to coach the zone. </p>
<p>	Q.  In general terms, are the top freshmen not freshmen in a sense they were 20 or 30 years ago?  If not, how far back do we date this transformation?</p>
<p>	Q.  This season you have Steve Robinson back.  What has that been like for you and him?  What sort of adjustments need to be made?</p>
<p>	Q.  The first time you went to the final game, was it early enough in your career where you thought, "This is something I'll get a chance to do again quickly"?  Could you have imagined that night it would have taken so long to get another opportunity to play in that game?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned Michael Lee earlier.  Has he exceeded your expectations of what he's done, especially down the stretch here?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you go back to when you were a kid. </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you explain how you felt about the NCAA as a kid, getting older, what particular memories you had of it before you got here. </p>
<p>	Q.  Jim said last night the winner would have to give the loser strokes on the golf course next summer.  What are your handicaps?  Can you draw any analogies from the way you play golf, not very pretty, and the way you coach teams? </p>
<p>	Q.  Last night your transition game was able to beat Marquette down the floor.  Going against a zone team, is it more critical to get the ball down the court, not let them get into what they want to do?</p>
<p>	Q.  Goodnaturedly meant question.  Do you predict, win or lose, you'll cry tomorrow, given the closeness of your relationship with Kirk and Nick?  Will this be as emotional an experience as you probably have had?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you explain the difficulty of the decision to shut down Wayne after the second injury, what you have been able to do as a team, from your own standpoint, to be able to get the team through that and to this point? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think three years ago, if you had already won a national title at Kansas, you might have made a different decision?  If you win one tomorrow night, will there be any thought, "I've completed my mission at Kansas"? </p>
<p>	Q.  You obviously have some great memories of being here in '82.  If you could share a few memories of '93 and '99.  Does this building owe you one? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, while you've been at Kansas, you've had a couple of dynamic duos.  These two seniors this year, can you talk about their uniqueness?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Syracuse's other forward, the problem he presents, Hakim?</p>
<p>	Q.  Who are you going to be putting on Warrick? </p>
<p>	Q.  Anything at all to be gleaned from that 2001 meeting with Syracuse?  What were your memories of the '96 loss?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about loyalty as being one of the qualities that you really prize in yourself and others.  Where did you learn loyalty?  Who taught you loyalty?</p>
<p>	Q.  The two freshmen that have had the most success are North Carolina's Rashad McCants and (Florida's) Matt Walsh.  Both were in the NIT in New  York City.  Those were two games that Kirk Hinrich was suffering from a back injury.  Is that a coincidence? </p>
<p>	Q.  When coaches get together and just talk, shoot the breeze, are you equally as fascinated with winning the national championship when coaches talk about it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Maryland won it all last year with the two outstanding seniors.  You're in that position.  Looking down the road, do you think senior leadership will continue to be important or do you think it's more likely we'll see teams like Syracuse with younger dominating squads in this position?</p>
<p>	Q.  You gave a little story about '82.  This building has had some memorable, even bizarre moments in championship games.  Is there an aura or mystique about this place that you think lends itself to crazy things happening late in games?  Do you think the potential is there for something bizarre given the makeup of both squads to happen tomorrow night?</p>
