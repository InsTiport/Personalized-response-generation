<p>	Q.  Nick, can you talk about the match-up inside with the front court players of Maryland, your perception of how they played? </p>
<p>	Q.  Nick, looks like you guys had a little bit of trouble getting in sync early on.  Was that something that was happening from your end or something they were doing to you? </p>
<p>	Q.  You make the huge comeback, but you have someone like Juan Dixon on the other end that seemed like every team you came back, he was there to stave off the drive. </p>
<p>	Q.  Aaron, can you talk specifically about the comeback and what you guys did?  You were down 20 with six minutes to go in the game.  That was really a terrific comeback, the fact you didn't quit.  Talk about what coach wanted and what you guys did to get back in the game. </p>

<p>	Q.  Again, Juan Dixon, talk about his kind of play, what he did against you guys tonight. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk specifically about Aaron Miles' play?  12 and 10 as a freshman, look forward to having him back. </p>
<p>	Q.  It looked like Maryland may have just been better than you all today.  Was that your impression?  Do you think the three blocked shots on Drew early in the game kind of took him out of the game? </p>
<p>	Q.  You saw the one defense that worked, you went box and one; didn't work out.  Blake hit a shot.  The one defense that worked was the pressure.  Towards the end, do you not go to that any sooner because you know the ebb and flow in a game like this, because you're going to get more possessions, "Let's keep going, sooner or later we'll start knocking down some shots"? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about your feelings after this one compared to other years?  Do you feel in a lot of ways you got more out of this team than maybe you ever have before? </p>
