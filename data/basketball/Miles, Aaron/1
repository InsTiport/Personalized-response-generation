<p>	Q.  Aaron, did you all have options on that last shot or was that what you were looking for?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you guys just talk about what it was like not having Keith here today and how much that affected the outcome?</p>
<p>	Q.  Wayne, would you kind of sum up the end of your season and what you expect now in the tournament, how you all are going into it mentally and where you feel your seeding may fall?</p>
<p>	Q.  Wayne, can you talk about you guys came close but didn't get a Big 12 tournament.  Talk about how that feels and possibly how it shapes your mindset going into the NCAA tournament?</p>

<p>	Q.  When Oklahoma State made sort of the second second half run, the one after Bobik hit the threes when Graham started to get his own shot -- is the fact that he's such a difficult match-up, how much of a factor was that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Your options, your thoughts on the last shot.  Obviously J.R. hit a big one to keep you all in it.  What were you look --</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys have kind of brought out the best in each other these last two weeks, you and Oklahoma State; what is it about?  Is it a match-up deal or why do you guys play so well and execute so well against each other?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about JamesOn Curry and how much he's come on and how difficult he is to defend?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know you never want to lose, but can losing a game like this and an extra days rest come out and help you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Michael and Aaron, one, is there anymore you could have asked from Michael than what you got last two days?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was shocked that Aaron didn't score as much, especially as compared to what he did yesterday.  Do you need him to score more or because Wayne got so many touches it really is a moot point?</p>
