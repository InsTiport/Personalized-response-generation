THE MODERATOR: If you could start with an opening statement, feelings about the day.   
MALIK BEASLEY: It's been an amazing day.  I'm thankful to be here and thank you to Denver for giving me the opportunity.   
 Q.  Malik, Denver loaded roster; how do you fit in there and have you thought about how this is all going to work out for you?  
MALIK BEASLEY: Yes, sir, just compete every day, work hard, and whatever Coach wants me to do, I'll do it.  It's time to get to business.   
 Q.  Do you know any of the players on that roster, have any relationships there?  
MALIK BEASLEY: Not really.  I know a few guys by name but nothing too serious.   
 Q.  The Nuggets also took Murray, who's also a guard.  Are you afraid coming to such a loaded roster that you're going to have a hard time getting shots and have your development slowed down a little bit?  
MALIK BEASLEY: Not really.  I'm still going to work hard, compete against him.  We're friends, and we're going to work hard together to get Denver back on again.   
 Q.  Obviously going to Denver the air is a lot thinner.  Are you going to be able to adjust?  
MALIK BEASLEY: Yes, sir.  Yes, sir, I've got to.  It's the only way to do it.
