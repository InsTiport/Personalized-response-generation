COACH PIKIELL:   First, I just wanted to say, you know, we've been treated first class.   This is really an impressive school.   How they handle everything, it's just first class.   I watched, and kept saying to my assistant coaches, "How is this team not in the NCAA Tournament?" 
Well, Coach Fran did a great job.   He's got good players.   The future looks really good here at Iowa, and it's disappointing we ended our season this way.   It is the winningest season in our school history, and we fought until the end today, but they were better.
