 IZZY MARQUES : Go ahead. 

 Q. Izzy, how difficult is to have someone injured and out for a while? You guys played so hard without Angel and you were still in it toward the end. 
 IZZY MARQUES: It was hard. We thought she would be able to be in longer than she was, and we had to work through it. 
 And we did a great job without her on the court. Definitely we need her for next game. 

 Q. You guys all stepped up and scored without Angel in the game. Has there been a situation before this game before you had to step up for her? 
 IZZY MARQUES: Yeah, we have many games and know always she is the one who we go to, so everybody has to know what to do when she is not in. 
 And when one player is not doing her job, somebody else has to bring it, and we did that largely this season, and we did that today, too. 

 Q. Izzy, talk about the defense on the last sequence with Bird. It seemed like she got a better look than you might have wanted her to. Can you talk about that? 
 IZZY MARQUES: It was a hard thing because you have a shooter screening, and you are not able to help as much so you have to make a good defensive play on the situation. It was a good play, good shooter, and it's hard to defend that. 

 Q. What was it that you guys were seeing by the Storm that you had not found a way to approach that? 
 IZZY MARQUES: We couldn't help off the screener, because they are good shooters, so we have to work around it, and the best way we could do it is to go under and meet the player on the other side, because if we help off the screen then the other person has a wide-open shot.
