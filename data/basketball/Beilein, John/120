<p>	Q.  Did the fact that Syracuse came at you so quickly, starting off both halves, did that sort of cause the team to lose its legs a little bit? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you discover something about yourselves in these four games that you might not have known you had before, the ability to take it to teams that were supposedly better than you, especially inside? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, kind of trading basket to basket there.  Last couple minutes in the first half they were pressing.  They made a couple threes. </p>
<p>	Q.  What happened with Kevin Pittsnogle, he has a game that slips in like this?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did they do something in the second half?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you reflect on just a remarkable week of basketball for your team and getting to the first championship game in the history of the program, the big stage, New York City, Saturday night. </p>
<p>	Q.  About the 15-minute mark, you started going for the 1-3-1 half court.  You cut the lead down to 9.  Can you talk about that. </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about getting momentum on your side, the one shot, it looked like it got things in your direction. </p>
<p>	Q.  What does this tournament do for the team? </p>
<p>	Q.  John, can you talk about this run. </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about gaining respect with recruits.  Can you talk about maybe gaining respect with basketball fans.  This might be the first time that a lot of people saw you. </p>
