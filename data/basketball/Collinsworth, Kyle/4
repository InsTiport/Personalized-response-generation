  BYU   87

THE MODERATOR:   Coach, some opening comments? 
COACH ROSE:   Well, I thought it was a really hard‑fought game.   Probably a great basketball game to watch back and forth.   We had a hard time getting the lead and got the lead late and had a hard time protecting the lead. 
So I give Coach Fisher and his team, congratulate them for a hard‑fought win, and wish them the best in the rest of the tournament and throughout the season.   For us, we'll have to bounce back from a disappointing loss and hopefully be ready to play tomorrow morning.

Q.   You guys started slow, what was the key to getting back in the game? 
TYLER HAWS:   I think just our effort.   It took a few minutes to adjust to everything.   We started rebounding better, and started sharing the ball and getting our shots.   Got ourselves back in the game. 

Q.   Tyler, they seemed to have a handle on you in the first half.   But on the second half you seemed to get back on track.   Did you change some things or did you look for things? 
TYLER HAWS:   No, the coaches told us to shoot our shots.   I think we were trying to do too much sometimes, so we just started playing our game and shooting the shots that they were giving us and started making shots.

Q.   Kyle, tonight you played 45 minutes and were on the floor an awful lot.   How did that feel with your knee and how did you feel you acquitted yourself taking on those extra minutes tonight? 
KYLE COLLINSWORTH:   My knee feels really good.   So I'm really blessed and fortunate about that.   There's no swelling, so it's great, and it's the best it's felt through the process.   I was just grateful I had no problems through those 45 minutes.   There was a reason we worked our way up and stayed under 20 to get to this point so my body could do that.   Tonight I just tried to be a leader for my team and make the necessary plays.

Q.   I think you both played against San Diego State when you were in Mountain West in your careers.   Do you miss playing them and is there a certain energy about those games? 
TYLER HAWS:   The games are always fun to play in.   They're always really well‑coached and they have talented guys and we love competing against each other.   This one just hurts.   We had our chances to win the game, but we've got to bounce back.
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, questions for Coach Rose.

Q.   Coach, I know it's a tough loss, but is there any solace in the way you guys hung in there and forced overtime and took the lead in that first overtime? 
COACH ROSE:   I'm extremely proud of our guys.   I think one of the most important things that we wanted to do in this game was to make sure that we would never fault our effort, that our guys would leave everything out there.   We didn't go really deep in our bench tonight, and I felt like we were chasing them the whole time.   That was something where I felt like the experienced guys could really help us get to that point.   But we got some great play off the bench from Isaac and from Corbin, and Dalton gave us some good minutes.   Jake Toolson gave us a few minutes early in the first half.   I think we got better. 
As a result of this game, you'd love to have a win against a nationally ranked team early in the season.   What we need to do is make sure our guys learned from what happened here.   I mean, we made some big plays.   Then they made some big plays against us, and plays we're capable of.   We got the block late in the game with the three‑point lead, I think, and didn't secure the ball.   Got it taken from us, and the guy steps back hits the three and tied the game.   I think those are all things we can learn from. 
I think it's a lot more enjoyable to learn from those kind of things when you actually win the game, so hopefully we can bounce back tomorrow.
