 COACH WEBER: It's obviously a tough loss. Started the game a little bit slow, very similar game to the game in Assembly Hall a few weeks ago where they jumped on us, and then we recovered and had a great finish to the half, played very good defense. I think we held them to six points in a long stretch, and it was a game of runs, and they got hot from three down the stretch, and we got a little tight and didn't make any plays, and they -- the couple threes, actually when the big kid got in foul trouble, Morgan got in foul trouble and they had to substitute, that was a big stretch because then he hit a couple threes and it got him back in, and we got a little tight and didn't make some plays. 
 Just very disappointing, very sad, but just got to hope for the best now that we'll be able to play basketball next week. 

 Q. Can both you guys just talk about what happened when down the stretch -- what happened to the offense? What happened to the defense? What did you see out there? 
 BILL COLE: I thought our offense in the first half and early second half looked as good as it had looked all year and we were moving and getting it to the open guy, hitting shots. I think they hit some shots down the stretch, and it looks like we just got tight and stopped doing the stuff that was working for us in the first half for some reason. And then like coach said, that last run, it put them over the top just a little bit and then couldn't hit anything down the stretch. 
 DEMETRI MCCAMEY: I just think the start of our defense we kind of relaxed and got the hairs up. We had them down 9, 11, 9, 11, and then they started hitting shots. Hardaway hit a big three to put them up, and we just had a stagnant offense. We stopped moving, stopped cutting and stopped getting the ball to Mike Tisdale and Mike Davis on the block, and once you do that and give a good shooting team like that and get their confidence back, it's going to be hard to beat once they get their confidence and hit their shots at the same time. 

 Q. I remember last year going into Selection Sunday a lot of nerves for you guys. I remember you said that you couldn't eat really for the last 24 hours or so. What are your feelings going to be going into this Selection Sunday? Do you feel more confident about your chances? 
 BILL COLE: Yeah, honestly I feel better this year than I did last year about our chances. But at the same time it's kind of like I'm sure we're going to be anxious up until Sunday. You've just got to keep telling yourself there's nothing else you can do, and it's up to other people, it's not in our hands anymore. Just keep practicing, keep working like we're in it, and hopefully we will be. 

 Q. Can you tell us what they were able to do? You weren't able to attempt a shot in the final about ten minutes. What did they do defensively to take you away from your game? 
 DEMETRI MCCAMEY: They switched everything, trapped ball screens and just had my thinking the whole last ten minutes. We had a couple opportunities to get in the lanes and pitch out, we just didn't make the shots, and they just did a good job of trying to make me think on each and every play down the court by changing up their defense. 

 Q. What do you think your chances are for Sunday? Are you confident you're going to get into the tournament? 
 COACH WEBER: You know, I feel that we played a tough non-conference schedule, we played quality opponents, we've beaten Top 50 teams, you know, we competed in one of the best conferences in the country. But at the same time, we went through it last year, and you just don't know. You have to wait and see what happens over the next couple days, and if there is any upsets or anyone else sneaks in, because you don't know if you'll be the team to be left out. 
 I thought if we would have won today, I would have been very confident that we'd be playing next week in the NCAA Tournament. I still feel good, but at the same time we've just got to wait and see what happens with everybody else. 

 Q. Demetri addressed that he didn't think the ball got into Tis (Mike Tisdale) and to Mike Davis down the stretch. Is that something they could do to take that away or is that you guys not entering the ball? What happened there?
 COACH WEBER: You know, we got a little stagnant. It's not a lot of possessions in the game. We ran a couple sets to get it into them. You know, as Demetri said, they just started switching everything, so it kind of denied some ball movement, allowed us -- it stopped us from getting it into them, and we had some turnovers in that stretch, too, that we never got any shots off. And then they came down, they made big plays. You know, a couple big threes, got it close, and then as Demetri said, when they switched off, now he had to penetrate and kick, and we missed a couple shots that we had opportunities.
