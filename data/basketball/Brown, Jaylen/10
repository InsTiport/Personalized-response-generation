 Q.  What did you guys see when you looked at the film defensively that you think you need to change, and why do you need to make those changes?  
JAYLEN BROWN: I think we made a lot of mistakes.  I think we kind of shot ourselves in the foot.  Coming out tomorrow we've got to clean up some of those mistakes.   
 Q.  What were the mistakes?  
JAYLEN BROWN: Just simple stuff, to be honest.  Like rotations, close-outs, over-helping, things like that, just being defensively sound.  We've got to do a little bit better job of that.   
 Q.  Do you anticipate that you'll probably get a little bit more time given the matchups in this series?  
JAYLEN BROWN: All I can do is be ready.  That's my job, to play basketball, so I'm just going to be ready if Coach calls me.   
 Q.  I know this might be one of the toughest teams in the league to go up against; is there something you guys have to do differently against LeBron?  
JAYLEN BROWN: Yeah, we've got to help each other.  We've got to have each other's backs a little bit more.  He got to the paint, and I think he wanted to establish himself in the paint.  We've got to do a better job of letting him see people in there and having more help defense.  He's a good player, but we've got to come out and make it more tough than we did last game.   
 Q.  Will Game 2 be the most important basketball game you've ever played in?  
JAYLEN BROWN: Yeah.  Yeah.  It's kind of crazy thinking like how I was just in high school two years ago, now I'm here playing in the Eastern Conference Finals against the defending champs, so it's kind of cool.  This is the biggest game of my career, and I'm ready to step up to the challenge.   
 Q.  I know you don't get into the whole playing against LeBron thing, but it's going to be like a cartoon in a sense, playing against a guy you looked up to.  I know it's part of the NBA experience, but how do you reflect on guarding the best player in the league?  
JAYLEN BROWN: To be honest, I don't even think about it.  I'm just playing basketball.  I mean, he laces his shoes up just like I lace mine up, so I'll just give my best effort to try to slow him down and help my team.   
 Q.  Is he stronger than you thought just from a physical sense?  
JAYLEN BROWN: I mean, yeah, I mean, I guess.  I don't really think about it.  I'm just trying to compete.  I mean, I'm a competitor, so I don't look at it as I'm guarding one of the best players in the game.  I'm looking at it as I've got a job to do, and if I don't do it, then I'm not going to play.  That's how I see it.   
 Q.  How would you describe the atmosphere from Game 7 to what you saw last night?  
JAYLEN BROWN: I think the atmosphere was pretty much the same.  I think the Game 7 atmosphere, the crowd was really into it, and I think the game yesterday we came out a little bit flat, but I think Game 2, I think we'll be a lot more engaged, and we're going to try to come out and hit first.   
 Q.  What if someone told you two years ago you'd be in this position; would you have believed it?  
JAYLEN BROWN: Yeah, I would have.   
 Q.  As a high school senior you would have thought you could be in the Eastern Conference Finals two years from now?  
JAYLEN BROWN: Yeah, I probably would say, yeah, it sounds about right.   
 Q.  Why would you have said that, just you're a confident guy?  
JAYLEN BROWN: Yeah, have a lot of expectations for myself, and I guess I would say that, that I have high expectations for myself.   
 Q.  What are some of the greatest lessons you've learned and most valuable things you can take from this run so far?  
JAYLEN BROWN: From this run?   
 Q.  This playoff run.  
JAYLEN BROWN: Always be ready.  You never know when your name is going to be called, and just how to win, the little things that go into winning.  I think that learning that early as opposed to learning that late has helped me out in my career, people like Gerald Green who always has been in my ear from the beginning, he's been in the league a lot and he's been in the league, out of the league, but he's always made an effort to come talk to me, and he's been a perfect example for me, so I learned a lot from him about how to be ready and how to take advantage of every situation because you don't know how situations might end up.  He's super talented, can jump out of the gym, and he's had unfortunate events but he's still here and he's positive, and he's been one of the best people to help me understand about the NBA, how it's a business and everything.  Gerald Green has helped me out the most out of everybody.  He's been in my ear.  He's been telling me everything that's going to happen, and it's been true, so a shout-out to him.   
 Q.  Jaylen, when you're out there with Isaiah and there's so much attention on him, what is your mentality knowing that you guys are going to be open at some point in time because teams are dropping to him, trying to be physical?  
JAYLEN BROWN: Yeah, we've got to help him out.  We know teams are going to try to blitz him, going to try to trap him and get the ball out of his hands.  So I'm just trying to be a threat out there, make them respect me.  I think everybody else is thinking, that, too, make them respect you so they can't put so much pressure on him.
