<p>	Q.  I was wondering if you go into this feeling any pressure to take over such a job, whether or not you spoke at all to the guy from NC State last year, Lee Fowler, the pressure, the focus you get with this position? </p>
<p>	Q.  Lee got some criticism last year.  Did he talk about dealing with that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you discuss weighing high RPI, and I know you touched on conference record, versus a winning conference record, especially in a major conference?</p>
<p>	Q.  I guess there's a perception out there that a winning record in a major conference is something that almost punches your ticket.  Is that accurate? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you also discuss the last 10 games of the regular season that you look at. </p>
<p>	Q.  Teams seem to perform so much better at home than they do on the road.  How will you factor that in?  What's the real true measure of how good this team is?</p>
<p>	Q.  The people on your staff who have real coaching experience, do you ask, "Coach, if you were a coach, you were preparing for these two teams, who would you least rather play?" </p>
<p>	Q.  I've talked to a lot of people who have. </p>
<p>	Q.  One of the things critics have landed on the committee for in the past is perhaps not actually seeing teams in person.  Has there been any sort of emphasis by you or the committee this year to get out and see a lot of games?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just maybe a little. </p>
<p>	Q.  On the home and road question, is the fact that road victories have been so difficult for most teams to come by this year, is that going to make it harder when you finally sit down and pick those 34?</p>
<p>	Q.  Sometimes injuries, extenuating circumstances, are taken into consideration.  We have a situation here where the Big-12 acknowledged there was a clock operator error, may have cost the team a game.  They can't change the win and loss.  Is that something they'd consider? </p>
<p>	Q.  There's a rumor out there, could you be more definitive, the last 10 games, just because team's schedules are sometimes more difficult the last 10, that was going to be deemphasized.  You basically said that's not the case. </p>
<p>	Q.  Should the champion  -- should the regular season champion of a conference rated in the Top 12 receive an at-large berth?</p>
<p>	Q.  What about non-conference, teams that have really struggled in non-conference, basically done nothing for their resume, then they win games within their league, then conversely a team that maybe has all their good wins before New Year's, then just can't do anything in their league?  How do you judge that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Why last 10? </p>
<p>	Q.  Why the last 10? </p>
<p>	Q.  Why that number? </p>
<p>	Q.  I cover BYU basketball.  In Utah there's a unique situation where three teams all will be eligible to play in Salt Lake City in the first round.  Could all three play, and what factors do you decide who goes where?</p>
<p>	Q.  Yeah. </p>
<p>	Q.  I know you don't want to talk about individual teams, but will BYU's refusal to play on Sundays have any influence?</p>
<p>	Q.  There's been some talk in the SEC, every conference thinks they should get more teams in than they do, they haven't had representation on the selection committee lately.  Do you think that as affected the fact that despite leading the country in non-conference RPI the last few years, they have gotten only six teams in and they certainly think they should get seven this year?  Do you think there needs to be representation from the SEC on the selection committee?</p>
<p>	Q.  So you don't think it's a problem, even from a perception standpoint?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talking about the pod system, three teams in Utah, last year Mississippi State, a higher seeded team, travels to Dallas to play Texas.  How do you go about putting the higher seeds closer to home this season?</p>
<p>	Q.  You look at a team like Florida, Kentucky, two possible No.  1 seeds, but how would you decide who went to the east and who went to the south? </p>
<p>	Q.  When it comes to teams like Duke, North Carolina, a team that traditionally is followed well, when it comes to attendance, do you try to spread those out?  We have Duke coming to Birmingham, Kentucky going to the Midwest.  Do you try to spread the teams that are followed well out?</p>
<p>	Q.  The pod system, last year I heard some complaints about Chicago.  You had a No.  6 Texas Tech playing No.  11 Southern Illinois in Chicago.  Creighton was playing No.  5 Florida in Chicago.  There was also some debate about Ohio State, a 4 seed last year, Illinois a 4 seed, Illinois stayed in Chicago, Ohio State got shipped west.  Are there any lessons from some of those things?  I know you said you can't make everybody happy. </p>
<p>	Q.  There are three first-round sites in the Southeast, more or less, with Tampa, Nashville and Birmingham.  Does that complicate the bracketing?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned earlier someone from the committee is assigned conferences, plural. </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm wondering, who was assigned the Southeastern Conference?</p>
<p>	Q.  With Kentucky, they're geographically an equal distance to Nashville and Indianapolis from the campus.  One is a dome, 40,000 seats, the other is 20,000 seats.  I'm wondering if the committee looks at ticket sales?</p>
<p>	Q.  So ticket sales could be a factor, all things being equal?</p>


<p>	Q.  In terms of seeding, does the committee somehow reward teams for "quality losses" such as a close road loss to a ranked opponent?  Is there such a thing as a "good loss"? </p>
<p>	Q.  As you said, the different factors such as number of points, whether it's a close game, are taken into consideration?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the pod system, go over the basics of what that entails. </p>
<p>	Q.  Like you said, the charge for the committee is the same.  From your experience on the committee, maybe from talking to some past chairs, do you think the way that gets done each year gets changed a little bit?  I know the factors are the same, but do you think each committee tends to maybe just give a little bit more weight to a certain factor? </p>
<p>	Q.  The RPI has gotten some criticism for the way it's been set up.  The basic formula is 15 to 20 years old.  Personally you might want to answer this or just in general.  Is it time for the RPI to maybe be retooled to some extent?  If that was the case, would that come from the committee or is that the NCAA?</p>
<p>	Q.  Everybody is talking about the fact this seems to be a wide-open year, numerous teams that have maybe a chance to reach the Final Four, win the national championship.  From your view, does that seem to be the case?  How much more difficult does that make the committee's job as far as deciding the seeds?  Do you think the Top 4 seeds is going to be difficult?</p>
<p>	Q.  Doesn't the committee chair usually present the trophy?</p>
<p>	Q.  Bill may be able to answer this, has there ever been a situation where the athletic director presented it to his own school?</p>
<p>	Q.  There's a certain team ranked No.  1 right now.  I thought about making the connection. </p>
<p>	Q.  The Big-12 is really strong at the top.  You have a situation where Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas are among the top teams in the country.  In a situation like that, would it cross your minds, regardless of their seeding, to put them in separate regions so they could not meet until the Final Four?</p>
<p>	Q.  For instance, would you make sure if Kansas is a 3 seed or something like that, I mean, they were in the same region as a 1 seed, Oklahoma, they would still be able to meet in the regional final?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would you look at a situation putting them in separate regions?</p>
<p>	Q.   I think there's a concern from coaches and therefore from fans around the Big-10 that the perception of the league is going to hurt the seeding of the teams at the top when they get into the tournament.  How do you avoid a committee buying the perception, whether it's positive or negative, about a league?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the effect parity might have on the field this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  What about on the field itself, picking the field?  Do you think some of the mid majors might get more consideration than in the past?</p>
<p>	Q.  The Big-10 final is played Sunday afternoon.  Last year Ohio State got shipped out west even though they won.  Some teams that didn't win got better positions in the tournament.  Are the Sunday finals, because they're so late, are they almost irrelevant in terms of the seeding process if both teams are already locked into the tournament?</p>
<p>	Q.  When those games are played, do they actually matter in terms of what the committee is doing?  It seems as if you have to have that job done. </p>
<p>	Q.  When you have the tournament selected and seeded, you go to the bracketing with the pods, how much of that is driven by top-seeded teams?  How much do you try to get the top-seeded teams close to home versus a lower-seeded team?</p>
<p>	Q.  If you have a situation where you can accommodate multiple teams versus one higher-seeded team, do you go to please more schools?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there anything that you absolutely can't do when you're arranging these pods?  Is it possible the two 1 seeds to be sent to the same site?</p>
<p>	Q.  Some confusion about the conference record getting in, losing conference record.  You were quoted as saying it's hard to justify because of the parity this year.  Was that a misinterpretation?</p>
<p>	Q.  This year with some of the first and second rounds, you have a situation like Oklahoma City where a conference is playing host, does that give an unfair advantage to a team within that state, they're almost guaranteed a close home game, instead of being the logical?  In this case, Oklahoma would be the logical host school, perhaps. </p>
<p>	Q.  Would the committee, though, perhaps look at that situation, Butler can't play in Indianapolis because it's the host school?</p>
<p>	Q.  Now that you're utilizing the pod system, the rationale of keeping teams at home, I realize the sites were determined sometime ago, but the first time since '85 when you went to 64 teams, there is no ACC geographic site at all, period, although the conference has won five of the last 12 championships, been the dominant conference in the tournament.  As far as future committee meetings, will there be discussions of keeping at least one site for major conferences so that their team can go there?  I think particularly the ACC has any number of sites, yet this year none of them were picked. </p>
<p>	Q.  I understand that.  Again, there's a certain irony in the sense in the east since '85 there have been two sites every single year except in '94 and '98, what I would consider the ACC area, from Atlanta, Washington, DC, probable more suitable sites than there are collectively in the east.  I understand in the west you have a limitation on the number of potential sites.  I'm saying, is it going to be a higher priority now because of the pod system?</p>
<p>	Q.  Clock controversy at the end of the game that may or may not have cost a game, does the committee look at that?</p>
<p>	Q.  The situation with the RPI, you talked about it a little bit, but is it almost a disservice?  There's one national network that constantly has that as their overriding theme.  Would it be better if the RPI, it's become public, it's out there, is that a disservice or is it stuff that you like to have out there that people talk about?</p>
<p>	Q.  On the issue of mid major teams that often become a source of debate on the selections, assuming that it's difficult to pigeonhole those teams or judge those teams because of their conferences, when you look at those teams' non-league schedules, is there a gut-level factor beyond all the factors that you mentioned earlier, "This team belongs, this team doesn't have quite the juice"?  Do you see what I'm getting at?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talk about trying to reward the higher seeds closer to home.  Is there kind of a cutoff for that, the Top 4?</p>
<p>	Q.  Texas is one that comes up, Pitt, do you remember the ones you received most criticism for last year?</p>


<p>	Q.  You can't speak to the security issues.  Are there any contingency plans for the possible war with Iraq, what will happen with the tournament, if there were any speeches from the President during the time of games, what the plans are?</p>
<p>	Q.  But the plan is to have the tournament regardless of the war?</p>
<p>	Q.  We had the announcement yesterday about CBS possibly farming out games if there was a war going on at the time.  The thing that was confusing, may have been the way the release was written, there are any number of different networks, cable networks, which were listed.  Do you have a definitive plan with CBS?  Would there be X number on this network, or all the ones, would they be on one of those networks?</p>


<p>	Q.  The bracket buster last weekend, how many games were you able to tune in for?  What do you think the impact that might have when you huddle?</p>
<p>	Q.  Instance the other day where a young lady protested during the national anthem of a game.  If that were to happen at the NCAA tournament game, what would the committee's reaction be?</p>
