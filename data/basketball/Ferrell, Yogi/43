  INDIANA - 75 
   
 Q.   For all three of you, what was working off the rim?   They just couldn't keep you away from the thing?  
KEVIN YOGI FERRELL:   We just wanted to transition and try to score in the first five, six seconds.   Me, Stan, Will, Evan, guys like that bringing the ball up.   We just wanted to keep attacking the rim.   We noticed they weren't really helping off.   We just wanted to go to the rim.   
   
 Q.   What was working to cut down on the turnovers?  
WILL SHEEHEY:   It's some of the things we work on every day.   Just because we had nine tonight doesn't mean we're not going to continue to working on it.   Really just guys continuing to move the ball, playing smart, and just really playing well here.   
   
 Q.   What does it mean to finally end the slump you've had against Wisconsin from '07 and to get a big win like this?   
WILL SHEEHEY:   It's something we've been working for all season.   We've played some games where we've played some tough opponents and haven't gotten it done.   So we knew what it takes.   Really we just stuck to our game plan throughout the whole time.   Yogi obviously made some big plays.   Stanford came off the bench and killed it tonight.   
So really if we have guys that are committed to doing what we've been doing, committed to the game plan, playing hard, playing smart, we're going to win games.  
   
 Q.   Stan, talk about your aggressiveness?   It seemed like every time you had the ball you were able to go to the back and it was there for you.   
STANFORD ROBINSON:   Well, Yogi and Will told me in the beginning of the game that the lanes were open and they told me to just keep going because that's one of my strong points.   So two of my leaders telling me to just keep going, I felt like I had the freedom to just be me.  
   
 Q.   How much did the energy in the Hall help you guys during the game?   
STANFORD ROBINSON:   For me, being the first time in Assembly Hall with that atmosphere, I know that helped me personally and then the team as well.   It joined us together down the stretch.   Because I mean, I'm sure everybody was tired.   Just hearing that crowd go crazy like that, I know I got a lot of energy.   I wasn't tired after that one.  
   
 Q.   What does this performance and the win say about how far you guys have come at the end of the year?   What's it say about what you'll be able to do in the big dance?   
KEVIN YOGI FERRELL:   We've come very far, had a lot of early losses, but I felt like we learned from that just watching film.   We're going to take this win and be grateful for it.   We've been working hard in practice, but we're not going to be content with it.   We'll just be in the gym and practicing because we know we have some tough opponents coming up.  
   
 Q.   Kind of following that, what's it mean for this team and what did this team take from Penn State in being able to close that game to what it was able to do tonight make big shots late and free throws late?  
WILL SHEEHEY:   Yeah, obviously having young guys and getting those games very close and even the way we called it back‑‑ I think we were down 15 twice in that game.   Just the way those guys know that you can win games regardless of what the score is really helped us.   The more games that they had that are close like that definitely helps those guys.   
Yogi and I played in a bunch of games like that, but for the younger guys to know that the game is not over at a certain point really helps.  
   
 Q.   You missed your first seven threes before you finally hit that eighth one.   Any hesitation before you shot that last one?   
KEVIN YOGI FERRELL:   No, not really.   I felt like I was open and pulled it.   I felt like most of my threes kind of felt good, just weren't going in.   So if I had to make one three, I was glad it was that last one.  
   
 Q.   What gave you the confidence that kept you going because for most of the day you were shooting the ball.   
KEVIN YOGI FERRELL:   I just tried to have an aggressive mindset really.   I knew some of my lay‑ups weren't going to fall early, but I wasn't going to let that get to me.   I was trying to get to the rim and put some points up on the board or kick it out.   That's just the mindset I always have.  
   
 Q.   The way you played these guys a lot of times, how different was the dynamic and style in any other IU‑Wisconsin game you've been in?   
WILL SHEEHEY:   They're a talented team.   They know what they're doing, and they stick to their game plan as well.   I don't think the pace of the game was that much different than normal.   Maybe they played a little faster, but they really stick to their principles and they do what they do.   We stuck to ours today and didn't try to have one guy take it over or anything.   The way the ball moved, it's tough to be in moving like that.
