  INDIANA - 56 
   
 Q.   What started to get away from you guys in the second half?  
WILL SHEEHEY:   Taking shots, making them take contested shots.   They had too many open looks off their break.   Did a good job stopping the initial break but their secondary break we didn't stop enough shots.   
   
 Q.   What happened with the bandage?   
YOGI FERRELL:   Just falling on the floor, really, court burn.   I'm all right, though.   
   
 Q.   Talk about the number of turnovers you gave up.   
YOGI FERRELL:   Still had more than what we wanted to get for turnovers.   The thing about that, we didn't get enough points off their turnovers, I felt like.   But we just had to kind of take care of the ball.   
We made great runs, but we could never push over that hump.   
   
 Q.   What makes Michigan State a strong team?   
YOGI FERRELL:   The ability to get out and run, especially offensively and defensively, they do a great job of help side defense, I felt like.   They especially packed the lane a lot.   Those are the things they do well.   
   
 Q.   What was Michigan State doing to take Noah Vonleh out of the game?  
WILL SHEEHEY:   They were fighting him for his catches, making every catch tough for him.   He's got to find a way to get more touches, easier touches.   He's got to work harder to get open.   And we've got to work harder to get him open.   
   
 Q.   Was there anything that Michigan State did to stop your breaks?  
WILL SHEEHEY:   We just had to wear them down, and we didn't get a point where we could speed them up enough so we could get on the break.   They had some second chance points and when the ball's going through the rim it's hard to get your break going.   
So we went to contest shots, make them shoot more contested shots and get out on the break.   
   
 Q.   Is there a certain amount of adjusting to the pace of the game in the Big Ten?   
YOGI FERRELL:   I'm not really sure.   I can't remember their turnovers, but I think a lot of them are unenforced and that's just the flow of the game.   We're okay with those kind of turnovers.   
But turnovers where we're just giving them the ball and they're scoring and things like that, we're not okay with.   So they're still learning.   And we're just going to learn to teach them every day.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
