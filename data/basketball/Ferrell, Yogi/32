Q.   Talk about what it was like to have Devin here tonight. 
YOGI FERRELL:   Yeah, it was a surprise for us.   We didn't expect him to be back down here to a game so early, but it just shows the improvement he's making.   We were glad to see him, glad he was here supporting us.   He's getting better right now, and we're trying to get him out there as soon as possible.
JAMES BLACKMON, JR.:   Yeah, it was really a surprise for him to be here because he's not just a teammate to us, he's like a brother to all of us, so we were really excited, and it actually gave us a little boost for the game. 
ROBERT JOHNSON:   Yeah, same thing.   I think it's just a blessing for him to be able to come out and be here at the game.   It had us excited before the game, and we're just thankful he could be here with us. 

Q.   What was your reaction when you first saw Devin? 
YOGI FERRELL:   We were happy, we were all jumping on him, like dog piling him kind of.   We were all happy to see him.   Wish he could have sat on the bench, but he sat behind.   He got in the huddles, so it was good to see somebody like that go through an injury like that and still out there supporting us and everything, giving everybody pointers.   That just makes you real happy.   Like James said, he's like a brother to us, known him for forever.   Just glad to see him back out there with a smile on his face. 

Q.   James, what did you like about what the team did tonight and what didn't you like? 
JAMES BLACKMON, JR.:   Well, I felt like on offense we were all good on all cylinders.   I feel like we just needed to pick it up defensively and play hard the whole game.   We feel like we let down a little bit on the team, but just keep it up the whole game. 

Q.   All three of you guys seemed like you were able to penetrate at will against them.   Was that something you saw on film or whatever that you were going to be able to do? 
YOGI FERRELL:   Yeah, that's something we wanted to establish, especially with guards like us who can penetrate and create basically.   We just wanted to get in the paint and we wanted to establish an inside game to start off with and let the outside game come, so that's what we tried to do this game. 

Q.   Yogi, you were able to cut down on turnovers the second half.   What were you able to do differently? 
YOGI FERRELL:   I think that was just a mindset of taking care of the ball, not making so much of long passes.   I remember one of my passes I tried to throw up to Troy, was kind of up court, really long, tried to force it.   Second half we made that adjustment as a team to not make home run passes, just make the simple one. 

Q.   Yogi, you had 10 assists and one turnover in the last two games.   How much of a focus has that been for you?   Do you have a target number in your head where you'd like to get to, assist‑to‑turnover ratio? 
YOGI FERRELL:   I don't really have a specific number.   I just want to cut down on the turnovers.   I feel like the assists will come with shooters like James, Rob, Nick, Max, guys like that, so if I just cut down the turnovers, make the simple pass to them, just drive and kick, my assist‑to‑turnover ratio will be really good. 

Q.   Coach talked about it seemed like they were getting to the basket a little too easy tonight.   What were they doing that was allowing them to do that? 
ROBERT JOHNSON:   I just think we didn't come with the right intent to approach the game, starting off.   We had a great game plan what we wanted to take away, but I just think the intensity from the beginning was lacking.   When teams like that get a little confidence it starts to make it harder as the game goes on, but I think moving forward we have to bring the intensity and intent from the beginning of the game. 

Q.   Robert, in terms of having to play a ranked team, how hard is it to come bouncing back in a few days? 
ROBERT JOHNSON:   Yeah, I guess you could say it's a little hard, but we all know that's a part of playing the game and a part of being a basketball player.   You're going to have quick turnarounds like that.   We've got another one coming Monday, so it's going to be the same thing so you've got to find a way to come out and still find your own and bring intensity from the beginning. 
JAMES BLACKMON, JR.:   Yeah, it's definitely a lot different from the crowd is behind you, but we just feel like we need to bring the intensity from ourselves and from the team, and that's what we're trying to do. 

Q.   Yogi, having known Devin forever, talk about what it took for him to be here tonight.
YOGI FERRELL:   That's what you probably would think coming from seeing Devin in the hospital.   Visited him a couple times, just kind of sad seeing one of my brothers, one of my teammates in a hospital bed like that.   I feel bad for him, that he's in that situation, but time has passed, time heals things.   I feel like that's what happened to Devin, and seeing him in the locker room, and I had my arm around him the whole time when we came back in from warm‑ups, just seeing him there.   Everybody was happy to see him, and we just want to get him out there on the court playing with us because I think he can contribute.
