  Q. Now you've got to make history. You know the stat. No team has ever come back down 3-1.   
 COURTNEY LEE: That's what we're looking to do, make history, like you say. No team has ever did it before, and we want to be the first to do it. That's our focus, and we know we can't just look ahead and think we're going to win games and look forward to the next game, so we're just going to take it one game at a time.  
  
  Q. It sounds clichÃ©, but you get one, you get another one, you get another one.   
 COURTNEY LEE: That's our main focus, one game at a time. You've got to play the whole 48 minutes. We might have an early lead like we did at halftime up by 12. You've still got to realize that it's not over and you've got to continue to play.   
 You have to get that one game, then focus on the next one.  
  
  Q. Who do you think is more -- has to be more loose in this type of situation, those guys because they've got the cushion, or you guys, because if you squeeze it too hard in this situation it might not work?  
 COURTNEY LEE: I think we've got to be loose. We've got to just go out there and play our game, just get back to doing everything that we've been doing that helped us be successful throughout the year. We need to carry that over to this series.   
  
  Q. This postseason you guys have been through everything?  
 COURTNEY LEE: I think we have. We've been down in series, we've been down in games, so this is nothing new to us. Like I said, we've just going to play our basketball, and that's what we do. We always come back, never get down on ourselves, and just looking forward to getting one game at a time.
