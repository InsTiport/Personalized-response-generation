 Q. Now it's 2-1 and you're ready to get back out there tomorrow?
 COURTNEY LEE: Yeah, we feel good about that. We've got a chance to come back home, protect the home court, did exactly what the Lakers did the first two games, protect home court. We got back home and protected our home court, got our momentum and started playing our game a little bit more and made a lot better defensive rotations. We supported each other on the offensive end and shots were going down.

 Q. How much difference did the home court make for the team?
 COURTNEY LEE: It definitely makes a big difference, especially getting home and playing in front of your home crowd to get that extra boost of support, so it definitely helps.

 Q. Is tomorrow night the same recipe for success again? I mean, you guys shot 62 percent. You didn't shoot a lot of three-pointers. A lot of mid-range jumpers and lay-ups. 
 COURTNEY LEE: Yeah, it's going to be the same recipe. It basically comes down to just competing and playing hard on both ends of the court for 48 minutes. That's what we wanted to do. We want to get back to running in transition and trying to get easy buckets like we were able to get last game.

 Q. Any more comfortable with the stage and The Finals feel and all that stuff? Does that get more comfortable as the series goes on?
 COURTNEY LEE: I don't know, man. It's another basketball game, but it's a basketball game that has significant meaning. It definitely means a lot more than any regular season game. But especially being back home definitely gives you that extra level of confidence.
