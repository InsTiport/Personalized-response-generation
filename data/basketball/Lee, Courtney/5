		   COURTNEY LEE: Like I said, it's my first year. A lot of people play their whole careers and don't ever get a chance to make it this far, so we're definitely treating it like it's never going to happen again.
 Coach had a quote from Dan Marino where when we first got there he enjoyed it, and he made a quote afterwards saying if he got back again he would change everything that he did. He never made it back. So we're definitely looking at it like that.
 
 Q. What about guys like Hedo and Rashard getting here after a decade in the league. Do you want to win it for them so much more because of that?
 COURTNEY LEE: Definitely. We want to win, period. Like you said, for those guys to be in the league 10, 11 years and this to be the first time making it, that shows that it doesn't happen that often. You've got to cherish it, and like I said, we're going to go out there and play like it's the last opportunity we've got.
 
 Q. What about Jameer coming back, a distraction, not a distraction?
 COURTNEY LEE: Not a distraction. It's not for sure if he's coming back or not. He's just doing a little bit of the workouts and the drills. We wish him the best with that.
 Jameer is a great player, so just having his presence out there is giving us confidence and he's helping us get better either way.
