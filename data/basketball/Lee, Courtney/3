  Q. Is it all about defense, getting that defense going?  
 COURTNEY LEE: It is. If you get your defense going, get some stops and get on a transitional run and get easy buckets such as lay-ups, it definitely helps.   
  
  Q. Anything to say to the Florida fans back there? Is everything okay with the Magic?  
 COURTNEY LEE: Everything is good. Everything is good. It's just one game. It's a seven-game series, so we'll be fine.   
  
  Q. How tough really is Kobe as far as you've had to guard in your career?  
 COURTNEY LEE: He definitely ranks as No. 1. He's definitely tough to guard. He's got everything in his game. He can shoot three, shoot off the jabs, pick-and-rolls, get to the basket. You never know what you're going to get, so he's definitely tough to guard.  
  
  Q. What do you know about guarding Kobe now that you didn't know prior to Game 1 perhaps?  
 COURTNEY LEE: I know pretty much everything about guarding him because I guarded him twice during the year. I knew he was a phenomenal scorer, but last game he came out and wanted to set the tone early for his guys, and I think he did a good job of that, not just on the offensive end but on the defensive end and also lead as a leader. That's probably one of the things that we need to focus more on is trying to stop him from setting that tone early.
