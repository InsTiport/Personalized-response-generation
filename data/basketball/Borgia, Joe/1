MATT WINER: Talk about the game tonight from an officiating point of view, I think you'd have to be pleased by what happened tonight.  There was an interesting call in the second quarter with Steven Adams and Draymond Green both going down hard.  The officials decided to go to replay here.  What's the trigger for replay, first of all?  How do you think they arrived at a double personal foul?   
JOE BORGIA: Well, Matt, it was a great game tonight by all three teams:  Both teams and the referees.  So on this play Kevin Durant takes a shot.  And while the ball's in the air, you have Adams and Green.  They get tangled up.  You see an arm go up, a leg go up, flipping over the back, and then you have a hard crash to the floor by Draymond's head.  So the officials immediately kill the play to come look at it for a hostile act.  And what they're looking for, they're looking to see if either of the players threw an elbow.  If either of the players flailed their arms and hit the other one.  But when they reviewed it, there's nothing unsportsmanlike on the play.  There really is nothing unnecessary.  You really just have a lock, a lock, and a pull down.  And because of where their bodies were stationed, they sort of fall over each other and one of them hits the ground hard.   
But it's too much contact to have nothing on.  So because they reviewed for the hostile act, they're allowed to come out with the appropriate penalty, and that's where they came out with double personal fouls on the play.   
MATT WINER: All right, Joe.  Appreciate it as always.  Easy night for you, and I know you like that.   
JOE BORGIA: Great night for all of us.
