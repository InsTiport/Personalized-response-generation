<p>	Q.  The first one that always has to be asked, have you been able to assess your team thus far, either earlier today or talking to them or do you look for body language in a circumstance like this?</p>
<p>	Q.  That was a lovely answer.  Thank you. </p>
<p>	Q.  Sometimes coaches in these circumstances say to themselves, we're going to go and do what got us here, this is how far we've gotten, the 7th game in the NBA Finals, we'll do what we do, but at the same time, the Detroit guards have really given your guards trouble.  At times do you look at different things or do you do what everybody knows?</p>
<p>	Q.  That answer begs the follow-up. </p>
<p>	Q.  What exactly is it, a lot of people noticed at the end of Game 5 when you switched Bruce Bowen on to Chauncey Billups that it seemed to be an effective switch and Tony Parker on Rip Hamilton.  The other matchup seemed to work for you.  Is that the alternative you're looking at? </p>
<p>	Q.  I can't stop. </p>
<p>	Q.  The things that we read about, Magic Johnson in the last game of The Finals in 1980, and do the things that happen in the final game of a Finals affect the legacy of a player? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you do anything to prepare primarily Duncan, Parker, Ginobili, for their first appearance in a Game 7 in The Finals?  Is there anything you say, anything that could prepare them? </p>
<p>	Q.  This is I think the fourth Game 7 of the playoffs this year, and a visiting team has won two of them already, and I know you've got your famous fool's gold line, how much do you feel you have to talk to them about that?  Yesterday the guys were saying, we would rather have it here than there, but we know it's not going to win the game, too. </p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of people have been calling on Tim Duncan to really assert himself here, but is that in character for your team?  He's usually very unselfish and plays a very team-oriented game, can you win that way with Tim becoming the focal point?</p>
<p>	Q.  Meeting Larry Brown last night for dinner, was it the first time in the series you met him out of the court and how much of the conversation, if you can share, was on the final series on basketball issues? </p>
<p>	Q.  Maybe if you drank more wine --</p>
<p>	Q.  What does happen to people after they die, Pop?</p>
<p>	Q.  What kind of pace would you favor, would you rather have like a very slow controlled game --</p>
<p>	Q.  Was your last Game 7, was that that Portland game in '89?</p>
<p>	Q.  You were almost --</p>
<p>	Q.  That was seven games, right?  Wasn't there a seventh game, '90? </p>
<p>	Q.  Yeah. </p>
<p>	Q.  Yeah, it was. </p>
<p>	Q.  I covered it. </p>
<p>	Q.  I was going it ask you if seventh games were any different, but apparently not. </p>
<p>	Q.  I have to ask one more because I forgot to identify myself, I'm Sam Smith, I'm with the Chicago Tribune.  But as far as a second guy, in all of these big games in I guess '88, the Game 7, the Lakers, James Worthy had a big game, as far as Ginobili, how much is he physically worn down from the Olympics and being a national hero and El Contusion he takes all season long and I notice you take him out a lot during games, is that to rest him, to have him at the end, and how important is he as a finisher for you today? </p>
