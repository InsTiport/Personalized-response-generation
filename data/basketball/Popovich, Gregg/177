<p>	Q.  Talk about Tim's ankle, how he's doing?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is he going to play?</p>
<p>	Q.  Great followups, though. </p>
<p>	Q.  You know if he will get Glenn back for Game 2?</p>
<p>	Q.  Stoudemire averaged almost 40 points a game in the regular season?</p>
<p>	Q.  I guess you sort of have to pick your poisons whether you go to guard at the perimeter or guard down low.  Is that something you are going to have to deal with?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you seen many point guards who pass once they get in-the-paint, like Nash?  Seems to be able to get in the paint and then make a pass?</p>
<p>	Q.  All three of your games with them in the regular season were well in the hundreds.  It is just unavoidable with the way they play?</p>
<p>	Q.  Seems like more the team you have now can play more at that kind of pace than any of the previous teams that you have had?</p>
<p>	Q.  How does that change your defensive approach when you have to go smaller?</p>
<p>	Q.  More dangerous that first phase of the fast break or when they get into that secondary transition?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does Joe Johnson's absence effect how you approach the first two games?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do coaches ever think about putting someone who is a key distributor like Magic or Mark Price with Cleveland take your biggest defender, biggest active defender no matter what position he plays then just put him on him to try shut him down?</p>
<p>	Q.  Make someone else make the play?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you feel Tony has played during these playoffs compared to past years? </p>
