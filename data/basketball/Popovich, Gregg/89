SPURS   102
  WARRIORS - 92

Q.   (No microphone.)
COACH POPOVICH:   He not only was aggressive, but the ball went in.   In the playoffs, it seems even more so, teams that shoot well do pretty darn well.   Tonight we shot 50 and they were in the 30s.   I haven't looked at the rest of the stats yet, but that was the story in the first two games for us, and it turned. 
We made shots and they didn't have as good a night shooting the ball.   Sometimes it's as simple as that.   There's other factors, you think about, turnovers, blah, blah, blah.   But we shot it and they didn't. 

Q.   Had you been seeing Tony a little too passive the last few games or... 
COACH POPOVICH:   I think sometimes he gets a little bit obsessed about driving it, getting to the rim.   When he does that, the turns down open jumpers and he forgets to play with teammates.   But when he's like tonight, like he's played most of the season, he'll stop, shoot the open jumper, he'll get his share of assists, and that's what we need him to be.   He's a scoring point guard, but he has to do it with a jump shot as well as a drive. 
He did that tonight. 

Q.   Pop, how important was it to get some minutes on the bench for Tony and Cory Joseph?
COACH POPOVICH:   Cory Joseph was important, because we wanted to get Tony some rest.   He was really tired last game.   We did a better job of giving him a blow here and there, not playing so many minutes in a row. 
I think it really helped him. 

Q.   This is probably only the 10th or so game they've been back together since they came back from injuries.   Does it take that long sometimes to find the rhythm?
COACH POPOVICH:   It does.   But I think getting Tiago back so we had our starting lineup, when we do that, it doesn't matter what the other team does player‑wise starting.   We may play well or poorly, but we're comfortable. 
We know how to operate starting out a game like that.   We might go small.   Tiago may come out, play a lot.   Being able to start with him gives us a comfort level. 

Q.   Talk about the job that Danny Green has done on Steph Curry and what you've done to slow Curry down these last couple games?
COACH POPOVICH:   I don't think we did anything special to slow him down.   I mean, we've tried to be a little bit more aware of what's going on, get up in the pick'n roll a little bit more, have other people involved, use different people on him. 
Danny has done a pretty decent job, as good as you can do on a great player like that. 

Q.   Could you talk a little bit about Boris and Ginobili?
COACH POPOVICH:   Manu, he hasn't been shooting the ball well.   Tonight he helped us by making some shots, playing good defense.   Boris is one of those high IQ players.   I never really know what he's going to do on the court, but he'll make a heck of a move, make a pass, do something on the weak side or make a steal.   He just really understands how to play. 
So them coming and having a good game was important.   We just had more guys play well.   We haven't had a lot of guys play well so far, but tonight we had four, five, six guys that played pretty darn well. 
Thank you.
