<p>	Q. Are you concerned by the way Beno has been playing sometimes in pressure situations and how would you assess his play in general backing up Tony?</p>
<p>	Q.  Sam Smith wanted me to ask you about Tim Duncan.  With Ben and Rasheed, is that as difficult of a matchup that Tim has to face, and just talk about why it is so. </p>
<p>	Q.  Unlike David Moore, I recognize the gravity of the situation here; I'm going to ask a serious question. </p>
<p>	Q.  No, don't do it.  The field goal attempts for your team versus their team have been a huge disparity, even the game you won, and Game 2, and obviously offensive rebounds, turnovers, but how much of a concern is that sort of a developing as a trend? </p>
<p>	Q.  To follow-up, I've heard you use the expression and I often quote you, but I've heard you say "fool's gold" about scoring up-tempo, those kind of things.  How much of the change in the Spurs' game would you push the ball more -- and is scoring a higher tendency and those things like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  I'll remember. </p>
<p>	Q.  But how about the running part, getting into the --</p>
<p>	Q.  Thank you for being corrected. </p>
<p>	Q.  Just a general bench question:  Can you assess their play so far in this series?  Have you gotten enough from them and what things do they need to do a little better?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Brown was just here talking about Ginobili being able to score a lot without shooting a lot.  Last game he took just seven shots and it's kind of different than other stars in the league.  Is that something you like, that if it's not there, that he doesn't take a lot of shots, or do you want him to be aggressive with that all the time?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you spend any amount of time the last couple of days discussing offense against full-court press, even just a few minutes going back to basics? </p>
<p>	Q.  I just hate to let you go so quickly.  When Tim Duncan has a game that's not to his standard personally, you always talk about not talking about it and leaving him alone and such.  What process does he go through?  What is he doing in these last 24 hours?</p>
<p>	Q.  Sounds like Coach of the Year stuff to me. </p>
