Warriors - 113, Spurs - 111   
 Q.  Any update that you can give on Kawhi?  
COACH POPOVICH: No.   
 Q.  Just your general thoughts about the Warriors' comeback?  
COACH POPOVICH: Well, it's a great team.  They're talented, they're well-coached.  You know, they're hungry, and they made great runs.   
We made too many mistakes.  Play a team like that.  Can't make the mistakes we made.  I thought the rebounding really hurt us, as is evidenced by the last -- I think it was Kevin that finally made it, or was it Klay?  He shot the three, then got the rebound back and shot another one, and the third one finally went down.  It was huge, but it was kind of indicative of what kind of mistakes we might have made.  Great effort, tough loss, great opportunity, and we let it slip away.   
 Q.  Think your team finally got a little rattled?  
COACH POPOVICH: You think so?  Did you notice that?   
 Q.  Well, I'm talking about when Kawhi went down, the game kind of changed.  
COACH POPOVICH: I'm just saying, okay.  Good observation.  You're correct.  We've got to move around it.  Our defense got a little in mud.  Couldn't get anybody to score, and they're fairly talented, as it showed.   
 Q.  Coach, I'm a little late?  
COACH POPOVICH: That's not my fault.   
 Q.  I just want to ask about Kawhi?  
COACH POPOVICH: I don't know.  I don't know.  The game just ended.  I haven't talked to anybody.  I don't know what Kawhi's status is.  I know he got his foot stepped on again, so he hurt the same foot.  We'll see.
