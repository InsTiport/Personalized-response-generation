Spurs   111
  Clippers - 107, OT

GREGG POPOVICH:   But you at least have to make him work, and he had to work tonight.   I thought Kawhi did a good job. 

Q.   You got a great contribution from Patty Mills tonight, sort of almost a throwback to last year's Playoffs.   Could you talk a little bit about what he did and the contribution‑‑ how big that was‑‑
GREGG POPOVICH:   Well, obviously it was huge.   He scored for us, and we needed to score to stay in the game, and he did that.   He did that all last year for us, and this year he's come back slowly from that shoulder where he was out so long, and just down here toward the stretch of the season, he started to have a game here and there like this one.   But for us to be successful, he's got to come in and score for us, and tonight fortunately he did that.
