<p>	Q.  You guys have led the league in preventing three-point makes and attempts, how do you emphasize playing that type of defense beyond the 3-point line and yet still play it inside the 3-point line as well as you have? </p>
<p>	Q.  Regardless of what happens tonight or in the rest of the series, you guys appear to be set up on paper pretty well for the future.  Can you talk about some of the moves you've made to secure players and contracts and stay young? </p>
<p>	Q.  On the same subject, can you talk about signing Robert Horry two years ago, I mean, was that something you thought about or it was like automatic once you heard he was available? </p>
<p>	Q.  I know you're focused on the game, but the Commissioner assured us they didn't make their announcement a while back to be a distraction.  As the Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations, do you have a general response to the fact that they have announced the agreement on a new Collective Bargaining Agreement?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is this the part of the series where the fool's gold part about the home games, and could you talk about talking to your team about not relying on that and how do you approach your team at times like this? </p>
<p>	Q.  Not necessarily to follow-up, but one more question, how much concern, or do you have any concern about the way you finish the game, other than the fact that it went your way, but some of your key guys were not able to get involved offensively and probably hard to expect that from Robert Horry on a regular basis? </p>
<p>	Q.  I don't know if you would agree with this or not, but from the outside looking in, you've seemed more at ease on this process, this trip, than the other two Finals.  Do you agree with that, and if so, is there a reason for it? </p>
<p>	Q.  As a friend of Larry's, do you have a good sense of how difficult this season has been for him and how difficult it will be eventually when he may have to make a decision as to whether he can continue coaching or not?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are there any adjustments you can make with Tim Duncan in just 48 hours between games on his free throw shooting? </p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering if there's anything you reinforced between games. </p>
<p>	Q.  Tim goes 26 and 19 the other night, and then they take away stuff, but following up on what Sam did, there's an entry pass that he misses, a tip in that maybe he could have done, maybe not, I don't know, does he beat himself up again after a victory and after going 26 and 19? </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm saying from your perspective, from what you've seen the last two days. </p>
