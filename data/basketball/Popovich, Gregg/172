<p>	Q.  Talk about Robert?</p>
<p>	Q.  Considering it is a closeout game, how important is it for you to come out with the same intensity and up-tempo game that you did in Game 3?</p>
<p>	Q.  Looking back at the last game.  Three quarters you guys played so solid.  You look at the fourth quarter, is there anything that you would like to do differently? </p>
<p>	Q.  For years you used to talk about your team is always in transition.  You were competing at a high level all that time, but is the transition over?  Do you feel like you finally got to where you were heading for all those years?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you look at the whole thing, is it by design or have you been careful about what you brought in?</p>
<p>	Q.  Were you at all surprised with what he (Tim Duncan) has been able to do defensively?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have to work on getting his (Tim Duncan) spirits up at all particularly after he sprained his ankle with Detroit?</p>
<p>	Q.  At what point in the last year did you make the decision to let Manu (Ginobili) go a little bit?</p>
<p>	Q.  How hard was it to watch the left-handed wraparound pass --</p>
<p>	Q.  You kind of take -- there's more better than bitter --</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you have to be talked into loosening the reins or did you just understand that it's time?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talk about not taking credit for this, drafting him in 57 or whatever it was, you saw something -- you saw something?</p>
<p>	Q.  But the question is, what did you see?</p>
<p>	Q.  What did you see, though?</p>
<p>	Q.  You got young Tony and young Ginobili and you have got Tim Duncan.  How much -- you have to have patience to sit there and let these guys make all these mistakes making all these kinds of plays and your patience to go and get a veteran guy, let me slow this down and put somebody in there who -- you know, we don't want to waste any --</p>
