		  GREGG POPOVICH:   He blew it today, this afternoon, and he's just warming up to see how it feels. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
GREGG POPOVICH:   Yeah, I think under these circumstances, we want him to play more.   One would want to have their best players on the court as much as possible, and starting him allowed me to do that, and we'll do the same again tonight. 

Q.   Besides starting him, the impact on the second period? 
GREGG POPOVICH: Well, these guys have played all year long.   The second unit is not like the second unit or guys that are just getting to the game for the first time.   They've been playing all year long, so it's really not much of a factor.

Q.   Analysts are saying it really messes up your flow.   What do you think about that?
GREGG POPOVICH: You know, we're doing the same things, same stuff that we've done all year.   Those guys are used to it.   It's not a big deal.   When Manu was coming off the bench, we were just as bad in the second quarter then as we were last night.   I don't see it. 

Q.   Whoever comes out of this series the next round (Inaudible)?
GREGG POPOVICH: This is Game 7 tonight, and that's where my focus is.   That's the way we've got to think about it; this is Game 7.   That's our goal, to get to Game 7.
