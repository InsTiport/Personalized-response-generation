<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the second quarter, specifically the defense in the second quarter, how happy you were with what you saw, probably what you were looking for this whole series?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you do anything differently on the pick and roll?</p>
<p>	Q.  You had a big man like Tim Duncan following Steve Nash around a lot. </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about Tony Parker's performance.  He talked earlier how you were hard on him early in his career, but it's helped him?</p>
<p>	Q.  How instrumental was he (Parker) to getting off to that good start?</p>
<p>	Q.  Were you worried when you scored that many points in the first quarter, do you ever look at the score and go, wow, that's too many even though we're ahead?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked at times about the challenge of holding a lead throughout the duration of a game in the NBA.  A couple of times you have done it against a team like Phoenix.  How proud are you doing that from start to finish?</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys held off a pretty good charge by them in the fourth, first two games you also had comebacks.  Are you just seeing that the experience of your team maybe is winning out here in the clutch situations against a Suns team obviously that has not been this deep before?</p>
<p>	Q.  You even won championships when Tim (Duncan) was having trouble making free throws.  He seems to be over the hump.  How did that happen? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little more specifically about how you executed differently against Nash and Stoudemire to shut them down in this game?</p>
