Game 2   
Warriors 116, Spurs 101   
 Q.  Is this a more discouraging loss because of what you got from Aldridge and the fact it looked like you competed at a greater level than on Saturday?  
COACH GREGG POPOVICH: I don't put adjectives on loss.  It's a loss or a win.  It's got nothing to do with it.  It's how you want to play, how you play, how you execute what kind of physicality and aggressiveness you display and I was pleased with it tonight.  They executed the game plan wonderfully.  I thought their physicality was great.  We were aggressive.  Played very well.   
You know, both teams are going to make mistakes here and there and that's fine, but the ball has to go in the basket and that's the difference in the ballgame.  They shot 50 percent from three, and I don't know what we shot, 14 percent, 4-for-28 or something like that.  That's tough to overcome but I was really happy with their execution and their aggressiveness, and hopefully we'll keep that and stick together but you've got to make shots, and it's been like that the entire year on the road for us for whatever reason and it really showed up tonight.  That made it very difficult.   
 Q.  Speaking specifically of Aldridge, you needed a big game from him and got it.  
COACH GREGG POPOVICH: LaMarcus has been a monster all year long.  He's led our team at both ends of the floor.  He doesn't complain about a darned thing out on the court.  He just plays through everything.  I can't imagine being more proud of a player as far as playing through adversity and being there for his teammates night after night after night.  He's been fantastic.
