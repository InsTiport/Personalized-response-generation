<p>	Q.  What do you find usually after Tim (Duncan) has a game where he's disappointed himself, given the free throws after a game?  How does he come out?  How does he approach games after that?</p>
<p>	Q.  You switched Bruce Bowen onto Joe Johnson the second half of Game 3.  He did terrific job on Shawn Marion.  Is it kind of your theory he will take the hot hand of those two guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know you love to rank things, so where would you rank Amare (Stoudemire) in terms of difficult covers that you have had in the playoffs in past years?</p>
<p>	Q.  Has he been one of the most difficult guys you have had to defend in the -- I mean, it goes beyond just the numbers.  Does he present you more problems than most guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  From like '98 on, you played the Lakers almost annually in the playoffs.  That's when Shaq was 27 years old, you played him better than most.  Amare (Stoudemire) obviously is a completely different deal, but you guys are used to being really good at defending around the basket?</p>
<p>	Q.  You had said the other day the thing you most appreciate about Tim (Duncan) is his genuineness.  Can you give an example of that, how that comes into play?</p>
<p>	Q.  You said you didn't say anything to him after the last game, but does he say anything to you like in his way?</p>
<p>	Q.  You coaches don't do much. </p>
<p>	Q.  With Mike Brown getting the job in Cleveland, talk about what a guy he is and a guy they are getting?</p>
<p>	Q.  We don't have the benefits of film, other than Star Wars maybe, we don't see the games as often as you do.  You talked so much about transition defense after the last game.  Yet you had 20 offensive rebounds, your two big guys had like 13 between them.  Can you hit the offensive boards and get 20 offensive rebounds and then also have the transition defense that you want?</p>
<p>	Q.  The way you described Tim (Duncan) just now would seem from the outside to be a way that we might describe the Spurs over the years.  Is it safe to assume that's from his influence or does he have to go -- if you do think that's a good description -- beyond that and speak of those things and express it beyond just showing it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you then look for guys who feel that way because we know there are guys in the league who feel differently?</p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of talk to the series about your defense and Amare (Stoudemire)--</p>
