<p>	Q. Coach, can you talk about were you surprised Rasheed wasn't getting more touches in Game 1 and are you expecting him to get a lot more in Game 2? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you expect them to go back to him a little bit more in Game 2, do you think?</p>
<p>	Q.  He's aggressive, he's very skillful, his tremendous stamina; Manu Ginobli, which facet of his game impresses you the most? </p>
<p>	Q.  Does he appear to be just scratching the surface?  Is there much more Ginobli in the future? </p>
<p>	Q.  Robert Horry moves at his own pace, did it take you a while to get used to him and his style?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you decide how much artistic freedom to give to a guy like Manu and when to rein him in? </p>
<p>	Q.  When did you decide? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did that have anything to do with watching him in the Olympics? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just talk about your team's ability to year after year find guys late in the draft that not only played, but played such significant roles with your team?</p>
<p>	Q.  There was a stretch in the first half yesterday where the team was struggling offensively, you made some substitutions, you got Devin in, you got Glenn Robinson in and some really nice minutes from Glenn Robinson, can you talk about how much of a lift, particularly Robinson, you got from those guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much confidence do you have in Glenn Robinson knowing that he has not have the time to practice because he's had some family issues, etc., etc.? </p>
<p>	Q.  Where do you think Manu's competitiveness comes from?</p>
<p>	Q.  Nazr Mohammed said when you win a game like you did last night, it's almost like a loss sometimes and people are just trying to get better and figure out where they can improve.  Do you ever have to bring this team down from a high and get them to refocus? </p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously everybody on the team is a great defender, Ben is a great defender for them but how does what Bruce Bowen does compare, because he's not just always on the block, he's running through screens on the baselines?  Does it go back to a word you like to use, "demeanor"? </p>
