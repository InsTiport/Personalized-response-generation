<p>	Q. Can you talk about Brent Barry, just how he sacrificed a little bit to come to the team this year and obviously didn't have a great game the other night but imagine you expect a little bit more out of him? </p>
<p>	Q.  How did he fit in defensively?  Because that was an area of his game he wasn't really known for. </p>
<p>	Q.  Following up on Brent, what is your thinking about why he's worrying about shots so much? </p>
<p>	Q.  And on Glenn, you ended up playing him, when it sounded pregame like he might not be played at all.  Based on what he did in Game 1, how does that affect your thinking about him tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  When Dwyane Wade torched Tayshaun Prince, they switched Rip Hamilton on him.  Do you anticipate them putting Rip on Manu tonight and will that affect the way you attack? </p>
<p>	Q.  Yesterday Robert Horry said something along the lines that Tony Parker in particular had to learn how to tolerate you the first year or so in the league.  Is there a germination period or something that players have to go through when it comes to being with you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would you like to ask us questions after three days of interrogation?</p>
<p>	Q.  Early on, both Tony and Manu, when you got behind 17-4 were kind enough to talk to the team about what they needed to do, "we're having trouble getting to the basket and Detroit was closing in," and you went to Tim so much.  Do you think Detroit would want to react to that, obviously Tim is so important to you, but that you rely on him when things go bad and they are going to overplay him this time?</p>
<p>	Q.  We asked Duncan yesterday about Bowen's defense and he said we should ask Ginobli --</p>
<p>	Q.  We asked Duncan about Bowen's defense and he said we should ask Ginobli about that because his first year, Bowen, according to Duncan, it was not pleasant what Bowen did to Ginobli.  What do you remember about those days? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did they get concentration at all? </p>
<p>	Q.  One of your favorite phrases about your team is that "it's gotten over itself," I was wondering how that applies to you as well.  You've been a big part of this whole success. </p>
<p>	Q.  It has nothing to do with you at all?</p>
