Q.   What stuck out to you from yesterday's game? 
GREGG POPOVICH:   I thought we played good defense. 

Q.   Is there anything in particular that really impressed you defensively about how you played?
GREGG POPOVICH:   Just overall team.   Some individual, some team defense, but we played it pretty well.

Q.   Could you talk about what Matt has been able to do fronting the post and sort of making himself a pest for guys like Dwight Howard? 
GREGG POPOVICH:   You know, everybody tries to work hard on post D.   They've got good post players, and we're just trying to make them work as hard as we can. 

Q.   What enabled this team to put up 14 threes?   What did you see specifically from your offense?
GREGG POPOVICH:   The ball happened to go into the basket.   It's a game.   Some nights you make two, some nights you make 14.   That's a rarity, but there's never really a reason you can say, well, you were hot that night or‑‑ but we didn't run anything magical to get the shots.   They just went in last night.

Q.   Given the minutes, the points, the defense, is Splitter maybe ahead in development than where you thought he'd be the second year?
GREGG POPOVICH:   Well, one never knows what the upper limit for a player might be, but he's improved steadily since he's gotten here.   He's a hard worker, and he wants to be a really good player. 

Q.   What area the most has he made the most strides? 
GREGG POPOVICH:   Everything, both ends of the court. 

Q.   Tim mentioned that he feels you're more fiery now as a coach than you were years and years ago. 
GREGG POPOVICH:   Timmy is a pain in the ass.   I'm tired of coaching him.   Anybody else?   Okay, have a good day.
