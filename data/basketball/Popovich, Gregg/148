<p>	Q.  Congratulations.  How easy does having a guy like Tim Duncan make your job?</p>
<p>	Q.  It seemed like in the second half when you fell behind, your defense found another level and that's what you back in the game.  Can you talk about what you guys were doing out there, and how important the switch to the zone for a few possessions was to that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, I understand that a few moments ago you met with Coach Brown, and I was wondering if you could either share what was said or how difficult that was for you and/or he? </p>
<p>	Q.  He was very classy to you, but yet how much could you tell that this hurt him and what did you say to him? </p>
<p>	Q.  If he does have to give up the coaching, how tough do you think that's going to be for him knowing how much he loves the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  This third trip The Finals, for you personally, how different was it?  It seemed like you were the funniest guy in the press conference the whole last three weeks. </p>
<p>	Q.  Could I ask you, I got here a bit late, everyone focuses on Tim throughout the year; when you lose, it's his fault, and when you win.  Can you talk about what he showed tonight, not necessarily to you, because I think you know what he is, can you talk about that?</p>
<p>	Q.  What about tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm going to try this for the third time to ask you this question. </p>
<p>	Q.  Now that you have three titles in seven years --</p>
<p>	Q.  Let me ask you this. </p>
<p>	Q.  About you?  You always say --</p>
<p>	Q.  That's okay.  It's part of the game. </p>
<p>	Q.  You always say that it's your job, and you have success if you don't mess it up.  Can you assess what you did in the sidelines in this series, is it simply not messing it up, or is it actually mixing it up perhaps with defenses?</p>
<p>	Q.  What wine are you going to celebrate this with?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the success your defense had toward the end of the game and the stops you made on Chauncey Billups towards the end?</p>
