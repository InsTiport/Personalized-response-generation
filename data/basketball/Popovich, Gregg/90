Q.   Were you impressed, happy with the intensity tonight?
GREGG POPOVICH:   Sure.   I mean those guys are the best in the world and they competed and worked hard.   They respected the game.   They respected each other.   Nobody got hurt.   The fans had a great time.   That's what it's all about. 

Q.   Talk about James Harden looked to you. He had that ankle, how did that go?
GREGG POPOVICH:   He's great.   I talked to him ahead of time about his ankle and that sort of thing, and he felt it was no problem.   We tried to give him a little bit of extra time here in Houston.
