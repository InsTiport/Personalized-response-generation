<p>	Q.  Long time ago, beginning of the season, you were the one who said that this would work in the playoffs.  Phoenix, were they kind of a looming nightmare for you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was the difference in the series -- not only the series, but today's game, especially in the third quarter, defense?</p>
<p>	Q.  What is your thought now on having over a week off now before you have to play anybody else?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about Tim Duncan's play, he came out particularly aggressive.  Was that a carryover from the last game, how he felt coming out of that game?</p>
<p>	Q.  How hard do you think it will be to switch to a more grinding game no matter who you play in the next round than what you saw in this series?</p>
<p>	Q.  Going to be your third Finals appearance in seven years.  Three very different versions of your team.  What has enabled you to sustain this over such a long period of time with so much change?</p>
<p>	Q.  Has anyone ever done to you what Amare (Stoudemire) did this in this series?</p>
<p>	Q.  42 and 16?</p>
<p>	Q.  This wasn't coaching, why you have been in the Finals all these times?</p>
<p>	Q.  I have got to change my lead?</p>
