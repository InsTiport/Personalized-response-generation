 Q.   Can you give us your take on Tim Duncan in the overtime playing with the five fouls and what he was able to do?  
GREGG POPOVICH:   Obviously he basically took over for us in that overtime scoring‑wise, did a great job, just took it upon himself to be aggressive, and it helped us win.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone).   
GREGG POPOVICH:   Sometimes your worst nightmare is a big lead, and it's tough to keep leads often times.   We were fortunate in Game 1 to be able to do it, and tonight we weren't able to do it.   They're a heck of a basketball team and they're not going to give in.   But in the third and fourth quarters, they did a better job than we did with 50/50 balls, executing offense, and I thought while we turned it over, we also fell into a lot of poor shots, end of clock, and that allowed them to get back into the game.   
   
 Q.   The first half, discuss your defense in the first half.   
GREGG POPOVICH:   Well, we did a very good job defensively in the first half.   Second half it was relatively average, but there's no stopping until you get a board, until you get the 50/50 ball or a board, and they got them all.   They did a great job of that.   
   
 Q.   Anything different that they did on Tony?   He had 16 assists.   
GREGG POPOVICH:   No, Tony has learned to take what's offered between scoring and assists.   He moved the ball well, and I don't know what he ended up with, 15 or 16.   I didn't see the‑‑  
   
 Q.   15 and 18.   
GREGG POPOVICH:   Okay.
