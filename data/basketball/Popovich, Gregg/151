<p>	Q.  Talk about the way Detroit seemed to respond, not only to the adversity of the end of Game 5, but to seemingly every big basket you guys seemed to have tonight, they answered right on the next possession. </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about Rasheed Wallace's play down the stretch, he really had some critical plays for them. </p>
<p>	Q.  They had eight three-pointers this entire series, eight three-pointers tonight.  Was it something different they were doing or just hitting their shots?</p>
<p>	Q.  They have not looked for the three-point shot this entire series, did that surprise you they were looking for that shot?</p>
<p>	Q.  You gave Manu a brief rest with about seven minutes to a little under six in the fourth.  Did you think he had enough energy at the end of the game, and secondly, was he forcing a little bit toward the finish, the final couple of minutes? </p>
<p>	Q.  Sort of following up on what Mike said, you mentioned late, Manu, you were down two, a minute or something to go, how important was that turnover and turnovers in general to what you guys were not able to do?</p>
<p>	Q.  You had a chance to wrap this up at your home, and you have two chances obviously.  Can you talk about the disappointment not doing it tonight and the setup for Game 7 ? </p>
<p>	Q.  You got great triple penetration in the first half from Manu, and Tony, they seemed to close that out a little bit in the second half, was that them? </p>
