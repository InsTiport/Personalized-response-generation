Q.   Is there a point that Tony has to decide between being a distributor or a scorer?   Is that something that he can handle both? 
COACH POPOVICH:   Well, I'll let Tony make that decision during a game, especially scoring.   He's done a great job all year mixing it up, scoring, helping other people score.   Same job, doesn't change.

Q.   Did they do anything differently with him last night than in the other games? 
COACH POPOVICH:   I think the person that did the most different for them was Manu.   Switching Manu, putting the block on him.

Q.   What does Manu need to do to get his game back? 
COACH POPOVICH:   We'll talk about that.

Q.   The TNT guys were saying yesterday that you told them recently (No microphone) it would have been good for you guys to lose.   Do you still feel that way after last night? 
COACH POPOVICH:   Everybody wants to win every game.   That's what you try to do.   You try to win.   They played great.   They had a lot to do with us playing poorly. 
But nobody wants to lose a game in the playoffs.   You try to win every game.

Q.   Can a loss get a team to refocus after a long winning streak? 
COACH POPOVICH:   One would hope so.

Q.   With this team? 
COACH POPOVICH:   The good teams always come back after a loss.   You don't know if you're going to win or lose your next game, but you come back and you play.   Everybody wins and loses.   Not that dramatic a thing. 
If you win, it's not the most amazing thing in the world.   If you lose, it's not the most amazing.   You just keep on playing.

Q.   Do you think the atmosphere here played any role on your guys? 
COACH POPOVICH:   No.   The basketball team played a role.
