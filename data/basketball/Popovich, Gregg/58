Q.   Coach, is this the highest level of execution by both teams that you can remember in a Finals matchup that you've been a part of? 
COACH GREGG POPOVICH:   I don't really know how to gauge that.   I haven't tried to compare it to any other Final or anything.   You have enough to do just worrying about this Final, let alone comparing it to others. 

Q.   When you were here in November and you sent the guys home and Danny being one of them with your Big Three guys, your older three guys, did you already value him in the same way as those three guys or do you now? 
COACH GREGG POPOVICH:   We didn't keep Danny here because we really overplayed him; he was getting tired.   We had played him an awful lot.   And that was the only reason.   We were just giving him a rest.
