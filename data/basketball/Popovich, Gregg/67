Q.   Coach Pop, obviously the big difference from Game 2 to Game 1 was in the amount of turnovers that the Spurs had.   When you went back and looked at the tape of the 15 turnovers, how many of them would you say were forced, really forced turnovers and how many of them were avoidable? 
COACH GREGG POPOVICH:   I think that probably about half and half. 

Q.   Have you seen anything in particular they were doing against Tim that worked so well or still just kind of a tough shooting night for him, they were good shots?
COACH GREGG POPOVICH:   Who was the player? 

Q.   Tim.   I'm sorry.     
COACH GREGG POPOVICH:   I think they did a good job keeping the ball away from him. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thanks, Coach.
