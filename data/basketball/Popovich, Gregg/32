Q.   Gregg, down the stretch, did you guys not get what you wanted?   Was it their defense?   What happened offensively for you guys? 
    COACH GREGG POPOVICH:   LeBron with the ball did a great job at his end and we had to be really pretty perfect at the other end and we didn't.   We didn't take advantage of things, we made bad decisions. 
    The ball stuck to us.   I think we were trying to do it‑‑ we didn't do it as a group.   We tried to do it individually and we're not good enough to do that. 

Q.   You said the ball stuck.   What was the difference between the first half and the second half, where you got good ball movement in the first half and the ball seemed to get stuck in the second half? 
    COACH GREGG POPOVICH:   That's what happened, the ball stuck. 

Q.   When LeBron was coming down and pulling up in the third quarter, does it get you too much out of your defense to send a double early that far out on the court? 
    COACH GREGG POPOVICH:   Well, you can go double him if you want.   He's a pretty good player.   I'm going to guess he's going to find the open man. 

Q.   Coach, how do you rate the way you guys moved the ball tonight?   Because it was pretty well at sometimes but then they got sloppy, the ball movement tonight. 
    COACH GREGG POPOVICH:   I think it's a 48‑minute game and we didn't move it enough of those minutes, basically.   It's how we have to score.   We can't put it in somebody's hands and have them create everything for us.   It's got to be a group effort and we didn't do that. 
    That puts a lot of pressure on everything else.   It means we're going to have to be perfect on defense, we can't miss four free throws in a row, those sorts of things.   You move it or you die. 
    THE MODERATOR:   Thanks, Coach.
