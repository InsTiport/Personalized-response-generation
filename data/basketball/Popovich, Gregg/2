Game 1
Warriors 113, Spurs 92
GREGG POPOVICH: What do you want?  I'm so tired of this.
Q. What went wrong for you guys tonight?
GREGG POPOVICH: What went wrong for us?
Q. This afternoon.
GREGG POPOVICH: They played better than we did.
Q. You started Green basically on Kevin.  Was that -- did that work very well?
GREGG POPOVICH: Did you watch the game?
Q. Yes.
GREGG POPOVICH: What do you think?
Q. Didn't.
GREGG POPOVICH: Didn't work very well.  We'll have Danny grow four or five inches by Monday night, tell him to jump higher and move quicker and we'll tell Kevin, don't be so good.
Come on.
Q. Were you surprised by the starting lineup that Steve put out there, and was the tone of this game, was it set from the beginning?
GREGG POPOVICH: No, we weren't surprised, but the second part of your question is a good one in the sense that they looked -- they had more grunt.  They had more physicality.  The first quarter, we looked like deer in the headlights, very disappointing.  I thought we were very prepared physically and mentally but I was mistaken.  As I said, we looked like deer in the headlights.  The defense was really poor as far as following game plan of the first quarter, and it's a bad combination to play defense like that and not shoot at the other end.
So that was the game right there.  We need to have a couple of people play better but that's a different deal.  Players have to play well.  But I'm just talking about the general setting of the game.
Q. You put Rudy in the second half, how do you think that worked as far as the change?
GREGG POPOVICH: I thought it was great.  He's somebody that they have to guard.  We have a few players that they don't guard, which makes it very difficult getting shots and doing some things.  So Rudy helped us in that sense.
Q. Is that something adjustment-wise that maybe you're going to go with in the second game, maybe starting him right away?
GREGG POPOVICH: This game just ended, so give me a little time.
