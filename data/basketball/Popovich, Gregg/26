 Q.   Manu talked at shootaround about how you guys made a lot of mistakes in Game 3 that got overlooked because of the shooting.   Did you feel defensively you guys struggled?   They shot over 50%.   Is that something you kind of harped on over the last day?   
COACH GREGG POPOVICH:   That's what we spent all of our time on was the defense, because I thought we did a pretty mediocre job.   
It's always like that.   Doesn't matter whether you win or lose, coaches always find something to moan and groan about.   So we did the same thing.  
   
 Q.   Last Finals and this Finals has been a series of adjustments.   Do you feel you have something to change from the way you guys played Game 3 to the way you guys are going to play Game 4?   Something strong that you have to change?   
COACH GREGG POPOVICH:   No.
