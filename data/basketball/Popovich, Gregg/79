 Q.   Given the momentum you had after the first two days, will the days off help‑‑ were they beneficial to you?   
GREGG POPOVICH:   Who knows?   Who knows?   
   
 Q.   Everybody available tonight?  
GREGG POPOVICH:   Yes, everybody is fine.   
   
 Q.   If there are some things you need to improve on, what would you say they were?  
GREGG POPOVICH:   Just basketball.   It's a game of mistakes, and there's always room to improve on both ends of the court, so it doesn't matter if you win the game or lose a game, there are always things you can improve on.  
   
 Q.   Such as?   
GREGG POPOVICH:   Nothing super specific.   
   
 Q.   What's been the key for your two quick starts?  
GREGG POPOVICH:   Well, there are no answers to those kinds of questions.   It's always a little bit of everything because it's a game.   It can be a combination of maybe we made shots and they didn't, some turnovers one way or the other, maybe you got a good call, or all those things combined.   If you complained that everybody tried to jump out on everybody else, but you don't see that happening.   Sometimes it's your worst nightmare.   It's hard to keep the lead, so jumping out to a lead isn't always that great a deal.   
   
 Q.   Is this one of your favorite pop tunes?  
GREGG POPOVICH:   This is one of the things that helps you retire.   (Laughter).   
You start thinking about, there is a life out there.
