<p>	Q.  After Game 2, Tony Parker assured folks that you would stay on them, keep them focused.  What's been your emphasis, what you've shown them, what you've reminded them to keep them focused over the last 24 hours or so? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you lean on your international experience a little bit to say whether the international players you have in the backcourt, you think, gives your team an international style of play in any sense?</p>
<p>	Q.  Another international question:  I've read in today's paper that you were willing to have a training camp in Europe starting 2006, I think.  Can you give us the reasons and I trust, is it true and what are the reasons and what do you hope to gain from that? </p>
<p>	Q.  It's in the San Antonio Express News. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, looking back to Manu's rookie season, what was it about him that you saw back then that made you think he would be a special player and what gave you so much confidence to play him and give him such a big role on the team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Pop last summer, you like ended the break-up of the Lakers to the break-up of the Soviet Union, is Phil Jackson returning sort of like Brezhnev returning to the Soviet Union? </p>
<p>	Q.  Given that baseball, during the World Series, they don't allow transitions of this magnitude to take place, would you favor a similar rule for basketball so that there would not be like an upstaging thing going on during The Finals? </p>
<p>	Q.  We know that Tony made a lot of adjustments since he's come to San Antonio, how much would you say that Manu adjusted to your style and to what you wanted him to do?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you look at these first two games, is there any one area that you can look at and say, wow, we need to do that a lot better.  We were really substandard in that department.  Is there any phase of the game where you can say that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are the adjustments similar with Tony, the ones you talked about with Manu, just getting used to each other? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, jumping back to the question before that, you said that there are things that you'd like to see your team improve.  Given that you're up 2-0, how difficult does that message become to convey to a player who is looking and saying, we're up 2-0? </p>
