   GREGG POPOVICH:  Another hard-fought game.  We feel fortunate to come out of here with a victory.  These guys are a heck of a basketball team, and I don't think they've lost here in the playoffs.   
 I thought we did a good job of hanging in for 48 minutes.  We didn't do a great job of that in Game 3, but I thought we did a real good job of that tonight.   
  
  Q.  Can you talk about Manu getting going in the third quarter?   
 GREGG POPOVICH:  Manu was very aggressive in the fourth quarter and got himself open a couple times, made some shots and free-throws.   
 His aggressiveness always helps us at the offensive end because we didn't score much in the third quarter.  I don't remember exactly what, but I think we were about 13 points in the third quarter, what we scored.   
 We needed to score in the fourth, and he helped us do that.   
  
  Q.  Can you talk about Fabricio Oberto and some of the hustle plays he made tonight?   
 GREGG POPOVICH:  Fabby is a blue collar guy who tries to do the best job he can in his specific role, and tonight he did a really good job of that as he usually does.   
  
  Q.  Pop, what did you guys do in the fourth quarter to try to take the ball out of Deron's hands?   
 GREGG POPOVICH:  Well, we did a couple of different things tonight.  Just to try to give him a different look.  The young man is just incredible, and he was slicing and dicing us.  We just gave him a couple of different looks, and I don't think it totally stopped him at all.   
 But it helped us a little bit maybe.
