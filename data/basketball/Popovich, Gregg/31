 Q.   Pop, for those of us that are not in this building more than at Finals time, does it feel normal air‑wise to you, temperature‑wise to you tonight?   
    COACH GREGG POPOVICH:   I guess so.   I don't really notice, to tell you the truth.   I just come and coach.   
    THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.   
    COACH GREGG POPOVICH:   It's been great.   Thank you for being so kind ( laughter).   I appreciate it.
