<p>	Q. What are the different ways you've seen teams try to guard Manu, and has there been an approach that's had success? </p>
<p>	Q.  Give us an idea. </p>
<p>	Q.  When you look back on those years coaching in Division III out in California, what kind of a foundation was that for what you're doing now, and also what types of things do you remember doing? </p>
<p>	Q.  What do you remember about that game at Kansas when you were a coach of a Division III team? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kind of lost in the shuffle Thursday with all of your great performances and with the Wallaces not doing very much, Rip Hamilton getting shut down, the question is, Chauncey Billups, he's kind of lost in the shuffle and it seems this time of year he always steps up and gives his best. </p>
<p>	Q.  How big of a concern is he for tomorrow?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you find some examples and ways in which Tim provides leadership to this team?  And the second part of the question; did you know from the very first time you went down to visit with him in St. Croix that you had somebody special?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just talk about Glenn Robinson, how he's managed to deal with everything he's had to go through this year in Philadelphia, especially now with his mom passing and to come back here and doing what he's doing?</p>
<p>	Q.  How about the fact just that your players have done a really good job to lift his spirits and keep his mind off of what's happening? </p>
<p>	Q.  Would you talk a little bit about Bruce Bowen's defense and how important that defensive effort is important to you? </p>
