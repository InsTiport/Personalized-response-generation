Q.   If I'm not mistaken, you're one of the coaches that likes to have offense on your end in the second half.   Why is that?
GREGG POPOVICH:   I just like it. 

Q.   Does it do anything different than‑‑ I mean, what difference does it make for you that offense is on that end as opposed to defense? 
GREGG POPOVICH:   It's the way I like it. 

Q.   Your reaction to the Thunder lineup changes? 
GREGG POPOVICH:   I don't know what they are. 

Q.   Ibaka and Jackson, in. 
GREGG POPOVICH:   We'll start the same guys we've been starting. 

Q.   The three days between games, does it reduce the rhythm you guys are in?   Are you concerned at all about that?
GREGG POPOVICH:   I have no idea. 

Q.   It's unusual, right? 
GREGG POPOVICH:   It is unusual. 

Q.   Has it been beneficial for you guys do you think?
GREGG POPOVICH:   I don't know.   I don't know how you gauge something like that.   You just go play the game.   If we win, people will say it was beneficial.   If we lose, it wasn't.   But the other team had three days, too, so I think it's just meaningless.   It is what it is. 

Q.   With them starting two point guards, would you expect to have Danny Green on Reggie Jackson or Green or Westbrook?
GREGG POPOVICH:   I don't know.   I don't know.   I haven't thought about it. 

Q.   When a player like Ibaka has been out and comes back at some point in the Playoffs, do you believe a team gets a bounce from that, just from their presence? 
GREGG POPOVICH:   Sure.   He's a heck of a player. 

Q.   When you've got three or four days in Oklahoma City, where do you like to eat? 
GREGG POPOVICH:   You're trying to get me in trouble, aren't you? 

Q.   No, you are not really wanting to talk about the game and I don't blame you, so let's talk about something that's interesting. 
GREGG POPOVICH:   Okay, wine and food is great.   I'll stay here a long time if you want to talk about that.

Q.   Any suggestions?
GREGG POPOVICH:   No, I don't want to make anybody angry.   You go one place and somebody else might get angry at you.   I've got a couple people already called, why didn't we come here, instead we went over here.   You can't go everywhere at once.   But there's plenty of good places to eat.   Not a problem. 

Q.   To this point after two games in the Conference Finals, how is your team's kind of mental intensity, their engagement?   Are they where you expect them to be?
GREGG POPOVICH:   How do I know?   I don't know.   You actually think I go talk to each player and ask them what's your mental state is today?   How fired up are you?   Are you ready to play?   No, we don't do that.   I don't read anything.   I don't read anything into any of that kind of stuff.   All that matters is when the game starts you see what's going on and you try to fix it if it's bad, and if it's good, you roll with it. 

Q.   Were there any ghosts in your hotel, and if so, who says boo first? 
GREGG POPOVICH:   People keep telling me that, but I haven't run into any.   Some people really believe it.
