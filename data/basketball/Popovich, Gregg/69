Q.   Coach, Jason Kidd's name has now reportedly been brought up for a headâ€‘coaching job with the Nets.   I was wondering from what you know about him, what kind of head coach would he make?   And how difficult is it to become a head coach when you have no experience? 
COACH GREGG POPOVICH:   Well, you know, I think of course it's an individual thing, but when you've played in the league as long as Jason has and played for a number of coaches, he's pretty much seen everything that the NBA can offer.   So he does have experience. 
If he's crazy enough to want to be a head coach in the league, I wish him all the best.   But he certainly has the intuitive skills to know what's going on out there.   Obviously, he would be able to have relationships with the players that he's had with his coaches throughout. 
So if that's what he wants to do, and that's who they want to hire, I think that he's got an opportunity and a possibility to be really, really good at it. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
