Q.   In the fourth quarter they went small.   Rather than counter big you stayed small.   I wonder what you liked about the lineup that you were using. 
GREGG POPOVICH:   I couldn't really tell you to be honest.   It's always a feel during the game whether to stay big or go small.   It could depend on fouls or who you think is playing well, who's tired, what the match‑ups are, a lot of that sort of thing, so it's usually different every game, but I couldn't tell you any sort of rhyme or reason to it. 

Q.   You really curtailed their transition game.   I think they only had four steals, the Thunder did.   Was part of that taking care of the ball and not letting them get out on run‑outs?
GREGG POPOVICH:   Well, we didn't turn it over; you're correct in that regard.   But as far as transition D goes in general, I thought we were very poor.   If you would have watched the film with me, you would have seen that.   I thought that that was one of the best things they did, and it was basically Russell who ran it right down our throats, and our transition in that regard was awful. 

Q.   Are you pleased with what you did against Reggie Jackson in the first game? 
GREGG POPOVICH:   Oh, I don't know.   Coaches are never pleased.   You just play.   He's had a good game against us all the time.   He had a good game last night. 

Q.   Does Boris seem okay with the eye?
GREGG POPOVICH:   He's fine.
