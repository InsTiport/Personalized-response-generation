Q.   Coach, was it Serge and a lot more from their defense that you saw tonight against your guys? 
GREGG POPOVICH:   I mean, Serge played well.   I thought that our defense was pretty poor.   I thought our first half was probably the poorest defense we've played in a very long time.   We weren't there for the roller on pick‑and‑roll, fouled shooters, pickup points were bad, so on and so forth.   It was a bad half.   It was a miracle it was a one‑point game with 40 seconds to go in the first half from my perspective.   The only thing that kept us in the game was Manu made those threes. 

Q.   Can you just talk about the impact Serge had, especially defensively in the paint? 
GREGG POPOVICH:   Serge is always great in the paint.   He blocks shots.   He changes shots.   He did a fine job. 

Q.   What do you think was difficult for Tony tonight compared to the first two games?
GREGG POPOVICH:   I don't know. 

Q.   Jackson has struggled defensively at times this year.   He seemed to be okay today, and if he can play solid defense they're very tough to deal with because he's such a good offensive player.   Did you not take advantage of him being on the court with your offense? 
GREGG POPOVICH:   No, we don't run an offense to take advantage of Reggie or a single individual.   That's just not the way we're built.   We're not an isolation team, we're not a one‑on‑one team.   We can't play that way.   We win or lose them as a group, and I thought tonight that along with the defense being poor, I thought they were much more‑‑ I was very disappointed that we didn't come out with more of a foot in the neck sort of an attitude.   They killed us on the board, they beat us on 50/50 balls, and that's very disappointing to me.   That's not the way you approach a game. 

Q.   Manu went to the locker room late in the fourth quarter.   Is he good or physically okay?
GREGG POPOVICH:   He'll be fine, or he's out for the rest of the Playoffs.   (Laughter.)   You've still got to have some fun even if you lose.   Come on, it's basketball.   Yeah, we wanted to win, but I want to laugh, too.   Make sure Sammy gets that.
