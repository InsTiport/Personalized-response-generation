Q.   I think the presumption is typically that the team that loses the game makes the adjustments.   Have you seen things that you could improve on from Game 1 to Game 2?
GREGG POPOVICH:   Well, I'll give you the same trite answer.   Basketball is a game of mistakes.   There are always things that a team can improve on.   It doesn't matter if you win or lose.   Coaches are going to go back and try to do things a little bit better, whether it's defensive execution or offensive execution, that type of thing, so we can always get better.   That's just the nature of the beast. 

Q.   How much did playing the Lakers help you guys prepare? 
GREGG POPOVICH:   Well, I don't compare teams, I just try to strategize for the team that we're playing because players are different, systems are different, so I don't take much from that.
