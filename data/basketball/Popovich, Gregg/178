<p>	Q.  Talk a little bit about Brent Barry's performance. </p>
<p>	Q.  75 points scored in the fourth quarter of a Conference Finals game.  Do you remember the last time you participated in something like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Following up, you talked a little bit before the game about small ball.  You had the best defensive points against, at least during regular season.  Do you feel like you could sustain that or want to sustain that throughout an entire series to beat this team at their game kind of thing?</p>
<p>	Q.  You did not give Tim Duncan his usual break at like 6 minutes.  Was that because of the ankle, wanting to give him a longer run?</p>
<p>	Q.  How were you guys able to keep Shawn Marion from being an offensive factor? </p>
<p>	Q.  Even though Steve Nash did have 30 points or something, I mean, was there some point where you were trying to trap him on the floor or trap him late?</p>
