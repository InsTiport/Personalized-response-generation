GREGG POPOVICH:  Great All-Star Weekend comes to a close.  Good game.  Hope the fans had a good time watching all the players.  Now time for everybody to go back to work and do the real important stuff. 

Q.  Coach, it seems like there was a lot of deliberate play out there for a change.  Y'all tried to play defense that was unselfish ball, which is not that typical for an All-Star Game. 

GREGG POPOVICH:  Well, I think, you know, there are a great deal of young players in the league who really show that they know how to play the game and they are interested in playing the right way and moving the ball, being unselfish, you know, competing and playing defense.  You know, it's an All-Star Game, so you're going to get a lot of the show-boat stuff, which is normal and the fans came to see that, but in general, we've got a great crop of young kids to go along with some medium-aged guys, the Duncans and Garnetts of the world and some of the older guys, and Grant Hill and Shaq, like he calls himself the elder statesman.  I think it's a great group of NBA players right now. 

Q.  Could you talk about Allen Iverson, you coached him this summer with the Olympics and his performance tonight? 

GREGG POPOVICH:  I thought he with D did a great job of getting everybody involved tonight.  It was like his main purpose in life for the game tonight.  I don't think he scored much.  I haven't seen the stats, but he was really good at getting everybody involved, finding the open man.  He played defense and I thought he did a great job.  It's good for him to get the MVP.
