<p>	Q.  Did you sense Manu getting frustrated in the first half and is that why we saw the second half that we did?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the layoff and what that did to start out the game?  It looked like you started out a little slow. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the two- and three-minute stints that Glenn had in the third quarter. </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm just curious, you've seen Manu and his growth the past three years, how big does his play in a game like this help take the pressure off Tim Duncan and make you an even tougher team to beat in this kind of series?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you get the sense that Manu Ginobli seemed to get energized from a block charge call on Ben Wallace?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talk about the defense being better, was it tactical or was it effort that got the defense playing better in the second half?</p>
<p>	Q.  You took two early time-outs in the first quarter, just wondering what you said to the team while you were trying to slow it down a little bit. </p>
<p>	Q.  Is it a bit of chicken and egg, you said Tim appreciates when Manu or Tony goes off, but doesn't he set all that up for them as well?</p>
<p>	Q.  You outrebounded a pretty good rebounding team tonight, were you expecting to do that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about Nazr Mohammed.  He was a journeyman for a while, talk about what he's meant to the team and now seems to be hitting on his spot. </p>
