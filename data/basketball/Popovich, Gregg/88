  WARRIORS - 97

THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach Popovich. 

Q.   What happened in the overtime?   Couldn't get a shot to fall. 
COACH POPOVICH:   You just said it.   They made some shots.   You make shots, you win. 

Q.   Did you feel like Manu got tired towards the end there?
COACH POPOVICH:   I don't know.   I didn't ask him that.   Maybe he did.   I don't know. 
Doesn't matter, though.   He's going to play.   I'm sure everybody was a little bit tired. 

Q.   Talk about the aggressive factor as far as you were leading, then you let it up.   Talk about what you did or didn't do to maintain that momentum going forward. 
COACH POPOVICH:   I'll try to answer that. 
We just kept playing the game.   We got into overtime.   We didn't make shots.   They executed and made some shots. 
We didn't lose any aggressiveness.   Just kept playing.   They did a good job in overtime.   Just as simple as that. 

Q.   Does this feel like a missed opportunity when you're up by 8 with 4:30 left?
COACH POPOVICH:   Of course.   Everyone would want to finish out a game when you have a lead going down the stretch.   You don't want to lose a lead.   That goes without saying. 

Q.   Do you feel in the fourth you settled for too many jumpers, didn't post up, take it inside when you were having some success?
COACH POPOVICH:   I'll have to look at the film.   I thought we did a little bit of the both.   Timmy got the ball out on the post. 
But you take what's given.   You do the best you can to read the defense, see what's available.   You react accordingly.   It might be a lot of shots for one person because of what somebody's doing defensively or it could get spread around. 
I think we got caught up in a few too many threes.   27 is too many for us. 

Q.   Do you have any sense at all of what's going on with the free throws in this series, especially today, 56%?   Something in their heads? 
COACH POPOVICH:   We didn't make our free throws.   I don't think that I'll be able to watch the film and come up with an answer for you why we missed the free throws. 
We missed 'em.   It's uncharacteristic.   We've been shooting at about an 80% clip all year.   The last few games we've shot them very poorly.   I don't know why.   I don't have the answer to that. 

Q.   Both teams tonight only had four fast‑break points.   What do you think explains that change from the rest of the series?
COACH POPOVICH:   I have no idea.   Just the way the game went.   Every game is different.   You can look at any game, something will be odd.   You can look at rebounds, turnovers, it's the way the game got played that night.   There's no formula for that sort of thing. 
The next game, maybe both team also have 20 fast‑break points.   You'll ask why and I'll say, I have no clue why. 

Q.   You played and coached a lot of basketball over the course of your career.   This is an unusual Warriors team.   Do they remind you of anybody you've gone up against or are they unique?   How do you game plan for this team? 
COACH POPOVICH:   Well, I don't compare them to anybody else.   I don't care about any other team.   I only care about who I'm playing.   You game plan for them first by doing what you do.   At this point in the season, we all are what we are.   That's what you need to do, is execute the way you play, do those things. 
Obviously you give attention to people like Curry and Thompson.   But you'd have to do the whole deal.   Tonight, Barnes and Jack were tremendous.   They got the job done for 'em. 
So when other people step up, that's always a great thing in these games.   Usually the playoffs, teams that win, have other people step up at some point in a series.   Those two guys did it tonight in really fine fashion. 
Thank you.
