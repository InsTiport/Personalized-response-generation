<p>	Q.  How are you tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  You are saying I believe after the first game that this team is like a chameleon, we don't want to impose our will, we'll just do whatever it is we need to do.  That seems to run counter to what a lot of elite teams say.  Could you talk about that, why it's your philosophy.</p>
<p>	Q.  Your philosophies are well stated over the years and everyone knows the kind of team that you have had and want to have.  How do you think of yourself when you leave the arena with your team average in the 115 points or something in the Conference Finals and your guards putting behind the back down the stretch, those kinds of things?</p>

<p>	Q.  I heard you have been talking about how you are in the West, you are called upon more often now to match up small and big.  Do you think this is something that's kind of going to catch on, other teams are going to start doing it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Seems like you have got a fairly open -- less formal structure?</p>
<p>	Q.  Not that that hasn't worked, it has.  You are leading in the series but do you ever find yourself saying, well, I have got Tim Duncan, I am just going to pound that in there see if they can deal with it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Assuming Joe Johnson is not affected by mask or layoff, what do you expect from him in this game?</p>
