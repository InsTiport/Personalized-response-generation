<p>	Q.  When a team is up 3-0 as you are now, does it ever enter your mind about oh-oh, what if we collapse here, what if we have one of the all time -- what does a coach think of and what do you do to try to keep your players from thinking those things?</p>
<p>	Q.  No, not really.  We're killing him (laughter). </p>
<p>	Q.  As soon as you do. </p>
<p>	Q.  One-third or one-fourth of the way through every season you will go -- you will go off on your team and talking about how they are not working hard enough.  Are you doing that for effect?  Do you need to get their attention every once in a while?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you tell us how far Tony Parker has come since the day you guys drafted him?  How much of a luxury is it to have Tim Duncan?</p>
<p>	Q.  There was a lot of talk before this post-season about whether the Suns' style could work in the playoffs.  Your thoughts on a team that plays that style, whether it can win a championship?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk again a little bit -- go through again why you felt it was important to acquire Nazr (Mohammed) and how he's performed for you in the playoffs?</p>
<p>	Q.  As a coach what do you appreciate most about Tim (Duncan)?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you plan on working Glenn (Robinson) back into the mix?  Will you just play him -- you play him you guys get in foul trouble that sort of situation?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you went out and signed Robert Horry how much of that was because he played perimeter defense because some of the big guys in the league can go outside and shoot threes?</p>
