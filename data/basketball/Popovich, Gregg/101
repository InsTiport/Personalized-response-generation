 Q.   You guys are struggling and not struggling.   I'm curious, DeJuan Blair starts 62 games out of 66 and now can't get off the bench.   Can you talk about why?   
COACH POPOVICH:   No. He's working hard to be ready if called upon, and that's a great thing.   He's got great character, and he's ready to go if I call upon him.  
   
 Q.   Brooks was saying their small lineup the other night got some things done in the fourth quarter.   But their defense still was not very effective.   How did you feel like your offense performed really in both games, the way the Thunder went small, particularly with Ibaka as the big man?  
COACH POPOVICH:   Well, I don't want to speak for Scotty, but I'm going to guess that he was probably as happy with their defense as we were with our defense.   I don't think either team did much of a clinic on defense in Game 2.  
So I would expect tonight that both teams would concentrate a lot harder in that area.
