Warriors - 120, Spurs - 108   
 Q.  Pop, any word on David Lee's injury?  
COACH POPOVICH: I have no idea.   
 Q.  Pop, you get the competitiveness you were looking for tonight?  
COACH POPOVICH: Yeah, I thought they did a great job.  They competed really well.  Couldn't ask any more from them competitiveness-wise.  We turned it over.  Kevin Durant had his way for a period there in transition.  It just really spread the game open, he did a great job.   
But the competitiveness was great.  Every time you look up you're playing against four All-Stars, so you better be pretty perfect, and competitiveness-wise I couldn't ask for anything more.  We turned it over too much, and we've got to make some more shots.  But it's a hell of a team.   
 Q.  Coach, you said before LaMarcus hadn't scored.  Considering the way they defended him and the way he played, did you get what you wanted out of him tonight?  
COACH POPOVICH: Sure.
