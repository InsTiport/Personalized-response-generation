Q.   Can you just talk about what you saw from Kevin Durant those last six minutes you seemed to have him on the ropes and he seemed to take over the game?
COACH POPOVICH:   It didn't seem like that, that was a fact.   I was there.   I saw it.   He was great.   We tried to do a couple of different things, but his play was better than anything we did defensively, that's for sure.   He finished it off in fine fashion.

Q.   Coach, turnovers the major difference between tonight and Game 3.   Can you just talk a little bit about that? 
COACH POPOVICH:   Well, we did a much better job.   We didn't have that problem that we had in Game 3.   But we've got to play 48.   We've only played three quarters in both these games here.   We haven't played the second quarter.   First, third and fourth quarter, we've competed and played. 
But for whatever reason, the second quarters have been really bad for us, and we've had to recover from that both nights.

Q.   Can you talk about the importance of Game 5?   Manu was just in here talking about how often series turn on Game 5?
COACH POPOVICH:   Every game in the series is important.

Q.   You said the other day at practice that Serge Ibaka had a big impact defensively.   Can you talk about what affect he had on you guys tonight? 
COACH POPOVICH:   Well, 11 for 11 is what I think it was.   That's a pretty big effect.   All the bigs really scored tonight.   Obviously, you put most of your attention on the big three there and try to do a great job on them first, just naturally. 
But the bigs came through tonight and were outstanding.   I didn't look at the whole deal, but I think they were 22 for 25 or some crazy thing.   If you did a shooting drill with nobody guarding you, I don't think you could do that.
