<p>	Q. It's been like three days since the last game and we've had press people go home and league people go home.  I'm just wondering how was it for you guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  Very serious question:  Brett Brown was seen this morning with a photo of you in short shorts.  Just wondering if that surfaced at all. </p>
<p>	Q.  You saw Andrew Bogut at the Olympics this summer, what did you think of him and what type of pro do you think he's going to be?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've been fortunate enough to win a couple of titles in the last couple years, but no one else aside from the Lakers has repeated and Detroit is trying to do that now obviously.  How difficult is it to repeat, given all the factors in this day and age?  What is the challenge of repeating? </p>
<p>	Q.  Just your reaction, P.J. (Carlesimo) getting passed over in Minnesota?</p>
<p>	Q.  In the last couple of days, how much of what you talked with the players was about mental stuff and effort and playing with heart, as related to the X's and O's and changes in basketball?</p>
<p>	Q.  Larry was in here, by the way, and said he enjoyed watching Batman, and is going to movies you like and seems to be having fun.  But two-and-a-half days is an interminable period, as you talked about, and Tim Duncan has been analyzed and overanalyzed and scrutinized.  How is he dealing with all this over these last couple of days, and what do you expect from him at this point?</p>
<p>	Q.  That's encouraging for us. </p>
<p>	Q.  It's been brought up, it's been one of the low points in Spurs' history, certainly in yours, too, has been that 2001 series with the Lakers, where the Spurs sort of collapsed there.  How is this team different from that and what happened then?</p>
<p>	Q.  You're his closest friend and you probably have agonized with him a little bit over his decision about whether he's going to keep coaching, but what does a guy like Larry Brown mean to this game, realizing he may coach only two or three more games? </p>
