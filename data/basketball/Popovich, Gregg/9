 Q.  Is it more difficult planning for Game 3 not knowing the status on Kawhi?  
COACH POPOVICH: No, either he's going to play or he's not.  Everything else, you just work on what you want to work on.   
 Q.  Has he been able to do anything on the court in the last couple days?  
COACH POPOVICH: He has shot.   
 Q.  Are you confident that your guys are going to come out with the requisite belief in Game 3?  
COACH POPOVICH: I believe that.   
 Q.  What are some of the things that the team can do collectively to kind of help LaMarcus and Pau get going offensively?  
COACH POPOVICH: We can all do our jobs.   
 Q.  How much do you take the long view on Kawhi?  
COACH POPOVICH: Yeah, that's always a factor, somebody's health and longevity.   
 Q.  Jonathon Simmons said it starts on the defensive end.  Is it just a matter of playing hard defensively, and that's going to kind of ignite your offense?  
COACH POPOVICH: We've been that way for 20 years.  Defense comes first, especially against a team as good as Golden State.  Certainly you have to keep scoring because you're not going to stop them totally.  But you've got to do something defensively to slow them down.
