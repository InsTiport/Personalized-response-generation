 Q.   Pop, same starters tonight?   
COACH GREGG POPOVICH:   Maybe.   
   
 Q.   Whatever Parker did at halftime of Game 4, will he do the same thing?   Will you do something else to try to keep him loose or whatever?   
COACH GREGG POPOVICH:   His leg is fine, so whatever he does at halftime he does.   I really don't even know what that is.   Keep it warm.   Don't get stiff.   He's fine.   
   
 Q.   Erik Spoelstra kind of said he would have liked to have played yesterday.   Two days is kind of hard to wait.   Is that the same feeling you guys have?   Or maybe this is beneficial for you?   
COACH GREGG POPOVICH:   I agree with Erik.   This time of year waiting is like death.   You want to go play.   You've been doing this a long time, and it just seems interminable.   It's forever.   The quicker you play, I think the players would love it, coaches would love it.   
Speaking selfishly for myself now, the two days were great because we're a little bit older.   We need a little bit more time.
