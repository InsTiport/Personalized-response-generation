<p>	Q. I wish I could start out with a funny question for you, but on a serious note, you got a firsthand taste of that resiliency of the Pistons, can you talk about the way they bounce back every series in the postseason, what that means. </p>


<p>	Q.  What can you do to create more scoring opportunities in the paint, not only for Tim, but what can you do to open things up for your guards who had an easier time driving the lane in the first couple of games?</p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of people have talked about the importance of Game 5, in this 2-3-2 format, has it almost become a home-court disadvantage?</p>
<p>	Q.  I understand that today was more of a Serbian-type of film session.  I'm wondering what you were trying to get across to guys. </p>
<p>	Q.  Yeah. </p>
<p>	Q.  You have to get Gordon Liddy to fix it. </p>
<p>	Q.  So what were you trying to get across today? </p>






<p>	Q.  Just to follow-up to the film session, one player described you as almost giddy, because you're ready to get back out on the floor and see what kind of character, see how they respond, is that an accurate description, "giddy"?</p>
<p>	Q.  I have no idea.  One of your players used that word and it went over my head and that's why I'm asking you. </p>
<p>	Q.  Okay. </p>
<p>	Q.  That's why I come to you, Pop. </p>
