<p>	Q. Can you just talk a little about you and Pop know each other so well and know what you do in certain situations and how you react.  Do you think either one of you has to resist the temptation to do something out of character to kind of catch the other off-balance, or does that even enter into your thinking? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about your philosophy on playing big men defensively.  There was a lot of talk last Finals about not doubling Shaq and him being able to work the perimeter better.  What's your philosophy on Tim Duncan? </p>
<p>	Q.  Without asking for any secrets, who is going to defend Manu and how do you see the challenge, how do you play defense against Manu? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can there be much spectator appeal to perhaps the first Finals featuring the two top defensive teams in the league? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the Chauncey Billups and Tony Parker matchup, two guys who have already led their teams to titles but you don't hear a whole lot about them as the top-tier point guards in the NBA. </p>
<p>	Q.  Sports fans across the spectrum say they are tired of greedy, selfish athletes and it seems like both of these teams are the antithesis of that.  Do you have any hypothesis as to why this might not resonate with the casual sports fan?  Is it the style or is it something else? </p>
<p>	Q.  Along those lines, San Antonio is going for it's third championship in six years and you're going for your second in two, do you think that continued success of these two franchises specifically can kind of be a dam against all of those problems you mentioned earlier? </p>
<p>	Q.  We watch these games in The Finals, the Conference Finals a couple years ago, Robert Horry takes shots every so often and he's hit and he's usually five or six feet open on some of these.  How do you deal with Horry, why do you think he's been so open on these occasions and how do you deal with that?</p>
