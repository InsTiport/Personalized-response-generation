COACH GREGG POPOVICH:   First, I'd like to congratulate the Miami Heat for being in the Finals.   You know, it's been a habit for those guys, and they deserve a lot of credit from ownership all the way through the organization.   We're very‑‑ it's somewhat still disbelief, but because they're such a great team, it really makes it worth it to us.   It's just great satisfaction to be able to come out on top against such a great organization and a great team.   
But they're a class act and they'll be back next year for sure.   I don't think anybody would really doubt that.   So congratulations to those guys for all their efforts.   
From our point of view, it's satisfying because of the work that we put in all year to get back to the Finals, and have this opportunity again, and it worked out.   So, we feel very gratified by that and humbled to have had the opportunity.  
That's all I've got to say.  
   
 Q.   First of all, congratulations on the championship, Coach.   
COACH GREGG POPOVICH:   Thank you.  
   
 Q.   I wanted to ask you, when you left here, it was 1‑1 in the series, but Kawhi Leonard gave you three consecutive games over 20 points.   Can you tell us and walk us through what you said to him to turn it around, Coach?   
COACH GREGG POPOVICH:   Well, you know, a lot of that is family business, but we have conversations throughout the year.   They're mostly one way, because Kawhi's a really quiet young man.   But he listens and he's a great learner and super competitive, has a drive to be the best that's really uncommon in our league.   He walks the walk.   I mean, he is there early; he's there late.   He wants more.   He wants me and the coaches to push him.   
So I just talked to him about not being in that deferment or that defer sort of stage.   The hell with Tony, the hell with Timmy, the hell with Manu, you play the game.   You are the man.   You're part of the engine that makes us go.   
And it starts with his defense and his rebounding, and he's starting to feel his oats offensively, obviously, because I have not called a play for him the whole playoff.   I do not call his number.   Everything he did was just out of the motion and out of offense, and he's learned it well.   
In the future, obviously, we'll use him a lot more on an individual basis.   But it's not really our style, and he appreciates that.  
   
 Q.   Speaking of the number, No. 8, Patty Mills, have you ever coached a player that has so much excitement on the bench, and then when you call his number he does what he does?   
COACH GREGG POPOVICH:   He's a special guy.   His energy has been important to us all year long.   He's a real significant reason why we got to the Finals, and obviously he's played well in the Finals also.   But that energy, that team sense that he has really has become infectious for everybody.  
   
 Q.   Obviously you played a great team game with so many contributions.   Do you feel for a player like LeBron James?   17 points in the first quarter, 31, 10, 5, does everything he can, plays point guard, and at times he was sort of out there alone maybe because of Dwyane's knees.   Do you sort of feel for what he went through and how hard he had to push in this series?   
COACH GREGG POPOVICH:   I'm not here to judge the Miami Heat or any of their players.   I'm just thankful that we were able to win.  
   
 Q.   Well, just can you talk to what LeBron did against you guys and how much of a challenge it was to go against what he provided for the Heat?   
COACH GREGG POPOVICH:   LeBron James is a great player.   He's a great competitor.   He's a class act.   And I know he's feeling what we felt last year, and I don't wish that on anybody.   It's tough.   Most people never even have that feeling.   Either the feeling of elation or the depression that goes with a loss.   
But he hangs it out there, and he's still the best player on the planet.  
   
 Q.   Their facing elimination, how much did you anticipate the way they started the game against you tonight, and given the lead they got out to, what was the key to your guys sort of regrouping and pulling back into it?   
COACH GREGG POPOVICH:   Well, in all honesty, I think in the beginning of the game it was more what we did not do than anything.   I told my team at that first timeout we looked exactly like we looked two years ago when we won the first two against OKC and then they won four in a row because we stopped moving the ball.   We got on the dribble, the ball didn't move, it didn't change sides, and that's what we looked like the first six or seven minutes of the game.   
So they got back on track with that and started moving the ball like we're used to doing and got themselves back in the game offensively, and they picked it up defensively.   I think Miami got 11 or 12 points in the second quarter, so the defense picked up, and the offense started to be who it's supposed to be, and it got us back in the game.   
Why that happened is because the guys have character.   They play the game the way we ask them to play it.   They don't get too excited if they're doing well, and they don't get too down if things are going badly.   They just try to execute.  
   
 Q.   Can you pick out one aspect of this particular team, this particular season and the whole journey that you think will stay with you for a long time?   Any part of it that stands out?   
COACH GREGG POPOVICH:   My, I just think I just take it as a whole.   Last year's loss was devastating.   I've said many times, a day didn't go by where I didn't think about Game 6.   So I think just in general, for the group to have the fortitude that they showed to get back to this spot, I think speaks volumes about how they're constituted and what kind of fiber they have.
