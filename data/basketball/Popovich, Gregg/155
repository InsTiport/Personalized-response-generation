<p>	Q. Almost to a man this week, your players have said, win, lose or draw, you can light a fire under your players or pat them on the back.  What is it about your relationship with your players that allows them to like buy into your coaching philosophy and management style? </p>
<p>	Q.  Are you surprised at how they all seem to buy into it relatively quickly?</p>
<p>	Q.  Most teams that have won championships over the last 25 years or so have no-brainer lock Hall of Famers; the Pistons don't necessarily.  Your thoughts on just how they are a unique team in that respect and they don't have a lot of All-Stars, and yet they are in this position?</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys give up 102, only forced four turnovers, is your defense broke or does it just need some tinkering? </p>
<p>	Q.  What's your assessment of how the benches have played the last couple of games and are you planning any changes in the rotation for Game 5?</p>
<p>	Q.  Knowing Coach Brown like you do, is Chauncey Billups the kind of point guard that you would expect Coach Brown to build around, the way he plays and whatnot?</p>
<p>	Q.  And how much of those four turnovers can be attributed, the only four turnovers that you guys forced yesterday, how much of that can be attributed to the way he ran the show?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the second-chance points.  Are a lot of those off transition where you turn the ball over, they run and so you miss a shot and people are out of position?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does Tim have to impose his will on this series more forcefully? </p>
<p>	Q.  You say that and you've also said that, you know, Tim is most critical of himself.  Knowing that, what do you expect from him after Games 3 and 4 going into Game 5? </p>
<p>	Q.  What can the team do around him to kind of create some openings for him to have to room to work?</p>
<p>	Q.  It's easy to say that the series is simply 2-2, but all of the games have been blowouts, how does a coach cope with that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there somebody specifically within the group that needs to take that by the horns? </p>
<p>	Q.  Most of the guys that come into the NBA feel that first and foremost they have to have a shot, so they offensively advance.  Is this a fault of coaching and is coaching a guy to be a good defender easier or harder than coaching him to be a good scorer? </p>
<p>	Q.  Larry mentioned in his press conference that he felt kind of bad in beating you and the Spurs by such a lopsided margin.  Obviously you guys want to win every game --</p>
<p>	Q.  So you don't care?  You want to beat Larry by 30?</p>
