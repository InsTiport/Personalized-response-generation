   GREGG POPOVICH:  We played well for a quarter.  I thought we matched their energy and physicality for a quarter, and at that point they upped the stakes in that area and we folded, both mentally and physically.  And the consequence was getting our butts kicked in a lot of different ways.   
 So that was the bottom line.   
  
  Q.  Coach, can you give an overview on Tim's night?   
 GREGG POPOVICH:  He didn't have a great night.   
  
  Q.  Can you get a little deeper?   
 GREGG POPOVICH:  Not really.  He didn't have a great night.   
  
  Q.  Do you credit their defense?   
 GREGG POPOVICH:  They did a great job.   
  
  Q.  Talk a little bit, Pop, about the psychology of the series now, where it goes from here.   
 GREGG POPOVICH:  Well, I have never really been real big on that.  That's what you guys do.  You will decide the momentum has changed now and that sort of thing.   
 I don't think I have to tell you, you probably already wrote it.   
  
  Q.  So you don't think the momentum has changed?   
 GREGG POPOVICH:  I don't know.  I'm not concerned about momentum.  I'm concerned about playing better.   
  
  Q.  Does the size of the deficit tonight scare you or concern you at all for the next game, or are you confident that you will be able to have another close game at the Delta Center where the Jazz are 7-0 in the playoffs?   
 GREGG POPOVICH:  The score of the game is not really all that important.  How we play is what matters, and we didn't play very well.  They played better than we did in a lot of areas.   
  
  Q.  Did you see a significant difference in the way they came at Tim from the get-go in terms of their aggression on him and swiping at the ball a lot and taking him out?   
 GREGG POPOVICH:  No.   
  
  Q.  Same as what they did in the first two games?   
 GREGG POPOVICH:  Yeah.   
  
  Q.  They just were better at it?   
 GREGG POPOVICH:  Seemingly so.
