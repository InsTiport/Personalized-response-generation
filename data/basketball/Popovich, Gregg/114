		   COACH POPOVICH: Tough loss. I thought we fought back all night long. We did a good job of being persistent and not giving in at all. So I'm real proud of them for that. 
 We just didn't quite get it done, so now we have a lot of work ahead of us. 

 Q. How did you see the last play, Derek Fisher, Brent Barry?
 COACH POPOVICH: In what respect? I watched it. (Laughter).
 I was there. What do you --

 Q. Do you think it was a foul or not? 
 COACH POPOVICH: No, it wasn't a foul. 

 Q. Do you think it was properly a noncall?
 COACH POPOVICH: Yes, I think it was a proper no-call from what I just saw.

 Q. Can you talk about the contribution you got from Brent tonight?
 COACH POPOVICH: We wouldn't have had a chance to win if it wasn't for Brent tonight. He was great. Not just because he made some shots, but he played a good floor game, he played good D. He was fantastic. 

 Q. Was it a proper noncall because that was the decision that was made so you were living with it?
 COACH POPOVICH: Is that a trick question? 

 Q. No. 
 COACH POPOVICH: What else do you want me to say? If I was the official, I wouldn't have called that a foul. Is that okay? Okay. 

 Q. Tony said the play was supposed to go to Manu and obviously Brent got the ball. What was that last play? 
 COACH POPOVICH: It could go to a couple different people, but Brent got the ball. In any play you draw up, there is more than one option. And Brent was one of the options and that's where the ball went. 

 Q. The rebounding job L.A. did there, is that kind of what kept them in front and kept you from getting there?
 COACH POPOVICH: Well, we did a better job in that respect in the second half. But still and even down the stretch they got one for sure, maybe they got another one, I don't remember. 
 But I think on Derek's jump shot, that was off an offensive rebound. They got the ball back and he made that shot, so it was a problem for us all night long, especially in the first half and then down the stretch it bit us again.
