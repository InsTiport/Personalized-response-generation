<p>	Q. The last play, what did you draw up and what happened after it went?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just talk about Robert Horry, fourth quarter, overtime, just stepping up his game. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you explain his penchant for this stuff and late-game shots?</p>
<p>	Q.  Robert was coming off his worst playoffs before you signed him, what made you decide to sign him? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about the other things he did besides the threes, what about the one dunk, what were you thinking as he took off on that, put it down and then comes up holding his arm?</p>
<p>	Q.  During the time-out with nine seconds left, did you anticipate that the Pistons might try to trap you guys, and have Horry in that position because of that?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've got a chance, one game away from yet another title, can you just talk about how you feel personally about this great run you have?  I mean, there's not many NBA coaches that have won three or more NBA titles, and you're closing in on that. </p>
<p>	Q.  I mean, you don't want to any of the credit, that's a pretty incredible feat. </p>
<p>	Q.  There were a lot of moments where you could have had frustration, Tim with the free throw problems and the crowd and everything, what was the tenor of the team during all of that and the spirit of what was going on in the last few minutes?</p>
