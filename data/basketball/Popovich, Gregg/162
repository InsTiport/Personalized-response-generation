<p>	Q. Talk about the hustle points and the hustle plays from Robert Horry, and 15 points from Bruce Bowen. </p>
<p>	Q.  And about Bruce's contribution tonight. </p>
<p>	Q.  Has this been a little bit easier so far than you expected? </p>
<p>	Q.  Brent Barry told us the other day that you preach that it's more important how your team responds after a victory than how the opponent responds after a loss, was this a case of that tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  Tony Parker got his fifth foul with 7:26 left in the fourth, and you had to go with Beno, how vital was it for Beno to control the pace of the game and run things at that point in the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  I think I counted 11 threes made in the game.  Was that a part of the game plan to jump out and go long distance on these guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  You guys had a lot of layups in the first half, are you surprised to get that many against Larry Brown's defense?</p>
<p>	Q.  Lots. </p>
<p>	Q.  You went to the zone defense there briefly, the thought behind that and how it worked? </p>
<p>	Q.  It looked like some confusion when you called a time-out. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just talk about the versatility you've shown in the last four or five years of the playoffs now you come here and play halfcourt and defense, the way you can do both styles?</p>
