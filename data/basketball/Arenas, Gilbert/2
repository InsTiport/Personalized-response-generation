 Q.  There is a mass of humanity in this town.  I'm assuming with your personality this is right up your alley? 
 GILBERT ARENAS:  It is.  Although I'm going to bring it down a notch here.  People say I'm the best dressed out of the East All-Stars, so note that:  Best Dressed, East All-Stars. 

 Q.  Is there a better venue than this city for the All-Star Game? 
 GILBERT ARENAS:  This is going to be great.  When the USA Basketball was here the fans came out and showed their support.  So this is going to open up David Stern's eyes to see if he really wants the game here. 

 Q.  In this kind of a game can we see a little bit more of one-on-one battle between you and Kobe Bryant? 
 GILBERT ARENAS:  I don't know.  We might have to stick each other, but it's nothing personal.  What happened up in LA and what happened in Washington is just part of the game. 
 So if we have a chance to stick each other, we're both going for an award. 

 Q.  The word is that you have some jerseys laid out, what are you going to do with them? 
 GILBERT ARENAS:  At tomorrow's practice with the fans I'm going to give out 100 Agent Zero jerseys.  And since everybody knows, we'll see if I can still sneak it on.  I'm going to try to wear the Agent Zero jersey in the game. 
 What's the chances of me getting away with that? 

 Q.  This is your third All-Star Game, but it's the first time you'll start.  How do you feel about that? 
 GILBERT ARENAS:  It's an opportunity just to be here, period.  I get my third ring.  I never imagined this growing up.  You always wanted to be an All-Star, but three consecutive, I mean, it's amazing that I'm here again for the third consecutive time. 
 And starting, you know, I get more than nine minutes this time (laughter).  So we'll see how that plays out. 
 If I'm rolling, the hibachi is on, you know what I'm going for.
