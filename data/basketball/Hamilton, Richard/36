<p>	Q.  You showed last night that a cohesive team can dominate a team of superstars, and I was there in Indianapolis where foreign teams did that three times.  Would a team like the Pistons be an ideal representative for the U.S. in the Olympics and would you like to see something like that happen?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much of this is a by-product of the kind of players that Joe went out and got?  It seemed like for whatever reason, things didn't quite work for all you guys, wherever you were, and he had a sense of each one of you had something to prove and you're like essentially proving it together. </p>
<p>	Q.  What is it that allows you to be so effective on the offensive glass? </p>
<p>	Q.  You know that being in this situation where there's a little bit of comfort, up 2-1, still at home, has not always been great for you guys.  What have you learned from past experiences and how do you keep from anticipation getting in your way? </p>
<p>	Q.  You guys have held that team to 68 and 88 points in two out of three games, almost won the other game, do you pinch yourselves at the defense you're playing against these people and what you've done so far?</p>
