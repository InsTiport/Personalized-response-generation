<p>	Q.  Chauncey, talk about how you put you yourself in the zone this game. </p>
<p>	Q.  Chauncey, you had 53 against the Lakers in two games in the regular season, another 22 tonight.  What is it about the Lakers that seems to bring out the best in you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is it how they defend the pick and roll that's different than other teams? </p>
<p>	Q.  Rip, talk about yourself going 5 for 16, getting the win.  You probably couldn't play any worse than you played tonight, and you guys win the ballgame? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can both of you talk about what you saw as far as the Tayshaun and Kobe matchup, and what Tayshaun was able to do against Kobe? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the job Rasheed did tonight on Karl Malone not only defensively, but getting some key shots for you guys tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  Chauncey, it's still a long series ahead, but could you think of even a better script for you individually and the team in Game  1 to start off with?</p>
<p>	Q.  How about individually, yourself?</p>
<p>	Q.  Heading into the series, the defensive will you are able to put on teams in the East, there is a sense, as well as you guys played, part of that was those teams were not as good offensively as the Lakers would be.  Can you talk about the satisfaction of doing the exact same things you did to these other opponents to the Lakers tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  Rip, was it the game plan defensively to concentrate on the other players on Devean George, on Fish, and Gary and Karl and not let the others get involved? </p>
<p>	Q.  Chauncey, 58-54, the Lakers are coming back and you guys come out of the time-out, next two offenses you play peek-a-boo and knock down the jumpshot and go to the bucket and get fouled and take two shots, was this called by Coach Brown or was this the feeling you had or you had that confidence that you could do it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Rip were you surprised on the time-out, we go to time-out on the international feed when Coach Brown said to you:  I don't care if you're 5-for-15 or 5-for-100, keep shooting the ball, is that the way he's been to you the whole way along?  That's a lot of confidence you're playing in L.A., you know it's a close game and you weren't playing your best game of the year. </p>
