<p>	Q. Given everything that this team has had to go through this season, how rewarding is that piece of hardware right there?</p>
<p>	Q.  The score that you had in the first half was the top of the court, basically and then Dwyane Wade had the 12-point third quarter and ties the game up at 60 and then no more points for him the rest of the contest.  What happened defensively for you? </p>
<p>	Q.  It seemed like you played better in this series at home, but tonight you were able to excel on the road, why was that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about Bruce Bowen as a defender and your experiences against him and what you think of him as a defender.  There have been some things said about Bruce's tactics. </p>
<p>	Q.  Is it true that you got a call from Stevie Wonder? </p>
<p>	Q.  Somebody said something about you getting a call from Stevie Wonder at the game or before the game. </p>
<p>	Q.  Wow. </p>
<p>	Q.  With all of the stuff going on about Larry, how were you guys able to continue to focus?</p>
