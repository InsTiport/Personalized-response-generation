Q. Rip, it seemed to me like both teams had an easy time getting to the hoop in the first quarter.  What happened after that?  It seemed like the Heat continued to get some easy shots and you guys struggled offensively to get to the basket. 

RICHARD HAMILTON:  I think that, you know, we just need to really continue to run our sets.  I think that we probably needed to do a better job of trying to get Rasheed and McDyess and Ben and them guys involved a little bit more, so their big guys can't help out as much.  I think in the first quarter, I think second, third and fourth, we need to do a better job on getting them the ball. 

Q.  Chauncey said the other day it seems like, in his words, unfortunately you guys play your best when you have your backs to the wall.  Did you see that as the scenario and do you think you'll play a lot better? 

RICHARD HAMILTON:  Man, that's crazy.  Like I said, I don't believe we played like it tonight.  I think we let the refs get into our head early, kind of messed up our flow of the game, but we still need to go out there and play the game we want to play.  The crazy thing about it is, you know, we play better in these type of situations, and right now it's either win or go home.
