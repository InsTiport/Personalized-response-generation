Q. When did you find out that you were going to be guarding Wade and what was your reaction?

RICHARD HAMILTON:  No, I wasn't -- it wasn't something that somebody told me.  I wanted to.  You know, Coach didn't even know I was going to guard him, at the beginning, I just started with him and see how it goes. 

Q.  You went to Larry and said "I'm going to take him"?

RICHARD HAMILTON:  Yeah.

Q.  Is that how it works? 

RICHARD HAMILTON:  Yeah, I think Coach has a lot of confidence in us.  When we come out and do scouting reports, he never says, you guard this person or whatever, whatever.  He allows us on the floor to make up our own decisions on who wants to guard who. 

Q.  When did you decide you wanted to guard him?

RICHARD HAMILTON:  Last game.  But I didn't really say nothing until the beginning of the game.  I said to Tayshaun, "I'm going to give you a break, I'll guard him in the beginning and see what happens." 

Q.  The first half, is that as good as it gets?

RICHARD HAMILTON:  I think we really stepped up our defense and played aggressive and took a lot of things away from them. 

Q.  Why do you think it takes you guys to be down before you get your real effort?

BEN WALLACE:  I don't know.  We got a good win tonight.  We go to Miami and see what they do. 

Q.  With everything else going on, with Coach Brown, how are you guys able to stay so focused, especially the first half, zero turnovers?

BEN WALLACE:  I don't know.  We got a good win tonight and we're going to take it down to Miami and see what we do down there. 

Q.  What did you think of the effect of putting Rip on Dwyane did for you guys defensively?

BEN WALLACE:  I don't know.  We got a good win tonight and we're going to take it down to Miami and see what we do.  (Laughter).

Q.  This sounds reminiscent to someone else saying that both teams played hard.

BEN WALLACE:  Bottom line; we got a good win when we needed to and now we go down to Miami.
