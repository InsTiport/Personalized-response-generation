<p>	Q. You guys have been so effective when it comes to defending big men, you shut down Shaq last year with the Lakers, last week with the Heat, last night notwithstanding, what do you guys do differently defensively to try to eliminate the big man and what he can do, with the damage he can do in the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Last night you guys went to Rasheed early, hit three buckets in the first quarter and seemed to go away from that.  Why do you think that breaks down when you guys are not going inside? </p>
<p>	Q.  We've seen you have some big nights, last night obviously a lot of the shots weren't falling, was it an off-night or something the Spurs were doing?</p>
<p>	Q.  And that usually doesn't happen two games in a row for you either, you know that, too, right? </p>
<p>	Q.  How does Bruce Bowen play defense differently than other people in the league or better?  How would you describe that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you explain what Chauncey Billups has meant to your team? </p>
<p>	Q.  You were matched up with Ginobli a little bit last night, is he like any other player in the league, and what makes him so difficult to guard? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think the games that you have played actually just took a toll on you last night, the whole accumulation of the Conference Finals against Miami and then Indiana?  Do you think that may have contributed to the 7-for-21? </p>
<p>	Q.  As a follow-up to that, is Bruce Bowen the best defender you've had on you the entire playoffs? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talk about the way Bruce exerts all of his energy on defense, does that get into your head a little bit, even when you hit an open shot, you're pressing too hard? </p>
