<p>	Q. I know you guys generally don't shoot a lot of threes, but when you're outscored 33-0 from behind the arc, does that pretty much make it impossible to win? </p>
<p>	Q.  Was there a point where they kept coming back and you had to roll your eyes and say that tonight wasn't your night?</p>
<p>	Q.  It seems like the big difference today was that they were really circulating the ball quickly, swinging it, and their defense was sort of stopping you guys from doing the same thing, why is that? </p>
<p>	Q.  I know you guys take pride in your defense, what happened in the first half to allow them to get some layups and easy looks at the bucket? </p>
<p>	Q.  You guys seem a little bit frustrated with the officials because they have 34 free throws. </p>
<p>	Q.  You've had a chance to see Manu now for two games, do you have any kind of theory or idea about what you all can do to provide an answer to him? </p>
