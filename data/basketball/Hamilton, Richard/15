<p>	Q.  You had not hit a three-pointer this entire series, when you hit one did you know at that point they were going to start going in for you?</p>
<p>	Q.  I think we heard a couple of the crucial time-outs at the end of the game, did Coach Brown tell you, "I love you guys," And did he say to have fun? </p>
<p>	Q.  Would you agree that there was like a turning point the first half when you guys had a couple technicals and started to go off on the refs even though you were leading, but then after that, it seemed to just sort of calm down and get your concentration back and not sort of fall into that trap that you did in the first two games here?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the play when Bruce ripped your mask off, is it something that epitomized the whole series, what the whole series has been for you against Bruce? </p>
<p>	Q.  Both Larry and Chauncey have said that it's been a tough couple of days for Sheed.  How do you see him respond when he has a tough couple of days emotionally like that and how do you feel like he did he especially in that fourth quarter? </p>
