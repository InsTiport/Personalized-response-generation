<p>	Q. You guys have been behind in the last two series and now it's the third one, can you talk about where do you guys get your collective resiliency to come back like you have all this spring?</p>
<p>	Q.  That's a pretty good trait.  Is that maybe the No. 1 trait of this team, do you think? </p>
<p>	Q.  What adjustments can you guys make against Ginobli for Game 2?</p>
<p>	Q.  Like yourself, Chauncey Billups was a lottery pick, yet he took a couple of years to find his niche and now he's here in Detroit and he seems to be flourishing.  Can you just talk about the evolution of Chauncey Billups as a player. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you ever offer words of encouragement to Darko when you see other kids around him that got drafted like LeBron, Carmelo all coming out and showing what they can do and he's been stuck on the bench the last two years? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much do you think that's affected his confidence when you're stuck on the bench? </p>
<p>	Q.  Back over to Chauncey Billups, he was a bright spot in Game 1 and huge for you last year in The Finals winning the MVP, how big does his game have to be for you guys, and at the same time, how big is this game for you guys and how big does he have to be before everyone else is clicking on all cylinders as well?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just curious, when did you get that nickname "Rip" and who gave it to you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does it have a special meaning? </p>
