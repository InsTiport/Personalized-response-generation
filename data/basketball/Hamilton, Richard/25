<p>	Q. How freeing was it for you offensively tonight without Wade in the game? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've been through these elimination games before, did your experience in that make in any easier to take the pressure off?</p>
<p>	Q.  I'd like to ask you about the Piston defense and also about beating the Heat without Wade. </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you almost wish that Wade had played because you had been through a series last year when you were facing an injured Jason Kidd and Karl Malone didn't play, there's always been that little question, do you think that you wish Wade had played so there would be no question? </p>
<p>	Q.  How important was it for you guys to remain focused as opposed to Game 5 where you lost your composure?  Did you talk about that a lot in the locker room?</p>
<p>	Q.  Rasheed made the guarantee and things like that.  Was there any doubt in anybody's mind in your locker room the last two days that you guys would not win this game?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know you respect the Heat certainly with or without Wade but how different was it for you offensively without having to chase him around?</p>
<p>	Q.  You say the Heat are still a great team even without Wade but what did they look like tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  Tayshaun had mentioned earlier in the series that when you and Chauncey were getting shots and moving the ball, the offense really seems to flow.  Do you feel the same way that you guys are the key to getting this offense going?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about how important your guys' experience, winning the Championship last year has been in overcoming all that you've been through this season. </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk a little bit, that play at the end of the first half, Miami had pulled within two, with like a minute and a half left and you go on a 10-0 run and you had a couple big shots, what did that do for you guys and did that demoralize Miami a little bit?</p>
