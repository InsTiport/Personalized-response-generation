<p>	Q. Where is this team's mindset right now going into this next game?  Obviously it's a big game. </p>
<p>	Q.  How tough is it not to dwell on the little things that went wrong like free throw shooting, which has been a problem for you guys in the last two games?</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you think you guys need to do to limit Wade effectively these next couple games?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talk about helping out and being on a string, talk about Shaquille's impact.  As the series has gone on, it seems like he's getting more and more comfortable, more and more steam. </p>
<p>	Q.  What is Dwyane doing when he's at the top of the key to get into the paint?</p>
<p>	Q.  You said you guys don't play well until your backs are against the ball or until there's some sort of adversity there that challenges you guys --. </p>
<p>	Q.  Why do you guys put yourselves in that position?  Because it really does seem like you put yourselves in those positions. </p>
