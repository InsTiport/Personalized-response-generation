<p>	Q.  You sometimes get a little particular about things, where you are on the floor that, sort of thing, how would you classify the Staples Center as a shooting building, good, bad, how? </p>
<p>	Q.  Are you going to be okay with not seeing it until tomorrow, since you haven't seen it since November? </p>
<p>	Q.  Who is the toughest defensive player you've gone against and where does Kobe rank in that regard?</p>
