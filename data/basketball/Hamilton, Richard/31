Q. You guys came here on a mission to get one.  You got one.  Talk about going home.
 
RICHARD HAMILTON:  We came here to get one, we got one.  They did a great job tonight taking care of home.  Now we've just got to go home and take care of business.  We've got to go there and feed off our fans.  I think we're ready and prepared to do that.  
 
Q.  Rip, in the second quarter when you were assessed a technical going to the bench, were words exchanged between you and Coach Van Gundy?
 
RICHARD HAMILTON:  No, it was me and a player.  It was just something that -- the heat of the battle, one guy trying to get advantage on another, and they just called a double technical.
