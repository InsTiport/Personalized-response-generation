<p>	Q.  You've played a couple hundred games now for Larry Brown.  Can you define what it's been like to play for him, and if, in fact, after tomorrow night, it's over, how will you remember him? </p>
<p>	Q.  A few weeks ago, it seemed like the talk around this team constantly was about where would Coach Brown go next, and everyone was describing it's a distraction, yet now you could walk away winning a championship, what does it say about yourself as players and about Coach Brown that made that not be a distraction at all and you just went ahead and went about your business so easily? </p>
<p>	Q.  What qualities does Chauncey possess that would compare him to Derek Jeter in baseball and Tom Brady in football?</p>
<p>	Q.  You defended a lot during Game 6 on Tony Parker, is it something that you think made it tougher for him or was different for him? </p>
<p>	Q.  Have you gotten more comfortable as this series has gone on playing Bruce and how he's going at you? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much is the fact that you guys have been in Game 7s, how will that help you guys tomorrow night?</p>
