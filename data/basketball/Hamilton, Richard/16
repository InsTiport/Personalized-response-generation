<p>	Q.  They have been doubling Tayshaun and trying to get the ball out of his hands, what have you guys done defensively to counteract that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Are most of the doubles coming off Ben? </p>
<p>	Q.  We've heard a lot about how Rasheed's sense of humor is a big thing in your locker room, what does he give you specifically grief about? </p>
<p>	Q.  Does he have a thing with you or with Chauncey, a thing they will get on you about?</p>
<p>	Q.  Given your team's record in San Antonio the last few years, how imperative is it to win Game 5?</p>
<p>	Q.  How would you describe the relationship that Coach Brown has with his players? </p>
<p>	Q.  Before Rasheed got here, back when he was in Portland or wherever and you maybe didn't know him as well, did you think any different of him?  Did you think he was a flake when he was throwing his head bands and whatever? </p>
