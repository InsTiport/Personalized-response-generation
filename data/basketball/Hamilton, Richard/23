<p>	Q.  What are the specific skills that Bruce Bowen has that make it so challenging for you when he's defending against you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Bruce says he's got DVDs and tapes of you that he's taken home and studied.  Will you do the same thing and will you watch what he has done in the playoffs up to this point defensively? </p>
