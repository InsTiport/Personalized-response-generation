<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the job you did on Hollis Price, if you had a game plan, other than usually coming in? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jeff, being from Atlanta, coming here to the Final Four, what was your dream about how tonight would go?  How far did this exceed it? </p>
<p>	Q.  JJ, what did it mean for the team, for Donald Perry to come into a game like this and play as well as he did?  I think he scored seven points in the final three minutes. </p>
<p>	Q.  You picked a great night for your career-high.  Just seemed like you sensed with both McGhee and Brown in foul trouble, you were going to go right at them.  Was that your idea? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you please talk about the play of Jeff off the bench and how well he played tonight. </p>

<p>	Q.  Do you guys like the role of the underdog?  Should you guys be considered underdogs? </p>
<p>	Q.  What did you say to Mike about 24 seconds left?  Secondly, where did George Leach come from? </p>
<p>	Q.  What was the difference in getting better looks from 3-point range in the second half?  I think you guys were six for six.  Jared, you started it off with that bank shot, I think. </p>
<p>	Q.  Tom struggled with the ankle.  How much of his game was the result of the ankle?  Now only one day.  What do you expect on Monday? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jeff, I wonder if you could talk about, compare this to any other experience you've had, any other game like this?  Have you ever had a night where you've been that on? </p>

<p>	Q.  Jared got two fouls in the first half.  You sat him down for about the past 11 minutes.  How important was -- you guys didn't lose any ground during that time?  How important was the play of the guys off the bench? </p>
<p>	Q.  How serious is AJ's injury?  Will he be available Monday? </p>
<p>	Q.  When Coverdale got off those two wild passes, was that an indication to you that he had had it for the night? </p>
<p>	Q.  What were you thinking when Fife came over there in the last minute and you had your head down? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is this about as good a defensive performance by Dane as you've seen all year?  Talk about what he did tonight. </p>
<p>	Q.  You got 41 points from your bench, 32 from your starters tonight.  Have you had a game like that this season? </p>
<p>	Q.  18 months ago the situation with Indiana basketball was a bit in flux to say the least.  Can you talk about how you've responded, how the players responded, how the institution has responded, what it says about these three aspects of Indiana basketball that you find yourself in the final game? </p>
<p>	Q.  What are your anticipations?  With the quick turnaround with Coverdale's ankle, was it a problem tonight?  Are you concerned after a heavy work load tonight it's going to be a problem Monday? </p>
