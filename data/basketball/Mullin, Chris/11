THE MODERATOR: We welcome Coach Mullin to the interview room.   
COACH MULLIN: I thought today's performance was a gutty performance.  Thought that we took care of the basketball.  For the most part, we rebounded and competed.  I thought it was a good bounce-back game, defense was much better, and I told the team if we play like that, we'll be rewarded.   
 Q.  Coach, you started slow, but you battled back.  That has to be a good sign going forward.  
COACH MULLIN: Yeah, the guys have worked hard.  It's never from a lack of effort.  Sometimes other things creep in.  A lot of it is a lack of experience; that you can't fast forward.  Experience is something you have to go through, and when you go through it, it's going to be some painful nights, but I keep telling them, that's what's going to make us better.   
It's not going to happen right away.  Any good team, any good player, that's what you go through.  That's the price you have to pay.  The people that are willing to do it, they get rewarded in the end.   
 Q.  Did Indiana seem fatigued to you?  
COACH MULLIN: No.   
 Q.  No?  Okay. Obviously you played in the NBA and you know the league very well.  Curious on Troy Williams as it relates to the next level?  
COACH MULLIN: He's an NBA athlete, for sure.  He's a versatile player.  He can play several positions, probably guard several positions.  Multi-talented and versatile, which is very valuable at the next level.
