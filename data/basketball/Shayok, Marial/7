Arizona - 71, Iowa State - 66   
MEGAN GODFREY: Start with an opening statement from coach then we'll take questions for the players.   
STEVE PROHM: First off the atmosphere was terrific.  Our fan base traveled incredibly well, but it was an electric environment.  And I credit Arizona the second half and we talked about it at halftime.  We had to be disciplined defensively and then if we're fundamentally sound offensively we'll have a great chance to come out of here with a win.  44 points in the second half is too much.  But credit Arizona, they made big plays down the stretch with some threes by Coleman, some big offensive rebounds by Luther, that was the difference.   
MEGAN GODFREY: Take questions for the players, please.   
 Q.  What were the last 11 minutes, you guys had a 10-point lead, 11:02 to go and then what happened there after that?  
NICK WEILER-BABB: I mean it came down to they made big shots, we couldn't get a stop, and we got, they got a couple of offensive rebounds late in the game that really hurt.  And I think our shot selection really needs to improve and it came down to little plays like that.   
 Q.  Nick, can you expand on the shot selection.  What looks did you think you guys needed to improve upon down the stretch there?  
NICK WEILER-BABB: I think mostly just like in transition we took a lot of shots after they got layups and we maybe could have got a better shot.  It might have been a good look, but at that point in time we needed a great look.  There's nothing really specific but just the early shots in transition.   
MEGAN GODFREY: All right, take questions for coach.   
 Q.  You seemed to have them under control a little bit in the first half defending the three-point line.  What did you see change in the second half when they were getting little better looks than you were allowing in the first half?  
STEVE PROHM: Yeah, I think that the second half they were 6-14 from three and it started really with the first possession of the half.  We're up nine, we've guarded down to the last two, three seconds on the shot clock and we help off the corner, which that's our rule is to stay at home.  So we give Luther an open three there.  I thought Coleman, we wanted to go under some ball screens, but the one time Tyrese really went way under we gave Coleman a really good look and then he made a couple big threes too.  But that was the challenge in the second half, can we be as fundamentally sound defensively.  We held them to 27 points, we really competed.  They had other at the other end of the floor, you really can't hear, and so we just got to continue to grow from that.  But we can't give up 50 percent, almost 60 percent from three and expect to win.  Too many points.  And then obviously we struggled the last 10 minutes with getting good shots and then finishing some plays too.   
 Q.  4-24 from three, obviously you're not happy with that but 24 threes, is that a number you're comfortable with this team that you have currently?  
STEVE PROHM: Yes and no.  Because I don't think all -- I bet a third of them we didn't need.  Too many quick contested threes, I thought, to where I thought when we really got good ball movement we really opened up gaps, I thought we really got good things.  We were on a good pace, we had 54 points with 11 minutes to go, so we're, we have got a really good chance to maybe mid 70's, I don't know, 72 I think, that's where mathematically it would end up.  But it was just too many contested, too many quick shots and then we were back on defense.  We have got to be more fundamentally sound offensively.  Again, I had to tell them all the time, you give them freedom, we got to make good decisions with that but we got to know time and score at times we got to make sure we're working them.  And they did a good job to hedge ball screens, but we talked about how we wanted to attack that, we talked about how we wanted to move their gap help.  When we're locked in and we're playing good I told the guys in the locker room, I think we have a chance to be a really good team, I'm really excited about our team, we just have to do our habits, our good habits we have to just do them for longer periods of time.   
 Q.  What did you think of the pace early in the game?  I mean it was quick, was that good pace for you?  
STEVE PROHM: Yeah, I thought we got a lot of good things in transition.  But the thing is, is when you don't have it in transition, when we fill into a drag screen or we get ball reversal, we got some good things off that, and to where I thought there was a lot of times where we pushed it in transition and really tried to force the issue to where, hey, if it's not there, let's get good ball movement and let's really move the defense.  And that's, we're going to grow from that, we're going to keep harping on it and once we get that completely fixed I think this team can really make some really good strides.  I like this team a lot, like I said for a long time.   
 Q.  One more thing along that line, is it just me or does Talen sometimes get out of control or do you want him being like that or how do you control him?  
STEVE PROHM: You know, he's a freshman, he had some great moments, but we have got to, we got a couple guys that we got to continue to preach, hey, ball movement and shot selection at times.  You don't want to take away their aggressiveness, you don't want to pigeon hole them, but we do, there's some times where we got to make sure we're getting a good shot because bad shots nine times out of ten are going to lead to easy offense.  And Arizona's got, Sean does a great job, Arizona's got a very good team, their guards stepped up.  I thought Luther -- and then our fires on Jeter, as good as they were in the first half we let him out in the second half.  I mean we didn't jump baseline, slide in the fire, he got a jump hook.  They split the trap one time, he got a layup.  Coleman got in the paint.  And so we just got to be smarter and this one hurts because you're up 10, 11 to go, fan base unreal in there, we got to finish that game out.   
 Q.  You had a few missing players tonight but you played hard.  I mean one of the things you said in the opening press conference was that your fans travel.  So it seems like you're creating a culture.  What do you hope to have happen over the next few days?  What do you want to build on in terms of that culture that you're building with this energy that you have following you?  
STEVE PROHM: Yeah, well our fan base is incredible.  I said it last night at our event, I mean, we probably had three quarters of the arena.  I mean they're loud, they love their program, they love their school, they got an immense amount of pride in Iowa State and what it's about and what it stands for and so I can't thank them enough.  What I want to see over this weekend is just we got to continue to compete and we got to continue to get better because all three games are going to be resume building wins.  If you can get them.  But we got a quick turn around and so we got to respond, this is the first time this team's had to bounce back from a tough loss to where we think we -- give credit to Arizona -- but it's one that we probably let get away at the end.   
 Q.  Piggybacking off that, when you lose a game like that and then probably whatever happens the next two days, the refrain is going to be, well if they had those four guys.  What do you do with that, with your team or anybody saying that to you?  
STEVE PROHM: We don't have them.  They're gone.  We got two injured and two that needed to make better decisions.  So we have got eight and I jokingly call them the Rocket 8.  We got eight guys, they asked me yesterday in the press conference who is number nine.  We got eight.  So that's what we got, that's what we got to go to work with.  While the other four guys are out the one thing I thought they did a great job of being encouragers on the bench and being really supportive and so there's no excuses, we have got eight guys, we have got to get better and we got a great opportunity tomorrow and it's a quick turn around, it's two different styles, Gonzaga is one way and then Illinois, if you play them, we played Brad's teams before, you got to prepare for their pressure and that will be new for a lot of our guys.
