  Q. What's the best part of this experience to this point?   
 RODNEY STUCKEY: Just being around all these guys, seeing everybody down here, just having fun.   
 It will be fun tonight. This is the first time I have experienced something like this. It will be a lot of fun.  
  
  Q. It is like basketball heaven.   
 RODNEY STUCKEY: Yeah. Like I said, everybody is down here, everywhere you turn, you see someone.   
 It is going to be fun tonight. I get to play with my friends that I really don't see during the season. Hopefully we come out with a victory.  
  
  Q. Any tips from Iverson on how to play tonight?   
 RODNEY STUCKEY: Just go out and play hard. That's all you have to do.
