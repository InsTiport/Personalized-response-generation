Dayton - 89, Virginia Tech - 62
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.
MIKE YOUNG: We tip our cap to a really good Dayton team, exceptionally well-coached Dayton team. They took us behind the shed and whipped our hind end. And Coach Grant is -- they're going to have a really good year -- so are we -- they got the better of us today, we'll live to see another day and excited about coming back over tomorrow and representing Virginia Tech. Y'all go ahead.
THE MODERATOR: Open it up for questions for the players.
Q. For both of you, what was it about Dayton that surprised you early on that you didn't anticipate today?
WABISSA BEDE: Nothing surprised us. We just came out with bad energy, I kind of felt it from like the layup line our energy was kind of low, we weren't as upbeat as yesterday. We knew how good they were and we knew they were a great team and they came out with fight from the first media timeout. You could tell the energy was high, the fans were in it, it was like a home game for them and all congrats to them. Great game.
HUNTER CATTOOR: Like what he said. Great team, came out with more energy than us and we never matched it from the point of the game.
THE MODERATOR: All right, we'll take questions for coach.
MIKE YOUNG: Anything, guys? Happy Thanksgiving.
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.
