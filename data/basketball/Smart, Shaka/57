 Q. Very happy team. A lot of talk about this team coming in. Shaka, we talked about all the negative publicity. Played the video for the team. Certainly was a motivating factor. What did your kids prove tonight?
 COACH SMART: Well, I think we proved we're a better team tonight. We proved we get a chance to advance and play Georgetown on Friday. 
 We don't really worry about all the drama surrounding the selection. We know we're worthy of being here, and we proved we were the better team tonight.

 Q. Georgetown, if they get Chris Wright back, how does that change the ball club?
 COACH SMART: He's a phenomenal player. He's not the only one; they've got a lot of good players. But we do too. If we go out and play well and defend, we'll have a chance to win.

 Q. Speaking of phenomenal players, this kid did a terrific job shutting down other players. 
 COACH SMART: He's been terrific all year long. Can't say enough about him.

 Q. How did you think you did tonight?
 JAMIE SKEEN: I had four fouls. I thought I did very well defensively. 

 Q. How much was the negative talk a motivating factor?
 JAMIE SKEEN: It was a big motivation for us because it hurts when people are talking about the team and they don't think you belong. So only way we can come out and prove them wrong was come out here and win. 

 Q. Up next you get Georgetown storied program, is that a winnable game for this team as well?
 COACH SMART: I believe so. If we play like we played tonight, I believe we can beat anybody.

 Q. All right. No time to rest. 2:00 a.m. flight tonight.
