 Q.   You had a phenomenal night inside, scoring virtually at will, in fact the points in the paint piled up.   Yet it did not free up the perimeter opportunities for the Cavs.   Was it a combination of just more of a harassing defense on the part of the Warriors tonight, or, as Coach Blatt said, was the team a bit tired, a bit exhausted from the three games in five nights and the travel?   Or a combination?   
TIMOFEY MOZGOV:   That's a long question.   Can you repeat, please?   
   
 Q.   The success you had in the paint, scoring at will really set the tempo for the Cavs in terms of your ability to roll up the points.   But it did not essentially open up the perimeter game.   Was that a factor to the Warriors relentless defense, or was it also somewhat of a reflection of the fatigue, a little exhaustion, three games in five nights as Coach Blatt said?   
TIMOFEY MOZGOV:   We played like seven guys, but it's all that we have, and we can't ask for something different.   I just can't say.   Maybe guys are tired, maybe not.   
But we're going to watch some film, do some work on mistakes and see what we can do on the perimeter, and inside, outside, whatever.   Whatever it takes.  
   
 Q.   Defensively tonight were they able to exploit anything you guys were doing or not executing?   Did they learn something through the first three games, or did you guys just have a bad game defensively?   
TIMOFEY MOZGOV:   It's hard to say.   We all played as hard as we can, that's what I can say.   Like you said, they scored a lot of points.   It was not a game like‑‑ I think we can play better defense.   I don't know what it was or it was not enough energy on the defensive end or if it was just bad defense, or they do something different with a small lineup.   
So, like I said, it's a lot of work tomorrow and after tomorrow to see how we can be better on defense, both in energy and game plan for everyone.  
   
 Q.   They seemed to be able to get to the basket a lot easier tonight than they did in previous games.   What was different tonight?   
TIMOFEY MOZGOV:   It's what I said, maybe it's a small lineup.   It's, for me personally, a little bit different.   I need to learn how to play with a small lineup if Coach wants me on the court.   So this is what I say, we're going to see.   We're going to see what we can do better.  
   
 Q.   Was it that they were maybe moving a little too quick?   That you were uncomfortable?   What was going on?   
TIMOFEY MOZGOV:   Me?   
   
 Q.   Yes.   
TIMOFEY MOZGOV:   I always want to stay in the paint and protect the paint.   But like I said, they played a small lineup.   They tried the stretch defense, whatever they're doing.   Like I say, we've got three more games, and we all have to learn something from this game and move to the next game.  
   
 Q.   What you were talking about, you got switched out on Andre Iguodala a number of times and he was standing out at the three.   Could you tell me about your thought process and what you had to think about, because you didn't really fully go out there and challenge him, and he ended up draining a couple on you, though you had a great offensive night.   
TIMOFEY MOZGOV:   You know, Andre's a good player, but we all know he's not the best shooter on their team.   But he's really good in driving and kicking out whatever they do.   So I just tried to take his strengths away when I got him.   I don't want to let him beat me on a drive.   I tried to be late contest when he shot, so that's it.  
   
 Q.   You started to touch on this a little bit.   Were you finding it much more difficult to protect the paint in the rim when they were driving in because you had so much more ground to cover?   You were out covering guys and had to stick with guys farther out on the perimeter than you did with Bogut.   
TIMOFEY MOZGOV:   What is the question?   
   
 Q.   Was it harder for you to get into the paint and protect?   
TIMOFEY MOZGOV:   Yeah, yeah, like I said.   They move a lot with their small lineup.   They don't stay.   I've got to move too, but it's not about how you move.   It's about how you read.   You've got to‑‑ like I said, you've got to learn.   You've got to learn, and I have to be better.   We all have to be better.
