<p>	Q.  Mike, how much did their quickness throw your offense out of synch early especially?</p>
<p>	Q.  Mike, the stretch where you couldn't get a field goal in the second half, Coach Calhoun talked about how the atmosphere is different on a Friday evening.  Did you get caught up in that?</p>

<p>	Q.  David had only three points for the game.  Didn't score in the last 24, 27.  You rely on him so much to come up with those big baskets.  How difficult was that psychologically?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chris, just wondering if you can talk about how difficult it was setting up the offense early.  Then you seemed to catch up with that pace and settle down after that. </p>
<p>	Q.  This league is such a good league.  How many teams do you think the tournament committee will take from this conference?</p>
<p>	Q.  It seemed like in the second half they clogged up the middle offensively.  What did they do differently? </p>
<p>	Q.  UCONN has been here before.  How much of an advantage is that to their program?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you imagine coming into the tournament, there's two freshmen in their first two games at The Garden, giving performances like Ben Gordon and Chris Thomas did.  Did it surprise guys like you? </p>
