North Carolina - 78
Notre Dame - 47
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Notre Dame.
We'll take an opening comment from Coach Brey and then open it up for questions.
COACH BREY: Let's give a lot of credit to North Carolina.  They were fabulous.  Their defense was a different level than what we've seen or played against in South Bend.  We really had nowhere to go.  I give their defense a lot of credit.
There's two games here that we were in a one-possession game with four minutes to go before the half, and we turned it over a bunch both nights.  We were able to recover yesterday, but not today.  We just finished the half turning it over.  We couldn't recover today.
But again, I think Carolina gets a lot of credit.  They were in a groove.  I thought their defense was fabulous.
THE MODERATOR: Questions.
Q. Mike, the 20-4 run at the end of the half, out-rebounded by nine at that point, you had a tough time.  How tough was that?
COACH BREY: We could make our travel plans at halftime.  Let me put it that way.  That's how tough it was.
Again, we did it both nights, which I think we've got to address and practice on Sunday before we move into this next tournament.
But I think you got to give North Carolina credit.  I thought their defense, from what I watched, was a different level than I've seen all season.  We couldn't make passes.  They contested stuff.  They've got great length.  They did do the number on the board.  We were able to hold our own on the board in South Bend, but not tonight.
Q. Mike, your team had 15 turnovers.  That's more than you've had all year.  You went more than 10 minutes without a field goal.  Were you getting most of the shots that you wanted?
COACH BREY: Not really.  We weren't.  I thought we really had to force stuff and we hurried some stuff.  Again, I think it was their defense.
We tried a couple different entries.  What happens is when you don't have a receiver against a team that really contests like this, you put your head down and drive and kind of force a play.  We did that a couple times.  Then frustration builds a little bit.
So, again, we've come out of this thing, 18 turnovers, 15 turnovers.  I still don't know how we won yesterday with 18 turnovers.  We've been one of the best taking care of it in the country all year.  We're going to have to get back to that if we want to survive and advance in the next tournament.
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
