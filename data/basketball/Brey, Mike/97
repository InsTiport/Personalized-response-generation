<p>	Q.  In the next month, five weeks or so, what are the answers you need to hear to remain in the draft instead of coming back for your junior year? </p>
<p>	Q.  Some of the feedback you've received, have they told you anything as far as projection? </p>
<p>	Q.  Earlier in the year you talked about you definitely were going to stay for four years.  What changed this year to the point where you're ready to explore your options in the NBA draft? </p>
<p>	Q.  Since this is a relatively new option for the student athlete, give us the timetable, what's the timetable? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned Top 20.  Does the fact that Ryan didn't have a good first year in the NBA affect your position at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was there anything in the past few days, anything that happened, a talk with somebody?  You said you were going back and forth.  Any one thing that made you decide? </p>
<p>	Q.  You initially said you intended to stay the whole four years.  What is the hardest part of leaving, if you do leave?</p>
<p>	Q.  Some players have gone out in the past not sure where they're going to go.  Have you come to a way to get the best information in terms of where you may go (inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  What kind of information did you get on Ryan last year?  Where was he told he was going to go? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've embraced this process both times rather than be reluctant.  In terms of continuing to build this program, how much more attractive does it make the program, not just that you have the prospects, but the effort the program puts in helping players take the next step?</p>
<p>	Q.  If he gets drafted, what happens to the point guard spot?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does a guy like Russell Carter handle the ball as well?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you evaluate your own game, there's a lot of times you created offensively where the other team had help to stop you.  NBA is a lot of one-on-one.  Is that something that entices you, to think your creativity may be rewarded at the pro level?</p>
<p>	Q.  Your parents, you said you talked with them.  They're going to support whatever you want to do.  When you chose Notre Dame, I know they were excited about that.  What was their feeling about this decision?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is not a front for transferring to St.  Bonaventure? </p>
<p>	Q.  This is a tough school academically.  You've worked hard at that.  How do you feel about the two years you put in academically?  Do you have a long range plan?</p>
<p>	Q.  Whether or not to go to Chicago, what will that be based (inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)? </p>

<p>	Q.  You mentioned before that you talked to Jared Jeffries quite frequently.  I know he was injured part of this year, didn't play a lot.  What was his mood like?  What did he say the NBA life was for him? </p>
<p>	Q.  I want to make sure I understand the process correctly.  Your name is in now, but you can withdraw till June 18th if you're not sure you're going to be in the Top 20 or don't like where your probable draft status is going to be. </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there anything other  than you would not project yourself to be as high as you would want to be that would cause you to drop out of the draft? </p>
<p>	Q.  Strictly come down to where you think would you fall in line? </p>
<p>	Q.  Was there any point during the season in terms of matchups, games, where you kind of started thinking, "I could move on"?  You guys had a lot of big games, you played against a lot of good players, TJ Ford, Steve Blake.  Was there any point on the court where you thought you were ready to make the next step?</p>
<p>	Q.  After you were done, were there games you could look back on and thought that you kind of proved yourself, that you did well in games where you tested yourself?</p>
