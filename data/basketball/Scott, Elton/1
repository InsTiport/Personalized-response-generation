GALE CATLETT:  My thoughts on the game, just quickly afterwards would be that when our pointguard went out with five fouls.  We kind of were a ship without a rudder; couldn't run the offense; couldn't run the plays.  Have a freshman kid trying to run it without nobody else to go to.  Villanova did a nice job of capitalizing on that, and I thought our kids played very hard.  I thought we were going to win.  The kids thought we were going to win.  And the foul thing just killed us right there and that's when the game turned and it's pretty simple after that.


Q.  Coach Catlett, Elton, can you just talk about his performance?

GALE CATLETT:  His performance for the day, the his career, today, what do you want to hear?  I thought Elton played very hard.  He had to play a couple different positions because of our lack of personnel.  We had to place him 2 and 3.  We didn't bring a kid with us that started at two-guard forward for us.  He did a nice job, always played hard and I thought he did a heck of a job; tried to hold us in there and after that we didn't get much.


Q.  Do you sense trouble when Kearse fouled out?

ELTON SCOTT:  When he fouled out, I kind of sensed the trouble because they started pressing more,  running, jumping, because they knew we had a new guy running the point the; so I sensed trouble.
