 Q.   Buzz, Deonte had reached 23 points with seven minutes left, and he disappeared for a while.   Was that defense?   
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   Coach, can you talk about the way you guys scrapped through this?   I mean, obviously, you're not happy with the result, but there was a stick‑to‑itiveness that made this go right down to the wire.   
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS:   Thank you.   It mirrors our last two games in many regards, other than we didn't play ten extra minutes.   I do think our guys have resolve and resilience.   
I thought, whenever that last media time‑out was‑‑ that's what I was trying to look up.   I think it was 3:32.   The next 11 points they scored were from the free‑throw line.   Obviously, I under the last two or three possessions we were trying to foul.   But we couldn't ever get a clean stop.   Fouled late in the shot clock, gave them points.   I think they went 9 of 11 their first‑‑ they didn't miss until right there at the very end.   
I think it was 58‑61 when Derrick fell on his hip, Jamil missed those two free throws.   They had scored seven or eight from the free‑throw line and then finished scoring from the free‑throw line.   We just couldn't ever get a clean stop.   
And I thought that, obviously, we need to shoot more free throws in order to have a chance to win, and we need to make a higher percentage, but we turned the ball over too many times in a lower‑than‑normal‑possession game.   We had five turnovers when we played them last time.   They had 19.   Tonight we had 15, they had 10.   It's a possession game, and you need a shot every possession.  
   
 Q.   Buzz, did you get the look you wanted out of that last possession?   
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS:   Out of the time‑out?  
   
 Q.   Yeah, out of the time‑out.   
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS:   I wanted it to be a little cleaner.   We were trying to get Jamil open to run one of our side‑out plays that have a few different options.   We didn't necessarily have to have a three there.   Some of what we were doing in that play allows a potential three.   
But he didn't get open, and Todd was about to fall inbounds.   We would have wanted to get a cleaner look.  
   
 Q.   This is a new experience for you now, going to the NIT.   
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS:   I hope.  
   
 Q.   Yeah, you hope.   
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS:   That's the thing that‑‑ obviously, I see it from a different lens, like you said.   Part of it is I think I'm getting old, but part of it is I do look at it from a different perspective.   We've never been to New York and not been an NCAA Tournament team in the last three years.   
So when I turn on the TV or look at some of the social media stuff, it's like, oh, they're in, they're in, they're in, they're in.   And then no, it's a bubble, it's a bubble, it's a bubble.   And then it's like, yeah, they're going to the NIT.   And then I'm like, well, how many teams are in the NIT?   You know what I mean?   How many bubble teams are there?   How many 1 seeds are there?   How many 2 seeds are there?   
I hope we go to the NIT, and I mean that sincerely.   I would like us to keep playing, but as I just told our guys, in my career as a head coach, I haven't been to the NIT.   So does anybody know how that works?   Sincerely.   
So after Selection Sunday?  
   
 Q.   Yeah, just whoever's leftover?   
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS:   They just call you and say, "You want to play?   Hi, I'm Michael Hunt.   You want to play in the NIT?"  
  
 Q.   Conference champions are automatic qualifiers (AQ).   
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS:   So there's only 23 teams that are not AQs that are going to the NIT?  
   
 Q.   There still may be AQs playing tomorrow.   
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS:   That's what's so strange to me.   I'm not sure the people that say you're NIT bound understand there's eight AQs and more.  
   
 Q.   Deonte look like he took it to a different level.   
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS:   I thought we got him some good looks.   I thought our interior guys, particularly Deonte and Davante, I thought they played really well in the channel.   But I think Xavier, their perimeter guys got to the channel too often.   
Thanks.
