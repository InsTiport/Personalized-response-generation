  JAY BILAS:   Next coach is Marquette's Buzz Williams, in his fifth year as head coach of Marquette.   Taken the Golden Eagles to seven straight NCAA tournaments.   This year's team from last year's Sweet 16, two straight Sweet 16s for Marquette.   He's got three starters back and eight letter winners.   Past national champion, Marquette in 1977 under Al McGuire, and Buzz Williams has carried on that tradition very capably.   Buzz. 
    COACH WILLIAMS:   We're excited to be here.   It's been a long week in some respects.   We had condensation on the floor in Charleston.   Coach Odom and Brianna addressed that this morning, and I'm glad to know that we'll be able to play here tomorrow.   We'll have a good feel, I think, for where we stand after we play Butler and the next two games. 
    We lost a lot last year, but I'm excited about what we're bringing back, and we're honored that we would be invited to be here.   Our guys are thankful for the opportunity and exposure and also just for the opportunity to experience something at this level.   Thank you.
