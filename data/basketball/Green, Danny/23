 Q.   I guess the big news today is that Serge Ibaka is day‑to‑day, could possibly play in Game 3.   Does that surprise you?  
DANNY GREEN:   Big surprise for us.   (Laughter.)   
You know, we prepared the series as if he was going to play Game 1.   We didn't think he was going to be out long, if at all.   But day‑to‑day, you know, it means he's probably going to be back.   We've just got to continue to do what we do and focus on little things, fixing mistakes we had in games 1 and 2 because we're going to have to be that much more focused, intense and tougher going into their building, especially if they have a healthy Serge.  
   
 Q.   What kind of emotional lift do you think that could give them besides him just being a good player and being on the floor?  
DANNY GREEN:   Big emotions.   I'm sure they don't need any more.   It's the Playoffs, of course, the Conference Finals.   They're down 2‑0, backs against the wall, every game is a Game 7 for them, and we've got to approach it that way, as well.   And with their fans behind them, we know how loud it can get in there and how emotional they get and intense when they go on a little run.   We've got to try to limit those runs and not allow them to get their emotions going too high.  
   
 Q.   How much of a difference does he make?  
DANNY GREEN:   A big difference.   Obviously one of the best defensive players in the league, alters everything around the basket, rebounds, and also a floor spreader.   He can knock down shots.   You've got to respect him, and hopefully if he does come back, he's not as fresh, he's a little rusty when he comes back.
