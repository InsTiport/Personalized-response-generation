Q.   How much was the crowd a part‑‑
DANNY GREEN:   The crowd was great.   The crowd was the main reason why we were on our runs, we were able to make those shots.   Our being at home will help us the next couple of games.   We have to take advantage of it.   

Q.   Does it mean more to do it in front of Ray Allen, the best three‑point shooter of all time? 
DANNY GREEN:   I don't really look at it that much, at the opponent.   (Indiscernible) just shoot the basketball.   I watched him growing up.

Q.   Can you talk about defending LeBron, what he's doing.   Since you're were working against him in practice, has that helped you at all? 
DANNY GREEN:   I practiced against him three or four years ago.   He's a totally different player now than he was then.   I was playing him decently.   It's not just one person.   It's not me, it's not Kawhi.   It's all of us making it hard for him.   Making other players beat us. 
We did a good job of opposing on him and opposing on the shooters and making them make tough shots and giving ourselves a chance.
