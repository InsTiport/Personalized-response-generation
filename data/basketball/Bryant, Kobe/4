 Q.   What do you think about his final Allâ€‘Star Game after 15 (Garnett)?   What do you think about that?  
KOBE BRYANT:   Well, I think he appreciates it.   
   
 Q.   A lot has been said about Michael Jordan's comments on LeBron.   Have you seen the story and what is your take on the comments?  
KOBE BRYANT:   I think the message is winning is above everything else.   That's what drives him.   Same thing that drives him now, win as many as you can.   And it's really that simple.  
   
 Q.   Do you think they inspire him?   Is he the odds on favorite for MVP?  
KOBE BRYANT:   He's hitting one of those patches where the hard work and talent all come together.   And just hit one of those hot streaks.   Some of us have been there before, and there's just no feeling about it.  
   
 Q.   What was so special about Jordan's comments?  
KOBE BRYANT:   Special about it?   
   
 Q.   Yes.   
KOBE BRYANT:   I don't know.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible).   
KOBE BRYANT:   Yes, I think the game has become even more global than it has been.   As an ambassador for the game, it's a beautiful sport.   The more you can spread the message, trying to get the game as global as possible, but I think the more kids play, the more that they'll see the beauty of it.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible).   
KOBE BRYANT:   Yeah, I've been working on my cricket game to come over there, I want to make sure my cricket game is up to par.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible).   
KOBE BRYANT:   Well, I think it's healthy.   What I told him (Howard) was whatever critics and pundits say, you can't adjust your game, you have to do what you do.   Everything else will fall into place.
