<p>	Q.  When you were looking at tapes of Hamilton, what tendencies did he have that you thought you could exploit against him when you were guarding him? </p>
<p>	Q.  Where was the hunger tonight, the passion in the squad in the first game of the NBA Finals?  It seemed Detroit controlled the tempo and the aggression. </p>
<p>	Q.  You talk about playing the length of Tayshaun Prince, when they put Lindsey Hunter on you, you went right at him, fadeaway jumper, good.  It seemed to be difficult playing against someone like Tayshaun?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about Game  2.  You guys have been in this situation, and we asked Shaq about it, being down 1-0 in the Finals against Philly.  Talk about Game  2. </p>
<p>	Q.  What reason do you think Fish and George and Mailman didn't get involved in the game?  It just seemed like you and Shaq out there, they were not getting the open looks they usually get and it really showed in the statistics and everything that it was you and Shaq. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel the soft press that Detroit threw at you after they scored baskets took seconds off the 24-second clock?  It was more difficult for you guys to get into your offense that you were talking about.</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about some of the adjustments, or if there are any, you may have to make on Chauncey Billups?  You made some adjustments in the San Antonio series on Tony Parker.  Can you talk about him and what you have to do against him in the next game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously this is the series that Karl and Gary came here for.  How difficult was it to start with a loss and neither of them got going tonight?</p>
