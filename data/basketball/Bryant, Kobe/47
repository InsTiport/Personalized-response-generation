 THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
  Q. Phil Jackson characterized this game as somewhat ragged. Would you agree with that assessment?  
 KOBE BRYANT: Yeah, it was a choppy game. It was a typical road playoff game, from my experience being in the playoffs, where a team at home gets out to a quick start and kind of maintains the lead throughout, makes big plays, and the road team's just trying to stay in the ball game.  
 You stay four, five, six points down. Just kind of chip away at it and then come and take it in the end. It was a good test for us.  
  
  Q. They got a lot of momentum winning Game 2 at your place, they're playing their first Western final home game in 24 years, the crowd is at a fever pitch. How important was it to stop that crest of momentum right away?  
 KOBE BRYANT: It was very important, particularly at the start of the game. We knew they were going to come out with a big surge, and tried to weather the storm as much as we can, and just try to stay in the ball game. Not have happen to us what happened to us against Houston, where they came out with a lot of momentum and we never recovered. We let them go on these big runs.  
 And we did a much better job just staying in the game.  
  
  Q. You're on the line, a minute left, one-point game, 18-, 20,000 fans trying to chant insults your way, did you hear that and did it lead you to feel like you are automatic?  
 KOBE BRYANT: It really helped me, to be honest with you, I swear to you, because I couldn't feel my legs one bit, not at all. And when they started chanting that, it just reminded me what we're playing for and where we're playing.  
 And it just kind of -- you gotta man up, put these in the hole because of that.  
  
  Q. You hit a 3 late over J.R. and he was right up on you. Did he get the ball as you were taking it up?  
 KOBE BRYANT: The ball?   
  
  Q. Looked like he tipped it --  
 KOBE BRYANT: That shot -- well, I would like to say I meant to do it. But, to be honest with you, the shot was going short. It was going to be well short and then he got the ball arm, whatever, and I had to put a little bit more effort into the shot. Had to kick a little bit more into it. And so it went in.  
  
  Q. Can you just describe kind of how tired you are? Is it the altitude? Is it the way they're playing defense on you? Is it just the wear and tear of the seven-game series and now this?  
 KOBE BRYANT: It's a little bit of everything. I haven't had a break for three years now, and the team's been leaning on me trying to beat me up, and I try to dish it out, too. That makes you tired as well, too. But you gotta do what you gotta do. And you need support, too, and Pau gave me the support I needed for about three straight plays.  
 I didn't have anything. I just laid on the baseline side and just tried to rest and Pau made some big shots. And bought me some time.  
  
  Q. The last play where you got fouled and did the swan dive, were you tired or were you hurt?  
 KOBE BRYANT: I was about to go to sleep.  
  
  Q. When they're jeering you and you make those shots and then you make a 3 and then you hear the silence, what is that like for you?  
 KOBE BRYANT: It's a great feeling. It's a much better feeling actually than being at home and hearing the roar of the crowd. You enjoy it a lot more, because everybody's against you.  
 And everybody's wanting you to lose, want you to fail. And when you hit a shot like that and everybody goes quiet, it feels good. It feels real good.  
  
  Q. You've been in a hell of a lot of playoff games. How do you compare that one as far as intensity, how much fun it was, besides you getting hammered, of course, every play?  
 KOBE BRYANT: I rank this right up there with some of the biggest road wins we've had, since I've been a Laker, because in the past we always had guys that had a lot of experience. Robert Horry, Rick Fox, Ron Harper, they've all been through this stuff before. For our guys this is brand-new. Last year we weren't tested like this.  
 So this means a lot. And it goes a long way for us as a ball club.  
  
  Q. And a major gut check?  
 KOBE BRYANT: Major gut check. This is what you have to do. Derek pulled the team in in the fourth quarter, pulled us all in the huddle and just reminded everybody, This is what it's about. This is a gut check. This is where you're tested. To be a champion you've got to respond.  
  
  Q. You guys have had two pivotal inbound steals in the first three games. How much do you work on such situations in practice and Trevor being the stealer and Lamar the guarder, are they kind of like specialists when you guys do that or what?  
 KOBE BRYANT: No, just worked out that way with Trevor being on Carmelo, you know they're going to go to him. And Trevor, he's very crafty. He's very crafty. He's long. He's fast. He's quick. And he's a ball hog. So he does a good job at reading those things and they are coming up the middle then going outside, faking outside and coming up the middle. It's great defensive play.  
  
  Q. George Karl has called you the best closer in the game. What's that mean to you when you hear something like that?  
 KOBE BRYANT: It's a tremendous compliment. Tremendous compliment. In the ball games, you just gotta try to make the right plays, make the right reads. And a lot of times you've got guys draped over you and you've got to make tough shots and shots you've got to make.   
 But it's a tremendous honor.  
  
  Q. The great debate continues, LeBron last night and you had a big 3 today, what would you have to say about that?  
 KOBE BRYANT: Are you serious? No, really?   
 Well, honestly, I texted him, told him it was a hell of a shot. We're all friends. Everybody tries to make it out like this big thing, but we're all friends and I told him it was a hell of a shot. And he does what he does in Cleveland. I do what I do here. But it's good banter.   
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
