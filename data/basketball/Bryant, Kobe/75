<p>	Q. Tim, can you just talk about the difference of playing with Shaq as an All-Star and then playing against him? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about Denver as a host city and how you enjoyed your weekend. </p>
<p>	Q.  You didn't play as much in the second half.  I was curious as to your comments on that and was there something wrong or just not the situation for you to play? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kobe, you're very familiar with Allen.  Could you give your perspective on his performance tonight and what was special about it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you share with us what kind of conversations you and Shaquille had this weekend, if any? </p>
<p>	Q.  Didn't talk at all. </p>
<p>	Q.  Seemed like just before the tip I think all ten starters shook hands or patted each other except you and Shaq.  Is there a reason why? </p>

<p>	Q.  Just talk about the fourth quarter and you guys got kind of within reach but it kind of just, latter half, you couldn't get anything to fall. </p>
<p>	Q.  How was this weekend for you personally, not being the focus with everybody talking about the younger generation? </p>
<p>	Q.  Any reason why this game tonight seemed so ragged and both teams -- neither team shot 50 percent and it seemed about 30 percent on jumpers? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the difference of having Shaq on your All-Star Team for every year and now he's out East, and seemed like they took advantage of having him?</p>
<p>	Q.  What happened to the goal of ten minutes and sitting down?  You played more minutes than anybody?</p>
