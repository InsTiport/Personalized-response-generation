 Q. Kobe, two things. Phil said that you guys did okay offensively attacking the zone and playing against the zone and defense was the concern tonight. Could you just talk about two things, the defensive effort on your end, and, two, their bench, especially the second quarter when they built that lead. 
 KOBE BRYANT: Our defense could have been much better, I think. You know coming up here, we lost a sense of urgency defensively. I think our concentration was focused on how to attack the zone. 
 And I think it kind of flipped our attention to detail defensively. Our focus was on the other side of the floor, which doesn't win championships. So we need to get back to ground zero when it comes to that.

 Q. In the fourth you had four shots. Was that something where your team just wasn't getting you the ball or was it defensively?
 KOBE BRYANT: We didn't lose the game because of that. We lost the game because our defense sucked.

 Q. Can you talk about the bench and were you surprised they were able to play that well in the fourth quarter?
 KOBE BRYANT: No. I mean, they have a great bench. They performed well. They've been performing well in the second half of the season for them. Channing Frye was bound to get some shots. He's a great shooter. 
 Like I said, we've got to do a much better job defensively. Paying attention to those guys, all of them, and staying in front of your man and things like that.

 Q. You speak of sense of urgency. Lost it here in Arizona. Isn't that the ritual of the home court advantage, to recapture that hunger on your home court?
 KOBE BRYANT: Yeah, we've gotta go back and play. We've gotta -- it's going to be a tough game. Looking forward to the challenge. I know my guys are. To get back to the basics of playing defense the right way.

 Q. You also had -- not to speak of just the defensive focus, there was also severe rebounding disadvantage. Were those one in the same or, again, just concentrating more on breaking the zone down?
 KOBE BRYANT: Our attention needs to be on the defensive end, period. That's second-chance opportunities. Their bench came in and gave them a big boost in getting balls back and getting them extra possessions. We've got to cut that stuff out.

 Q. Kobe, for you offensively, you were on the attack from the beginning and some of the people were wondering, was that by design or was that just what was made available to you out there?
 KOBE BRYANT: No, you know, I was more aggressive in the second quarter. Felt the game slipping away. Got going, made some shots. Kept it going. 
 But that has nothing to do with us getting to the next round. We can't -- offensively, we scored enough points. We've got to do a better job defensively, period.

 Q. What's your emotions, your feelings? Could you share any thoughts right now? Anger? Where are you with where you guys are at?
 KOBE BRYANT: Jovial. 

 Q. What?
 KOBE BRYANT: Jovial. 

 Q. How concerned are you, and are you reassured that you guys the last two years have always stepped up in these key Game 5s at home?
 KOBE BRYANT: Can't rely on that. This is not last year. Just can't rely on that. We have to play with a sense of urgency and understand this team can beat us. And we've got to be ready to play.

 Q. Do you maybe need any more help out there? Nobody had more than 15 points. You had 38. Nobody had more than three assists. You had 10. 
 KOBE BRYANT: That's not what wins championships. Everybody wants to talk about the offensive side of the ball. It has nothing to do with it. Gotta defend.

 Q. You talk about the difference between your offense and defense and focusing on defense. Is there something to be said for the transition that comes from a missed shot on offensive possession going into defense, or do you just have to snap back into the two different sides of the ball?
 KOBE BRYANT: It has something to do with it. But when the shot goes up and it's missed, be it a good shot or a bad shot, you gotta get your ass back.
