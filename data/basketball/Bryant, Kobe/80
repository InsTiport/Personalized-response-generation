<p>	Q.  With all that's at stake here, how do you explain what appeared to be a pretty flat effort overall? </p>
<p>	Q.  How similar is this situation to when you guys were down 2-0 to San Antonio, except for maybe the difference that Malone is injured now? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Rip's night offensively, particularly.</p>
<p>	Q.  Why was it so difficult for to you find shot opportunities for yourself tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  Normally whenever the Lakers lose a game they want to get right back out on the floor, but you have two long days before you get back on the floor.  Will this be a time for a lot of soul searching and emotional, this roller coaster will be on a downward spiral right now?</p>
<p>	Q.  There was a lot of talk after Game  2 about how the Pistons were able to bounce back.  Did any of that surprise you the way the Pistons came out right from the start?</p>
