<p>	Q.  In every series, there is that defining moment that goes for the rest of the series.  Could your shot at the end of regulation be that defining moment for the series?</p>
<p>	Q.  This team in the third quarter seemed to be pretty much in control and suddenly momentum got away from you guys again.  Could you really put your finger on what was happening out there and how Detroit was able to get back in it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Were you surprised that Richard Hamilton was not guarding you as closely as he was?  And also, what kind of adjustments did you make to their defense, given that they were double-teaming you for much of the first game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just talk about the 3-point shot and how you were able to gather your balance and hit it.</p>
<p>	Q.  Beginning of the overtime, you were running pick-and-rolls and they were not switching out.  Were you surprised they let you get so deep and did you go into a zone in your mind?</p>
<p>	Q.  But they were not switching out, they were switching out on you most of the game to take away that penetration, and all of a sudden they laid back and you were like, home. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about why you guys were so much more effective tonight with Rush and Walton on the floor and talk about Luke's game.</p>
<p>	Q.  How surprised were you that they didn't foul that last possession?  And second of all, where would this shot rank in your personal ranking of incredible important shots of your career? </p>
