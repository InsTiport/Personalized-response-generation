<p>	Q.  What is your strongest memory of playing against Rip in high school? </p>
<p>	Q.  Wasn't there also a team when you were teammates?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have memories of what it was like as a teammate or an anecdote about being roommates?</p>
<p>	Q.  Phil was just in here talking about this being the last chance for this group, and it's been talked about and he harped on it a couple of weeks ago when you were down to the Spurs, talking about the uncertain future of this team, how much have you guys talked about this, and you're a part of this yourself about whether this might be the last time we see this group in the venue in the Finals, do you talk about it at all, think about it at all, look around a little bit?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you see this the same way, that this is the last run of this group?</p>
<p>	Q.  How have you been able to take the distractions that have been well documented and turn it into a motivation for you to get to this level, back to the Finals?</p>
<p>	Q.  There's a general feeling that if you guard Hamilton as the game wears on, you'll get tired and it might affect your shots offensively, do you have any concern in that regard? </p>
<p>	Q.  Again, about Richard and high school, was there a sense that he was an NBA player when you guys  --</p>
<p>	Q.  If the Pistons  --</p>
<p>	Q.  If they indeed don't employ hack-a-Shaq, how much of a plus would that be for you all? </p>
<p>	Q.  What do you anticipate, how tired do you think Shaq will be with the Wallace brothers banging around and others? </p>
<p>	Q.  Of all the teams you've played in the Finals, does this team, the Pistons, present anything different and unique problem-wise for you guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  Shaq, the experts and the odds-makers said it will be an easy victory for the Lakers. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you agree with that, and if you don't agree with it, why? </p>
