<p>	Q.  How would you describe your relationship with Karl Malone and what has it meant to you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Shaq was kind of saying that he thinks it was more you guys, what you did or did not do, as to why you lost the game yesterday than Detroit taking you out of some things and just beating you guys.  Do you agree with that assessment, and if so, what you guys have done this year, you've had to lose a game to motivate you to step it up and why do you think that is? </p>
<p>	Q.  Detroit has gotten a lot of credit for their defense, how good was their defense and how do you compare it to like a San Antonio?</p>
<p>	Q.  How was Detroit allowed to set the pace of the game and how do you change things for Game  2?</p>
<p>	Q.  What else are they doing on defense?  Are they pushing you either way or are they double-teaming when you come off pick-and-roll or is it just straight-up stuff? </p>
<p>	Q.  Most of the game it looked like you guys were having trouble running a play.</p>
<p>	Q.  I know you said last night that you were looking forward to the challenge to Tayshaun, it looked like you were starting to measure them up a little bit.  I know you hit the rain-dropper on him one time, were you starting to measure them up a little bit and it seemed like there was a defensive change on you?</p>
<p>	Q.  But were you starting to feel him out a little bit? </p>
