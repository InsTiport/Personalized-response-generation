<p>	Q.  Could you talk about their defense and are you surprised at how tough they are, because there's all this talk about Eastern Conference/Western Conference and this team is coming out and really playing great defense, obviously. </p>
<p>	Q.  Is this team as mad as hell and are not going to take it anymore?</p>
<p>	Q.  You look around and you see Karl just dragging that knee brace around and Fish is limping and Devean is limping and Rick's not playing, are you guys too banged up to really push this right now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Where does the turnaround start then?  Where do you guys turn at this point?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the challenges Tayshaun Prince presents defensively with his long arms, and maybe in turn, also, like, how if you get by him, you have one of the Wallaces to score around as well?</p>
<p>	Q.  At the end of the game, you were chasing Chauncey Billups further up the floor, is that something we may see in the next game more?</p>
<p>	Q.  When Shaquille only gets two points in the second half, is that them or is it you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Are there things that you feel like you can do to get him more touches? </p>
<p>	Q.  After the game last night, Shaquille said, I guess in going to your bench, he kind of found it peculiar that maybe Bryon Russell has not been tapped, a guy with a lot of playoff experience, been to a couple of Finals.  Any thoughts on that, since Phil has gone to rookies the first couple of games?</p>
<p>	Q.  As you said, you're seeing a second defender, Shaq when he makes a move is seeing a second defender, is it in effect what you're seeing with San Antonio after the first couple of games, take care of the two main guys and see if the other two guys can beat us? </p>
<p>	Q.  To do that, giving your situations with Karl and Gary Payton?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about, you said that you've seen this defense in terms of Detroit, but have you seen kind of a blue-collar approach from anybody else?  It seemed like they bring something that maybe you guys have not seen for a complete 48 minutes? </p>
<p>	Q.  And last year you were able to roll off four straight, why are you not having the same success?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you elaborate on what you meant last night when you said you were forced to attack from 30 feet out, and is that, along with Shaq's complaints about not getting enough touches, are those signs that you guys are kind of losing faith in this offense a little bit?</p>
