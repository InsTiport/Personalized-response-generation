 Q. How much of a role are you going to play tonight?
 KOBE BRYANT: I'm not really sure yet. I'm not sure. Derek and I talked briefly about it in the back of the bus last road trip. We haven't gotten into it too much, so I'm not really sure.

 Q. And as far as your hand, what's the rehab process right now? 
 KOBE BRYANT: I do therapy nonstop, around the clock until it's ready to go. 

 Q. How many things are you doing therapy on?
 KOBE BRYANT: Just one, just my ankle. 

 Q. Will there ever be a time when you go out there this season without something taped or bandaged?
 KOBE BRYANT: No, fingers will always be taped. 

 Q. How are you going to be for the second half? You were playing hurt for such a long time. 
 KOBE BRYANT: Well, hopefully I'll be -- I'll definitely be healthier than I was the last month, so that's a plus.
