 Q.  Do you think this city deserves an NBA team? 
 KOBE BRYANT:  From what I've seen so far the response has been incredible, people supporting the All-Star Game.  I don't see why not. 

 Q.  How much more special is it for the players to have the All-Star Game here this year? 
 KOBE BRYANT:  It's fun.  It's fun.  It's the first time it's ever been in a neutral city.  So when you bring the All-Star Game to a neutral site, the energy picks up.  For us it's special to be a part of it. 

 Q.  What do you like best about All-Star Weekend? 
 KOBE BRYANT:  Just the interaction with the other players, a chance to catch up with them. 
 During the summer we get a chance to cross paths and talk a little bit.  It's always special to do it at the midpoint during the season. 

 Q.  You guys are rivals during the regular season, how hard is it to get along during the All-Star Weekend? 
 KOBE BRYANT:  We get along perfectly.  We get along extremely well.  We have a mutual respect for one another when we play.  And because of that respect we compete extremely hard against each other.  But outside of that we're all close. 

 Q.  Talk about Phil Jackson being a finalist for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame? 
 KOBE BRYANT:  It's more than deserving.  He's the greatest coach of all time, in my opinion.  Just look at his accomplishments and what he's been able to do and maximize the talent that he has on the team.  And all the records that he set.  It's actually a no-brainer.
