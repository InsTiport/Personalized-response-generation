Cleveland Cavaliers - 94
  Atlanta Hawks - 82

Q.   DeMarre, wondering how you felt physically tonight, how you felt you were able to perform on the knee and how it felt to you during the game. 
DeMARRE CARROLL:   Physically, I got out there.   So you know, I must have felt good.   You know, when you're a little kid, you dream of opportunities like this, playing in the East Conference Finals and playing against one of the best players in the world.   I didn't care if I had one leg, I wasn't going to let this pass me by. 
But at the end of the day, we went out there, and we didn't have a lot of energy.   I think that was the biggest thing. 
Give them credit.   They played great.   But it's not about me, it's about the team. 

Q.   DeMarre, LeBron's tough to guard anyway.   How much more difficult is it when he kind of changes how he's playing midgame?   It seemed like he started out attacking, and the second quarter, he switched to point forward.   Does it make it more difficult when he changes that way midstream? 
DeMARRE CARROLL:   It's always difficult to guard LeBron, but he's a physical player and a smart player.   He knew I was injured, so he came at me full force.   I would have did the same if he was injured. 
But at the end of the day, he's a great player.   He led his team to victory.   We didn't come out and do what we needed to do on our home court.

Q.   DeMarre, only 15 assists for you guys as a team today.   Is there kind of a sense within the huddles that you guys are playing a little bit more isolation ball than you had in the past? 
DeMARRE CARROLL:   Yeah, we knew that.   That's what we said at the end of the game, that we played too much isolation ball.   We didn't play our team ball, and that's what really hurt us. 
I think the biggest thing going into Game 3, we've got to look at film and get back to playing Atlanta Hawks basketball, because I think we didn't do that tonight.

Q.   You said you didn't have a lot of energy tonight as a team.   How does that happen? 
DeMARRE CARROLL:   I don't know, man.   I think we just came out flat.   How does that happen?   I don't know.   We just came out flat.   I think that's just something we've got to go back and regroup and get ready for Game 3. 

Q.   Dennis, how do you guys go to Cleveland now and keep a positive mindset? 
DENNIS SCHRÃDER:   I think we just want to go out there and compete, play as a team, and I think we didn't do that first two games at home.   I think we've got to go out there and just compete for 48 minutes and try to win the game over there.

Q.   DeMarre, I beg your pardon if you've already answered this:   How did you feel once you got out there?   You led the team in minutes.   How was the leg? 
DeMARRE CARROLL:   It was a leg.   I got out there.   We all know I wasn't 100 percent.   We all know that.   But at the end of the day, I got out there.   That was my biggest thing.

Q.   Prior to the game, I saw you taking some drills over on the practice court.   What was the decision‑making process like in that final hour? 
DeMARRE CARROLL:   The doctors, my agent, Coach Bud, they wanted to see, you know, basically, if I can get out there and I can compete.   They felt comfortable with me over there, and the doctor felt comfortable.   They told me everything‑‑ it couldn't get no worse. 
So I got out there and tried to help my team win.   It didn't happen, but, hey, like I said before, I wouldn't turn this chance down.   I wouldn't have turned this opportunity down for the world.   I would have went out there with one leg because, at the end of the day, it's about the team.   It's not about myself.   We worked too hard for me to just give up like that.

Q.   A lot of confidence has gotten this team to the No. 1 seed but to be down two games, still has to be some confidence in that locker room saying despite not playing the basketball, you guys are the better team, that you're not out to just steal one, you're going to get two on the road.   What's your mindset right now in agreeing with that?     
DeMARRE CARROLL:   We've been through a lot of obstacles this year, especially these playoffs.   To be down 0‑2, we take it as the first of four.   Coach always tells us that.   We take it one game at a time.   I think we're still confident.   Nobody is in the locker room hanging their head, but at the end of the day, we know we've just got to go out there and compete.   We haven't played Hawks basketball.   So hopefully, we can take that on the road.

Q.   Just wondering from both of you, this is not the offense we're used to seeing for 60 wins in the regular season.   Just kind of wondering what are the issues here, at least this series? 
DeMARRE CARROLL:   The issue, I think we just‑‑ you know, we got to get back to playing unselfish basketball.   I think sometimes we get down, and everybody try to take over one‑on‑one.   But at the end of the day, we know we're not moving the ball like we should.   We know we didn't play a great game.   We know we didn't play a team game.   It's just something we've got to get better at, man.   We're down 0‑2.   It's not the end of the world.   We still feel confident.   We still feel we can go to Cleveland and win.   We did in the regular season. 
We've just got to have positive energy and get back on the practice floor and get back into the film room and figure it out. 

Q.   DeMarre, defensively, you guys were able to close out and contest on some of the three‑point shots.   What do you think the difference will be when you guys go to Cleveland in order to make the adjustments you need in order to affect their three‑point shooting? 
DeMARRE CARROLL:   I think we've got to individually keep our man in front of us, especially myself.   They've got great three‑point shooters.   They try to close out that many shots, you've got to give them credit.   But at the end of the day, defense has to figure it out.   That's Coach Bud's job, and I think he'll be ready.
