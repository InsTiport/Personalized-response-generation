COACH MARSHALL:   Just disappointed in not being able to advance, especially for my seniors.   They put a lot of work and time and effort.   They're a character, class group.   And just really disappointed for them that we can't move on.   That's a pretty good basketball team we lost to tonight.   They made one more play than us.   So congratulations to them.   
   
 Q.   On that last play, what was your initial role before?   What ended up happening?   Did you look at the clock and see how much time was left and you decided to step back and take 3, didn't have enough time to get a 2 and a foul?  
GARRETT STUTZ:   My initial role was I was supposed to be the screener for a weak side fake screen for a shooter.   I was kind of the last option at the top, when VCU read the play well.   So ended up setting a ball screen, by the time I got the ball I knew there wasn't enough time to go for a two.   Couldn't have been more than two or three seconds left.  
   
 Q.   Could you take us through the first half and just looked like they got you kind of out of rhythm and uncomfortable.   What was VCU doing?  
JOE RAGLAND:   They obviously pressured the ball and the first half we didn't handle it as well as we should have.   The second half we handled it pretty well and had a chance to win the game.   
   
 Q.   It looked like they double teamed you a lot to get the ball out of your hands.   Do you expect that, is that something they've done a lot or was that a surprise?   
JOE RAGLAND:   No, I expected it just because of percentages.   And I knew they would play the percentages.   They didn't really leave me a lot when guards penetrated and stuff like that.   
But my team, they was aggressive.   We fought as hard as we could.   Me not always having the ball is somewhat not a bad thing, because we've got guys that could create.  
   
 Q.   The zone was effective, kind of helped you get back into it.   How did you get back in the second half?   
TOURE MURRY:   Just load up their offensive approach.   I think we got out to shoot, it was contested shots.   Mainly just slowed up their offense.  
   
 Q.   This is obviously, by the expressions on your players' faces, an extremely emotional loss for them.   Can you describe your emotions and are you feeling more for yourself and what you're going through or what these three kids and the rest of the guys in the locker room are feeling right now?  
COACH MARSHALL:   It's definitely more about these guys, especially the five seniors.   This is their last chance to play in the NCAA tournament.   Just to have it end ‑‑ it ends abruptly.   It's over for most of them, unless they have a pro career.   And I'm assuming most of them will.  
I'll have other opportunities and hopefully the guys that are underclassmen in the locker room will have other opportunities.   But our seniors, they're wearing the uniform for the last time, so it's more about them right now.   
   
 Q.   Just trying to find something in this game that was effective.   The zone seemed to do it and the pressure seemed to do it.   How difficult was it to find that thing that worked tonight?  
COACH MARSHALL:   Well, we had a couple runs there in the first half.   I know it was a one‑point game or two‑point game with the last media timeout.   And we didn't finish the half well.   I think they got it to 12 and we eventually started pressuring them.   I thought it worked pretty well.   Maybe I should have done it earlier.   
Tried to get the ball inside to Garrett and Carl, and I don't know what ‑‑ seemed like Carl missed more than three shots.   He was very rugged and offensive rebounded very well.   It seemed like he had a lot of shots in there that he couldn't get to go in.   And Garrett struggled a little bit with their athleticism and size.   
Yeah, they're a good basketball team.   Pretty obvious.   44 teams in the country, I guess, are better than them.   So that's hard for me to imagine.  
   
 Q.   Is it hard to prepare for that pressure and hard to simulate that in practices?  
COACH MARSHALL:   It is.   We did six players at times and then dropped one off once they got into the half court.   You've seen the Valley.   You've seen the last 18 games that we've played, other than Davidson, actually the last 21 games have been in the Valley.   And no one presses in the Valley.   We press more than anyone else, probably.   So that's kind of what you get.   You don't get a dose of that at all.   
So we tried to replicate it the last three days.   We got better at it.   I was pleased with only 12 turnovers.   12's our goal against teams that don't press.   So it wasn't that.   
But maybe just the fact once we got into the half court, especially in the first half, we had great looks.   Ben had a wide open 3 early and a couple of foul line jumpers.   David Kyles had an open look.   Just didn't make them, just did not make shots in the first half.   Whether that's their defense or our jitters or inability to knock down shots.   We've done a pretty good job of it all year, and we did a decent job in the second half.  
   
 Q.   Can you describe what you were doing defensively on Theus's final play, and what you were trying to set up on offense on your final play?  
COACH MARSHALL:   Well, we were in a match‑up zone and they were going to ball screen up top.   And somehow they rubbed us off, the other guard was spread out.   It's a match‑up zone, so it's not a perfect world.   But we try to get to the shooters.  
The big play was when Carl Hall lost Troy Daniels in the corner for a three‑pointer.   I think we had taken the lead and then he lost him in the left corner around a minute to go.   Theus made a great play, got it to go up over Stutz and it bounced around and went in.  
Then we got up the court.   We tried to run a quick.   We didn't run it very well, didn't execute it very well.   So we called timeout.   And went to a specialty play that we have to try to get some three‑point shooters around the arc and set a couple screens.   And they're not only athletic and play really hard, but they're long and they are pretty aggressive ‑‑ very aggressive.   So they did a good job on it.   
Joe couldn't turn the corner.   David was a little late using his screen to get to the left corner.   So we ended up with that shot.   Garrett had a look, it wasn't a great look, but it hit the front rim.   Looked pretty good from my vantage point, it was just a little short.  
   
 Q.   Them double teaming Joe, kind of taking the ball out of his hands, how big a factor was that?  
COACH MARSHALL:   Well, I think they double teamed a lot of people.   They generally trapped ‑‑ they do a running jump where they come off the in‑bounder, and usually that's our two guard.   He didn't have any assist tonight, which is maybe the point that you're getting at.   Normally he has a few assists, but he didn't tonight.   And that's just a credit to them and the way they play.  
   
 Q.   You had a couple of guys who really played well when you did get back in it, David Kyles and Tekele Cotton?  
COACH MARSHALL:   Yeah, they did.   Tekele Cotton in the first half played very well.   David gave us a boost making some shots, getting some deflections and steals.   So it was good.   We needed a couple more contributions from the rest of the guys, but those guys certainly played well for us.
