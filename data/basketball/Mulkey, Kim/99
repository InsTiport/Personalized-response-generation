<p>	Q.  Emily, you have another pretty good athlete in your family; was he here tonight or have you heard from him this week?</p>
<p>	Q.  Emily, how much were you feeling it tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  Sophia, does this make, to your right, does this make the move to the United States, make everything worthwhile, is this what you wanted?  What kind of player are you going to be once you actually figure out how to play the game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Sophia and Steffanie, could you talk a little bit about the confidence that Emily's early shots gave you when she hit like four three's in a row. </p>

<p>	Q.  For Steffanie, judging by the score it looked like the game plan came together perfectly for y'all.  Was it as easy as it looked out there? </p>
<p>	Q.  For Steffanie and Emily, you two might have - "struggled" might be a little strong - but maybe had the least type of performance that you were used to of anyone in the rotation.  Can you talk about how each of you had managed to stay confident throughout this to play so well tonight? </p>

<p>	Q.  Emily, do you think that you guys winning the national championship now there are a lot of teams saying, hey, it is possible, we can make it there? </p>
<p>	Q.  Steffanie and Sophia, 45-22 rebounding edge; can you talk about some of them were tipped rebounds where somebody else would get them; were y'all trying to keep the ball active sometimes?</p>

<p>	Q.  Any of y'all, been pretty business-like, we talked about that this whole time; can you celebrate, are you excited?  (All said "yeah.") </p>


<p>	Q.  The trademark of Michigan State in their tournament run has always been strong second halves.  What did you remind your players about at half-time to try and keep them from finding some momentum to get back in the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you comment on your status as the first person to win a title as a player, assistant, a head coach? </p>
<p>	Q.  The three players you had up there outscored Michigan State's bigs by 50 points and Michigan State's team by five.  When did you know that you could have that kind of success with them?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about what you were thinking the first two minutes of the game, four turnovers in the first five or six possessions; you made the very quick, very sudden two substitutions right away. </p>
<p>	Q.  You said on television after the game this is one of many to come.  You were talking about your team? </p>
<p>	Q.  Well, you're still pretty young Head Coach, you've only been at it a few years, I mean, is it hard not to look down the road and see how many you might be able to win?</p>
<p>	Q.  What are some of the primary keys to turning around a program over the course of five years; and second, after seeing what Bruce Webber wore last night did you feel like you had to come out with something flashy?</p>
<p>	Q.  Keys to building the program. </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about the rebounding edge; the fact that you had so many players involved too, LaToya I believe had six, Chameka, Chelsea.  How big was that, knowing that maybe Steffanie and Sophia couldn't get them all? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned that you are the first team men's or women's from the Big 12 to win a national title in basketball.  If someone had said Baylor would do that in 1997 when the league was formed, I think a lot of people would have thought you were crazy.  Can you just comment on it that you were the ones. </p>
