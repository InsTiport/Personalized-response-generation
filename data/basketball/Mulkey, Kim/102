<p>	Q.  Sophia, having your mother come here to watch you play, what has been her feelings about this seeing you at this stage of your life on the basketball court? </p>
<p>	Q.  Chelsea, what's caused your improvement as a back court player?  Is it that you're healthy now or that you picked up something else? </p>
<p>	Q.  I guess starting with Chelsea and maybe the other players can address it too, did you feel like back in November that you might see LSU again here, that you might both be here in the Final Four? </p>

<p>	Q.  Temeka Johnson was saying earlier sometimes it's great and sometimes it's tough having an ex-college point guard for a coach because they're such perfectionist.  You have one too.  I wonder if you could sort of talk about the pluses of having her and is she kind of a -- is she tough on you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Stephanie, after the way that game ended, the first game against LSU, was there part of you that really did want to play them again? </p>
<p>	Q.  For any of the players, we hear all the time that players dream about playing for championships, being in a Final Four; how different is the reality of being here, how different is that from what you might imagine growing up? </p>

<p>	Q.  Sophia and Stephanie, can you talk about, I know you have only been out here one time but what was the arena like and obviously it's a big open air; does that affect your shot or will you get enough time in here that you can get over that? </p>

<p>	Q.  In light of the tragedy a couple years ago, what do you guys think this making the Final Four has done to boost the morale at Baylor among not only the basketball program but maybe the school in general. </p>
<p>	Q.  Sophia, you had a rather somewhat unorthodox route to Baylor from your hometown.  I wonder if you could just talk about what you knew about Baylor, when you first heard about Baylor and maybe how Kim charmed you into coming there. </p>

<p>	Q.  Chelsea, if you could just talk about the fact that you saw LSU in person; what struck you about their talent and what you think they're biggest threat is tomorrow. </p>

<p>	Q.  Could you talk about your recruitment of Temeka Johnson when you were at Tech and are you surprised by the way she's improved and how good she is now. </p>
<p>	Q.  The way last season ended, I know what the feeling was; how long did it take you to kind of put that behind you and then regroup and start looking forward into this year? </p>
<p>	Q.  There will be a new champion this year with Connecticut having been eliminated.  But there's a chance for yourself, for Michigan State or even LSU to put kind of a new face on college basketball; do you all kind of understand that as well as just winning the championship itself?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about just how difficult it is to cover Seimone Augustus and maybe just a little bit about her versatility out there. </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about how you really don't stop Seimone but one thing you had you didn't have the first game is Abby playing a lot more.  How excited are you just to see what she might be able to do to at least slow down Seimone Augustus a little bit?</p>
<p>	Q.  Will you talk about the difference maybe you felt between being a player in the Final Four and now as a head coach in the Final Four. </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned your own Final Four experience both as a player and as an assistant Coach.  Can you talk a little bit about, is there anything you can do to prepare your kids for what they're going to experience when they step out there tomorrow night in front of 28, 29,000 people? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there any one aspect of the game that you really do not want LSU to dominate tomorrow?</p>
<p>	Q.  You're saying how excited everyone is in Waco now.  Can you take it back two years to right after the tragedy on the men's side, what it was like for the women's program and what it took during those past couple years to get to where you guys are now?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know it was early in the year, but what did you learn from the LSU game or about your team or what maybe from that game helped you the rest of the year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you think you might see them again back here?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much has the sort of off-court experience of the Final Four, than everything else, changed from your days as a player and your days as an assistant Coach to today? </p>
<p>	Q.  I apologize for asking this in advance.  This is water under the bridge I know, but could you just talk a little bit about what happened at the end of your stay at Louisiana Tech.  I know you're happy at Baylor now, but just the idea that someone with such an institution at that school, that they didn't --</p>
<p>	Q.  Labeling yourself a Louisiana girl, I'm wondering if you've given yourself -- have you thought at all about competing against your native brothers and sisters tomorrow? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about in contrast how LSU handled the deal with Pokey when their job became open.  You said the other day that there should have been no question in their mind that she should be the coach.  It seems like you really feel like they handled that the right way and making her the head coach and keeping her around. </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned recruiting Pokey, can you talk about what you saw in her as a player and if some of those same attributes have carried over to her coaching style?</p>
