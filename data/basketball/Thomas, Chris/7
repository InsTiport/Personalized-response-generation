<p>	Q.  Coach, St. John's likes to pride itself on its tough, physical defense.  Your team certainly responded with the same kind of effort to win this game. </p>
<p>	Q.  Mike, could you just talk a little bit about your philosophy coming in for Hatten and some of the things you did with him. </p>
<p>	Q.  Mike, talk about offensively in the first half.  You had eight different guys score on the first 11, 12 minutes of the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Having said that, knowing that you're going to score, do you still expect to hit 63 percent of your shots in the first half? </p>
<p>	Q.  For any of the players, after what happened the last time against when they got it down to 53-48, what was the mood of the team? </p>
<p>	Q.  Matt, after the last couple years going home early before the weekend, is it almost a sense of relief to be able to stick around for the semis and have a chance to play away into Saturday? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about your initial impressions about playing Connecticut tomorrow, Coach?</p>
<p>	Q.  As an east coast guy, Friday night is a pretty special thing.  Memories of the Big East as a kid growing up? </p>
<p>	Q.  Ryan, how much of the atmosphere, did you feed off of that?  You had a banter going with some of the fans it looked like.  How much did you feed off the atmosphere? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you plan on coming out that way, Chris? </p>
<p>	Q.  Ryan, considering you're a senior, how much of a sense of urgency do you feel to leave a final stamp in this program? </p>
<p>	Q.  Ryan, I noticed you smiling when you were standing on the line, standing next to Curtis Johnson.  When you saw the big man come in, was anyone thinking, "No, God, not again." </p>
