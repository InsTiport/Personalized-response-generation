<p>	Q.  Mike, there's a reason why these two guys were with you.  Chris was big early.  Colin came off the bench and played well for you.</p>
<p>	Q.  Were you looking to use Colin in the corner there? </p>
<p>	Q.  Colin, how did the play develop, from your perspective? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have any thoughts of the situation in your head when you're in that position at that moment? </p>
<p>	Q.  Colin, legs splayed.  It wasn't the prettiest jump. </p>
<p>	Q.  The legs were splayed? </p>

<p>	Q.  You guys, next up is Connecticut.  Obviously, you've had some success with the top teams in the country.  Can you talk about what you have to do tomorrow.</p>
<p>	Q.  Just to follow up on that, what if he doesn't play?  How does that change?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chris, can you recall the last time in a game this important that you were sitting on the bench that late in the game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mike, you talked about absorbing a punch and what you guys have been through the last several weeks.  Can you talk about sort of emotionally what you have been going through and keeping yourselves alive? </p>
<p>	Q.  Chris, as a guy who's had to hit a lot of big shots in your career, can you talk about the play Colin made that late in this building when it seemed like West Virginia had all the momentum in the world. </p>
<p>	Q.  Mike, you feel in a sense you'll be strongly discussed now with 17.  Would tomorrow night clinch it in your mind?</p>
<p>	Q.  How long were those last 11.3 seconds? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mike, how do you not get a flashback of Central Michigan in that situation? </p>
<p>	Q.  Colin, your coach has talked about how he has confidence in you.  How much of an adjustment has it been coming into college this year and having sporadic playing time and having to come off the bench and still have your shooting? </p>
