  (No. 35 Overall Selection, L.A. Clippers)

 Q. Talk about getting drafted by the Clippers?
 DeANDRE JORDAN: The Clippers is just a great organization. They have some great guys and they picked me, hoping that I fit in well, and I know they drafted Eric Gordon, so hopefully it will be a good fit for me. 

 Q. It says you're a Phoenix Suns fan; have you changed your allegiance?
 DeANDRE JORDAN: I was always a fan because of the pick-and-roll game with Steve Nash, so that was an offense that I wanted to be in. With the Clippers we'll work some things like that, and hopefully I'll fit in well. 

 Q. Obviously there was a lot of speculation about where you would go in the draft; were you surprised that you were still here in the second round?
 DeANDRE JORDAN: Yeah, I was. 
 But everything happens for a reason, and I'm just going to take this and try to make something work.
