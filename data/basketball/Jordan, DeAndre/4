 Q. Can you quickly talk about what it means to put on that jersey and represent your country?   
DeANDRE JORDAN: It's a great feeling. It's an honor. Like everybody's been saying since we were kids we've all dreamed of competing in the Olympics. With a chance to play with some of your peers who are the best basketball players on the planet, it's a really good feeling.   
   
 Q. Are you looking forward to it?   
DeANDRE JORDAN: I'm really looking forward to it. I've never been to Brazil. I've never competed in the Olympics, so all these things will be new to me, exciting, and these are some memories that I'll keep forever.
