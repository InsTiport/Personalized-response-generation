THE MODERATOR:   We're now joined by Auburn head coach, along with student‑athlete Brandy Montgomery and Tra'Cee Tanner. 
Coach, begin with an opening statement. 
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY:   I thought our players came out and started the game exactly how we wanted them to start, and that's playing defense.   That's been key for us the last couple of games.   Then not only playing defense, but converting some of those turnovers into points for us as well. 
THE MODERATOR:   Questions. 

Q.   Can you elaborate on the start, what you wanted to do. 
TRA'CEE TANNER:   We definitely talked about keeping them from getting open threes.   Our defense is set into only allowing them to get contested threes off so we could irritate them a little bit. 
I think we did a really good job of limiting their three‑points.   We just amped up the pressure a lot on defense.   We weren't holding back because we have nothing to hold back for. 

Q.   Brandy, do you feel you were coming into the tournament with a lot of momentum? 
BRANDY MONTGOMERY:   Yes, we definitely came in on a high and we fed off of that. 

Q.   Can you talk about your shooting day. 
BRANDY MONTGOMERY:   I honestly just haven't been thinking about it.   I just catch, shoot, no thought.   It's been working for me. 

Q.   Describe the last two weeks for you guys, where you were at two weeks ago, where you are at mentally morale‑wise now. 
TRA'CEE TANNER:   I think we did complete 360 of how we played earlier in the season.   We're a much better team than our record shows.   Better late than never.   But for it to click right before the tournament, it gives us a lot of momentum to come in, especially our young ones that have to come up and play. 
I think we have a lot of things that we have to do, but it can be done and each team is beatable. 
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY:   I think our young ladies should get all the credit.   They could have said, The season's over.   They could have quit.   But that's not what they did.   They get a lot of credit for continuing to fight, continuing to work hard.   I'm just really proud of them for doing that. 

Q.   Coach, can you speak on Brandy a little bit.   Has her getting in rhythm offensively been a boost for you?
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY:   It helps us a lot when Brandy is making shots.   Brandy is going to take shots.   It helps a lot when she makes them. 
If you look at her number, she was 7‑15.   Because Brandy is a shooter, as a volume shooter, you have to make sure you're always taking good shots.   A lot of times she was just rushing and taking bad shots.   Bad shots brings your percentage down. 
The last couple games Brandy made good shots.   Once she's in rhythm, you're not going to stop her. 

Q.   Can you look ahead to tomorrow against Texas A&M. 
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY:   It's so funny to look back at the games we played.   We went back and looked at our game against Florida the first time in January, we were awful.   Couldn't even recognize what team was out there on the floor.   We were really bad. 
Really, there was no energy.   There was no effort.   There was no hustle.   They just weren't playing very hard. 
We continue to tell them again, That's not the team we are.   They rediscovered who they want to be.   That's what we want to continue to do. 

Q.   Did the weather affect your travel plans at all?   Did you try to get here early? 
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY:   No.   When you play the first round, you come very early (laughter). 
THE MODERATOR:   Ladies, thank you very much.
