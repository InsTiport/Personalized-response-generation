Q.   Can you just talk about last night and the heat talk and LeBron and the cramp, which has become the big story.   Now that you've had a chance to digest last night, your thoughts, especially the fourth quarter? 
    BORIS DIAW:   It was basketball game.   I don't know how big the story got, but it was just, you know, the Finals.   Two teams playing basketball, and I know the game was hard.   I think both teams were tired but we broke through. 

Q.   Was it too hot to keep playing in there? 
    BORIS DIAW:   No, it was okay. 

Q.   (Inaudible).
    BORIS DIAW:   I've played in more heat than that before.   I played games where it was hotter, way worse.   When I go back and do basketball camps in Africa and you play outside in the sun, it's warmer than that. 
But, yeah, it's not the ideal condition to play Finals.   But it was hard for both teams. 

Q.   Any lingering effects, Boris?   Is your body feeling different today? 
    BORIS DIAW:   Not necessarily today but definitely yesterday more tired than you are usually because you are more dehydrated.
