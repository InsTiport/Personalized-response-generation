 Q. You weren't really billed as a shooter per se, reading scouting reports and whatnot, but you've shot the ball very well. Is that something that you really, really put a lot of effort into over the last season or so? 
 OMRI CASSIPI: I mean, that's who I am. Obviously coming from a different country, maybe you people didn't know more about me because you don't get to see as much as you see other guys in college. I shot the ball 50 percent from three last year, and maybe not as good, but it's a pretty good percentage.

 Q. What's been the biggest adjustment playing pro ball here? Is it just more travel, more games?
 OMRI CASSIPI: A lot more games. A lot more games. Every night, night in and night out. Just to prepare myself for those games and play against the best players in the world, especially defensively, every night you've got to guard LeBron, Kobe, Carmelo, Dwyane Wade, and just to prepare yourself mentally to be ready to play.

 Q. Did you think maybe they'd bring you along a little slower?
 OMRI CASSIPI: I didn't know what to expect. Obviously it was my first year out of the country and coming into a new city, new system, new league, the best league in the world, so I didn't know what to expect. But I'm happy about the way it's going.
