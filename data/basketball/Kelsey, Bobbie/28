COACH KELSEY:   We're just very disappointed right now.   I don't know if we can really articulate the disappointment we have.   But you know, give credit to Minnesota.   They fought back and they made some big shots.   And we had a couple of mental letdowns and that kind of killed us. 
But it wasn't for lack of effort.   Michala played really well.   She battled in there all night, and just needed a little more help.
