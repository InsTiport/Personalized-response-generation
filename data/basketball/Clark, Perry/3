<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about your bench contribution today?  I mean, this is definitely got to be a big key for this game. </p>
<p>	Q.  John, when you fell down, when you were down by 10, maybe take us through what you were thinking at that point.  You hadn't scored yet at that point.  You had the next basket.  It seemed to ignite the run.  What were you thinking and did that basket get you going? </p>
<p>	Q.  Where was your head at, where was your confidence? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, the way you guys ended the season, do you feel, in a crazy kind of way, you had to prove something in the tournament? </p>
<p>	Q.  Darius, first of the three threes, it looked like you really wanted the ball.  Came around, got the rebound.  Did you feel like you really wanted the ball at that point? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much did you want the ball again? </p>
<p>	Q.  What was the strategy going into overtime? </p>
<p>	Q.  You guys were able to neutralize Sweetney for about the last nine minutes, last four minutes of regulation.  How were you able to hold him scoreless?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Marcus Barnes. </p>
<p>	Q.  In the last 30 seconds of regulation, did you not call a timeout because you trust him?  You had a timeout left.  You just let the game go. </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) Darius, did you guys feel that you had to shoot more from the outside because of the way they played such strong interior defense? </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)</p>
