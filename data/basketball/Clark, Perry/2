<p>	Q.  This is for Coach.  Darius was shut out tonight.  (Inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, despite the loss here, how does this help you prepare for the tournament coming up?  Do you get anything out of these couple of days? </p>
<p>	Q.  If you could just talk about that next to final possession where you're three points down. </p>
<p>	Q.  Just for the players, how disgusted were you there at the last five minutes of the game?  You were just allowed layups and dunks, and why did that happen?  </p>

<p>	Q.  Perry, can you talk about not playing Darius the last four minutes. </p>
<p>	Q.  For John, could you talk about going to the NCAA tournament and what you guys are going to have to do to prepare and be successful. </p>
