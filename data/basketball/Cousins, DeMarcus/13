 Q.  DeMarcus, tonight's show, fashion show or the game Sunday?  What's the most challenging?  DeMARCUS COUSINS: Probably the fashion show.  This is something I'm not really used to.  It's a new thing for me.  So hopefully it goes well.   Q.  Do you have to talk to anybody about how to walk down the runway?  DeMARCUS COUSINS: No, I'm going to be myself.   Q.  Talk to anybody about how to prepare for a fashion show?  DeMARCUS COUSINS: I don't really know anybody that's in that lane.  Like I said, hopefully it goes well.   Q.  Have these guys been treating you like a rookie?  DeMARCUS COUSINS: No, I mean, these guys I play with during the summer.  I'm reunited once again.   Q.  Not like an All-Star rookie?  DeMARCUS COUSINS: No.   Q.  You said the other night you haven't had a chance to kind of applaud the fact that you are an All-Star, with everything that was going on.  Has getting here yesterday and this stuff allowed you to start to enjoy the notion of being an All-Star?  DeMARCUS COUSINS: I mean, yes.  It finally hit me that I am.  I really didn't know what to expect.  Came in, shot off the plane and got right to bed.  It's been fun so far.   Q.  What was the moment you said where it finally hit you?  DeMARCUS COUSINS: As soon as I got off the plane.  We went straight to the media.  It was like, yeah, it's starting.   Q.  You guys got 30 games left this season.  Is this another sort of reboot for this team?  Some time to build with Karl next season?  DeMARCUS COUSINS: Yes.  I feel like it's an early training camp for us.  That's the way we can approach it.  Basically we can prepare for next season.   Q.  When you guys go through what you go through, how much soul searching is there amongst players and coaching?  You're on your third coach now.  And it's really on the players.  Players don't perform, the coach gets fired --  DeMARCUS COUSINS: Is it on the players though?   Q.  Yeah.  DeMARCUS COUSINS: I wouldn't necessarily say that.  I mean, we were a team above .500.  So I wouldn't necessarily say it's on the players.  Things happen for a reason.  A lot of things we can't control.  What we can control is our effort on the floor.   Q.  During your last run, you haven't been very happy with the team's effort.  DeMARCUS COUSINS: You have nights like that.  As a leader of my team, I suppose -- there are some games, myself included, some games we came out and didn't have great effort.  It showed on the floor.   Q.  DeMarcus, we're from Israel.  What do you have to say about our boy Omri?  DeMARCUS COUSINS: I love Omri.  Great guy, great teammate.  Hard worker.  I enjoy having him on my team.   Q.  How important is he for the team?  DeMARCUS COUSINS: Very important.  Everybody on our team is important.   Q.  Do you feel changes in the coaching position you will benefit from it?  DeMARCUS COUSINS: I think everybody will benefit from it.  Change isn't always a bad thing.   Q.  How difficult is it for you to be such a huge All-Star playing for a losing team?  DeMARCUS COUSINS: How difficult is it?  It's hard.  Nobody likes losing.  All we can do is keep working hard and try to move forward.   Q.  In the deep Western Conference, do you think the Kings can make it to the playoffs next season, the season after?  DeMARCUS COUSINS: Yeah.  I think we have the pieces to do it.  It's just about all of us coming together.   Q.  Do you think that it was fair that Coach Malone was fired?  DeMARCUS COUSINS: It doesn't really matter how I feel about it.  It happened.  All we can do is move forward from it.  It really doesn't matter how we feel about it.   Q.  How much do you know about George Karl?  DeMARCUS COUSINS: I don't know him personally, but I do know he's a great coach.  I know he's a Hall-of-Fame coach.  That right there I'm excited about that.   Q.  Have you talked to any of your teammates who have played for him?  DeMARCUS COUSINS: Reggie Evans played for him in Denver.  Reggie says he's a great coach.  He's excited, I'm excited, the team is excited.
