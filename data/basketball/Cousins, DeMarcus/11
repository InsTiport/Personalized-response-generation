 Q. I was going to ask you if there was any kind of concern going to Brazil with what's happened with Zika and all that or is it just wear bug spray and that's it?   
DEMARCUS COUSINS: Me, I feel (indiscernible) so I can't go anywhere like that. The truth is Zika's in America, so what's really the difference? It wasn't really a concern for me. I feel that I'm well protected, and I think I'll be fine.   
   
 Q. What's the most exciting thing about being part of this team?   
DEMARCUS COUSINS: Getting to wear USA across your chest. That's probably one of the biggest things ever. So I get to represent my whole entire country. I'm grateful for that opportunity and I'll take advantage of it.   
   
 Q. (No Microphone)?   
DEMARCUS COUSINS: It's a huge honor. This has been a goal of mine for a while, so it's always an exciting and great feeling to be able to wear USA across my chest. I'm grateful for the opportunity and just plan on taking advantage of it, being around some of the top talent in the league. I feel like every player always comes back better.   
It's a great environment, great learning environment. You get to play for a legendary coach. So just being around it just increases everybody's abilities and you just come back a better player.
