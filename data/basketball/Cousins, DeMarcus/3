Q. What are you cautious about the Raptors' play style?
DEMARCUS COUSINS: What am I cautious about?  They're a talented team.  Plenty of talent on the floor.  They got a threat from every position.  So that's more than enough to be worried about.
Q. How are you planning to win the Game 4?
DEMARCUS COUSINS: Play better.
Q. Where are you right now conditioning-wise?
DEMARCUS COUSINS: I don't know.
Q. Have you viewed the film from last night?  And the stats show 1-of-7 from the field.  Would you say it was about your spots or a little bit more aggressiveness?
DEMARCUS COUSINS: It's part of the game.  Some nights they don't fall.  So hopefully next game it's a better showing, get some shots to fall.
Q. What's the pressure now on the team that if you go down 1-3 going on the road?
DEMARCUS COUSINS: Come out ready to play tomorrow.  We went over our mistakes.  We're a confident group and feel like we got a great chance with Game 4.  So we'll see what happens.
Q. You probably saw the video of the fan that was courtside last night that pushed Lowry a little bit.  What's your reaction when you see something like that?
DEMARCUS COUSINS: That's unacceptable.  Just nothing around it -- it's just unacceptable.
