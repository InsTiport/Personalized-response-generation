San Diego State   63
  Air Force   56

THE MODERATOR:   We're joined by Air Force.   Coach, just some general thoughts on tonight's game. 
COACH WILLIAMS:   It's the best game we played all year.   It was great team energy, effort, focus from the tip with our scouting report, what we wanted to do.   Especially the short turnaround. 
I was proud of how they came out both halves.   It's usually been the story of us, one half better than the other.   Puts us in the hole, where we're up and can't sustain.   Good to have that team energy and focus and execution tonight.   No better place than the tournament. 
THE MODERATOR:   Questions for the student‑athletes. 

Q.   Jimi, you were able to tie the score at 50 late in the second half.   What was the confidence level when you were able to tie the score?
JIMI BLAGOWSKY:   I think at that point we knew they were going to go on runs and we were going to go on runs.   We were able to make another run back at them. 
Then we thought the focus was there, the energy was there.   Then we just, you know, couldn't get them off the boards.   They were able to make another run.   It was a little too late for us to make a final push to get back and beat 'em, so...   

Q.   If you could talk about the rebounding advantage SanDiego State had towards the end. 
JIMI BLAGOWSKY:   We knew that was going to be one of our main focuses coming in with the height disadvantage.   We did one of the best jobs we did all season in rebounding and keeping them off the boards.   Just kind of let up a little bit, couldn't get them off, couldn't push them back.   Just one of those things.   Game of inches.   Just a couple inches here and there. 

Q.   Camille, this has to be a tough season for you, not a lot of victories.   What was the mindset coming into the tournament?   Was it loose, positive? 
CAMILLE THOMPSON:   We were really positive.   Our mindset going into the tournament was 0‑0.   It was a close game, our last home game, we knew we could beat this team.   We had a very positive attitude.   We were ready to give it our all and give everything it took to win. 

Q.   Talk about defending Cierra Warren from SanDiego State?
CAMILLE THOMPSON:   We were in a sagging 2‑3 on the defensive end.   We were concentrating on her as well as other posts, packing in the zone, not letting them throw it in. 
That was basically our mindset, do everything we could, push back for her not to be able to score and take away her feet as well. 
THE MODERATOR:   We'll continue with questions for coach. 

Q.   The last few minutes, SanDiego State taking over the glass, was that something about them being more aggressive or the ball bouncing their way?
COACH WILLIAMS:   They're big and they're going to come at you.   That's part are their mindset and that's their game.   They miss a shot, they're going again.   They're very athletic. 
They went on a run, second‑chance points hurt us.   Rebound put‑back.   They're terrific athletes.   Cierra Warren is phenomenal.   All‑league player. 
Again, our kids battled, fought back.   One of our focuses was rebounding and trying to make it closer than it has been than before, try not to give up.   You know they're going to come after you, it's tournament time. 

Q.   You mentioned the battle and fight of the team.   How proud were you they were able to stick with it for all 40 minutes?
COACH WILLIAMS:   Oh, yeah, definitely proud.   I'm proud of them.   They were fun to coach all year, although it doesn't translate into wins and losses that way.   We've had different people different times of the year not with a full till of 15 players.   So who is going to show up this time? 
We're going to need our big two to score for us to be in a game.   The first half against Boise, those two didn't score.   You can imagine what our offense is going to be. 
For them to refocus, short turnaround, tournament time.   These seniors were part of the group that won the first games three years ago.   They tried to reiterate that to the freshmen that that can be done and set that legacy for them. 
It was good to see.   It was great energy, effort, focus for the 40 minutes, the two halves, what we needed to do all year, able to get Ashton Williams back on the floor after being injured.   Again, Missy Byrd trying to be another rebounding force for us. 
They didn't quit.   The energy, focus and positivity is great.   It's a great locker room that we have. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you very much.
