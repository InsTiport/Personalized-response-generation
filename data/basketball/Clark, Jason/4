CINCINNATI   72
  GEORGETOWN   70 (2 OT)

Q.   Talk about the turnovers in the second half, how they were really a critical part of this game. 
COACH THOMPSON III:   Yes, we had some very untimely turnovers at key junctures.   They got some second shots at key junctures, and I think that's why we ended upcoming in here second and they came in here first. 

Q.   Talk about the final play and how that evolved, and was that what you were looking for? 
COACH THOMPSON III:   Yeah, but I mean, we wanted‑‑ Jason dribbled off Henry, had Hollis in the corner.   They just locked in on Hollis so he couldn't move, and so both guys came with Jason, he threw it back to Henry, a shot Henry has made, so you want to get those three guys playing together, so the reading was there.   They locked in on Hollis.   Hollis didn't cut, didn't come around.   Jason came up, both guys came at him.   Threw it back to Henry for a wide‑open shot, ball didn't go in. 

Q.   Henry, I was just wondering if you could talk about your emotions, going from the high of making the shot in the first overtime to missing the second one. 
HENRY SIMS:   I mean, it would have been nice to make that last one, obviously, but the first lay‑up to put it into double overtime I think obviously felt good.   But I'd much rather have that shot at the end. 

Q.   I know this is not about individual accolades, but can you reflect on how Henry has improved over the season and how he's become a key player for you guys?
COACH THOMPSON III:   I think we've been reflecting on that all year.   He has improved.   I think I said it yesterday.   He's made a natural progression each year, and you see this year the fruits of a lot of hard work that he put in starting this summer and rededicating himself to being a good basketball player. 

Q.   What did Cincinnati do differently in the last nine minutes of the second half? 
COACH THOMPSON III:   I'm not sure.   I think that during that stretch our turnovers‑‑ we had made some poor decisions at that point, I think. 

Q.   You had a couple of front ends on one‑and‑ones that could have made the difference down the stretch.   Can you talk about how tough it is to see a game come to something like that? 
COACH THOMPSON III:   Obviously it's difficult to come here and lose, and like I said, to come here and lose when I think the key things were rebounds, turnovers, and then you put your foul shots in, and that's what's different.

Q.   Talk about Cashmere Wright's drive on the game‑winning basket.   He seemed to have a lot of room, he went right down the middle.   Can you talk about what happened there? 
COACH THOMPSON III:   He's a good player.   I think for most of the night they were trying to attack our zone with penetration, and at a key point he was able to penetrate and get to the rim.

Q.   How tough was Yancy tonight? 
COACH THOMPSON III:   Yancy is tough every night.   I mean, their team is tough every night.   Yancy hurt us, not just with the post moves, but he got some big second shots that we needed to get the defensive rebounds.   But he's a competitor.   He's been through it.   He's a very, very good player. 

Q.   Jason, can you talk a little bit about they clamped down on you pretty good there and kind of your emotions about this tournament, how you hold it in high regard and how you feel now that it's over? 
JASON CLARK:   You know, I'd rather be sitting in here talking about a win, but they did a good job, and that's a tough team.   They played hard.   You know, it doesn't just come down to me scoring.   We've got a lot of guys on this team that can score the basketball.   But like I said, I'd rather be in here talking about a win.
