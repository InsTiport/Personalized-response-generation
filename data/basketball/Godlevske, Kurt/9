COACH GODLEVSKE:   Well, we thought coming into this game that if we could do a job on Caroline and Emily Leer and force the other girls to beat us that we might have a chance.   Obviously they have a full amount of weapons and did a terrific job on shooting the basketball.   I thought Alex Louin was really good tonight. 
Really disappointed in our first half, though, effort‑wise from our girls and was happier with how we played in the second half, how we executed, and I thought Blaire was way more aggressive than she was in the first half with turning the corner.   So was Lex. 
But you've really got to tip your hat to Villanova.   They've got five kids that can really shoot it, and Harry's system is incredibly tough to defend. 

Q.   You look at tonight, and when you're missing IJ and you're missing Lauren, how much does that affect you?
COACH GODLEVSKE:   Well, I think it affects us a bunch because you can always count on IJ for 10 rebounds and 10 points almost every night, and she's someone we could have thrown it to on the inside, and also allows us to match up better defensively with them man‑to‑man, and we didn't want to play any zone.   We kind of had a scheme with it coming in.   But when Edwards got hot there in the first half, it kind of forced us to get out of it with that big hole.   But it definitely played a part in it for us because it limited us. 

Q.   You look at your first year here, and not much was expected in the preseason but you proved a lot of people wrong and this program proved a lot of people wrong.   You had a first round bye in this tournament.   How excited are you for the future?
COACH GODLEVSKE:   We're extremely excited, and that's one of the first things we just talked about in the locker room when I was addressing the younger girls, that we've done a lot, we've accomplished a lot, we've had a fantastic year in that regard, but we've got to find ways to continue to get better, and we've got a terrific recruiting class coming in, and as a coaching staff we're excited about it, to actually be setting loftier goals as we go forward.

Q.   What do you take away from this league as a whole this year?
COACH GODLEVSKE:   Oh, man, it is extremely difficult preparation‑wise every night because everybody is almost different on a different level, with Harry's system to guarding St.John's with their terrific athletes to how complicated Creighton is with their five girls that they play and with his motion offense.   Preparation‑wise and grind and the strength of the players and the athleticism and how well they're coached, you've got to be on every night or else you're going to take it on the chin.
