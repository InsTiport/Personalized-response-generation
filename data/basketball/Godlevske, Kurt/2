Creighton - 60, Butler - 51
KURT GODLEVSKE: Well, first of all, I'd just like to say congratulations to Creighton and Jim.  I thought they did a phenomenal job.  I thought their kids were really engaged.  But overall, I thought it was a really good game.  I think both teams competed.  I thought my kids really competed.  They just seemed to have a little better flow offensively and took away some things from us, from the first two meetings that made it extremely difficult offensively.
But other than that, I was proud of my kids.  I thought we battled and gave ourselves an opportunity late.
Q. Kurt, it was kind of an interesting situation with where this team stands.  What do you think makes this group worthy of the NCAA Tournament?
KURT GODLEVSKE: Well, I think, first of all, the number of wins that we have I think is the first thing that I would argue.  I think the quality of wins that we have.  When you look at that we beat Ohio State on a neutral court and they finished fifth in the Big Ten, we've got a top-15 win over Marquette, and just the whole complete body of work that I think we've done throughout the season.  The Big East, in my opinion, does not get enough credit for the quality of teams, and for us to finish third in the Big East, I think we're very deserving of being in that tournament, yes.
Q. How cool has it been to lead this turnaround for this program?
KURT GODLEVSKE: It's been an amazing feeling, but it's not something that me personally, like I take -- or relish, I guess, for me personally.  It's more of a pride thing for my kids, like to hear Michele and Tori and Whitney and Taylor talk about where they've came from and where we are now.  It's more of me like getting the glow from my kids having that positive experience.
Q. What was the missing piece for your team tonight offensively that you maybe weren't able to get into the same flow that you saw Creighton get into?
KURT GODLEVSKE: That's a great question.  I think that we just needed to have -- not having Kat through the second half of the season changed a lot of things for us, and when you're getting ready to play a game like this in a tournament setting, that's a big game for us, whether or not if we win or lose, no matter who we're playing, it's a big game for us because of the tournament ramifications overall.
Having someone that you can throw the ball to and settle you down and get a big basket for you is huge because then it gives us that fourth or sometimes even fifth person that we can do that to, and it makes us much tougher to defend.
Now, with that said, I think Shae has stepped up and had fantastic and maybe the best season she's had as a bulldog.  But those are things that we've got to continue to grow and work on as a team, especially when we get in those situations where they weren't guarding Shae, and we were running some things to kind of take advantage of that, and Creighton just did a phenomenal job of rotating and recovering.
