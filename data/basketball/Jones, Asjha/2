Q. In the one win the bench was a little bit more successful than they were in the two losses, what is the reason for that? 
 
ASJHA JONES:  The reason?  I don't know.  I don't think it's really a bench/starter thing, it's more like what we do as a team.  For me, I don't know, I guess I'm just used to people just like leaving me, totally and not really being too concerned of what I'm doing.  But I've been playing well all summer, so people have been paying me more attention.  I think I just need to play. 
 
Q.  Is Lindsay's inability to penetrate, not opening up those free shots that were there before?
 
ASJHA JONES:  Maybe.  Just the whole -- just I think we have been doing a lot of standing, or I have been doing a lot of standing.  People try to move.  We score points when we're moving around.  But when we're not, you can see we're standing around.  I don't know if it's like just more of a bench/starter thing, I don't think so.  I can come off the bench, but as long as I'm moving or whatever, then as a team we'll be a lot more successful. 
 
Q.  When you made that run in the second half yesterday, did you guys see something and make an adjustment or what?
 
ASJHA JONES:  No, I think we just got after it.  I think we just decided to, you know, like, "Let's go.  Pick it up."  People have ups and downs in a game.  It's a game of runs.  And we made ours and we just couldn't quite get over the little hump at the end. 
 
Q.  Facing elimination, do you expect to see that type of energy tomorrow?
 
ASJHA JONES:  Well, we play with energy, but sometimes we just don't do the things that we need to do to get enough points on the boards.  But no matter what, we're going to come out with energy, and we just have to play a little smarter game.
