<p>	Q.  Yesterday Brooke Wyckoff said that you guys had to do the little bitty things to win this game.  The first half you pretty much took the open shot away from them, forced nine turnovers.  Anything that you probably could have did just a little bit more to pull this thing out? </p>
<p>	Q.  You turned out to be the best offensive option for the team.  Was that by design or was that just came from the flow of the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  How long does it take you, if you can remember last year, to get over the defeat and losing in the Finals and that?</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys sort of completely took them out of their offense for the first five minutes of the first half, so what did you do there that kind of changed for the rest of the game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you comment on Ticha Penicheiro and Yolanda Griffith.  Just seemed like in the second half they kind of pulled the team together.  They came out after half time and really pulled the teammates to get this victory, to get this title?</p>
