Q.  You guys got a split in Connecticut, talk about the mindset coming into Game 3 here. 

ASJHA JONES:  I think everybody's probably feeling the same.  Every game is important for us.  It's going to come out, we're going to come out with energy and just try to play the right way, just try and get up and down the court and just see what happens.

Q.  They have only lost two games here, does it help that you were one of the two teams to beat them here?

ASJHA JONES:  No, it doesn't really matter.  All that stuff that happened in the regular season is out the window.  Right now both our games have been pretty tough and evenly matched, balanced scoring all around, but all that stuff is out the window.  Now it's just time to take care of business.

Q.  Do you think the team maybe has a little bit of an edge considering it's the second season here, your second year?

ASJHA JONES:  No, they have a lot of veterans on their team who have been around.  And they're playing with confidence.  I think that really all that is gone.  I think every game is just going to be a dogfight and we'll just see what happens at the end.
