 Q.  Is it tough for you to not be part of Sunday's game? 
 BEN GORDON:  No, I'm over it, there's always next year.  That's how I'm approaching it. 
 
 Q.  Tyrus said you're going to help him out on the slam dunk contest. 
 BEN GORDON:  Yeah, I'm waiting for him to let me know what he wants to do. 
 I don't know what kind of dunks he wants to do yet, but if I have to bounce it off the floor or throw him a lob or whatever, I'm ready. 
 
 Q.  So you're going to be kind of a prop, huh? 
 BEN GORDON:  Yeah, I'm going to be a prop (laughter).
