 BEN GORDON:  I was happy to come out here and compete with the guys.  We got the W, that was the most important thing. 
 Q.  It seemed like you kind of got the blood flowing a little bit more in the second half, they got it to four early and then you picked up play. 
 BEN GORDON:  The first half we came out, I think guys were a little nervous.  We got the kinks out after the first ten minutes or so, and it just carried over to the second half. 
 We were able to get off to a big lead and the game was pretty much over after the first five minutes.
