<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the rebounding specifically.  Talk about that, early in the game.</p>
<p>	Q.  Ben, it was a great opportunity for you tonight coming back to New York, your hometown, and really doing what you needed to, to help in supporting the fact that you didn't have Emeka in the line-up tonight. </p>
<p>	Q.  Ben, when they cut the lead to three with a couple minutes left, it seemed like you kind of turned it on a little bit, drove for that layup, then hit the three.  Was that a point where you kind of said to yourself, "Now's the time"? </p>
<p>	Q.  Ben, what do you think you learned about your club today? </p>
<p>	Q.  Ben, do you have a different mindset when they went from zone to man-to-man?  Are you more aggressive against the man? </p>
<p>	Q.  Josh, just talk about the challenge of playing without Emeka, what you felt you needed to do tonight. </p>
<p>	Q.  Charlie, do you think you had to change your game a little bit because you're filling the role of Okafor tonight? </p>
