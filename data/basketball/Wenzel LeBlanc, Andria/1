  TIM SIMMONS:   Andrea, can you give a quick synopsis about the impact that this tournament the first two days will have at Cal State Fullerton and being played at Titan gym?
ANDRIA WENZEL LeBLANC:   Well, first, our athletic director Jim Donovan just wanted to apologize for not being able to be on the call today.   He's in a meeting with our senior staff with the NCAA about the new institutional performance program. 
But to answer your question, Cal State Fullerton is obviously extremely excited to be able to partner with ESPN and work as part of the Wooden Legacy tournament.   Obviously our goal when we heard it would possibly leave Southern California was to be able to help keep the tournament in Southern California, and we're obviously very proud to be involved with this tournament. 
TIM SIMMONS:   How do you feel about having 16 to 20 hours of live TV coverage coming out of Titan gym? 
ANDRIA WENZEL LeBLANC:   Well, obviously first, we're very excited for our men's basketball program to be able to play in the tournament and compete against some of the other great teams that will be coming to Titan gym, and obviously the TV coverage will be not only beneficial for the athletic department but for the university as a whole. 
TIM SIMMONS:   And correct me if I'm wrong, just for the general public, the parking around Titan gym will be free during the Thanksgiving holidays on that Thursday and Friday? 
ANDRIA WENZEL LeBLANC:   Correct, parking on campus will be free Thursday and Friday. 
TIM SIMMONS:   Which garage would be the best one for these people for the general public to park in? 
ANDRIA WENZEL LeBLANC:   There are‑‑ the garage would be the garage on the corner of Gymnasium Drive and State College.
TIM SIMMONS:   I think we're finished with the teleconference.   We want to thank the coaches for participating along with Greg Wooden and Andrea, and if you have any questions please feel free to give me a call, Tim Simmons at 720‑244‑6580.   Thank you very much.
