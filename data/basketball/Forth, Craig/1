<p>	Q.  A lot is made about having only one day to prepare between the semis and the finals.  Your preparation would seem to be a little bit easier because it's like you're preparing for the same type of team you beat last night, whereas Kansas is getting ready for something kind of entirely different. </p>
<p>	Q.  Put a question mark. </p>
<p>	Q.  Is it easier to prepare for a team that's similar to the one you've already beaten?</p>
<p>	Q.  Speaking of playing teams from the same league, do you see any correlation, all the wins you've had over Big-12 teams this season?</p>
<p>	Q.  If you're unable to slow down Kansas' transition game  --?</p>
<p>	Q.  What other things have to happen then for you to stay in the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there a difference in coaching a team this young early in the season, at this point in the season, what you're able to do?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there any team that they're similar to, perhaps Connecticut, in terms of how quickly they get up and down the court?  Is it reasonable to assume that they will have a spurt or two, that no team that has played them is going to be able to match that for 40 minutes?</p>
<p>	Q.  Carmelo and Gerry, to follow up on what Coach was saying, he doesn't tell you you're young, but you know that from your driver's licenses. </p>
<p>	Q.  Does it worry you to play against a team led by seniors, you being a team led by freshmen, or does it make any difference? </p>

<p>	Q.  Kueth, did I get that right? </p>
<p>	Q.  How surprised are you to be sitting here, given how young the guys around you are?  If I'm not mistaken, your brother played on a Final Four team not long ago.  Have you talked to him about that? </p>


<p>	Q.  Coach Boeheim, third time you're here.  Last few times didn't go as well as you would have liked.  Does it temper the adrenaline this time knowing that you have one more to go?  Can you not get quite as excited about it on this day? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you guys think if you can win a national championship for Coach Boeheim, he'll be as happy in the future as he seems right now? </p>


<p>	Q.  You said before, winning this thing, you want to win it more for your kids than you do for yourself.  Why? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kueth, can you describe when you first saw Carmelo Anthony play what you thought. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you said the other day, talking about Carmelo, how his personality has sort of enabled him to be welcomed by his teammates, even though he's dominated the scoring.  Can you talk about what it is about his personality that is so engaging? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jim, do you believe there's something that's changed perhaps in the dynamics of college basketball that allows a team with two freshmen playing key roles to contend for a national championship? </p>

<p>	Q.  You talked earlier about playing in international competition.  Can you talk about how he's evolved as a player?</p>
<p>	Q.  He talked about your fun ride in the Dominican Republic.  Do you have some recollections of that?</p>


<p>	Q.  Roy talked about his '97 team, how hard that loss was for him, because it was a team he felt deserved to play for the national championship.  Is there a team of yours that you feel similar to? </p>
<p>	Q.  There were a couple of instances last night where, after Marquette made a 3 or made a basket, Kansas would just push the ball up the court and then score a layup or a dunk.  How do you keep that from having a psychological toll on your team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you comment on Warrick's development this season for your team.  Then looking at Keith Langford for Kansas, the kind of challenges he presents, especially to that zone defense. </p>
<p>	Q.  For a coach to be at a school as long as you have is unusual in this day and age.  Has that always been what you wanted to do?  Was there any time when you were at Syracuse that other schools came courting and you seriously considered their offer? </p>
<p>	Q.  Other than obvious success and wins, has it been difficult at all to get kids to buy into zone that often for that long?</p>
<p>	Q.  I asked Coach Williams to kind of assess your golf game.  He was very complimentary.  Could you go over the strengths and weaknesses of Roy on the golf course. </p>
<p>	Q.  On Coach Williams, he said last hour how much respect he had for you as a coach.  You both go in tomorrow night hoping to win your first.  Can you talk about your relationship a little more. </p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously the '87 game had a dramatic finish.  .  I wanted to get your memories of that.  What did you try to do to put weight on Hakim since he's been on campus?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is the experience gap between freshmen and seniors in the game today less than it used to be?  Is the reason just because of the high-level of competition these kids play now at a young age?</p>
<p>	Q.  I don't expect a deep philosophical treatise here. </p>
<p>	Q.  When you're thinking of recruiting a kid that you know is probably only going to be at your place one year, the pluses and minuses of that, fitting into your program?</p>
<p>	Q.  Isn't it a little unusual to have so many players all progress, all get better, all mature, all at the same time it seems? </p>
<p>	Q.  In looking at Kansas' transition game, who or what is the biggest reason for its success?</p>
<p>	Q.  Looking back as a kid, as a player, as a coach, the things anecdotally that impacted the NCAA tournament, the Final Four?  Are we overdoing it or does it mean as much to you, to Roy, any coach, as we think it does?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel winning the big game would validate you in any way?  What have you learned by not winning the biggest game?</p>
<p>	Q.  What have you learned by not winning the biggest game. </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about your offense and the philosophy with this collection of players?  So much is made about your defense.  You guys scored 95. </p>
<p>	Q.  Does a three-guard offense pose any particular problems for your zone? </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible). </p>
<p>	Q.  When you watch television through the years, you see that Smart shot go in the basket. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you keep it on and watch?  Was there a time, those final few seconds, that kind of got away from you at the end, would you relive those as a coach, think about what could have been in those final couple seconds or do you have to let that go eventually?</p>
<p>	Q.  How about once it went in the basket, you guys didn't get it out, shock (inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said you haven't seen any other transition offenses that compare to Kansas, they don't see the zone all that often.  Does that give either one kind of a neutralizing advantage in any way?</p>
<p>	Q.  Gerry McNamara, what was it about him that you liked when you saw him as a player?  Was he highly recruited?  How did you first come upon him?  Carmelo, is there any reason he should come back to college next year?</p>
<p>	Q.  I want to know about the Scranton story. </p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously, we find the whole idea of you and Roy going for your first championships endlessly fascinating.  When you're not playing in the Final Four, when you're just watching other coaches compete, outside of friendships, do you find yourself partial to whichever coach at the moment happens to have been going through the longest journey trying to do this?</p>
<p>	Q.  As far as Carmelo getting the 30, 40 pounds since he committed to you guys, was it his senior year, in the summer, when he showed up on campus, "This guy is a kid, now he has a man's body"?</p>
<p>	Q.  Basketball culture obviously has changed in recent years.  Colleges, though, are still pretty much in the business of educating people over a four- or five-year period.  Is the fact that coaches such as yourself and others across the country willingly and knowing you're enrolling kids who will stay for a year or two, that is a disconnect from the mission of a University?</p>
<p>	Q.  Even John Thompson said he's rooting for you. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have a feeling that the coaching fraternity is happy for you and Coach Williams this tournament?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you heard from some of your former players and assistants over the last couple weeks?  What's the level of pride in the program right now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Speaking of Derrick, where do Dwayne, Derrick and Carmelo rank in terms of importance to the program? </p>
<p>	Q.  It's become fashionable to root for a guy who has put in a lot of distinguished service but hasn't yet won the championship.  Ray Bourque with the Stanley Cup, Elway and the Super Bowl.  Have you detected a Jim Boeheim ground swell as you've come along?</p>
<p>	Q.  Roy has mentioned how maybe early in his career he got a little sucked into the notion to be a great coach, you have to win the national championship. </p>
<p>	Q.  His perspective has changed.  Have you gone through a similar process?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you read in articles or on TV people talk about Syracuse, New York, they always complain about the weather, a miserable place.  You spent your life there.  What is it about it that makes it such a great place that you want to live in?</p>
<p>	Q.  All this experience that these kids have now, the travel, the high school match games, how has it produced a different type of kid where you have to approach them to coach?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you ever seen anybody who shows as much joy and enthusiasm while he's playing as Carmelo?  What does that do for the rest of the team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Everybody asks you about '87.  What are your memories of the '96 final?  Were your feelings after that game any different?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think perceptions of you have softened over the years?  If you could step back and look at this, do you think there is a sentimental favorite between you and Roy in this deal?</p>
<p>	Q.  Especially because you're back in the Superdome, when you hear from Derrick Coleman now, Greg Monroe, does that group in '87 maybe feel connected to this season, almost a sense that you guys maybe can finish the business that they brought here? </p>
<p>	Q.  Last night you mentioned in your game preparation one of the concerns you had is trying to get your team to be loose for a big Final Four championship game.  What is your approach?</p>
<p>	Q.  In your memory, what freshmen in the Final Four on this stage have stuck in your mind?  Where would Carmelo fit with that group? </p>
