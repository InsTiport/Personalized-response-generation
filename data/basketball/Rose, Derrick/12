 Q. Did you think at all that there might be a fracture when you first landed? 
 DERRICK ROSE: At first it really hurt. I haven't landed like that since when I was in high school, so I wasn't used to that. But as soon as I shot the free throw I knew it couldn't have been a fracture or a break, so I was fine. 

 Q. (Inaudible). 
 DERRICK ROSE: I didn't know he was going to dunk. My biggest thing was just I was just going to dunk regular, then when I saw him come, I just popped the ball back even a little further. 

 Q. (Inaudible). 
 DERRICK ROSE: I didn't watch it after the game. My friends showed me on their laptops like a week later. 

 Q. (Inaudible). 
 DERRICK ROSE: I probably went to bed.
