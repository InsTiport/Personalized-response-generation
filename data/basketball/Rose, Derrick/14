 Q. State championship, national championship and now an All-Star Game. I don't think any one player has had this much success. 
 DERRICK ROSE: It is crazy when you think about it. We've done so much hard work. My dream finally came true. 

 Q. Obviously you are exhausted. You get to play tonight. What are you doing tonight? 
 DERRICK ROSE: Probably laying low. I will wake up, get here. I got no sleep last night, packing all night. I'm exhausted.

 Q. What time did you land?
 DERRICK ROSE: I landed around ten o'clock or eleven, something like that. 
 Came and checked in my room, talked to my family and went over to practice.

 Q. How much sleep did you get, seriously?
 DERRICK ROSE: None. Only four hours, the time I was on the plane.

 Q. Is this something you are going to take seriously? 
 DERRICK ROSE: Of course. We want to win. We are going to go out there and try to win.

 Q. I think the sophomores have a winning streak going. 
 DERRICK ROSE: The record is 2-7 or something like that. They have been beating us the last couple of years.
