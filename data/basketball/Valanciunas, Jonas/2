  TORONTO RAPTORS 
  
  Q. Jonas, are you going to play this season immediately for Toronto, or are you going to wait a year just to refine things overseas?   
 JONAS VALANCIUNAS: I don't know. I don't know yet because the team -- my agent goes to conversation with my team, so we don't know yet, but we trying to have opportunities to go this year.   
  
  Q. Did you expect that Cleveland might take you with the fourth pick? Had you heard that previously?   
 JONAS VALANCIUNAS: I don't know. I don't expect no team to pick me. I just wanted to get drafted the highest possible, so that's it.   
  
  Q. What part of your game do you think would translate best in the American NBA-style game?  
 JONAS VALANCIUNAS: I don't know. I have all-around game, so I would like to translate that to NBA game, my game.  
  
  Q. If you play with AndrÃ© Bargnani, your games are somewhat similar, so talk about how well you'll work together, especially with the international experience you both have?   
 JONAS VALANCIUNAS: I don't think, he's kind of like power forward guy. So maybe he has better shooting. So maybe I'm better on rebounding. I don't know. We will be good.   
  
  Q. Talk about going to Toronto, which has a very international flavor, a lot of international players, do you think that will make the transition easier?  
 JONAS VALANCIUNAS: Yes, there's a lot of Lithuanian guys there. I think will help me in the NBA, so I like this situation.
