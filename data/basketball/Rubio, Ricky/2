 Q.   You'll be playing the Rising Stars game in your first year in the NBA.   
RICKY RUBIO:   Playing over here is a dream come true.   It wasn't my best year in Europe, but we won the ATB, we won the King's Cup, and that's the most important thing when you're on a team because it's teamwork.  
   
 Q.   Was there any doubt last year when you were not getting as much playing time as you wanted, not playing as well as you wanted, that it might be tough to make a transition to the NBA?   
RICKY RUBIO:   That's helped me.   That helped me a lot to grow up as a player, to grow up as a man, to be more ready to be here, just in case I don't have the minutes that I want, try to be a better player.  
   
 Q.   Was there any doubt when you were sitting on the bench that you could play in the NBA?  
RICKY RUBIO:   No, I would say I can play here.   Obviously after playing the Olympic games, I felt ready to play here, and I worked hard to be here.
