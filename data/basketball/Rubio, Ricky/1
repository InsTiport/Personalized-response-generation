Q.   What are your thoughts on being here this weekend?
RICKY RUBIO:   I still can't believe I'm playing in the NBA.   I'm here, I'm enjoying every second.   I can't say the moment I realized ‑‑ the final we played against the U.S., I was playing good against the best players in the world.   And I wanted to try.   Actually I still can't believe that I'm here. 

Q.   Who were the people you were watching in Spain?   Some of the people that inspired you?
RICKY RUBIO:   Raul Lopez was playing from Spain in Utah, here. (Indiscernible), and he helped me when I was hurt.   He is so talented.   He was one of the best players in Spain.
