Marquette - 94, LSU - 84
THE MODERATOR: We welcome LSU to the media room.  Coach Wade and Tremont Waters, thank you for joining us.  Coach, your thoughts on tonight's game?
WILL WADE: Well, we just let them get off to a good start, let them get in rhythm.  Didn't do a very good job on 10, and that ended up, really, really, really hurting us.  So, you know, disappointing.  I thought it was a game we had an opportunity to win.  We were down 2 with 10 minutes left, and couldn't find a way to make it happen.
Q. Can you just talk about your game, 39 points, 5 steals, 4 assists?  How good did you feel out there?
TREMONT WATERS: I'm going to have to say that today my shots were just falling.  Overall I'm pleased the way I played, but I'm mad that we lost.  So I'll just leave it at that.
Q. What do you guys take out of this trip?  I know 2-1 would have been a lot better than 1-2, but what do you guys go home with?
WILL WADE: We confirmed that we can't guard anybody.  That's the number one thing we did.  We thought that going in, but we certainly confirmed that out here.  All three teams shot over 50% against us.
It was a great experience, but you've got to take advantage of the opportunities that you have, and I don't think we took advantage enough of them.
