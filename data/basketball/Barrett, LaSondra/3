Kentucky  Â– 60
  LSU - 58

 THE MODERATOR: We have LSU with us now. We'll have Coach Chancellor make an opening statement. 
 COACH CHANCELLOR: Really proud of our team today. We played awfully hard. We had to play back to back. We played some of our players 36 minutes, 35 minutes, 34 minutes. I thought they did a great job. I thought they played with all their heart, all their character, all their toughness. We just come up a little bit short today. 
 THE MODERATOR: LaSondra, your opening thoughts on the game? 
 LaSONDRA BARRETT: I mean, I thought it was a hard-fought game. Right now I really don't have any words to say. It hurts to lose. You go out and play your hardest, keep coming up short. 
 Just proud of how my team fought tonight. Just going to keep our heads up. 
 THE MODERATOR: Adrienne? 
 ADRIENNE WEBB: Like she said, we fought hard. It is hard to say much after a loss. We played our hardest out there. Unfortunately, we just came up short. 
 THE MODERATOR: We'll have questions for the student-athletes. 

 Q. LaSondra, you got wrapped up with the Kentucky player in the first half, did that affect you for a while? In the second half you started scoring again. Was that a reason that you were tight there for a while? 
 LaSONDRA BARRETT: Before the game, I was having back problems. I think she just aggravated it on that tangle up. 
 It had nothing to do with the second half. It was just the will to win. I was fighting a lot of injuries, playing through a lot of pain. 
 I mean, just to go out and play hard, that's part of basketball. Just being there for my team, I had to play through it. I couldn't make any excuses at the time, so, yeah. 

 Q. Adrienne, they trapped you on the baseline, you were trying to make a move. What were you trying to do when that turnover happened? 
 ADRIENNE WEBB: I was trying to advance the ball up the court, kind of relieve some pressure off our point guard. I guess I got tangled up in everybody else's feet and didn't go anywhere. 

 Q. Adrienne, when you hit that three there late to tie it up, it was a point where they could have put you away earlier, you guys came back and got a layup. Did you feel you were getting momentum at that point? 
 ADRIENNE WEBB: It kind of felt like a momentum shifter. Knocking down big shots, getting to your open players, that kind of converts to how you got to get a stop on the other end. 
 But it wasn't enough to pull out the game. 

 Q. Do you feel like you accomplished enough here to garner an NCAA berth? 
 LaSONDRA BARRETT: No question in my mind we're an NCAA team. You can lose any given day. We came out, competed hard, competed with the top team in the nation, also in the SEC. 
 With our defense, we bring it every night, I don't see any reason why we wouldn't be in the NCAA tournament. 
 ADRIENNE WEBB: I agree. Yes, we should be an NCAA tournament team. You know, playing in this tough conference, like she said, getting our wins, playing against a lot of top-tier teams this season kind of helps get us that NCAA bid. 

 Q. Will there be some worry between now and March 14th? 
 LaSONDRA BARRETT: I mean, all we can do is prepare. Whatever happens happens. But we just gonna continue practicing like we are an NCAA team, hoping for the best. But right now, like I said, we bounced back from that loss and all we can do is hope for an NCAA tournament bid. 
 I think we're likely to get in. That's just my opinion. I don't know. We deserve it. 
 THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much. We'll continue with questions for Coach Chancellor. 

 Q. Coach, in the first half, Kentucky had foul trouble. They committed 13 fouls. Victoria was on the bench. Did you feel there was an opportunity for you to put more daylight between you and them at that point? 
 COACH CHANCELLOR: We opened up the game up there, we couldn't get anything going for the whole game. This game we opened up the first half and we got about three or four easy little basket shots. We got free throws. Uncharacteristically of us, we were 6 for 15. 
 I thought in the first half, we had an opportunity to open up a 9-, 10-, 11-point lead and couldn't. That was also a factor in the game when we couldn't make that happen. We opened up the second half with a play we called. We run a little out-of-bounds play to open up the second half, got a wide-open layup, couldn't make it. 
 Those are the kinds of things in a game of this nature, plus free throws. They had second-chance points. We had been a really good rebounding basketball team. We had not given up much of that. 

 Q. What were you trying to do on the last play?
 COACH CHANCELLOR: We tried to run a little play, get the ball to [] booing begin. They did a good job of denying her the ball. It's hard with the way Kentucky plays to get a good shot. We still got a 12-footer for the shot. It wasn't a bad shot that we got. It was contested, but it was still a shot. We were trying to run a little screen across and get the ball to Boogey, but we couldn't do it. 
 THE MODERATOR: Coach, who is Boogey for those who don't know? 
 COACH CHANCELLOR: LaSondra Barrett. 

 Q. I know the players were asked about this. But your own opinion, coaching in what arguably is the toughest conference, do you think you deserve to get in the NCAA? 
 COACH CHANCELLOR: Well, if Kentucky deserves to go, we deserve to go. We played them twice, went to two points both time. If there are 64 better teams than LSU right now, I'd like to find them. I don't have any doubt in my mind. I mean, we had a chance today. We were down 8 points, had a chance to get beat 15 or 20, and we didn't. We played back to back. We played them big minutes tonight. We played 36 minutes, 35 minutes, 34 minutes. We could have gotten beat there. We were just one play away. 
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach. 
 COACH CHANCELLOR: Thank you.
