THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement?   
MARK FEW: No, let's just go with questions.   
 Q.  Florida State goes pretty deep in their rotation even during the NCAAs, maybe going 10 deep.  How much more difficult does that make your task as far as game planning for them?  
MARK FEW: It does make it difficult in just trying to ascertain just the sheer numbers.  Okay, this guy's strength is driving.  Of this guy's strength, he's a shooter.  This guy can do both.  This particular inside guy, left shoulder.   
Usually you have seven or eight guys to deal with, but not 11.  It's impressive that they've been able to play that many.  Usually what you see in college basketball is a tendency to kind of shrink your bench as you get farther along and deeper in the season and into the postseason.  Very, very impressive.   
 Q.  They're coming off a victory over the top seed.  What does that, just in general, tell you about this team?  
MARK FEW: Well, just watching them tells me more than being a top seed.  Physically, probably easily the most physically imposing and athletically gifted team we've faced maybe in the 20 years I've been head coach, I would say.  Just the bodies, the size, the length, and the athleticism is really impressive, and the amount of pressure they can bring, just the size and athleticism and the voracity they go to the offensive glass, and the way they drive downhill, it's impressive.   
 Q.  Sister Jean is getting a lot of publicity in this tournament.  
MARK FEW: Yeah, pretty cool.   
 Q.  But you guys have a chaplain.  How does he interact, and what does he do to help your guys?  
MARK FEW: He's a great guy and he's always around.  He's not quite, probably, as active or as involved as she is.  But our guys have access to many different spiritual mentors and even collectively.  I mean, we pray at the end of every practice, and one of the players usually leads it.  We're not ashamed of that or afraid of it.  It's been a good way to bring our team together and grow as a unit.
