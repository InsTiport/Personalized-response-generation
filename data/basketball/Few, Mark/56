THE MODERATOR:   For Gonzaga, head Coach, Mark Few, Sam Dower, Przemek Karnowski and Kevin Pangos, and we will begin with an opening statement from Coach Few.   
COACH FEW:   Well, we ran into a buzz saw tonight!   That is an excellent basketball team.   They are well coached, and about as good‑‑ as good defensively certainly as we've seen in a long time.   Offensively, especially well our turnovers leading to getting their offense going they're a handful when they get out and run like that.   We got beat in pretty much every facet of the game tonight and tip our hats to them.   Hope they keep playing that well all the way through.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions for the student athletes.   
   
 Q.   Kevin, can you describe what happened with the ankle in the first half and coming back?   
KEVIN PANGOS:   You guys saw it better than I did, I didn't know what happened but it felt like it did the two other times I did it this year.   Rolled it pretty food, throbbing a lot.   I don't know how it happened, you guys probably doing, you probably saw a replay or something.   
   
 Q.   Kevin, was their speed and quickness and the way they came at you defensively greater than you'd seen all year?   
KEVIN PANGOS:   Yeah, the pace of the game was a little faster, but we also didn't do a good job, we gave them confidence to turn it over and then they got out and ran and it was a highlight real.   We didn't do ourselves any favors.   We let them feel pretty good about themselves.   But they're a good team and they did speed it up a little bit.   
   
 Q.   Sam, I wonder if you could offer any thoughts on your last game of your career at Gonzaga?   
SAM DOWER:   We just came out, they outplayed us today.   I mean, I didn't play the best today, but my teammates were there the whole time, and they picked me up, they kept looking for me.   Whatever, even though we lost, we still lost as a team.   
   
 Q.   For Przemek and for Kevin, beyond their defense how was it at the other end trying to stop them and deal with their athleticism at the offensive end?   
PRZEMEK KARNOWSKI:   Like he said, they were athletic and the key before the game was to stop them physically from offensive rebounding, and we just didn't bring it tonight.   I think they were just getting the rebounds and scoring points.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, gentlemen.   We will continue with Coach few.   
   
 Q.   Coach, the running into a buzz saw is the description you used for Wichita State as well, any similarities between the games?   
COACH FEW:   Yeah, I mean, as I told Sean afterwards that's the best team we've played, gosh, that I can remember.   I don't quite remember‑‑ we played at Buffalo against Syracuse maybe four or five years ago, so I guess I need to come up with a better term, because I mean, the Arizona team we saw tonight was as good of a team as we have faced, that I can remember.   Especially the way they played.   Just so well coached and playing like a team, very physical, extremely athletic, and, you know, they were just too much for us tonight.   
   
 Q.   Mark, going forward, I don't know if they can repeat what they did tonight, but if you're playing them is just the key, the turnovers and the quick shots not allowing them to‑‑  
COACH FEW:   Yeah, no question.   And we‑‑ you know, allowed them to, in a lot of ways, to play so great and look so great with just a ridiculous amount of turnovers, which, you know, one of the reasons we had 29 wins is we took care of the basketball this entire year.   
The other reason we had 29 wins is we're pretty smart with our shot selection, that's why we shot with a high percentage.   We got a little sped up, we tried to do too many hard things early, weren't very strong with the ball and they got out and dunked the ball and run like that and then offense becomes easy for them, which is one of the areas they struggled with this year.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about Gordon and a big guy who can move like that?   
COACH FEW:   I mean, he's a fantastic player.   The best thing about Aaron is he just plays so hard.   That's a talent in itself.   I mean, all coaches would tell you that.   He just brings it!   I remember Billy and Shaka telling me, they coached him this summer in USA basketball and what a motor he has!   Sean is putting him in all the right spots so you can find success on the offensive end and he's just so tough and plays with so much energy.   He's a handful.   
THE MODERATOR:   Any other questions?   Thank you, Coach.
