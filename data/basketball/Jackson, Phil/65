 Q. I'm sure you've heard about these little things the Celtics are going through with the travel delays yesterday and obviously their injuries. Do these things stack up going into a game like this? 
 COACH PHIL JACKSON: You know, I don't know. I really don't. We're just worried about our guys and the health of our guys right now. We hadn't thought about that. 
 But they do wear on you. These playoffs wear teams out and you go through them.

 Q. How is the health for your team?
 COACH PHIL JACKSON: It's all right. This is like a hockey report, injury report (smiling).

 Q. Upper body --
 COACH PHIL JACKSON: Upper body is good, legs are sustaining.
