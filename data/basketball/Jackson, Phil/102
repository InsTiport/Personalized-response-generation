<p>	Q.  What was it about the triangle offense that made you fall in love with it when you were helping run the Bulls' summer team in '88, and what role specifically does Kobe play in that offense? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have any feel for Karl and Derek's knees?  Any better today than yesterday and what are you going to be looking at exactly, when you talk about perhaps sort of keeping an eye on how long? </p>
<p>	Q.  Any sort of treatment today for either one of them?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've had some pretty wild variations in production from the bench during the season, and in the playoffs, and is that hard for you to  -- you want to push a button and you're just not sure what you're going to get night to night?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about the lack of familiarity with Detroit going into Game  1.  How much were you able to learn about them and what was the most significant thing you think that you absorbed from Game  1? </p>
<p>	Q.  Sunday night's Game  1 loss marked the third time that one of your clubs has dropped the opening game of the NBA Finals.  In the other two instances, the Bulls in  '91 and the Lakers in 2000, when you came on and then convincingly swept the remainder of the series.  What lessons and any preparation can you take from those two prior series and apply them or have you applied them, or if any impact that those two previous series might have on the way in which you prepare for this game? </p>
<p>	Q.  In reviewing films, what was it that you saw in your team that you didn't like?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know your stance has been to wait till the off-season to deal with next year, but apparently, Jeanie Buss was on the radio said saying your chances of coming back is at 95 percent, curious if that might reflect anything in your thinking or Dr.  Buss's thinking how do you interpret that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Anything that you draw out of that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Given the energy Kobe Bryant had to exert on Richard Hamilton, are there any changes you might make on him and what he'll do in his role in this game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Will there be changing for that reason?</p>
