<p>	Q.  Why were you dissatisfied with basketball when you retired as a player?  What or who motivated you to make coaching a career?  And what role did Red Holzman play in motivating you or inspiring you to become a coach? </p>
<p>	Q.  Where do you think Gary Payton's head is at right now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Any sense that the injuries of Derek and Karl played any role?  Obviously they both struggled a bit of late, have you seen anything going on physically with them?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are you anywhere near having to do that?</p>
<p>	Q.  One of the more puzzling things in sports for people who don't play, is understanding why a team or an individual can come out in a big game and appear flat, why does that happen on occasion? </p>
<p>	Q.  Shaq did not get a whole lot of shots after halftime, was that everybody else's negligence in throwing the ball inside or was he active enough in going for the ball or were you satisfied with how it was going?</p>
<p>	Q.  How was Detroit able to control the pace of the game and what do you do to change that for Game  2? </p>
<p>	Q.  Have you spoken to Gary Payton since last night's ballgame, because he  -- while Karl has spoken about his frustrations about last night's game, last night and today, Gary has not spoken.  Have you talked to him about how frustrated he was after last night's performances? </p>
<p>	Q.  Why do you think you had Shaquille going, you were not able to build on that?  Usually that's what you're seeking and you could put other teams away but you could not establish a good lead with Shaquille scoring inside. </p>
<p>	Q.  What problems does Chauncey Billups pose offensively and what do you have to do to limit him?</p>
<p>	Q.  How radical do you think their decision to single cover Shaq for a lot of the game was and how different was it from what you saw in the previous three series? </p>
