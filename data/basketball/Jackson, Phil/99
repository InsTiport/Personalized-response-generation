<p>	Q.  Old, great Zen master, all of the tactics that you use to get guys up, is anger one of them?  Is this a time for this team to be mad as hell? </p>
<p>	Q.  How would you rate Shaquille for jumping out on pick-and-roll, and is that in general what you guys are going to do with Billups? </p>
<p>	Q.  Late in the game you had Kobe Bryant guarding Chauncey up the court, I was wondering, is that something you would be willing to do for longer stretches just to kind of cut their offense out before it can get started? </p>
<p>	Q.  Through three games, there's been some alarming discrepancies in some of the numbers for you guys:  3-point shooting, lack of getting to the free throw line, offensive rebounds, to name a few.  How much of that is Detroit riding you guys off of what you guys want to do offensively, or is it more you guys not just being able to get into it and into a rhythm? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think sooner or later teams need the qualities that superstars bring in order to win a championship?  And if you could describe the challenge of coaching superstars? </p>
<p>	Q.  To follow-up on that, the history, the formula in the League, the NBA has always been, you need to have these kind of superstars to make this kind of play at the end of the game and whatever to win a championship.  Have things changed?  Obviously the series is far from over, but have things changed in the League that perhaps you don't need that player as desperately anymore to have success? </p>
<p>	Q.  Shaq, after the game last night, seemed to be lobbying for Bryon Russell to be playing.  Do you have any thoughts about changing lineups or different personnel? </p>
