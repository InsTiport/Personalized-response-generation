 Q. Can you discuss Andrew Bynum's situation right now and the importance of this game from a momentum standpoint, if there really is such a thing in this series. 
     PHIL JACKSON: Well, each team is trying to gain control, trying to put two wins together, obviously. This is a big game for us to win, going back there with an obvious opportunity to win two games on our home court to finish it off, and they're going to probably be trying to replicate the intensity that they played the fourth game with. 

 Q. And Andrew's situation for this game?
     PHIL JACKSON: No change since this morning. You know, he's ready to play the game and ready to go out there and perform. 

 Q. I wonder what kind of consideration, if any, was given to putting Andrew on a plane and sending him back after Friday's game -- excuse me, after Thursday's game, sit him out for Game 5 and have him ready to go for six and seven with extra days rest?
     PHIL JACKSON: Never considered it.

 Q. Was it thrown around at all in any way, shape or form?
     PHIL JACKSON: No, didn't even consider it.
