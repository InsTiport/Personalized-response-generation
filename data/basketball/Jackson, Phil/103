<p>	Q.   Could you talk about what was supposed to be run on the last play in regulation that set up Kobe's shot and how well it actually went compared to what you drew up? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you explain your decision to go with Luke both in the first half and late in the game after not playing him for two games? </p>
<p>	Q.  The way Kobe's game was going the last few minutes of regulation, what was your confidence level of getting the ball in his hands and being able to deliver in that situation? </p>
<p>	Q.  What's your thought on Larry not fouling in that situation during the dribble/hand-off exchange and why do you think Kobe is so hesitant to foul in a position down three, two points in that situation?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've seen a lot of Final games, where does this one rank as far as excitement is concerned? </p>
<p>	Q.  You have the older team, outrebounded 20-10 in the second half and you seem to get beat, loose balls one after the other.  Is energy a concern?</p>
<p>	Q.  Defensively, is there anything that you can do different to kind of slow down Chauncey Billups?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you just comment on the overall play of the Pistons' backcourt.  Rip Hamilton also got going tonight.</p>
<p>	Q.  I understand the concept of not fouling the 3 point shooter to get the four-point play, but why not foul before Kobe got the ball?  Why not foul Shaq in that situation and are you surprised they didn't?</p>
