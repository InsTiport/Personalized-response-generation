 COACH JACKSON: Well, they attacked the hoop today. And, you know, earned 42 foul shots. And that's really the game plan. We seemed to be staying home on the 3-point shooters, and Stoudemire and Lopez had the night for them.  
  
  Q. Was there anything different in their zone tonight that you saw from Games 1 and 2?   
 COACH JACKSON: It was a better zone than they played the other night. I think we figured it out in the third quarter. But we didn't figure out defensively what we had to do.  
  
  Q. You seemed to have a pretty good handle on their pick-and-roll the first two games. And this one obviously Amar'e was loose all night. Did they do anything different? Or did you not --  
 COACH JACKSON: Started slipping the picks early in the game. We decided rotation man wasn't there. Andrew was there, but he got fouls almost immediately.   
 Got them going. And then we got a little bit nervous about going because he was slipping. And then Nash started having some success getting in the lane. So we have to go back and work with that.  
  
  Q. Have you thought about holding Andrew out for a game at this point? Is that something that enters your mind, the way he's going?  
 COACH JACKSON: Yes.  
  
  Q. What are the chances that happens the next game?  
 COACH JACKSON: I don't know. I'll talk to him see what his suggestion is about it and how he feels about it. I think he was ineffective, I thought, out there. There were some things that got by him. He had one nice move in the post. Defensively I thought he was a little bit late, some of those things.  
  
  Q. Talk about the havoc Amar'e caused on his drives, his game tonight and how it affected the bigs on your side.   
 COACH JACKSON: Start that again.  
  
  Q. Talk about the havoc Amar'e caused on the basket, not only his drives but getting you guys in foul trouble?  
 COACH JACKSON: Yeah, he did.  
  
  Q. What did you think about the game he played?  
 COACH JACKSON: I said it at the start. He got 42 points. Got a lot of baskets at the hoop.  
  
  Q. (Question about technical foul)?  
 COACH JACKSON: I thought it was a 3-point play Pau had under the basket. They didn't give him the 3-point play. I didn't like that non-call on that thing.   
 After that point they'd shot 20 fouls in that half, and we hadn't had a foul shot go in. So we just wanted to get in the game.   
 I think that's the first tech of the year for me, by the way.   
  
  Q. Did you swear?  
 COACH JACKSON: No, I did not swear.  
  
  Q. Is that the same word you used in post-game interviews?  
 COACH JACKSON: I don't know that word anymore. I forgot it.  
  
  Q. (Question about lack of execution)?   
 COACH JACKSON: I thought they were unforced. I thought a lot of those turnovers were unforced. You can't take away some of the tipped balls when they try to pass interiorly to the zone.   
 You have to give them credit for those. But I think there's a lot of unforced.  
  
  Q. What was happening with Lamar tonight?  
 COACH JACKSON: I don't know. He had really a game he doesn't want to remember about. He wants to go home and forget about this one.  
  
  Q. People talk about you running your test before you go on to play. Did you have your test now?  
 COACH JACKSON: We certainly didn't come out and play the way I wanted to start a game, and we didn't finish it the way I wanted to finish the game.   
 I thought we made a good run at the end of the first quarter, poor second quarter. Really a poor second quarter. And got on track back in the third quarter and got the lead back. And just didn't finish the game the right way.   
  
  Q. (Question off microphone)?  
 COACH JACKSON: Yes, we expected a zone.  
  
  Q. (Question off microphone)?  
 COACH JACKSON: Did not shoot the ball well. 32 3-point shots. That's not really what we want to do as a basketball team. All right. Thank you.
