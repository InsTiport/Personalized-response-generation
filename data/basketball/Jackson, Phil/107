<p>	Q.  How was Malone able to practice today?</p>
<p>	Q.  Full speed the entire practice?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you have to hold anybody out today?</p>
<p>	Q.  For?</p>
<p>	Q.  Anything that's going to be a concern going into tomorrow?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are Fisher, Fox and Karl all able to do what they would normally be doing tomorrow?  Any limitations on the three of them?</p>
<p>	Q.  From what you've seen on tape from Detroit, what would you say is your biggest concern about the Pistons? </p>
<p>	Q.  The other day during the teleconferences, Larry Brown said that he was not going to employ hack-a-Shaq.  Were you surprised that he may have tipped his hand, whether truthfully or not, so early, and what are your concerns or lack of concern regarding that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Are you still concerned about transition defense?  I know the Pistons are not the quickest team in the world but is that an area they can exploit against you or does Kareem Rush help you guys in those areas?</p>
<p>	Q.  Kobe Bryant's court proceedings, you called it a situation this year.  Can you talk about how he has turned that distraction into a motivation, especially in the playoffs? </p>
<p>	Q.  Has it surprised you he has done it as well as he has? </p>
<p>	Q.  Has Ben Wallace showed you anything in the playoffs or regular season that would change the way you have defended him in the past?</p>
<p>	Q.  You have players who are here for the fourth time, you have players who are here for the first time, some who have been here but failed; is there any particular message now that you're on the verge of this or heading into this that you're trying to send to them in the next day? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've harped on it several weeks ago when you needed to as a desperation rally cry; is there any reason to bring it back at any point in the series, or is that now the known backdrop?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does it do your heart good when Larry Brown says, he's not going to indulge in hack-a-Shaq? </p>
<p>	Q.  Would you mind commenting on what Karl Malone has meant  -- what has Karl Malone meant to this team in terms of his leadership, his locker room demeanor.</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the challenge of guarding Hamilton and whether he reminds you of any players from another era, the way he works so hard.</p>
<p>	Q.  How would you compare Rasheed to the role he had in Portland?</p>
<p>	Q.  You said earlier that you talk about this as being the last chance to perform as a group, can you just be a bit more specific about that? </p>
