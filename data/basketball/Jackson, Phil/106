<p>	Q.  Given everything that's happened this season, how meaningful would it be for you to win a ring, particularly this year, and do you believe this has been the most personally difficult season you've had as an NBA coach? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you explain to me what it is, the bond between Deadheads, and do you have it with Luke (laughter)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Wondering how you would characterize the importance of Game  1. </p>
<p>	Q.  Given the injuries, new players, outside things happening, how were you able to keep this team focused on the now and dealing with today, this season? </p>
<p>	Q.  I read this morning that there was a point after you played for the Knicks that you kind of became disenchanted with the game and didn't ever think of yourself as being a coach.  Was there ever anything that you did think you would do with your life, if coaching had not happened? </p>
<p>	Q.  Given that you coached against Brown two years ago, do you notice any similarities in style between this Pistons team and the 76ers team two years ago, or is it a completely different situation with completely different personnel? </p>
