<p>	Q.  What is Karl's status at this point?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there a possibility of trying to get him a five-day rest before Sunday?  Would that be prudent to give him the time to heal or can anything be gained by that?</p>
<p>	Q.  I wanted to get your take on Larry Bird's comments about the league needing more white players. </p>
<p>	Q.  I was unclear on your answer to the call for Sunday, giving him five days to improve. </p>
<p>	Q.  You don't think he can improve enough in time? </p>
<p>	Q.  The two days versus five days?  This is more like a three-month? </p>
<p>	Q.  So have you talked to the doctors or whatever and they have said to you, he's going to look the same Sunday as he looks today? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is it pain threshold or can he permanently damage it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Karl Malone and Derek Fisher and Rick Fox, how debilitated overall is your team and have you ever gone into a Finals situation with as many injuries as this? </p>
<p>	Q.  After the great game by Luke Walton and him being a rookie, how can you anticipate, how much can you count on from him tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  Given your injury situation, is it even more imperative that you get a little more offense out of Gary in the 12- to 15-point range to offset some of your injuries?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you worked on Shaq playing the pick-and-roll differently when Chauncey rubs his man off or is it going to stay the same? </p>
<p>	Q.  As opposed to Game  1, you kept Shaq in straight through the first and second quarters, in Game  2, and it looked like he tired a little bit in the third.  Is that because of the situation of the game or you felt necessity? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you describe the difference for your club when Slava is on the floor as opposed to Karl? </p>
