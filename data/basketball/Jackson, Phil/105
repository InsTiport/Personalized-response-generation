<p>	Q.  Did the team come out too passive after the six-day layoff? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said before the series that people don't talk enough about the Pistons' offense.  What are your thoughts about that, and your team's defense tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  I know after a late-season game last year, Billups wanted to make you throw up and had good games against you this year, why do you think he's had good success against the Lakers?</p>
<p>	Q.  Looked like with you really were able to push the advantage with Shaq in the first half and it seemed to disappear a little bit in the second half, is that what the Pistons did to adjust or did you guys just stop finding him?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much of Kobe's shooting problems do you think came from chasing Hamilton as hard as he did, and were you trying to give him a break by running Kareem at him or was there a different sort of matchup you were looking at? </p>
<p>	Q.  You guys were having some problems guarding some of the matchups, was zone ever an idea or concept? </p>
<p>	Q.  We view all of your games overseas and we see that Karl Malone is an integral part of your team and he was completely negated today. </p>
