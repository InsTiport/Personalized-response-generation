  Q. The Bulls and the Nets are reaching out to see if you're interested. Any truth to that?  
 COACH JACKSON: Those channels did not reach me. I have no awareness of that at all.  
  
  Q. Would you say right now, will Lakers be your home next season?  
 COACH JACKSON: Home is where your heart is, right? (Laughter).  
  
  Q. Right now. All these rumors, distractions.   
 COACH JACKSON: I'll leave it open and just say as of now I've not made up my mind about coaching or not coaching next year. But that's all I can say, really, truthfully.  
  
  Q. You said 99 percent chance (indiscernible)?  
 COACH JACKSON: You know, I've not entertained any conversations about that right now. So I just can't imagine it. Not to say that it's beyond your wildest dreams, it never would happen. I mean, the strangest things do.   
 But it's just not part of my conscious thought right now to go down that path. Let's go down this path right now.  
  
  Q. (Question about distractions)?  
 COACH JACKSON: That's not a distraction (indiscernible).  
  
  Q. (Off Microphone)?  
 COACH JACKSON: Probabilities are great.   
  
  Q. (Off Microphone)?  
 COACH JACKSON: No. No, at all, desire to go back to Chicago and coach the Bulls.  
  
  Q. (Off Microphone)?  
 COACH JACKSON: I'd like to have a vodka with him at some point. (Laughter) he seems like a very interesting young man.   
  
  Q. (Off Microphone)?  
 COACH JACKSON: No. No. And I never lived in Brooklyn. So, you know, or Newark.  
  
  Q. You can get rid of all this if you just say I'm leaving the Lakers and (indiscernible)?  
 COACH JACKSON: I've always had problems committing. (Laughter). Let's talk about Phoenix and the Lakers right now.  
  
  Q. (Off Microphone)?  
 COACH JACKSON: No, not really I'm not. I mean, it's a distraction, I think, to other teams. And I think it's a disservice to coaches that are really, you know, seeking jobs and have an opportunity to go to those towns.  
  
  Q. Have you changed up anything (indiscernible)?  
 COACH JACKSON: Well, we looked at the options and walked through some things yesterday after we met with you guys in the afternoon.   
 We only had a couple of our starters out there on the floor anyway. So most of them are aware. But so I think we know how or what we're supposed to do. I don't think we know how to do it yet completely. But it's pretty simple. It's one of the simple exercises in offense.   
 And a lot of it requires not trying to get to the basket, but still using your penetrating dribble and making sure you occupy the defense.  
  
  Q. (Off Microphone)?  
 COACH JACKSON: Well, zone is basically either going to have a two guard format or one guard format with the front so you try to mismatch it at some level up front and you try to extend the zone so people have to play different places. So basically you want a guard having to rotate into the post area, because you keep shifting offense around.   
 When you overload, do that, you bring the centers usually out to the corners, and it drops guards down to the lane where they have to defend the lane or rebound.   
 So those are some of the aspects. But that's not the end result. The end result is moving the ball back through the zone after you do that.  
  
  Q. (Off Microphone)?  
 COACH JACKSON: Yeah, at times. They're trying to play the gaps. They did a pretty good job, I thought, of chipping balls and creating turnovers. Active hands. I thought Grant Hill was active two or three times. And steadily tipping the ball. And Stoudemire got one. So we have to be much better at passing the ball in that sequence.  
  
  Q. (Off Microphone)?  
 COACH JACKSON: Short bounce passes in the lane. But all in all, you know, that game was, what, a four-point game coming down the stretch. And it wasn't about the zone. I think it was about changing the complexity of the game and hiding some players defensively, I think, that we felt we wanted to take advantage of.  
  
  Q. First time you mentioned Pau (indiscernible)?  
 COACH JACKSON: Yes.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 COACH JACKSON: Yes. I think they understand that. We actually even put out a reward for (indiscernible). So there's rewards involved in it.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 COACH JACKSON: Well, we've asked them to. I think we have wing chested big men is what we have. So not so much made up in the chest; they shy away from it.  
  
  Q. Any thought to bring Bynum off the bench?  
 COACH JACKSON: No. He's back to being, does a disservice to (indiscernible). It's best to wait. So best off I think he starts.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 COACH JACKSON: It's just we have a minor fine pool that we reimburse these guys for various things they do.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 COACH JACKSON: I can't disclose that. That's secret business.  
  
  Q. Kobe was really loose yesterday. It's almost like he relishes challenges like this. Talk about that.   
 COACH JACKSON: I think we understand the idea that we allowed the game to change in the middle of the game. And a lot of it was foolish play on our part. I think more chagrined over watching the tapes and the edits today than there was misery. So I think guys were like: Let's get back at it as quickly as possible.   
  
  Q. (Off Microphone)?  
 COACH JACKSON: No, I really don't. I mean, I'm not aware of how you go about doing that unless you're talking about like Mark Twain stuff or Huckleberry Finn, those kind of channels rather than the river being dredged.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 COACH JACKSON: No, she does not represent me.   
  
  Q. Where is this stuff coming from? Why do you think this is coming up?  
 COACH JACKSON: I don't know. I think people get a hint or an idea and they run with it. They run with their crew.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 COACH JACKSON: It's just a hunch. I just throw it out there as a hunch.
