Pittsburgh   84
  Wake Forest ‑55

COACH BZDELIK:   Give Pittsburgh a lot of credit; they hit us right between the eyes, and we were on our heels throughout the entire game.   We had some shots early on that fell for us yesterday and didn't fall for us today.   And there was separation because of the fact we couldn't keep them off the boards, and tried a variety of defenses.   We just couldn't keep them from getting to the paint.   I think they had 27 points on lay‑ups in the first half, and we never recovered. 

Q.   Jeff, did you see the energy today that maybe you guys had yesterday and just how a bad start can have a domino effect a little bit?
COACH BZDELIK:   Yeah, we were always on our heels.   All we did was discuss rebounding, and that was the No.1 key.   And I think they had, what, three offensive rebounds in the first three or four minutes after we got stops.   I knew we'd have some match‑up problems defensively, so we went with the zone.   It was effective against Duke, and it just‑‑ we just couldn't stop them, to be honest with you. 
And then the inability to make some shots and to score, we just lost some confidence, and we've been fragile with that throughout the course of the year at times.   You got the score you got.

Q.   How do you foresee this next couple of weeks going?   Will you meet with Ron?   Will you guys talk? 
COACH BZDELIK:   I'm just going to answer questions about the game. 

Q.   Jeff, after the way you talked about Travis yesterday and how much he's meant to this program over the last four years, how disappointing is it ‑‑ or frustrating is it ‑‑ to see him go out with a game like he had tonight? 
COACH BZDELIK:   Yeah, I'm sure Travis had a lot of emotion, and you know, he had some good looks, didn't go down.   And, yeah, we have to remember these are young people that care deeply, and we went from a very emotional high last night, yesterday, to a frustrating, so to speak, day today.   They're young people who care deeply, and, hey, it's tough when you're out there and things aren't going well for you to battle through it.   Yeah, it's tough for Travis to have a game like this at this point. 

Q.   Jeff, was this Travis's and Coron's last game at Wake Forest, and would you entertain the notion of a CBI invitation? 
COACH BZDELIK:   That's for the administration.   Our only focus really was today, this game.   We had intentions to win it, and to not even think about a CBI, for example. 
Now, what the administration's feel is about that, I don't know, I haven't discussed that with anybody. 

Q.   Coach, we saw Pat Riley in attendance today.   You had a couple stops with him in your career.   Was he here as a byproduct of his friendship with you or was he here by chance? 
COACH BZDELIK:   I didn't know he was here, and I'm sad that he was here to see that.   (Smiling). 

Q.   If you had a chance to play again, would you like to play a postseason game? 
COACH BZDELIK:   We certainly don't want to go out like this. 

Q.   Coron, what made things so difficult for y'all to find shots today?   What were they doing defensively to really deny you guys good looks? 
CORON WILLIAMS:   I know from me, at times they were denying me, and when I came off screens, you know, the guys were hedging real hard, so it was tough for me to get good looks.   But Travis had a couple open looks.   He wasn't able to finish those, and that's all we can ask for is just good, open looks. 
You know, I'm not going to be able every game to come out and have as many open looks as I did yesterday, and other guys just have to step up. 

Q.   Coron, it looked like, at the end of the first half, both you and Codi were able to get to the basket a little bit.   What happened there, and why wasn't that as effective in the second half? 
CORON WILLIAMS:   Well, they had a few breakdowns, and I found myself a few gaps that I could get through, and Codi, he's great in transition, and he's a driver, and he was able to get in the lane and finish like he usually does. 
You know, we just took advantage of their breakdowns.
