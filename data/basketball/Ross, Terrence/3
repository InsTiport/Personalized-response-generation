 Q.   Were you surprised you were picked where you were that night?

 Q.   After the workouts you had a feeling you were going to go higher than people thought?  
TERRENCE ROSS:   I tried to give a lot to workouts.

TERRENCE ROSS:   Yeah, most definitely.  
   
 Q.   Why is that?

 Q.   Do you practice dunking?   How do you get ready for something like this?

 Q.   As you were a kid watching that did you say "I can do that"?
