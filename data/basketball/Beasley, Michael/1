 Q. Talk about your competitiveness with this experience, this Rookie Challenge? 
 MICHAEL BEASLEY: I don't like losing. It hurts when you lose. It is not cool when you lose. I like to be the cool guy. Cool guys don't lose. 
 I will play hard. 

 Q. Is there any MVP possibilities?
 MICHAEL BEASLEY: Definitely, definitely. 

 Q. Not as intent on the defensive end in this particular game, relax a little bit? 
 MICHAEL BEASLEY: Yeah. The coach will be watching.

 Q. How are you taking this all in so far? 
 MICHAEL BEASLEY: It's fun. Most of the rookies I have known since high school. It is always fun. It is always fun to be around people you know, and people you like.
