<p>	Q.  Can you explain what the normal rebounding drill is like, if there is such a thing as a normal rebounding drill, in a practice? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk a little bit about the excitement of getting to the Final Four, whether you guys have even been able to take a breath since Sunday? </p>
<p>	Q.  How do you keep your cool when you have a game going down to the wire?  What does Coach Izzo say and how do you guys keep your cool? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there a problem that you might have too much of a complicated play called or whatever, get caught up in the excitement? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned all the things that you've been through over the years.  How were you able to keep your confidence after having so many bad experiences? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you went to the foul line against Kentucky, did you ever have any flashbacks to what happened against Iowa? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about this team's development.  It seems as though you have gone through transformations throughout the season, and now it finally seems like everything is working for you. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you tell me something about Paul Davis that I don't know from reading his statistics, anything specific?</p>
<p>	Q.  From reading his statistics. </p>
<p>	Q.  Looking at the match-ups, it seems you're probably going to end up with Jawad Williams, who is a little bit taller than you.  How do you handle that kind of assignment?  How do you approach taking on someone bigger? </p>
<p>	Q.  Going back to the games going down to the wire, what goes on in maybe the last timeout, what goes on with the coaches and the players?  Can you take me through that a little bit. </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there kind of a pep talk that goes along with that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is that maturity that helps you block out the pressure because you have the crowd going crazy? </p>
<p>	Q.  In that same vein, when you're in that last timeout, would you prefer going in the game on defense to make the big stop in that situation or being on offense to make the big basket? </p>

<p>	Q.  For those of us who aren't familiar with the specifics, can you fill me in on the famous drive with Coach Izzo, that conversation, when it occurred and how it was important? </p>
<p>	Q.  When did this occur? </p>

<p>	Q.  Paul, how did you guys keep your confidence over all the tough stretches you went through? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little about the match-up with Sean May?  I know you have known each other since the McDonald's All-American days.  What makes him a difficult match-up?  How much do you think he's improved over the years?  What is it going to take to come out on top? </p>
<p>	Q.  Were you surprised that he went to North Carolina, being from Bloomington, Indiana? </p>
<p>	Q.  In Austin you mentioned that you grew up in a Michigan State household, but you were a UNC fan.  Could you expand on that.  Also can you tell me any times you crossed paths with Sean May? </p>
<p>	Q.  Are you kind of amazed at all the overtime games and particularly how teams, including your own, handled the pressure in the last minute or two of those games, be it regulation or overtime? </p>
<p>	Q.  Early in the first overtime the other day, you're down four.  You're just coming off that remarkable three-point shot.  You guys stayed afloat with a possession where you got three or four offensive rebounds and knocked down the three.  When you made that shot, did that cross your mind that was in any way emblematic of your program and the work ethic associated with it? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much did the tough times you went through help in the Kentucky game and in the Duke game, the close games, having been through those tough experiences before? </p>
<p>	Q.  You say the win over Kentucky boosted the confidence.  So where is the confidence level now, say, compared to what it was going into the tournament? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've obviously been heavily scrutinized by fans and people in general.  How much of that scrutiny stemmed from the fact that you committed so early through your high school career, and fans had a chance to look at you and know you were going to be a Spartan? </p>
<p>	Q.  Speaking of those close games, coaches get a lot of credit for pulling out those games, but how much is it up to the players to kind of step up in the moment and seize it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel like you're playing the best basketball of your career right now?  Could you talk about what you did in the off-season as far as improving your strength, how that changed your body and your game this year. </p>
