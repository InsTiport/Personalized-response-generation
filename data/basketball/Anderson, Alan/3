<p>	Q.  Drew Neitzel, can you tell us what went into the decision to make him a starter back in February?  Final Four is a pretty big stage for a freshman point guard.  Do you have any qualms about him? </p>
<p>	Q.  The last few years in the Final Four, we've seen where it's Juan Dixon or Okafor, how important is it to have a player like that?  Do you have somebody that could accept a role like that this weekend? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked the other day on the teleconference about savoring this one more than the other three.  I wonder if that's in part because you have a win in the Final Four or are you a different guy now than you were when you were grinding for those our three? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you assess the Davis-May match-up?  Also talk about how difficult it's been for you to pull Davis' talent out of him throughout his career? </p>
<p>	Q.  What is this team doing better than it was a month ago? </p>
<p>	Q.  What you just said about this appearance here not being about the coach, the program, the president, the university, the world, about it being about the players, have you had a talk with them since they cut down the nets about this is their ride and about enjoying the journey? </p>
<p>	Q.  You were mentioning the Sean-May match-up a moment ago.  Rashad is a pretty good scorer and can play defense.  What worries you most about him in that match-up? </p>
<p>	Q.  As you go through, there's plot lines in every Final Four.  This year you have sentiment with Illinois, Coach Williams.  You guys are a little bit of a spoiler.  Do you mind that role at all or pay any attention to it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you get the sense from your guys after what they did last weekend, beating those two teams, all the questions that were hanging over their heads, that there's some sense of a weight that's been lifted?  Do you like where you're at right now as far as being confident, yet not coming here with all the pressure? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've been involved in this business for such a long time.  As an assistant you've seen lots of kids.  Do you think as this tournament has gotten larger, the NCAA has done a good enough job in terms of funneling resources to players?  Does that maybe have to be the next frontier? </p>


<p>	Q.  Paul, did you and Sean May ever cross paths before college? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Izzo was talking about he thinks this Final Four is for you guys because of what you've been through.  Can you fill some of us in on what you have been through and what it means to be here? </p>
<p>	Q.  One of the thing that jumps out at coaches watching you play is, it seems that coach really demands a lot from the seniors to take ownership of the team out on the floor, be coaches on the floor.  Can y'all talk about that whole process, how a bigger role that might have played in you getting this far? </p>
<p>	Q.  Chris, Coach Izzo said he wanted this championship for you guys.  I was curious if part of you wants to win one for him, it would establish him as one of the few coaches with more than one title. </p>
<p>	Q.  Your team's success in the tournament coincides with Paul stepping his game up to a consistent level.  Can you discuss what he gives you when he's playing well and how much more difficult you are to beat with him at that level? </p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering if you could talk about the time, I think it was on Selection Sunday, when Coach Izzo used a sledgehammer to smash a couple videotapes of the Penn State game and the Iowa game in front of you guys.  What was the reaction of the team?  What kind of message do you think he was sending with that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Alan, you were talking about Paul bringing up his level of play.  You also were asked about seniors taking ownership of the team.  Did the seniors give him some encouragement that might have helped out along that line? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Izzo talked about sort of the three giants here, Duke, Kentucky and North Carolina.  What would it mean to you guys personally, what do you think it might mean to the Michigan State program if you're able to pull off that hat trick that no one has ever done? </p>
<p>	Q.  This will not affect you, Chris, since you're a senior.  Some of the coaches are talking about wanting the three-point line moved back in college basketball.  Considering what that shot seems to mean every year in March Madness with all the upsets, do you think it's good for the game, bad for the game, or if it's nine inches it's not going to make that much of a difference? </p>
<p>	Q.  Alan, it looks like you're going to be going up against Jawad and Marvin Williams a lot tomorrow.  What problems is that going to present to you?  Vice versa, what problems will that present to them? </p>
<p>	Q.  There's been a lot of focus on the seniors, but will you comment on the play of the underclassmen, particularly Maurice and Shannon, what that means to your prospects? </p>
