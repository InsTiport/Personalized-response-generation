<p>	Q.  Is this another example of you guys coming through with your backs against the wall? </p>
<p>	Q.  How were you able so stay so focused? </p>
<p>	Q.  Was it the defense or the foul trouble or both that held them to nine shots from the field tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the job that you guys did on Wade?  He had his points, but he worked hard for them tonight. </p>
<p>	Q.  You guys have had these situations before in the playoffs:  Down to the Nets, down to the Pacers, why do you think you have to be down before you get to come up? </p>
<p>	Q.  How was it with Rip on him tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  Before the game did you say anything in the locker room to get the team to block out the other stuff going on? </p>
