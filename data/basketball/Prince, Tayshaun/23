<p>	Q.  Tayshaun, I wanted to ask you, when you're guarding Kobe Bryant, what things are you thinking about running through your head?  And what are the keys to try to prevent him from really getting off and making spectacular dunks and that type of stuff?</p>
<p>	Q.  Don't you get tired?  I mean, you're running after Kobe the whole game, and running for the breaks and shooting 3-pointers.  What's your energy like during the game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about how dominant the starting backcourt was, Rip and Chauncey, 50 points together?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you done enough study of Kobe to know when the ball fake is coming and when he is actually shooting?  That seems to be one of the problem when people defend him.</p>
<p>	Q.  Being from L.A., did you grow up rooting for the Lakers, and what is it like playing against your hometown team?  Is there any emotional things on your part or more motivation on your part? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Jackson said maybe Kobe was having some problems with the look of the crowd and the background here at the Palace.  Have you noticed anything like that happening to opposing guards or players? </p>
