<p>	Q. It's got to be annoying to you guys, you guys had the lead in the fourth quarter both games and it slipped away.  Is it poise?</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys are known for keeping your cool.  What happened last night?</p>
<p>	Q.  The way that you played Wade last night, it seemed like to me that you gave him more room at the top of his offense than you had before, not pressuring him a lot, allowing him to see the floor maybe?</p>
