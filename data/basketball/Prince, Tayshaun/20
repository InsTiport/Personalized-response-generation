<p>	Q.  Talk about you guys coming up short but still right in the game all the way till the end.</p>
<p>	Q.  What was Wade doing differently tonight that you guys were able to have a lock-down on Monday?</p>
<p>	Q.  How hard was it for you to sit the whole second quarter when you're seeing they're getting behind and you've got the two fouls and you don't want to pick up other fouls?  If it was up to you would that be the way you played the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  It seemed like tonight as opposed to Game 1 that Dwyane ran off a lot more screens and it seemed like he had the ball in his hands a lot more instead of the point guard.  Is that accurate, and if so, what difference did that make?</p>
