  Q.  Who do you like in the dunk contest?   
 CARLOS BOOZER:  I don't know, all those guys are obviously high flyers, but I think I'm going with Gerald Green from Boston.  I think he wants to bust out on the scene.  He's probably got some tricks for us.   
 But I'm going to go like everyone else and be a fan.   
  
  Q.  What's been the biggest difference this year for you?   
 CARLOS BOOZER:  Obviously health is a big thing, but I've also improved and I think I've gotten better from year to year.  As long as you look at it like you always have something to improve on I'm going to continue to get better.
