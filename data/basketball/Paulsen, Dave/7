Saint Louis - 83, George Mason - 78
DAVE PAULSEN: We're really disappointed.  I thought defensively we really, really struggled, had a hard time guarding them the entire game.  We allowed missing some shots, especially in the first half, to have an impact on our defensive energy.  You know, and the second half, we played much better offensively.  We attacked.  We cut it -- I think we tied it at one point 46-46 and then gave up a transition three, things like that.  You've got to give a lot of credit to Bartley.  Bartley, Roby, guys not at the top of the scouting report did a great job for them and stepped up in a big way.  Got to give a lot of credit to Saint Louis.  We're disappointed for the end of the year.  We told our guys in the locker room, we're not into moral victories, but this team has grown a lot during the course of the year, and guys like Shevon and other our seniors who had to deal with a coaching change for the final year of giving everything they've had, we've improved, had some good victories.  And Shevon and his classmates I think hopefully will look back in a year or two or three or whatever it takes to say that they had a huge impact in kind of getting this program going in the direction we hope it goes.
Q. 15 rebounds, championship record.  Talk a little bit about how that affected you on the boards today, your game.
SHEVON THOMPSON: It didn't affect me much.  It's like I tell everybody that I'm just a -- I just love to rebound, so once a rebound is there, I'll just get it.
