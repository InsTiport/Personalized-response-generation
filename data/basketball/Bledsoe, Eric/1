ERIC BLEDSOE:   We are definitely making a pitch for it.   We'll try as best as we can to keep it going, try to carry over to the playoffs.  
   
 Q.   You're the team that owns LA right now?  
ERIC BLEDSOE:   Yes.   We are the team that owns LA.   LA is a great team.  
   
 Q.   What's your official height?  
ERIC BLEDSOE:   6'1".  
   
 Q.   What did you want to be when you grew up besides an NBA player?  
ERIC BLEDSOE:   What did I want to be?   Football player.  
   
 Q.   One advice for the kids?  
ERIC BLEDSOE:   Just never give up.   Keep working hard.   Don't let anybody tell you you can't do anything.   Work hard to improve your skills.  
   
 Q.   How many guys are there in the NBA you feel like can defensively try to pressure guys?  
ERIC BLEDSOE:   The other person?   
   
 Q.   How many guys in the NBA try to do that besides yourself?  
ERIC BLEDSOE:   From what I've seen is Avery Bradley.  
   
 Q.   You guys are similar in that energy and defensive aggressiveness.   
ERIC BLEDSOE:   Avery is a terrific ball defender, and he does a great job of picking up full court.   I think Avery Bradley is great.   
   
 Q.   You guys pick up guys full court or try to cause havoc.   Doing that for like the whole game, how do you feel like at the end of it.   You still have to play defense at the other end and offense.   
ERIC BLEDSOE:   At the end of the game you want to leave a game pretty tired.   You want the opponent to feel the same way.   Just by getting up and making it work the whole game, you just know it helps out getting the team going.  
   
 Q.   You don't see guys really pressure full court.   
ERIC BLEDSOE:   Because too many people don't want to play full‑court defense.  
   
 Q.   Guys don't like that?  
ERIC BLEDSOE:   Yeah.   And I like it playing the full‑court defense.  
   
 Q.   Why do you like it?  
ERIC BLEDSOE:   It just gets me going as a player.   It gets my teammates, everything, the crowd into it.   
   
 Q.   What do you most look forward to in the whole All‑Star experience?  
ERIC BLEDSOE:   Just having fun.   Just enjoying my break.   At the same time this is a competition.   But you don't want to get caught up in that type of game because we work so hard during the season, we finally get a break.   We want to just relax.
