		   ERIC BLEDSOE: I feel great. 

 Q. How special is this whole experience? 
 ERIC BLEDSOE: By far better than Birmingham, I'll tell you that much. All-Star, always dreamed about being there, especially seeing my favorite players playing. It is just a great feeling. 

 Q. Is this where you thought you would be at this point in time halfway through the season; are you where you've expected to be? 
 ERIC BLEDSOE: Oh, I think it's going to be great. Especially Blake giving highlights -- inaudible. We just are going to have a lot of fans these couple of years going forward.
