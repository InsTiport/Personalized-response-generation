THE MODERATOR:   We're joined by head coach C. Vivian Stringer and student‑athlete Kahleah Copper.   We'll go straight to questions for the student‑athlete.  
   
 Q.   Kahleah, when you were dominant in the first half, scoring 12 of your 14 points, but in the second half Northwestern stepped up their pressure and their blizzard collapsed in the key, what was different defensively that caused you to struggle on the offensive end?  
KAHLEAH COPPER:   I think they came out more aggressive but I had to do other things to get my other teammates involved and that's it.  
   
 Q.   Kahleah, as you take this game out of the equation, how has your experience in the Big Ten overall been this first season?  
KAHLEAH COPPER:   The Big Ten has been fun for me.   It's been very competitive every night.   I think we had to come in every game knowing we had to compete and I can really appreciate that from the Big Ten.  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach.  
   
 Q.   Coach, despite the loss today, do you feel comfortable that you'll have a good seed coming into the NCAA?  
COACH STRINGER:   No.   I don't know.   I don't know.   We just try to take it one game at a time.   I don't even worry about that.   I don't have a clue.  
   
 Q.   With the foul trouble in the first half, did it change your defensive game plan at all in the second half because you had a lot of players that were very close to fouling out?  
COACH STRINGER:   I think that you would know if‑‑ I think based upon the score, when we were able to take switches, you would have to know that we were very pleased with the way we were playing defense.   But it does create a problem.   It does create a problem.   And we had to take people out and when you take people out, they started to get really happy and things changed.   I liked the way we played defense, and I know that it's good.  
But definitely with the foul situation as it was, it was difficult to sustain.  
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, Coach.
