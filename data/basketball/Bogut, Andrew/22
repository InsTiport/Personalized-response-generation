<p>	Q.  For any of the players, I wonder what it was about UNLV that you felt like brought them back into the game?  Any particular turning point that got them --</p>

<p>	Q.  Can you guys talk a little bit about facing that pressure full court, and if you felt like you were bounced around and fouled a little bit, and if they were consistent with the calls?</p>
<p>	Q.  Bryant, can you talk about attacking them off the dribble ?  You guys were trying to feed the post for a big stretch at the first half, then it looked like you and Hawkins decided to go to the hoop. </p>
<p>	Q.  Andrew, can you talk about how you felt tonight and also what you think went wrong in the second half when they caught up to you almost?</p>

<p>	Q.  Could you talk a little bit about going zone late in the game and forcing those three misses?  It seemed to swing the game back to you guys. </p>
<p>	Q.  Ray, when you had all the starters, or at least four of them in the stretch, were you intending to give guys a little bit more rest?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, I want to ask you, earlier in the game you were bringing Andrew at the free throw line as supposed to yesterday when he was posting down low more.  What was your reasoning for that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ray, when we talked yesterday you were telling me that you were concerned with the fact that there were so many different ways to hurt you.  Ultimately seemed like you chose to focus on Blankson.  If that is accurate, if you did, do you feel you were successful in slowing him down enough?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about how important it was to have Justin Hawkins being active and getting to the hoop?</p>
<p>	Q.  You touched on this a bit.  Talk about the composure of your team.  You hit a lot of free throws.  You seemed to have composure after blowing the big lead. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, on that note, would you rather kind of learn some of these lessons in a game like this, especially with what you have coming up tomorrow and the next few weeks?</p>
