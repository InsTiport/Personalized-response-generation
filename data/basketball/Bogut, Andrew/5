Q. What is the priority from your side for Game 4?
ANDREW BOGUT: Try to win.
Q. How different is the dynamic of when they're starting with Jefferson instead of Love?
ANDREW BOGUT: Obviously, they're a little quicker, probably a little better defensively.  RJ's a seasoned veteran.  He's played many different roles in his career.  He's been in The Finals before.  He's played here at Golden State with us, and he's a great teammate.  It worked for them.  They obviously were fired up to come out a man short and prove they could still (inaudible).
Q. You obviously could have known hours ahead of time that was one possible way they might have gone.  But it's harder to prepare for that when you've been preparing one way the whole time.  Is it a little something that throws you off in the beginning because that wasn't what you've been playing against?  That wasn't what you prepared for?
ANDREW BOGUT: Not really.  We expected that lineup.  We were prepared for it.  That's not an excuse for us.  Throughout the Playoffs, we've changed our lineups a couple times.  We're doing different things.  They're doing different things.  It's all about adjustments on the fly at this point.  If you have to get a day off to prepare in a Finals series, you probably shouldn't be in The Finals.
