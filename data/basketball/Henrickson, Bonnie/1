COACH HENRICKSON:   Well, we got off to such a poor start offensively and the start, I mean, the half.   Scored 12 points and had good looks, had uncontested looks and didn't finish at the rim and then started to affect the other rim.   When you're going to struggle to score that much, then you've got to be able to turn somebody over and go get some layups in transition.   Then we make the nice run coming out from the locker room and then we turn it over late and into a one-possession game and same thing what we did at our place.   They did a good job of kind of pinching and we started to get some driving kick and some uncontested threes and some opportunities one-on-one inside, but certainly not enough of those.   And then they went away and just started ripping drive on us and we fouled and gave up layups.   If you look at their offensive possessions probably from the five-minute mark down, that's what it ended up being, shots at the rim and free throws, and then certainly the separations when we turn it over.

Q.   Chelsea, what was the thing in the second half, what did you guys key on to make that run, and was that a difficult thing to do after making only three baskets in the first half?
CHELSEA GARDNER:   We got a few stops on the defensive end and that's what helped us get our offensive end together.   I thought offensively we attacked and got open kicks from 3 from Terriell, Natalie and Lauren.   On the defensive end.   That's what helped us offensively.

Q.   Terriell, what was the mindset when things just aren't falling, the frustration keeps building and how do you keep that from just destroying your whole night?
TERRIEL BRADLEY:   You've got to stick with it and get after it.   My teammates uplifted me, and so did Coach Bonnie, so I just thought I have to be more aggressive coming out in the second half.

Q.   Chelsea, same question.   Again, tell me about what was going through everybody's head as the half goes on and nothing's going down?
CHELSEA GARDNER:   I thought we contained them defensively, that's how we stayed in the game, but offensively our shots wasn't falling but in the second half we picked up defensively being aggressive and attacking the basket.

Q.   Chelsea, Breanna Lewis had a huge game, especially the second half.   How difficult is she to contain inside and what was happening in there that she was able to get so many looks right at the basket?
CHELSEA GARDNER:   I thought defensively I was playing more on the top side and she started getting open looks over the top over me, but after she started going on the run, I felt that I had to get underneath her and stop her from getting open looks over the top.

Q.   Terriell, you and Lauren especially really started to get hot from the three-point line.   Talk about how you were able to do that and how you were able to post 3s there in the second.
TERRIELL BRADLEY:   I thought we just scored mostly off of baseline penetrations and just that we were wide open once we got the ball from one side to the next.   That's basically how we were open.

Q.   I don't know if that's as bad an offensive half of basketball that first half as you have seen your team play, but what do you say to them at halftime to try to get them out of that, what buttons do you push to try to make that all turn around?
COACH HENRICKSON:   Well, you get them to believe they're better than that and focus on a finish at the rim.   So you miss point blank, you're focused on something, it's not making shots.   Focus on how to make it.   Honestly, I told them we're probably lucky we're not down 30.   Shoot 13 percent, if he's in his locker room, he's saying they just shot 13 percent and we're only up 11.   I told them that.   I said that's how -- I wouldn't say that to you but that's how I would feel.   We're only up 11, they shot 13 percent.   And then again, not to let -- not let the offensive end affect your defensive end, I said we've got to win it in the 30s then win it in the 30s, I mean, if that's what it is.   But don't -- I thought -- I felt like the offensive end affected our toughness and our intensity on that defensive end, which it can't happen.   If you're not going to score, then you can't let that guy score either, the other team.

Q.   You contained them pretty well defensively with the poor start on the offense.   You were able to come out and get, like I said, hit those 3s and become hot on offense, but would you say turnovers played the biggest role tonight?
COACH HENRICKSON:   Especially, yeah, down the stretch.   Look at the numbers when that happened with 18, which is too many against the 2-3 zone, and we scored -- we turned it over too late.   Then you look at that, the turnovers and free throws unextended, and then it goes to layups.   So it's a product of turning it over and then what kind of shot is that for them, and certainly that was a dagger, and quite honestly it's been our Achilles heel on the year to just give a team extra possessions.   They get seven more shots, seven more shots than we get.   And we've not done that, we've been so much better here down the stretch and certainly frustrated that we end up in that situation again.

Q.   What does it say about your team that you were able to make that run, I think it was 11-0 to get back in the game?
COACH HENRICKSON:   Well, we've done that all year.   Honestly, we've done that all year, and we've won some and we've lost.   We were down 17 at Texas Tech, we've been down before, we've come back, but there were probably about four of those that we've not.   It ends up being a one-possession game.   Certainly I think we're that team that makes the run.   It's hard for me to believe we're that team that does that in the first half quite honestly.   I certainly believe that we're more capable of sustaining, consistently being more aggressive and attacking and being more productive.   We've done that all year so there's certainly value in that and that's a gut check and it's a character check, and certainly that's -- so we've been in that situation.   These kids aren't going to give up and let it go, that's not going to happen, that's not who they are, that's not who we are.   The frustrating part is how we get ourselves in that situation so we don't -- to me, we shouldn't be in that situation and play like that, play like that and grow those stretches where we're that confident and we're aggressive and we attack that much.

Q.   Talk about Chelsea Gardner as a player.   I mean, another double-double tonight and she's been a solid player for you all season long.   This is it for you, guys, but talk about Chelsea Gardner and how she wraps up the senior year.
COACH HENRICKSON:   Yeah, she's been a player that we've depended on all year.   In most people's scouting report Â’s defense is to try to take away some of her touches, and the work she's got to do offensively early, to work early to get position and put herself in a position where she can get a pass, whether it's a man or a zone.   Then you're at the mercy of the big, those little guys around you, they're willing to throw you the ball and get you on time, on target and get you a high percentage shot, so she's done a great job for us and her future is really, really bright at the professional level and we're excited for her about that.
