IOWA STATE   77
  KANSAS - 62

THE MODERATOR:   Your thoughts about tonight's game? 
COACH HENRICKSON:   Ended up like it was a their place, deep post‑ups and the contested threes in transition and executed and we didn't answer the run.   And tried to come out of the locker room and cut it to single digit, cut back the lead from eight to four and didn't do that.
And we didn't finish at the rim.   We thought we competed and played hard and showed some toughness, not enough.   On their end, they won the battle there.   But we tried to front and get over the top, and to do that you have to be able to press the ball and they started ripping, driving us a little bit and tried score at the rim and get to the free throw line and obviously didn't knock them down. 

Q.   Yesterday, it just seemed like it was a lot more difficult today how they defended you and playing against Brynn Williamson. 
ANGEL GOODRICH:   Well, it's just kind of like what they tried to do at their place.   They tried to box in, they tried to pin and they tried to stab and they did everything to just clog it up inside.   That's just what teams are going to do.   They are going to challenge you and make you want to kick it out and make you hit perimeter shots, so once that happens, you've got to knock them down. 

Q.   Carolyn, they are so big inside, how difficult is it to stay with that and defend so many big girls down there? 
CAROLYN DAVIS:   They have a tough front line, 6‑0, 6‑3, 6‑3, it's a challenge for our guards to guard in the post.   And that's one of our game plans, like Coach said, to get close coming in front and at times we did that and we slowed them up, and when we didn't, they capitalized on that. 

Q.   If you can both talk about Now waiting for the NCAA decision and how difficult that's going to be this next week, the pins and needles I guess you're on. 
ANGEL GOODRICH:   Well, just like Coach said, we are not so sure what's going to happen but we have got to stay positive, look forward, keep practicing and get better, because more than likely we want to still play. 
CAROLYN DAVIS:   I mean, I think she said it all.   We don't know, we think we've had some great wins, and we are kind of in the same position we were last year, we'll just have to wait and see. 

Q.   When you're making a defensive game plan, do you focus more on Poppens or Christofferson, or how do you go about approaching that in that sense?
COACH HENRICKSON:   Well, with Christofferson playing multiple positions, you have guards defending her on a post‑up, and then bigs trying to send her on the perimeter.   And with Poppens, it's just how physical she is and the pace that she plays at; we tried to front inside; we didn't do it. 
Certainly a little bit into the game, Chelsea got sat on and came in.   Which is what it was like at their place, and we tried to get around and force a tougher pass; and at times we did it and then it turned into some late line drives and opportunities at the rim. 
We thought both kids, the pace that they did play at, we have great respect for that.   And Chelsea has had a great career at Iowa State and has a lot left to do in her career.   The pace that she plays on her post and the pace that she plays on her rip and drive, great offensive rebounder, leading ‑‑ will finish her career all‑time leading offensive rebounder in Big12 play. 
She's not jumping out of the gym to do that, and I say that with great respect.   She does that by being physical and embracing that you can be a great rebounder not, you have to be at the rim.   Most of those are not up there anyway‑‑ they are guys that work to get their shots in the air. 

Q.   How much do you follow the whole NCAA bracket stuff?   Do you have an idea, a sense of whether you should be in or not?
COACH HENRICKSON:   Of course I think we should be in.   I thought the committee made a great decision last year and I thought we made them look real smart.   I think we should be.   We play the best teams in the best league in America. 
I said going in, I think what's hard is people think because we all beat each other up‑‑ we are a great league and we have one team ranked maybe two and we deserve better than that as a league.   Outside, a lot of people don't understand how good the league is and how competitive it is. 
We talked about it for the last two years, it's a one‑possession league and it's a fast league and we certainly think that if you look at our body of work that we have got quality wins and an opportunity. 
We are excited about the opportunity and certainly like you said, on pins and needles, because this tournament is a week earlier; it was only a four‑day sweat‑out last year.   This year it will be a little longer.   Angel is right, in the meantime, we have to be better and when we play again we'll be better. 

Q.   You talked about the matchup problems Christofferson   poses for you, but she seems to be on a huge roll. 
COACH HENRICKSON:   Well, she gets the two ‑‑ two threes in transition‑‑ because we are not matched up.   We are not matched up.   So the guy that's chasing her is on the other side of the floor, because that's her matchup.   And Angel is running at me, and I know Angel is not going to have Christofferson on the make, because our matchups ‑‑ they are true and we don't communicate ‑‑ and break down and make you pay.   We have two guys guarding one guy; and she's close enough to me I might have been able to get out there and knock it down probably but that probably might have looked bad on TV. 
Yeah, we don't match up but she knocks that downuncontested.   From a field goal percentage, three‑point field goal percentage she leads them‑‑ when she has someone in her face, let alone wide open. 
And then that is such a momentum play.   Watch their bench when they hit a three.   Everybody gets juiced up off of that, and that's why 10,000 people watch them play, they get excited about that.   

Q.   Nobody has really given Baylor a tough gamein the conference season‑‑
COACH HENRICKSON:   Oh, really‑‑ inaudible ‑‑ they were Tweeting that we were the only team that held them under something‑something‑‑ didn't he Tweet that‑‑

Q.   I thinkhe did‑‑
COACH HENRICKSON:   ‑‑ yeah, I think he did, ask them about it. 

Q.   This is the league showcase ‑‑ if they play like that, do you think they can give Baylor a quality game?
COACH HENRICKSON:   Well, I said it all along, when they beat them up ‑‑ inaudible ‑‑ first of the year, they made 17 threes.   I think that's what's got to happen.   I think it's got to be double‑digits threes; not that she doesn't impact that part of it, it's not like she does in the paint. 
Like I'm watching film on them and I think they are posting Poppens because Britteny is guarding Prins at the three.   Prins throws a little curl pass on the block, Gardner is fighting the pass and then goes and blocks the post‑up from behind.   So she impacts and she can impact from the three to the block.
So I think they are as suited as anybody for an upset because of the makeup of how they score.   They can score inside, but those guys can also score from the three‑point line and I've said that all along.   I mean, 17 threes at Iowa State‑‑ Brittney's freshman year is when they beat them. 

Q.   You said you want to get better for the tournament; what do you want to focus on? 
COACH HENRICKSON:   Well, defensively, we were better last night.   We have got to be better on interior defense, got to improve.   Part of the interior, that's ball pressure, too, we have to clean that up.   We give too much up to the rim.   We have to bring some help.   Force some lower percentage shots. 
Those are things, you go back to the breakdown, you get to this time of the year, so much scouting report defense and you have to get down and do some break down defensive things more; not that we don't do anything, but we have a chance to work on that and clean some things up.
