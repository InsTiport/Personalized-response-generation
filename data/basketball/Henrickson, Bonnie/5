COACH HENRICKSON:   I thought defensively, we were so much better than we had been, and especially in the first half, they averaged 28 points in the first half in league play, and almost 4 approximate against us in our first two games and our defensive numbers in the second half were better but first half, too loose and too many 3s and at our place, it was six made 3s in the first seven minutes.     
I thought it was the first time in the three games we've played that we actually jumped out on them and got the lead and got some separation, as opposed to the flip side of that, at their place and at our place.   
So much better defensive focus and intensity.   It got a little sloppy there middle minutes, but good to get one after a long day, not playing till 8:30, that's a real, real long day, I thought the kids handled it well.   We don't have many 8:30 tips, haven't had many all year.   
So I thought they handled the kind of length of the day and like sometimes that can wear on you, too.   So really proud of our effort and proud of our commitment to come in and guard better to start.   
   
 Q.   Chelsea, could you talk about having a career‑high in rebounds and a double‑double playing so close to home?   
CHELSEA GARNDER:   I thought it was pretty nice.   I came out with a lot of energy, a lot of effort, started off with a great start and I just felt excited about being back at home.   
   
 Q.   Angel, you had 16 points, five rebounds, eight assists, two blocks, two steals, zero turnovers.   Which is your favorite number there?   
ANGEL GOODRICH:   The zero turnovers (laughs).   I haven't done that all year.   That was the first one.   
So for me to come out and get zero turnovers especially in the Big12 Tournament, I felt great.   I was excited, especially when Terry told me on the bench, kind of put my hands up and was just smiling so big.   
   
 Q.   Can you tell us what you thought of the lift that air agave you both in the first half and the second half, and then after you, I'd like the same question of Angel, as well.   
CHELSEA GARNDER:   I thought Asia gave us a lot of energy off the bench and she came in with a big deal today, so I felt like she did a great job.  
ANGEL GOODRICH:   Yes, just like Chelsea said, she came in ready to play, she attacked and that's what we need, for people off the bench to step up and be ready to play.   
COACH HENRICKSON:   If you look at these two, they didn't know, angel said although I'm not surprised, these two were 8 for 40 in our first two games with these guys, and tonight they go 11 for 19.   That matters.   It was a good night, much better night.   
   
 Q.   What about the zero turnovers for a player who is as aggressive as Angel at all times?  
COACH HENRICKSON:   Just how much she attacks, and especially they started off in a triangle and two and we had not seen that all year and really played the majority of it just a straight 2‑3, but they really tried to pinch her.   They run a lot of people at her.   
I thought they tried to attack her with the second guy and I thought she made really, really good decisions in seams and didn't try to do too much.   And you know, I thought at our place and here, took penetration lanes and made really, really good decisions.   
But they are a team that even though it's a 2‑3, it's an aggressive 2‑3, and they really tried to get in there and cut the court on her, but I thought her poise and decision making certainly was fantastic.   
   
 Q.   You mentioned that you had such a long day today waiting for the 8:30 tip, how does that change tomorrow, and how difficult is that knowing you have a short turnaround tomorrow?  
COACH HENRICKSON:   We are excited to play.   We are not worried about the short turnaround.   We are excited to play and get one today and excited about the opportunity to play Iowa State tomorrow.   
So, we'll be fine.   We'll be fine, and probably go do‑‑ we'll get some information to them.   We have just recently played Iowa State, so we talked in the locker room, what was it, 7‑for‑10 from the three in the first half.   And then it was everything inside, three bigs have 62 points and 34 rebounds; and they didn't know the numbers, that's my job.   
But they can talk you through exactly where we broke down defensively in the locker room after this game.   So from a fresh standpoint, remembering the game, certainly remember the game at our place, too, the comeback.   But we'll be able to go through that.   But they are young and they are excited.   We are really excited to play.   
   
 Q.   Obviously depth is a problem for you, but in a way, can your lack of depth maybe relax Asia, you have to play her and she knows she's going to play?  
COACH HENRICKSON:   Right, yeah, and she came in and had had come in and gave us some energy, and that's what we were lacking and that's why Hawk got the chance.   We just felt like we had been so flat and had not gotten enough out of that position.   
I thought we could, I told her and CeCe when I made the move, doesn't mean you're not going to play.   You have to be ready to play and you have to handle coming off the bench and if your role is a little different than maybe the first guy or the second guy, you still have to be ready to play but it's magnified all year but it's really magnified this time of the year.   
And you know, we have got‑‑ yeah, you're right, because when you're ‑‑ and that's exactly what happened to us last year, everybody knew they had a chance to contribute because of what our numbers were.   And I think you're more dialed in and ready to go and pay attention more when you go, okay, I'm going to go and I may be the second guy off the bench, maybe not the first guy but I know I'll go.   
And I thought her minutes were huge.   For her, again, we've had some really special kids be able to hang in there and go through the difficulties of not getting on the floor and then because they handle themselves well, do what Hawk did and come in and help us, and you have to be able to do the same thing if that flipped for you, you still have to hang in there and not give up and give in, and go okay, maybe I'm the second guy or maybe I started and I'm the first guy, but whatever I do when I get in, I want to be able to impact the game.   I thought she did a great job for us tonight.
