<p>	Q. Would you describe the emotions now that the season is over?  What's it like, Chris and what's it like, Taron? </p>

<p>	Q. Could you talk about the defense and whether that was a matchup that you expected and how difficult a defender Barley was for you? </p>
<p>	Q. Chris, could you describe what you were thinking after you cut the deficit to two, was it a matter of just one more steal and one more opportunity if you felt like you had a chance to tie it; would you have felt like could you win it? </p>
<p>	Q. Were you on the double-team right before Jameer got the ball off Delonte?  Looked like you almost were able to get the tie; do you remember that play and could you help me with that? </p>
<p>	Q. At points in the game, this place was hopping, it got really loud with Saint Joseph's fans, did that have any effect on your play at all?</p>

<p>	Q. You talk about the dagger 3s, you almost expect them from their main guys, when Carroll hits them, obviously he's a three-point shooter, but when he hits the ones he did, that really seemed to be that every one of them were big. </p>
<p>	Q. Saint Joseph's this season, your season also ended up being 21-10, you reach the Sweet  16.  I know it's just ended but could you put it in perspective? </p>
<p>	Q. How remarkable is it what they are attempting to do and what they have done so far, basically win out without an inside scoring presence at all? </p>
<p>	Q. Could you compare this team to anything else you've seen as far as their style of this magnitude of success, anyway? </p>
<p>	Q. Like a donut kind of team. </p>
<p>	Q. What were your feelings on the officiating of tonight's game and do you think it had any effect on the outcome? </p>
