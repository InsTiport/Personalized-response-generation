COACH BROWNELL:   Same situation the last month of the season, we play well for a good period of the game and then the game gets away from us. 
Proud of the way our guys fought back, we seem to do that to give the guys a chance but credit Florida state they made the free‑throws they need to do make and advanced. 

Q.   Coach, how frustrating was it for you playing so many games and it's not like you guys were getting blowin out.   You're fighting night in and night out ‑‑
COACH BROWNELL:   It's difficult.   You know, it's very difficult.   Obviously the fact that our guys are competing helps because we're going to practice every day and working at it and really trying.   We have some deficiencies that we have to improve.   Until we do that this is going to be the outcome.   Felt bad for our seniors, but we've seen this so many times this year if you followed our team. 
THE MODERATOR:   Any other questions? 

Q.   Brad, you were down is 71‑69 you had a time out left, you chose not to use it after that basket.   Could you talk about your thinking there? 
COACH BROWNELL:   I wanted to save it for later. 

Q.   Talk about moving forward from this point.   Where do you go with recruiting and how do you try to rebound from this season? 
COACH BROWNELL:   We have a scholarship left, we're going to get out on the road as quick as possible and try and fill that and the guys we have coming back we've got to work to get 'em better, simple as that.   We need to get in the gym and improve our offensive skills so we can make more plays, finish plays, become a better offensive team. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
