  BRAD BROWNELL:   Coming off a good win at home against Wake.   Got off to a slow start offensively, but really played well the last 30 minutes of the game, I thought.   Defended well, and our offense got going as we made some shots.   You know, really except for the shooting at the beginning of the game, I thought we did some good things, just didn't make shots, which has happened to us a couple times this year.   
Looking forward now to a very good challenge against a team in Virginia that I think is playing extremely well.   Tony has done an unbelievable job.   Mike Scott is a terrific player, certainly First‑Team All‑ACC guy to me if not in the running for Player of the Year.   
   
 Q.   You guys played an awfully low scoring game up there last season.   Just wondering what you take away from that, especially the way Virginia defended last year and again this year.   
BRAD BROWNELL:   Well, they're hard to score against for a couple reasons.   Number one, there aren't as many possessions.   The game is going to be a little shorter.   Number two, they don't turn the ball over much, so it's hard to get any easy baskets against them.   They do a great job of transition defense.   They take care of the ball.   They usually take quality shots on offense.   They don't take very many wild shots that lead to long rebounds in just transition situations, so you're always going against their five‑man defense.   Obviously Tony does a great job with the pack line, and they're just really hard to score against.   
I think‑‑ I watched the film again here the other day, and I didn't like what I saw.   We struggled to get 40 whatever we got, 45 or 43 or whatever it was we got.   It was hard to get that many.   We know it's going to be hard to play against them.   It's hard to score against them.   Our defense is going to have to be outstanding to have a chance, and then somebody is going to have to make some shots to beat them on the road.   You have to make some three‑point shots I think against them, and it's hard to do because they defend the three so well.   
   
 Q.   How are your bigs at splitting the double‑team or passing out of it because it just seems the doubling the post is such a staple of what they do?  
BRAD BROWNELL:   Oh, we're okay.   I mean, I think‑‑ I don't know that we're going to split it very often.   I think their guys are big and strong, and so I think when they do get there and watching them on film that they get there and do it in a way that's hard to play against certainly.   I think you have to be opportunistic with the passing, though.   I think you have to try to make them pay for doubling by getting the ball out of there and somehow getting a shot on the weak side, whether it's a three or whether it's driving a close‑out.   You have to do something to get a good quality shot if they're going to double your big guys.  
It's happened a couple times to us earlier in the year.   We've done reasonably well against it, but Virginia does it probably better than most.   
   
 Q.   Who were those teams who doubled on you?  
BRAD BROWNELL:   It was some non‑conference teams that we played.   
   
 Q.   Andre young is shooting 43 percent from the three in conference play.   What's the best explanation for his considerable improvement since the start of January?   
BRAD BROWNELL:   I just think it's some confidence.   I think seeing the ball go in.   The Georgia Tech game was big for him.   He went seven for nine, and so first off, that really helps your average and your percentages.   But I think it gave him some confidence.   
He followed it up and made three the other night against Wake.   To be honest, I thought Andre would shoot a little better this year earlier in the season, and I think there were some games we lost that he didn't shoot well.   But I think his confidence is better.   I just think he feels better about himself.   I think he's gotten used to being guarded different ways sometimes, and I think he's just more comfortable as a guy who's well into his senior year and understands his value to the team of taking and making big shots, and I think he's had a few games now where he's been able to do that, and it's made a big difference in terms of his confidence.   
It's nothing in terms of like we've altered his stroke or done anything like that.   The kid has got a perfect stroke.   He can shoot the ball.   It's just getting into a good rhythm and finding some good shots and knocking them down and seeing them go down, really.   
   
 Q.   In a lot of your games you've got one or two guys that carry a lot of the scoring load.   Last time out, though, you really seemed to have some good balance with four guys in double figures and doing well.   Can you talk about that balance and getting that, how important that is to you?   
BRAD BROWNELL:   Well, I think it's critical for us because Andre had a huge game against Georgia Tech.   It's a little bit of a different game when a guy makes seven threes.   We haven't had that happen very often.   But I think we're the kind of team that we need three or four guys to get in double figures to really have a good scoring night because we don't maybe have the one guy who's going to get us 20 on a regular basis.   
So if Andre gets us 14 or 15, then we're going to need a couple other guys to get 12, 14 points to get 65.   So I think that's when our team is playing better, when Tanner hits 12 or Devin or Milt or both have 14 or 12 or 10.   We got good play out of Bryan Narcisse the other night.   He got us 11 in a starting role, so that was good.   But we definitely need three or four guys in double figures to win most of these games, again, because I don't think we have that one guy that's a 20‑point scorer every night.
