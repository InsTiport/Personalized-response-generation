Boston College - 84, Duke - 77
THE MODERATOR: We are joined first by Boston College head coach, Joanna Bernabei-McNamee, and student-athlete, Taylor Soule. Coach?
JOANNA BERNABEI-MCNAMEE: My opening statement is what a game! Man, that was fun! I loved the way every player on our team stepped up, especially the lady next to me, Taylor Soule played like a pro and Marnelle Garraud handled the pressure and ran the team like a good floor general. I loved the way our bench had everybody's back and Emma Guy comes in and has a double-double. Georgia scores her thousandth point on her first shot. Everybody was in sync and when we got out of sync and Duke would make their runs we stuck together as a team. I think that was a total team effort and I'm really proud of us.
Q. In a game that was so back and forth, how did you guys maintain your composure? At one minute Duke was leading and the next you guys made another run.
TAYLOR SOULE: Well, Coach tells us before the game naturally there are going to be runs but it depends on who is willing to fight the hardest at the end of the day so when Duke goes up, you have to understand that they're a great basketball team but we have confidence in ourselves that we can go on runs that are greater than that ask that's how the game turned out today.
JOANNA BERNABEI-MCNAMEE: Same, I think it's a matter of, you know, playing tough and controlling the things that we can control which a lot of times are rebounding and just having each other's back defensively.
Q. I believe it was at one point you were 75% from three. Can you talk about if that was part of your game plan heading into this contest?
JOANNA BERNABEI-MCNAMEE: I don't think that's every part of our game plan. If we end up shooting well from the three-point line it's an added bonus. Generally our game plan revolves around all the time working to get the breast shot possible and making sure we take care of the boards and cover each other's backs on defense.
Q. Taylor, you came in with four fouls and your team on the ropes. You scored 12 points. How were you able to basically carry your team to victory?
JOANNA BERNABEI-MCNAMEE: How were you able to do that?
TAYLOR SOULE: Just my team they give me so much confidence and when I look over and see everyone getting super hyped, it feels like we have so much confidence in each other and knowing that we can do absolutely anything with each other. Knowing I had four fouls, I can't foul out of games like this, gotta be there for my coach and everybody and stepping up to the challenge, and it was well worth it today.
Q. You guys played yesterday and fatigue could have been a factor. Where did you find the extra boost and energy to make that run late in the game?
TAYLOR SOULE: Naps when you can get 'em, massages, but, no, just understanding the importance of every possession, every game and as this team has matured, understanding you're going to be tired, the other team is tired. But those are all just excuses and at the end of the day we want to win a basketball game. So yeah we had a basketball game yesterday but we also have one tomorrow so just gotta fight.
Q. You guys haven't seen NC State since December. Seems like that was a year ago. You guys lost.
JOANNA BERNABEI-MCNAMEE: It was last year.
Q. Yeah! What if anything stood out to you from that game and what do you have to correct tomorrow?
JOANNA BERNABEI-MCNAMEE: Well, you know, NC State is one of those teams where they have a lot of players that can score and do dynamic things, so for us it's going to be a matter of being under control and knowing our personnel and how to guard them and often offensively it's going to be us pushing, even though it's going to be our third game trying to push the tempo and trying to play our pace, so it's like a tale of two teams when they play them and we want to make sure we play our pace and that could be a challenge being our third game.
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you.
