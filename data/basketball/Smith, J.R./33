 Q. How do you feel today?
 J.R. SMITH: Pretty good. Spirits are good. We won last night. So doing pretty well.

 Q. How much confidence do you guys gain by basically playing them shot for shot in the first two games to get the split, and now you get to go home where you guys play even better?
 J.R. SMITH: We have a lot of confidence and we always play great at home. Especially myself. And we really haven't got into the game yet. So it's going to be interesting to see what we do.

 Q. Has your calf injury hampered you at all, has it limited you?
 J.R. SMITH: No, not really. I'm limping up and down the court, but not too much. It doesn't really bother me. Gotta go back to the gym and try to get more reps out with it.

 Q. Could you feel a little pain during the game?
 J.R. SMITH: I felt it tug here and there. But I mean I was able to play.

 Q. Do you guys feel like you guys should be up 2?
 J.R. SMITH: We think we should. Few things, the ball didn't bounce the way we needed it in Game 1.
