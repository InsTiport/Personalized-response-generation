<p>	Q. Tony, tell us about, Coach said he was very, very proud of you.  I'm sure he wasn't very, very proud of the way you guys rebounded in the first half.  Tell us about why they were so good.  What happened to you guys?  It looked like a lot of guys were standing around and the ball was bouncing on the floor, get into that rebounding and how that affected the game at that point. </p>
<p>	Q. On the 3 you hit to start the run late in the game, it looked like Brown was daring you to shoot it.  Did you have too much time to think about that one? </p>
<p>	Q. Joey and John, can you imagine being in a tougher situation anywhere in the rest of the tournament than you found yourselves at halftime, the kind of style Pitt plays and the kind of mess you found yourself in?</p>
<p>	Q. Joey and Tony, all three if you want, a lot is made of Pittsburgh's defense but in reality you guys stepped it up pretty well, too, held them to 51 points.</p>
<p>	Q. Even when you guys had to run halfcourt, it looked like you could not be guarded.  Did it look like you were unguardable as far as getting to the basket? </p>
<p>	Q. At different points in the second half, Coach got on you pretty good, pulled Tony out at one point and pulled John out at another.  Was he mostly complaining about the rebounding or was there any other things he was talking about? </p>

<p>	Q. Can you talk about the way that Pitt rotates on defense and whether or not it gets frustrating as a point guard not really being able to set up maybe the offense that you want to and having to  -- is it about being patient when you are playing against a team like this? </p>
<p>	Q. Coach had talked about the rebounding being a big difference, the defensive rebounding, was it more than that?  Did you guys sorts of solve their defense down the stretch?  Did you figure some things out there?  It seemed like you were crisper coming down the stretch with that late run.</p>
<p>	Q. Joey, you had three baskets in that stretch to start when you guys broke up in the game, the first one was sort of an off-balance shot.  When you hit that shot, did you have a good feeling that the next two were going to go in? </p>
<p>	Q. Tony, I heard that before the start of the season that you wanted to get Coach Sutton his first National Championship.  Talk about moving one step closer to that goal. </p>
<p>	Q. Are you surprised as good as Pitt is that so much of this game was played in the halfcourt and so much of this game was probably played at a tempo and a pace that they prefer? </p>
<p>	Q. It seemed like in the second half you were able to spread out the floor a little bit more.  Did that seem to take away the defensive intensity, that you didn't have to attack so much from inside the circle?</p>
<p>	Q. Tony and Joey, you guys talked about how physical you expected this game to be, so can you tell us how physical it was? </p>

<p>	Q. John and Joey, the first half, you guys are down, you're down by two points, but you had shot 30  percent, the offense was running one assist and you look up and you're down two points.  Was that a lift that you were able to play good enough defense or play well enough in other areas? </p>

<p>	Q. Expand on your opening statement about their offensive rebounds were killing your ability to run and that's really the strength of your team, you guys can't run if you don't have defensive rebounds.</p>
<p>	Q. Is this the kind of game you go into sort of worried because of the style of play, something that you had really not seen and it counters your style, the kind of game, you're glad to get by any NCAA game but because of the style? </p>
<p>	Q. John didn't have an assist in the first half, he ended up with six, was the ability to finally run the floor a little bit and get him with the ball in his hands, was that the reason you guys were partly able to pull away? </p>
<p>	Q. Early in the second half, you really looked furious, you looked upset, you got on Lucas and Allen.  Can you talk about what you're going through this?  They are obviously used to you and they love you, but what was going on there? </p>
<p>	Q. How did you feel they responded to that?</p>
<p>	Q. Can I ask you about Krauser?  All of the years that we've been covering you, very rarely will a point guard just go through your defense like he was in the first half, can you talk about it, and also, did you make some changes on that in the second half?</p>
