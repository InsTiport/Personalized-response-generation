 Q.   Even though it's never been done in the past before where a team has come back from 0‑2 twice in the same Playoffs, you did it once, you know how hard it is and now you have to do it again.   
TONY ALLEN:   You said it in one question.   We've just got to do it.   They took care of home, now we have to take care of home.   Simple as that.  
   
 Q.   Everybody has got home‑court edge all around the league, but what is it about this building?   You guys have won 18 out of 19 and you're sharper, more poise, you execute, and you're almost impossible to beat here.   
TONY ALLEN:   I guess we've got great fans.   The guys are comfortable with the rims I assume.   I don't know, just a great crowd.   We need to take our home court, simple as that, Game 3.   We take care of home.
