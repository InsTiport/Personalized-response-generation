  TONY ALLEN:   Got to go get a win, desperate for a win.   Focusing on home, trying to get a win.

Q.   Is it a must‑win for you guys with no team ever coming back from 0‑3?
TONY ALLEN:   We're not down 0‑3 yet.   We're down 0‑2 and we've got to take care of home just like they took care of home.   Simple as that.

Q.   How good has it been back here at home sleeping in your own bed and eating your own food?
TONY ALLEN:   That's always a great feeling, but like I said, the business at hand, we need to come in here and take care of home.

Q.   What have you done the last couple of days to get yourself ready for tomorrow?
TONY ALLEN:   We had hard practices, went over a lot of stuff that they do offensively, and we had to tighten down a few coverages for us defensively.   Like I said, just having hard practices.

Q.   Do you get more intense as you get closer and finally want to get out on the court and play the game?
TONY ALLEN:   Yeah, everybody is anxious.   Everybody wants to get out there and do what they can do to help, but for the most part we need to be relaxed, come in here poised, stick to what we do, and that's our brand of basketball.

Q.   Is it tough to not get overanxious with the pressure on you?
TONY ALLEN:   It's hard, but you've got to keep it on an even keel.   Everybody wants to win, so we've got to stick to the game plan.   That's in and out basketball, getting a little more movement and being better on the defensive end.
