<p>	Q.  I'd like to ask the players, should either you or Minnesota feel like an underdog this weekend, here at the Final Four?</p>
<p>	Q.  To sort of follow-up that, does the fact that you're playing a team that you're very familiar with, does that take some of the kind of newness out of playing because you know Tennessee well, so can you almost kind of reduce this game tomorrow night to like an SEC game?</p>
<p>	Q.  For Seimone and Temeka could you both talk about how you knew the Final Four was going to be here all year long, here in New Orleans, and just you know, I know it's hard to look down the road, especially when you get into this tournament because it's a one game, do-or-die situation, but when you all went to Seattle, was there a feeling, hey, we got to win two games and then we'll play in New Orleans?</p>

<p>	Q.  Talking about the team, Tennessee, how do you guys match up, what do you think about them now that you've seen so much on tape I'm sure already. </p>
<p>	Q.  Doneeka, you probably have watched the last-second magic that Tasha Butts has had, could you talk about her and what you look for from her?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is for Temeka and Seimone.  Can you talk about the importance of rebounding, how you guys will need to do that, especially well against Tennessee, especially in light of the last match up with them. </p>

<p>	Q.  Temeka, you mentioned your reaction when you found out, when the buzzer went and you tackled your coach there, can you just kind of talk about your emotions and feelings that you had now and that have you this weekend of sort of the irony of getting here after Sue has coached for so long and to physically not have her right beside you now that the Final Four is here and you're here and it's in New Orleans.</p>
<p>	Q.  Temeka, after the loss at the SEC tournament, can you talk a little bit about what got the team going and how you refocused at that point?  Did you guys have a team meeting or anything?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there anything that you can do to help the big people down low with Shyra Ely considering how good she was the first time?  Seimone I guess in particular. </p>
<p>	Q.  Seimone, your shooting percentage throughout this tournament has been outstanding, can you talk about why that is?  Is that partially the offensive execution or have you taken it upon yourself as each game got bigger to perform bigger? </p>
<p>	Q.  Temeka, you mentioned having Coach Gunter here, unlike Seattle she was 28 hundred miles away, is it better now, easier for you guys to know that she's physically here and physically closer?</p>

<p>	Q.  Coach, Candace Parker won the dunk contest this week, is that significant for women's basketball, women's sports in general or is it being overblown?  What's your take on that?</p>
<p>	Q.  What are some of the things that have to change tomorrow for you to beat Tennessee in comparison to your first meeting?</p>
<p>	Q.  I have a question, '91, your last time in the Final Four was in New Orleans you were the Kodak All American.  Now you're back as a coach.  Can you talk about that?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was just wondering if you could kind of describe what this has meant to Coach Gunter, like how she reacted when you guys reached the Final Four and what her role is this weekend just kind of like chief morale officer or what she's been up to.</p>
<p>	Q.  Pokey, a lot is made of the Final Four when there's teams like Tennessee and UConn here year after year, and there's guys like you and Minnesota who are making your first appearance.  Is that adjustment less accepted because of all the things you talked about for this team, all the distractions you guys have had during the course of the year and maybe to a smaller degree that it's here in New Orleans?</p>
<p>	Q.  I'm curious if you at all draw any parallels in your case to Steve Fisher, who inherited a Michigan team through unexpected circumstances and took them to a championship.</p>
<p>	Q.  What's the head of the snake?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, I was wondering in '91 when that team won the SEC tournament, did you think then that you were going to make the Final Four, and did the whole Sesame Street thing then become like a depressing thing that contributed to the loss at Lamar?</p>
<p>	Q.  You have the sign that's on Coach Gunter's door, why not us?  When did that start and has it been something that's been a real focal point of trying to get the players to buy into?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would you talk a little bit about Tasha Butts and though, she's won like the last two games and what that does for a team and for her play?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just going back to Coach Gunter for a second, you spent literally half your life with this woman and  --</p>
<p>	Q.  And she's been coaching for 40 years.  Can you put into words what it means to you to know that you were the one that was on the bench that got her to this pinnacle where she's never been before, the Final Four?</p>
<p>	Q.  Involving Coach Gunter, what will be the pre-game tomorrow night?  Will she say something to the team before you leave the hotel?  I know there won't be a, "win one for me, guys", kind of thing from what you've told us, but what will that be like, just take us from the last time you'll see her before you come here.  What will that be like?</p>
