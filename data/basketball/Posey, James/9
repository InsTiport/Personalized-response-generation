 Q.  Does it bother you that you might be getting a reputation or that that's what people think, little tough guy, he's not going to hurt anyone? 
 JAMES POSEY:  All of a sudden in the past year I'm this tough guy, a violent person or player or something like that.  The game has changed a little bit.  Even some of the players said that wasn't a bad foul at all. 
 Q.  You try to relax in between games, between Chicago and Game 1 against New Jersey.  Is that a concern as you go into this next game? 
 JAMES POSEY:  We have no time to relax.  You just have to go with our game plan and just keep on playing hard and take it one game at a time. 
 Q.  Detroit missed a lot of open shots that maybe you guys wouldn't have missed.  Talk about your perimeter defense. 
 JAMES POSEY:  It was fine.  For the most part we did a good job, but we have to do a better job and continue to get better. 
 Q.  Were you guys at all insulted by the kind of convenient notion that Detroit has a team and Miami has Shaquille and Wade.  Do you think you guys are underappreciated as a team? 
 JAMES POSEY:  I mean, we've been hearing it for so long.  I mean, that's with every team for the most part.  There may be one or two players or stars they have on the team, but this team here, everyone is a star, they play well together.
