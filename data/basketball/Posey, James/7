  Q.  Talk about what you envision your role in this series is?   
 JAMES POSEY:  Some games present different opportunities and things like that and whichever opportunity it is, you just try to take advantage of it, whether it's -- you might get ten shots one game, sometimes you might get 2 to 3 or something like that or sometimes you might be able to crash the boards.  Sometimes you might not.   
 So every game is different.   
  Q.  How do you look back on your days in Denver, positive or negative?   
 JAMES POSEY:  I mean, it was just those days right there.  You didn't really know what was going to happen.  You thought if you could make it or survive to get to this level -- I guess it's a lesson learned that there's more basketball out there and you've just got to tough it out and hopefully be blessed with an opportunity to get to this level.   
  Q.  Do you expect to have a role playing Dirk certain times?  Is that where you can really be a key in this series?   
 JAMES POSEY:  Everyone is going to have their hands full of trying to contain Dirk.  We all have to be alert and know where he is on the court.   
  Q.  What's the key to doing that?  Is it keep him away from the basket, get him to drive, put the ball on the floor?   
 JAMES POSEY:  Just know where he is on the court.  He does a lot of things for this team and you just have to be aware.   
  Q.  You wore down Jersey in that series with your depth and against Detroit, certainly, too.  Do you think you can come in and change games?   
 JAMES POSEY:  Like I said, we just go out and play hard, try to take advantage of the opportunities.  That's all we can do, just play hard and stick with our game plans on both ends of the floor.   
 And if we do that, we can put ourselves in a good situation to win ballgames.
