 Q.   What are your initial thoughts on being here?  
CHANDLER PARSONS:   It's kind of cool being here.   Working with coaches from different teams.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about what you guys need to do in the second half?  
CHANDLER PARSONS:   We've got to take it one day at a time.   I think we're right where we want to do.   We've only been playing together three or four months.   So it's a growing process.
