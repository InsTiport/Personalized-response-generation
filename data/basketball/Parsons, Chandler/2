Q.   Dwight is obviously going to be the big story here today.   As an Orlandoan, what's your advice about Dwight's future?
CHANDLER PARSONS:   Oh, man, as a Magic fan my whole life, I hope he stays.   He's one of the best ever to play the game, and this is a great place to be.   So I hope that he stays here and helps them win games. 

Q.   Would you say that your versatility is the reason why you cracked the starting lineup so young in your career? 
CHANDLER PARSONS:   I think so.   I think I can do a little bit of everything, and I'm just all about the team.   I play defense, I rebound, I just do all the little things that add up to winning, and when you play with guys I play with, Kyle Lowry, Kevin Martin, those guys make it easy.   So I just go out there and play extremely hard and play in my role, and just be aggressive and just take what the offense gives me.   And on defense just try and make it hard for whoever I'm going against.
