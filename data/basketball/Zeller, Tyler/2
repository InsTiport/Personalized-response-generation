 Q.   What's the biggest difference between playing in the NBA and the college game?     
TYLER ZELLER:   Probably just the amount of games and the athleticism of everybody.   They're big, strong.   You've got to be on your game every night.   
   
 Q.   What's it like being part of the Cavaliers team?  
TYLER ZELLER:   We've got a lot of strength.   A lot of speed.  
Yesterday we did all the media circuit.   And today we have a lot of fun stuff planned, so it will be a great day.   
   
 Q.   Takes you back to your days growing up in the Allâ€‘Star Games?  
TYLER ZELLER:   Yeah, you see the other side of it, though.   It's kind of cool.   Just being able to see everything on TV and then being able to come here and play I think it will be fun.
