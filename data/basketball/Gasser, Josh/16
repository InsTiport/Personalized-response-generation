 Q.   For both guys, what made it so difficult to get over the hump there in the second half?   
FRANK KAMINSKY:   You know, we dug ourselves a hole in the first half, and we were trying to climb out of that hole the whole second half.   And we just didn't have enough left in the tank at the end to get over that.   
JOSH GASSER:   Yeah, I mean, when you're down 17 at half against a really good team, it's tough to get out of.   They outplayed us that first half.   We fought, we scrapped to try to get ourselves back, and just couldn't quite get out of it.   
   
 Q.   Frank, can you guys take enough positive from the way you played in the second half to carry over into next week?   
FRANK KAMINSKY:   I think there's things we can take away from the game.   We know we can't come out like we did and have a bunch of turnovers in the first half.   That led to a bunch of fast break points for them.   They really got into a rhythm, and we dug ourselves a hole and we couldn't get out of it in the second half.   We played much better, and that's how we have to play going forward.   
   
 Q.   Just for both, how important was it for you guys going forward to keep fighting and to at least bring it close at the end?   
JOSH GASSER:   I mean, in a one‑and‑done format, that's what you've got to do.   You've got to fight till the end.   It's NCAA Tournament time, so it's one‑and‑done from here on out.   So if we don't fight and scrap from here on out, bad things will happen.   We'd like to come out on top, obviously, but it didn't happen.  
FRANK KAMINSKY:   We've just got to take it 40 minutes at a time going forward.   Like Josh said, it's one‑and‑done time.   And we know that everything we've worked for this year is on the line now, and we've got to go out there and just listen to the scouting reports and do everything the right way.   
   
 Q.   Same question from your perspective on what was so tough about getting over that hump there in the second half.   
COACH RYAN:   Which hump are you referring to?   That's what I didn't quite understand, like why we didn't get ahead?   
   
 Q.   Correct.   
COACH RYAN:   Because we didn't make enough baskets, and we didn't stop them enough times.   We shot it better.   We held them to a lower shooting percentage.   We did a better job in the paint.   We scored more in the paint.   We did a better job on‑‑ in a lot of areas.   But when you say get over the hump, the hump was 20‑something at one time.   Got over that one.   
But hump, it's either you get ahead or you're behind.   We didn't get ahead.   
   
 Q.   What changed in the second half or what did you guys do coming out of the locker room to try and get back into it?   
COACH RYAN:   Just reiterated what we tried to get across before the game.   They hit some shots.   They made some jumpers.   Payne starts out with a tough three.   You've got to give them credit for the way they shot the ball.   
But we didn't make some‑‑ we didn't make the decisions we needed to make in order to get our defensive players in the half court position.   So once you're playing from behind, the number of possessions change.   We got behind, and we just had to keep trying to get more than they did on the next‑‑ whether you get 40 possessions a half, 35, 30, it's usually somewhere between 30 and 40.   We did not do a very good job on our possessions.   And they shot it real well to get a lot on theirs.   
Second half, hung in there tough.   What's that mean?   Of course they're going to play tough; what do you think?   Athletes are going to go out there and not scrap and not‑‑ we created some doubt for them shooting‑wise.   We weren't creating doubt early.   
I mean, you guys in a driveway, off your garage, you start hitting some shots, and the neighborhood kids are like, Man, that guy is good.   Well, the neighborhood kids got to take you out of your comfort spot.   Gotta do something.  
   
 Q.   You talked about your offensive decisionmaking.   Were you referring to shot selection or something else?   
COACH RYAN:   Yeah, ball movement, body movement, shot selection.   It's never just one thing, it's a combination of things.   And we weren't very fluid, but we found that fluidity and did a much better job on our points per possession.   We got to the foul line, did the things we were hoping to do more of in the first half.   
   
 Q.   With all the fouls and stoppages in the first half, what impact do you think that had on your ability to come back?   
COACH RYAN:   Well, in order to make a comeback, if you can score with the clock stopped, that's a pretty good thing, and we've been able to do that over the years.   Well, try to do it again.   
But just a free throw here, tough jumper by them there.   We got them to miss some free throws.   One of them hit so hard, our guys couldn't get their hands up in time.   That's why I try to tell our guys to have their hands up at the free‑throw line.   
You've got to grab those, and if we come down and score on that one, there's still time.   There's a lot of things you can go through, but in order for it to happen, it has to be ‑‑ you've got to score with the clock stopped a lot.   And you've got to get them to either turn it over or take bad shots and not give them second ones.
