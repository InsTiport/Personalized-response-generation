Q.   What do you make of Jeremy Lin?   Are you buying into Linsanity?
ANTHONY MORROW:   Yeah, he's legit.   He's a good player, man.   You can't deny that.   He's got the numbers every game.   He didn't play well last night against the Heat, but they're an exceptional defensive team, very athletic.   That was the first time against them in that kind of setting with that kind of pressure.   I think he's going to be good. 

Q.   (Question regarding Petrovic). 
ANTHONY MORROW:   He's got a lot of arc in his jump shot.   He jumps a little higher than I jump.   We have similar shooting, though.   (Inaudible).
