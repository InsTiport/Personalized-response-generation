<p>	Q.  Can you talk about how tough it is to end your career on this note?  Seems like you were in a funk today, Izzo was yelling at you, teammates yelling at you.  What was going on today? </p>
<p>	Q.  Paul, in the first half I think May only had four points, 18 the second half.  What did you see?  What was the difference there? </p>
<p>	Q.  Alan, when Carolina got rolling in the second half, did it just seem like it kind of snowballed on you; just wasn't much that could go right for you guys at that point? </p>
<p>	Q.  Alan, how many problems did you have with the knee coming into the game?  What kind of effect did it have on you today? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did something happen in the game?  Did you tweak it in the game? </p>
<p>	Q.  When the sting of this loss wears off, whenever that is, can you reflect on the career here, at least getting a Final Four banner to go up and represent the class that's been through so much? </p>

<p>	Q.  You alluded to the two differences in the halves earlier.  Was there anything North Carolina did tactically; was it just a matter they got on a roll and nothing could stop them? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, having seen both teams now, can you provide us with a bit of a preview, scouting report, keys to Monday night's game? </p>
<p>	Q.  How puzzled were you with Alan?  One time you yelled at Alan like, "What are you doing?"  Thoughts on this senior class going out at least with a Final Four. </p>
