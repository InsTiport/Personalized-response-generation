<p>	Q.  Alan, can you talk about that first half, you guys had some great looks in the paint but the shots weren't falling. </p>
<p>	Q.  Alan, to get to the Elite 8 with a win over Duke, how does that feel?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the pressure you supplied all night?  Could you sense their guards were getting frustrated?</p>
<p>	Q.  Paul, could you talk about the play where you fouled out Williams with three minutes to go and how big that was?  You ended up getting a put back to kind of save the game for you guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about what Paul did tonight?  Not just the way he played but the emotions he showed?</p>
<p>	Q.  Going back to that play where Shelden got his fifth foul, were you guys specifically going after him?  How did that change things?  Was it easier to rebound?</p>
<p>	Q.  Paul, you played 33 minutes tonight which is more than what you averaged.  Did you get your second wind from the second half there?</p>
<p>	Q.  Paul, yesterday your coach was talking about how a team can't be intimidated going into these teams.  Can you talk about the mindset of the team going into this game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Were you surprised that you had those open looks for threes and that you didn't have any guy in your face at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach talked about preventing them from making runs.  They got it down on the three or four at one point.  Your team seemed to be tightening up a little bit.  What got you through that point?</p>
<p>	Q.  Wisconsin won tonight which means three Big-10 teams in the Final Eight.  Through the year I know you heard about the Big-10 being down.  What do you feel now?</p>
<p>	Q.  What were your feeling when Shannon was knocking down free throws at the end?</p>

<p>	Q.  How gratifying is it for you to see your team get those stops at the end of the game and hit those free throws when they have come up short in the past?</p>
<p>	Q.  Tom, who was in charge of lighting the fire under Paul Davis tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  Tom, are you little bit closer, in the same area code or same building now?</p>
<p>	Q.  There was couple of strange calls or plays in the game right at the end of the half, also that missed dunk.  Can you tell me what they told you happened?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just address, where this win leaves you guys?  You talked about the footprint in the sand concept. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Shannon Brown.  He hit a big three and as usual gave you energy tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  You have two, three different guys guarding Redick, it was successful.  Why did that work well tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  I apologize if the question was asked.  I was in your locker room where they were pumped up right now.  Have you got the sense that the underclass tried to pull this together to win this for the seniors and the coaching staff?</p>
<p>	Q.  I asked your player about the Big-10 success.  Is this any kind of indication, does it show the Big-10 was underrated during the regular season?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, could you talk a little bit about not being intimidated.  When you get to this point, seeds don't matter.  Anybody is frail at this time, anybody is fragile. </p>
<p>	Q.  For those of us that didn't see the game in Durham this year.  Did you apply the same defensive principles in that game?</p>
<p>	Q.  You know, this senior class has been compared so often from the Final Four teams.  You mentioned in Worcester last week that the it was one of the best performances that you have ever coached.  Are they starting to rekindle the intensity of those bruising teams that you have had in the past?</p>
