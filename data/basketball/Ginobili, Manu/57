<p>	Q.  Late in the fourth quarter, you hit the big three pass from Tim out of a collapsing-type situation, how did he see you or describe that play. </p>
<p>	Q.  The little things that Tim did sometimes get overlooked, but what did it mean for you guys seeing him do the little things?</p>
<p>	Q.  Tim is such a quiet leader, do you think at any point that he felt that he had to go out and kind of silence his critics and prove again that he has the heart of a champion and he can lead his team? </p>
<p>	Q.  You guys went from having slow feet in the first half to fast hands in the second, what got into you guys at the defensive end and was it something Coach Pop said at halftime or the energy of Game 7? </p>
<p>	Q.  You're one of just less than a handful of people who have won an Olympic gold medal and now an NBA Championship in the same season, can you just sum up this amazing year you had? </p>
