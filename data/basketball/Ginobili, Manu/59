<p>	Q.  Manu, two questions.  You got a brief break about the seven-minute mark and came back about a couple of minutes later, did you have your energy at the end of the game did you think? </p>
<p>	Q.  Second question, relates to that, the final minutes, were you forcing too much, were you trying to do too much individually and as Pop said, not letting the game come to you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Where was your team's defense tonight first of all, and second of all, do you think you guys shot like way too many threes and why can't you guys get more fast break points at home? </p>
<p>	Q.  It seemed like your defense was not there tonight, their three-pointers, and you didn't get too many fast break points. </p>
<p>	Q.  Three points; 28 three-pointers. </p>
<p>	Q.  This team has not played a Game 7, but you've played in a Game 5 in the Olympic finals; will this help you for a game 7? </p>
<p>	Q.  Late in the game, when you were driving the basket and Rasheed was able to step in and strip it, what happened on that play, and why do you think he was able to do that? </p>
<p>	Q.  You seem to be very hard on yourself at this point, the way apparently Rasheed was after his play at the end of Game 5.  What will be your approach to game 7 personally, more determination or do you -- is there a danger perhaps? </p>
