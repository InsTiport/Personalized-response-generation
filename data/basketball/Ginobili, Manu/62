<p>	Q. What's been the difference for you between Games 1 and 2 and Games 3 and 4? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you look back at the infancy of you as a basketball player, were you a good defender first and a good scorer second or was it the other way around or did both of those sort of grow equally? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you won the first two games in San Antonio, people said, the series is over and now they have won two games and the series is over.  How are you guys looking at the series when it is 2-2?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is that the emotion of this team, is it embarrassment, disappointed?  What is the emotion?</p>
<p>	Q.  We're here in the middle of NBA Finals, but also there are some labor issues that are going on now.  As a player, who is relatively new to this league, how optimistic are you that a labor deal would be struck before the lockout deadline?</p>
<p>	Q.  What can you and the rest of your teammates do to allow Tim to get off to have one of those 30 and 20 nights that he's generally had in the NBA Finals before?</p>
<p>	Q.  Pop said the most disappointing was the fact that you guys have succumbed to their physical play.  Ben Wallace sets the tone for them with that kind of play.  Who has got to be the guy, who is it incumbent upon on the Spurs to set that tone in Game 5?</p>
