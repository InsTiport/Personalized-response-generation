 Q.  What do you expect from them on Sunday? 
 MANU GINOBILI:  Well, they're going to make some adjustments, but we don't know what they're going to be.  But we're sure they're going to play a better game.  They're going to play with even more energy.  We're going to expect more from the guys like Hughes and LeBron, of course, but there is going to be a breakout performance and we've got to be ready because if we don't improve, we are not going to win. 
 We've really got to adjust, too, and try to keep doing better. 

 Q.  Earlier in the season people were saying they need to get more athletic on the perimeter, they need to bring a younger guy into the mix.  What was going through your mind then?  Can you talk about that a little bit? 
 MANU GINOBILI:  We were going through a tough time.  January and early February were very tough for us.  But I don't remember a point where we said, okay, this year is not going to be ours.  We always felt very confident, very optimistic.  We knew that Dallas and Phoenix were playing much better than us.  But playoffs are a different story.  

 Q.  Was Pop concerned at that point?  Were they going, well, maybe they will break this thing out -- 
 MANU GINOBILI:  There were a lot of rumors going on.  I don't remember exactly what they were, but every time a good team goes through a tough period, there are rumors.  Sometimes it's about the team, sometimes it's about agents, sometimes it's about the players.
