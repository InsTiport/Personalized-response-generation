<p>	Q. It seemed like you were more of a playmaker to start the game tonight, was that your thought coming in? </p>
<p>	Q.  What is the feeling to hear your crowd calling you "MVP, MVP" when you are shooting free throws? </p>
<p>	Q.  Has this been a little bit easier so far than you expected it to be? </p>
<p>	Q.  I know you've seen Bruce have complete games many times, but at this level against and while he's guarding Rip Hamilton how important was that tonight that he came up big on both ends for you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Does it bother you at all that a lot of the Detroit players still are not giving you much credit in this series for what you're doing?  And B, can you comment on what these two lopsided victories do psyche-wise, they are the champions, but you struck the first blow. </p>
<p>	Q.  Basically striking the first blow so emphatically what you think it might do to their psyche? </p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously Game 3 is going to be huge for Detroit, for you guys how do you maintain that sense of urgency, and is that difficult?</p>
