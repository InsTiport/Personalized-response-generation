<p>	Q.  What did Phoenix do differently today?</p>
<p>	Q.  You all took more threes than they do.  Do you feel like in any way they took you all out of your game or you took yourselves out of your own game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Between now and Wednesday night do you expect the focus in practice and film sessions to be anything Phoenix specific or is it just going to be playing better Spurs basketball?</p>
<p>	Q.  It is a little bit of a shock for you guys not to have finished the job tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously a loss is a loss, you are still up 3 to 1.  What does Pop tell you all?  What is the mood?</p>
<p>	Q.  Pop talked about being a little unhappy with the transition defense.  You alluded to it too; what was difference?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about Stoudemire how he would dominate down the stretch with several key plays</p>
