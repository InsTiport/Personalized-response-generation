<p>	Q. How much pressure or responsibility, I guess you could say, do you and Tony feel in having to get the offense going? </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm doing a piece on flopping and some of the Pistons even some of your teammates said that you have a reputation for drawing calls every now and then.  I'm curious if you take offense to that, if you admit to it and if so, what are the keys to selling the call?</p>
<p>	Q.  I didn't mean it in a negative term, I just wondered if there's an art to it or something that players do, or why some players are more successful at doing it than others. </p>
<p>	Q.  Does the two days off help decrease the pain in your thigh, and also, what do you make of Tim Duncan saying that it really starts with him, this team, this offense? </p>
<p>	Q.  Robert Horry has said of the Detroit big men, they are too long and they jump too well.  What is it like trying to drive the lane against those guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  Larry Brown has always preached playing the game inside-out and Popovich has bought into that big time.  You guys have all said repeatedly, it all starts with Tim, but with him limited in his scoring, what can you do to open things up inside?</p>
<p>	Q.  Forget the responsibility for a moment, just in terms of concrete things you can point to, what do you do to create more opportunities in the paint? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk a little bit about some of the positives you've been able to take out of these last two games. </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm wondering to see if you can just reflect individually on your first two games and on your last two games. </p>
<p>	Q.  Just wondering if you can reflect just individually, not as a team, but individually on your first two games and your last two games. </p>
