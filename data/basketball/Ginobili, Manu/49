  Q.  How would you describe last night's game?   
 MANU GINOBILI:  Tight.  Nothing seemed to be easy for either team.  We were not making shots, a lot of pushing and shoving and going to the boards really hard.  So it was kind of -- everything looked tight.  We seemed not to find any space for anything.   
  
  Q.  (You had a tough game last night.  Talk about it.)   
 MANU GINOBILI:  Well, you know, I knew if we would have won anyways, I don't care, as I said yesterday.  Mine can be zero if we can win again.  But it was really a tough night for me.  I was not feeling good at all.  I started to lose confidence, and the game didn't come to me.  But, you know, I just feel blessed that I went to the line and made those three last shots.  I was not in a great situation there because of the confidence.  I didn't make a shot before that.  But they went in, so it really helped.   
  
  Q.  Psychologically, you guys are up 3-0, how do you guys avoid a letdown?   
 MANU GINOBILI:  We don't have to care about what people say about dynasty.  Of course winning next game means a sweep, but we just try to play as if it was Game 7.  We don't have to think or try to think that there's another option, another opportunity we face from here.  So we've got to take next game as if it was the last one.
