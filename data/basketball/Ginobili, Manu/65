<p>	Q. Did the Pistons do anything different, key on you a little bit more or was it your leg getting hurt at the start of the game? </p>


<p>	Q.  Could you tell when your leg was starting to give out a little bit and did it cause you any problems coming back to the game?</p>


<p>	Q.  When they make you a passer does that take a little bit away from your aggressiveness? </p>
<p>	Q.  Throughout the playoffs, and especially in The Finals, you literally have been the center of attention on and off the floor, how have you dealt with that the last few days? </p>
