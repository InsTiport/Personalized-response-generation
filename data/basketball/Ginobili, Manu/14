Q.   (Inaudible).
    MANU GINOBILI:   Very happy to hear that.   I got home, turned the AC to 64 and lay down on my couch there for a few minutes.   It was a tough one, but it is what it is.   I guess it happens.   It happens in your home and it happens in an arena, it can happen many places.   So you gotta face it and play through it. 

Q.   Is that all you needed was to lay down in cooler temperatures?   Did you have any residuals overnight?
    MANU GINOBILI:   I was tired.   I had to hydrate but not very much different than what I do after every game.   I lost a pound more but now with 72 hours between games, you got time to refuel and get ready again. 

Q.   Did you guys practice today or was it more of a recovery day?   And did the heat have a lot to do with that? 
    MANU GINOBILI:   No, recovery day.   We would have done it regardless, especially when we have another day to work on it a little more. 
    So today was recovery day, stretching, treatments, video, so all the talking part.   Maybe tomorrow we do a little more practiceâ€‘wise. 

Q.   We watched LeBron cramp up, did the heat have any effect on your body during the game? 
    MANU GINOBILI:   Well, I sweat a lot.   I was tired.   We had all to keep hydrated and we had cold towels all over to keep the body temperature on a normal place.   But I didn't have cramps, but everybody is different. 
    It was a bad situation for him because he cramped in the most important part of the game.   I'm pretty sure it was a tough one for him having to watch the last minutes.
