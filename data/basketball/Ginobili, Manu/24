		  MANU GINOBILI:   We were really, really close.   We have to try to repeat, play better, have a better contribution from everybody, and win it. 

Q.   Looking at last night, how do you feel now about reenergizing yourself? 
MANU GINOBILI:   I'm still down.   A blow like that, it's not easy to get back up.   But after 12 hours now, I feel a little better.   Knowing that we have another chance, that we can do so many things better, and that we are in a Game 7 of the NBA Finals.   There's not much more than that. 
So we are still in a good situation.   We are where we wanted to be at the beginning of the season still.   It's up to us.   We have to have our best game. 

Q.   Were you able to sleep last night, Manu? 
MANU GINOBILI:   With some assistance.   It was going to be a tough night.   Yeah, I did sleep. 

Q.   How does the feeling last night compare to '02?   As bad or‑‑
MANU GINOBILI:   Well, at the moment it was as bad.   The day after you know you don't have another opportunity.   When you lose an NBA Final or a game for a bronze, you have no tomorrow.   In this case we do have another option.   And the last one.   And we'll try to bounce back and still get it back.   We still have time. 

Q.   Which was worse, having to sit with the sprained ankle or playing and committing eight turnovers? 
MANU GINOBILI:   Both were pretty tough.   Mentally having been injured in a Final like that it was terrible, and I tried to play anyways, and I just couldn't.   It was very hard.   Now with time I should have stepped aside. 
In this one, again, I just got to try to do my best to forget, learn from mistakes, and have a good, solid game next to my teammates.   Not about trying to score more.   Just be solid and more aggressive and less mistakes of course.
