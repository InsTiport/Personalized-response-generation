<p>	Q.  It's been a difficult battle with their backcourt, for you and Tony, just talk about how you're going to have to adjust in Game 7 to even up a bit more?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is your first NBA Game 7, how does this compare to the Olympics, single game, winner take all or some of your international experience?</p>
<p>	Q.  Tim Duncan is not a real outwardly emotional player on the court, he doesn't pump his fist very often or things like that.  Could you tell us maybe behind the scenes or in the locker room what kind of a leader he is or how he acts?  Prior circumstances? </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm just wondering, are you nervous, Game 7, what's the -- how do you feel inside? </p>
<p>	Q.  A little more specifically, just dealing with their backcourt, what's the most difficult aspect of handling them? </p>
<p>	Q.  Last night in the fourth quarter, during down the stretch of the game, the game got a little emotional and maybe a little panicky for you guys, do you have things that you tell yourself to try and calm yourself down or what are you telling yourself during that point in the game to try and keep your focus? </p>
<p>	Q.  How hard or easy was it to let last night go? </p>
