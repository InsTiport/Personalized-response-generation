<p>	Q. How do you feel and are you going to be 100% for tomorrow?</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you remember about your first year in being guarded by Bruce during practice?  We asked Duncan what Bowen's defense was like and he said we should ask you. </p>
<p>	Q.  There's a little confusion over your injury, a lot of people thought it was your knee.  Can you talk about it.  Was it a bruised quad?  Did it tighten up overnight?  Any swelling? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said that when you first came in you came back physically and mentally, explain how you come back mentally from your first off-game after two really big games?</p>
<p>	Q.  But you personally, too, will it be tough for you to come back from that game? </p>
<p>	Q.  How would you describe how they played defense against you personally yesterday? </p>
<p>	Q.  What do you have to do specifically going into Game 4 so that you can work around some of that stuff? </p>
<p>	Q.  Just the way they played all of you guys a little more aggressively. </p>
<p>	Q.  When you came into this league, you were a bench player and then you became a role player and now you're a guy that a lot of people are looking at now.  I know the other day you said you didn't feel that comfortable with it, but I wanted to ask you, are you ready to deal with that and how difficult do you think it will be to deal as a spotlight player, where people are kind of looking at you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Just kind of follow-up on that, do you feel that's just your temperament and that's how you approach things, or do you think there's a difference in being a very good player and a player who is willing to accept the responsibilities of being a star and that obligation every night?  Is that something you've prepared yourself for or temperamentally is that just who you are? </p>
<p>	Q.  Richard Hamilton says he's very sore after playing you, you're probably one of most physical guys in the league, you play with every single part of your body, you hit hard, etc. Is that a fair description of Manu Ginobli?</p>
<p>	Q.  Having been a go-to player all your life to coming to the pros, how much has it affected your game playing with a player like Tim and especially in this series and the last few games, what has it meant for you as a player when Tim plays well and when Tim doesn't play well like he did last night?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk a little bit about the rebounding edge that the Pistons have enjoyed in two out of the three games here so far? </p>
