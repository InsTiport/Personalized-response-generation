<p>	Q.  They tried very hard tonight to make shooters out of Tony (Parker) and you and -- how much more difficult did that make it for your game?</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys started out pretty close at the halftime and you held the Suns, the Suns were 2 for 15 when you guys went on your run.  Was there defensive adjustments that you made at halftime or poor shooting or combination?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the determination you guys had, a lot of guys coming over early getting some work in early, Tony (Parker) and Tim (Duncan), not usually here, 45 minutes ahead taking the first bus, was it we're going to end it tonight?</p>
