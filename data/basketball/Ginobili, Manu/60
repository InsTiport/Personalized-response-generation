<p>	Q. Talk about the play that set up the Robert Horry play, did you think you could get the Pistons to trap in the corner? </p>
<p>	Q.  So Robert didn't say anything to you, as he does once in a while? </p>
<p>	Q.  Why is the corner the best place for you to get it there, because it seems like that's where you were supposed to get it, right?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is another chapter for Robert Horry in terms of the playoffs.  From your eyes, what is it about him that he's able to come up clutch in so many situations? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Popovich said after regulation, you had kind of said some things to try to get the guys back up after the missed opportunity there at the end.  What kind of things did you say to try to get him back up? </p>
<p>	Q.  You are a relative newcomer to the league, are you aware of the big-play performances in Horry's career that he's had in The Finals and all the rings and everything? </p>
<p>	Q.  You seemed to be able to get to the rim a lot more tonight, was that something the defense was doing or were you just being more aggressive?</p>
