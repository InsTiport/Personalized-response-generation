<p>	Q. I just asked the coach about this, but can you talk to us about how you and he came to an agreement on how much artistic freedom you would have on the court, you know, how wild and crazy you could get. </p>
<p>	Q.  Has this been a season where it's been like that from the start where you've had that freedom?</p>
<p>	Q.  Pop was saying that the franchise has been very fortunate to be able to get guys like yourself and Tony and Beno late in the draft, do you think it's been good fortune and good luck that he's been able to find you guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you surprise yourself ever at anything that you do on the court where you get one of those off-balance, crazy shots to fall and say, man, I didn't think I could make that shot but I did?</p>
<p>	Q.  Kind of a two-part question, one, I'm curious how many languages you learned being a part of this team with the international flavor, and secondly, do you see this current Spurs team as kind of the future of what the NBA is going to look like in a few years?</p>
<p>	Q.  And the languages?</p>
<p>	Q.  One of your teammates said that it's like you have a clock inside your body that goes off when you realize that your team needs a basket and needs a lift and in a crucial situation, you know when to go and when to push it and when to drive a little bit more aggressively.  In some players in this league, that clock is going off all the time.  How do you know when to rein that in and is it that you have a clock inside your body that tells you when to do that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Manu, the year you were drafted, did you know that the Spurs were interested in you?  Did you expect them to draft you, and were there other teams that had expressed interest that you thought might draft you? </p>
<p>	Q.  From a player's standpoint, can you describe what it's like to be in a Gregg Popovich huddle, especially when the team is not playing well like in the first quarter? </p>
