<p>	Q. What has changed so dramatically from Games 1 and 2 to Games 3 and 4 for you? </p>
<p>	Q.  You did on the first possession of the third quarter drive to the basket.  Were you trying to get yourself started at that point?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is it time for some radical, tactical changes, like maybe going to small ball, four small guys, play more up-tempo, because here you guys have slowed it down in the last two games I mentally compared to the first two, and maybe try some zone because they don't shoot many threes. </p>
<p>	Q.  The two games here have seemed a lot more physical than the games in San Antonio, how much tougher has that made it on you with your style?</p>
<p>	Q.  You're saying it's not X's and O's, but still, do you feel like their defense has decided not to let you and Parker penetrate; they prefer that you take the outside shots? </p>
