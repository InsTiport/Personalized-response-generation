<p>	Q. You started out slow and then you played stronger. </p>
<p>	Q.  Your scoring obviously was big tonight but another big factor was your rebounding, your team rebounding, you were a big factor in that.  Could you talk about the team rebounding and your focus there. </p>
<p>	Q.  Compared to two years ago, you just talked about your patience, are you a more patient player, are you a more confident player?  How has your game developed since your last trip to The Finals? </p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously you got on a roll, but did you sense that maybe their energy level wasn't the same as yours, and that's why you kept going out and you wanted to keep going at them in the fourth? </p>
<p>	Q.  Tell us about what you expect the adjustments they will make come Sunday overall and against yourself. </p>
<p>	Q.  Your fourth-quarter play seemed to spark your team tonight to victory.  Can you compare your fourth quarter tonight to other stretches in other past games.  How does this game, how does this stretch match up?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk a little about what it says about the Spurs when y'all can score 120 and run with Phoenix and then when you get two defensive-oriented teams, what the difference is, how y'all adjust. </p>
