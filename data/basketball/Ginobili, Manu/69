<p>	Q. In this era, there's 30 teams in the NBA, 420 players, do you realize there are 35 players around that are left-handed, that's one of the things I see that makes you special.  What are some of the things that you see that make you special and have made you been able to be dominant in these playoffs? </p>
<p>	Q.  At the beginning of the playoffs, Carlos Delfino was a little bit upset that he was not on the playoff roster, and he made that kind of public and players on his team calmed him down.  Have you spoken to him throughout the post-season about that at all? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little about Tony Parker's maturation process, the difference between Tony in The Finals in 2005 versus 2003, and whether or not you guys have more confidence in him as a floor leader than two years ago? </p>
<p>	Q.  Your playoff numbers are up so dramatically offensively in each of the three years you've been in, can you just talk about, one, how much pride you take in that, and two, what are the main things that you're doing this year that you're better at than you've done in the past? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've made some incredible plays throughout the playoffs, some of the drives, some of the layups, and your teammates have said when the ball is in his hand, we don't know what's going to happen.  What is your mindset on some of those plays as you're driving in a lane or switching hands?</p>
<p>	Q.  I read something last round that you said the Olympics kind of helped your confidence and maybe helped Popovich allow you some more of that freedom, can you expand on that a little bit?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the relationship between the two coaches and what that adds to this series? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about what makes the Pistons a great team in this era of free agency and also do you consider three championships in seven years a dynasty?</p>
<p>	Q.  Yes, I do. (Laughter)</p>
<p>	Q.  Will you take us back briefly to the early days in your basketball career, how you started in basketball as a career, what got you into it and how you developed your style, the people you patterned yourself after. </p>
<p>	Q.  Yeah. </p>
<p>	Q.  What does Robert Horry mean to a team with so many young guys like yourself, you guys have won some championships in the past, but this guy has won wherever he has gone. </p>
