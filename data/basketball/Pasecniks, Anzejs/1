 Q.  Can you start out with an opening statement, what you'll bring to the Magic?  
ANZEJS PASECNIKS: I mean, at the moment, my game, like European basketball, like on offense, we share the ball, we do a lot of pick-and-roll at the moment, but I think in a couple years or in a couple months I'm going to improve my game one-on-one.  So that's what I'm going to do at the Magic.   
 Q.  Seems like the reports are that you've been traded to Philadelphia.  Have you had any conversations with them at all or any workouts with them in the pre-draft process?  
ANZEJS PASECNIKS: No, actually that's likely surprised me.   
 Q.  What do you think you need to work on in your game to improve yourself?  
ANZEJS PASECNIKS: Actually I have to improve everything.  I have to improve my skills, my physicals, like my legs, my body, so those are the main things, and that's what I have to concentrate at the moment.   
 Q.  What is your contract situation overseas?  Do you have any plan in that regard?  
ANZEJS PASECNIKS: I have a contract with Gran Canaria for two more years, so at the moment that's all I know, and I'm thinking just about that.   
 Q.  Growing up in Latvia, were you able to watch NBA games easily?  Is there someone that you tried to model your game after as a young kid?  
ANZEJS PASECNIKS: I was like all kids, I was watching LeBron, Kobe, Durant, Allen Iverson.  I was hoping one day I'm going to be there, too, and now I'm hoping that one day other kids are going to watch my top moments and think that he wants to be like me one day.   
 Q.  Do you know anything about the current Sixers organization, what the team is looking like, anything about them specifically?  
ANZEJS PASECNIKS: Like I said, I didn't talk to them, so I don't know much.
