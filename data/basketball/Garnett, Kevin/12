		   KEVIN GARNETT: I thought they were a lot more aggressive than we were yesterday obviously. We'll make the proper adjustments and come back stronger Game 2.

 Q. You were pretty hard on yourself last night. 
 KEVIN GARNETT: Absolutely.

 Q. How bad do you want to get back out there?
 KEVIN GARNETT: I've got to be in control. I've got to be aggressive. 

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 KEVIN GARNETT: What I do well is make plays for other guys, bring a sense of making sure guys are communicating defensively, bringing a solid presence to that end, and I did none of those things. 

 Q. In terms of attacking Pau --
 KEVIN GARNETT: It's not a one-on-one situation between me and Pau; just Lakers versus Celtics. You know, it's the Lakers team, but I've got to be able to be a lot more aggressive than that, so I will. 

 Q. (Question regarding 2008). 
 KEVIN GARNETT: Not at all. I have no comments for his comments. 

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 KEVIN GARNETT: Well, we didn't get shots. I thought for the most part I don't think that we played well together obviously. But I still think there were chances in the game where we could have put a run together and made it interesting, but we just didn't. 

 Q. You guys are good at responding after games like this. What do you plan to do?
 KEVIN GARNETT: Just that, respond. 

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 KEVIN GARNETT: I mean, to really be honest, they just played really well. Playoffs is about making adjustments, and we're no different from that. So we're going to make the proper adjustments and hopefully apply them in Game 2.
