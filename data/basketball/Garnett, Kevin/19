 Q. Can I you talk about how well the trade went for Denver and Chauncey? 
 KEVIN GARNETT: He is a great friend, great family. He is not only back home with his family but the way he started, seeing him healthy and turn the team around, being productive. One of the best in the league. 
 I think what he is doing for Denver overall, it is just not -- not just for the team but in the community, I know he is active, people around there look up to him, I love him.

 Q. Who is your favorite All-Star besides your teammates? 
 KEVIN GARNETT: I enjoy all these guys. I don't have one particular person. I'm not in awe of anybody since MJ has used to come to these things. I do have an appreciation for all the players, the work ethic and the abilities. 
 Try to relax and sit back a little bit, not make it too competitive trying to really enjoy the weekend.
