 Q. How happy are you to be here? How excited are you to get going in this Finals?
 KEVIN GARNETT: Happy to be here like anybody else. Very fortunate, ready to get this thing started.

 Q. What's it like to be back in LA for The Finals? 
 KEVIN GARNETT: LA is always a trip. It's cool. Always cool weather. There's always good competition between the two teams. 

 Q. How much of a big deal is it for you guys to come into this place and (inaudible). 
 KEVIN GARNETT: I'm not into the records. I don't look at stats like that. It's important that we come here and play well. It's very important that we come here and play solid, nothing less than that. By any means necessary.

 Q. You guys have been very vocal about the rivalry and the tradition; the Lakers haven't. Does that surprise you at all?
 KEVIN GARNETT: I haven't really gave it much thought, to be honest. I don't think we've been speaking that much about the rivalry. I think everybody forgets that they're the defending champs. We're not into the rivalry. The past is the past and history is what it is. 

 Q. How much did the downtime help, a couple days off for you guys?
 KEVIN GARNETT: Rest is always good. I think obviously for both teams rest is probably central at this point. 

 Q. You played against the same team two years ago and won, so do you have confidence that it's going to be the same --
 KEVIN GARNETT: We're playing a whole different Laker team than two years ago. Bynum is out obviously. They have a new team, Artest, new additions. This is a totally different looking team than two years ago.
