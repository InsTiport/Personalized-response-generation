  Q. You were in a pretty crazy plane.   
 KEVIN GARNETT: Yeah, yeah. It wasn't that crazy. The landing was a little different, flying into this Texas weather. This is weather like we usually have back in Boston. It's all good.   
  
  Q. When you talk about adversity and hardship sometimes make you better, make you grow, do you feel like that's happening with you?   
 KEVIN GARNETT: Is this what the basis of All-Star weekend is going to be right here? When you get things that happen to you, man, it makes you stronger. It requires some patience and understanding, knowing my body, preserving my legs and such. At this point everybody is banged up. It's just the way our league is.  
  
  Q. The patience you're talking about (Inaudible)?  
 KEVIN GARNETT: It's a good thing. Patience is a good thing.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible).   
 KEVIN GARNETT: I've never played in front of a crowd like this, so we'll see. It should be fun. It's great playing here in Dallas, great city. The weather is what it is. It's not supposed to be here for too long, so that's a good thing.
