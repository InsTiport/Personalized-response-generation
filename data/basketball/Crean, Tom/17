Dayton - 80, Georgia - 61
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening statement from coach.
TOM CREAN: Biggest thing, and I've felt this for a long time after my experience of being here, but especially with this team coming in here, we knew we were going to be coming, at least I knew we were going to be coming in against a whole different level of intensity, physicality, the way guys play, the way they play together. And that's where we're at. And we got exposed by that. And we did not come out with the right, we did not come out understanding what we needed to do from the very beginning with the game plan, which was to not play behind Obi Toppin, which was to be more physical, but especially use our length more. When he caught it, get down on the dribble, and be able to come and attack.
The other big part of it on the offensive end, which is so disappointing to me because we have been having more success with it, we want to be to play through the paint. And we at one point, we were 1-19 at halftime, I believe. I think we ended up, before we made a couple of threes at the end, we sat one in the 20s of not going through the paint. And we were 25 of 42 when we did go through the paint. And that's what we got to understand. And I've got to find the guys -- this is not about coming in here and developing inside of the Maui Invitational. This is about guys that are going to come in and understand that it has all moved up. The level of intensity, the level of play has moved up, and we have got to be able to answer that bell. And we get a chance to turn around and go right again or right away again tomorrow. But the formula that we have has to be the formula that we travel with. And it doesn't mean the shots are going to go. It doesn't mean that we're going to be successful. But it does mean we're going to be aggressive. It does mean that we're going to follow, especially when you're playing a player like Obi Toppin. But it does mean offensively that we're going to get through that paint. And to me, that's just as disappointing as anything we didn't do on the defensive end, because there were far too many times the ball didn't get reversed. When we were able to cut, we were able to get really good things done. When we were able to move it from side to side, we were able to get things done even if the shot didn't go. And we had too many guys play like they hadn't been in a high level game like this. And really with all honesty, I looked out at one point in time, we had five freshmen in. We haven't. So we'll learn from it.
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student-athletes.
Q. First half, turned the ball over. What were they doing to you guys that made it difficult to get into your offense? For both the players.
TYE FAGAN: I believe that, like Coach said, on offense we were very stagnant in the first half. There wasn't enough cut in the ball movement. The ball was staying in one place a lot of times. We didn't get to the rim and kick out, we didn't play from inside out, like we should, and that's the plan and we failed to do that.
SAHRIV WHEELER: Like Coach said, which is no excuse, but just playing at this level, this intensity, the amount of fans that are into it, the pressure that's on to us, it's not really any pressure, but just what's at stake at this level, especially in this Maui Invitational, it's a first for all of us. Maybe we weren't used to that as, when we played some decent basketball we had turnovers down, we were sharing the ball, we were cutting and that's just stuff we're going to look back on film and get better from and continue to move forward.
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you. We'll take questions for coach.
Q. You talked a little bit about getting prepared for the tough play. I know part of it is your trying to build a culture here. The dust settles tonight, what -- you talked about playing through the paint, but what are some of the things, other things you want to work on to kind of be ready tomorrow to kind of get a different result?
TOM CREAN: Well it has to be a mentality, it really does. It has to be inside of you that you got to really turn around and respond. Like I said to the team after the game, for every minute that you spend pouting or worrying or rationalizing, that's a minute you waste on getting yourself ready for the next day and that's really what it comes down to. We got really good kids, you got, you have to learn how to win and part of the winning is the mentality that you bring into it and what you learn from it. So the bottom line to me is the stagnant -- we knew they were very, very good in the middle of the floor defensively and that's not how we wanted to attack. We wanted to get the ball reversed, get our cutting going, get it to the side and then get it back to the middle once we would get them moving around. And so that's what we're going to have to do. We can play anybody in the country and we're not going to be successful if we come down and we try to play right through the middle right off the beginning of the clock. And then we have to continue to be aggressive. It was a one-point differential in the second half. I'm sure I'll watch the film and I'll see some good things, but the bottom line is we knew we were going against a really, really good team and they were, they were every bit as good as I thought they were on film and we did not respond the way that we need to respond to it as wholly as we need to. So we have to turn around and have a much better response tomorrow.
