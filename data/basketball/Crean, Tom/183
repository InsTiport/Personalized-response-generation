<p>	Q.  Would you adjust pace as it pertains to Kansas, what your ideas may be on that tomorrow?</p>
<p>	Q.  Yes. </p>
<p>	Q.  Much has been written about the return to Marquette's glory days since the '77 Championship.  I was Coach Majerus says he feels some of your predecessors distanced themselves from that past and you've embraced that.  Can you talk about your relationship with Coach McGuire?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you at the same time talk about your relationship with Jim Boeheim, Bernie Fine, how instrumental they've been in advancing your career?</p>
<p>	Q.  There was a lot of focus last week about your big men's matchups against the Pitt guys, then the second game, too.  Can you talk about more of a challenge or different of a challenge is Collison going to be for them?</p>
<p>	Q.  With all of Marquette's success this year, your name is being mentioned with other jobs.  How do you handle that?  Has it been a distraction for your team?</p>
<p>	Q.  A lot has been made about "mid major" teams making it here.  How proud are you of that?  Why is it so hard for a non-BCS school?</p>
<p>	Q.  All right. </p>
<p>	Q.  Three of the teams here have a first time All-American, the fourth has maybe the best freshman in the country.  Do you need that kind of special player to get to this level and to win at this level?</p>
<p>	Q.  In your opinion, does Dwyane have to have a similar stat line that he did against Kentucky for you guys to come out with a victory?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you discuss Robert Jackson a little bit, where you'd be without him?  Did you have any apprehensions about taking a one-year transfer?</p>

<p>	Q.  Tell us what kind of coach is Coach Crean? </p>

<p>	Q.  When you were being recruited by Marquette, considering other schools, did the idea that you could be at this level ever come into your mind at that point? </p>

<p>	Q.  Dwyane, any pressure that you feel to duplicate 29-11-11 from last weekend? </p>
<p>	Q.  The last time Marquette won a championship was in 1977, which obviously was before either one of you were born.  What did you know about it before you got to Marquette?  What have you learned about it in the last three weeks? </p>

<p>	Q.  How important in the recruiting process is your coach?  Recently coaches have left to go to other programs.  Some of the players are disillusioned.  How important is a coach in the recruiting process to you?  What would it mean if a coach would leave? </p>

<p>	Q.  Travis, TJ Ford has gotten the bulk of the attention.  Aaron Miles has experience here at the Final Four, pretty good season.  Can you talk about what it's going to be like being matched up against him? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you kind of assess what you've seen as far as Kansas, their fast break, transition game, what's going to be important to slow them down? </p>
<p>	Q.  There's always a lot of talk this time of year about whether college athletes should be paid or not.  What are your thoughts?  Do you guys deserve more than what you're getting? </p>

<p>	Q.  Travis, the North Carolina situation where basically their best players had an insurrection to get rid of the coach, can you imagine that ever happening?  No allegations of physical abuse or anything like that.  Can you see any situation where on a college or high school level, that could or should happen? </p>
<p>	Q.  Dwyane, what has Coach Schwab meant to you inspirationally?  Do you see him as one fighting the good fight, battle?</p>

<p>	Q.  When Dwyane is having one of his special performances like he did Saturday against Kentucky, how do you resist the temptation to just stop and watch, let him do everything?</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously there's two Big-12 teams here this year, just like last year.  They kind of like to talk about how playing during the season really prepares them for the post-season.  Do you feel like Big-12 teams are any more prepared than you are?  Does conference affiliation mean anything at this point? </p>
<p>	Q.  With being linked to the '77 team, we talked about how is it's a blessing, does it make you anxious to make a name for yourself?</p>

<p>	Q.  Compared to Marquette, the three other schools here are behemoths and probably will have a lot more fan support in the stands.  Is that something you think about?  Is it something that makes you guys feel special or motivates you? </p>
