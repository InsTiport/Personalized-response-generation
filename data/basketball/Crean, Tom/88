Indiana - 82 Ottawa - 54
COACH CREAN: The highlights of the night for me are the way we came back.  There's so many things that happen in a game when momentum is up for grabs.  We got up 12 in the first half, we didn't close it, we didn't close the door on them.  We had some turnovers, some home run-type plays rather than coming down.  At the same time it was simultaneous with wanting to get in the bonus.  We didn't do it as quick as we would have liked.  We adjusted in the second half.
