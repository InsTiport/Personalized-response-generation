<p>	Q.  Thank you very much for your ability; we really appreciate it.  Congratulations.</p>

<p>	Q.  I was talking yesterday to Coach Williams.  He was talking about his own team.  He said one of the biggest differences - in fact, the biggest difference - between this year's team and last year's team is relative bench strength.  He feels that what he's got this year is not nearly what he had last year.  Is that your impression as well? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about Nick Collison, what makes him a little different? </p>
<p>	Q.  Question about Travis Diener.  You know, a lot of times you hear that a point guard is an extension of the coach on the floor.  I guess, one, with Travis, I guess I want you to comment on that.  Two, I'm just wondering, you know, a lot of people talk about your intensity, as well as Travis' intensity.  I'm wondering if perhaps when you were recruiting Travis if maybe that was part of the attraction, you know, for him as a player? </p>
<p>	Q.  Tom, I was wondering, do you sense that your kids have an appreciation for Al McGuire and his legacy there at Marquette? </p>
<p>	Q.  Yes, I can. </p>
<p>	Q.  What have been the keys to the development for Dwayne Wade over the last few years?  How has he handled his multiple roles of player, student, husband, father?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was curious, throughout the season, did you ever think you would be in the Final Four?  At what point in the season did you say, "Oh, man, I think we have a chance"? </p>
<p>	Q.  Your name, with all the coaching vacancies, is being thrown out there either with or without substance.  How do you handle that right now, especially with your team and coming into this situation this weekend? </p>
<p>	Q.  Tom, I think most people considered Hinrich, Wade and T.J. Ford to be about the three best guards in the country this year.  Do you think it's any coincidence they're all in the Final Four?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think that because so many kids are leaving school early and teams are younger that guard play is even more important when you're surrounded by a bunch of freshmen and sophomore front court players?</p>
<p>	Q.  Right before the tournament began, there was a lot of publicity about I don't know whether it be scandal or just kind of impropriety in college basketball.  That was kind of the story going in.  I wonder your reaction to the fact that's kind of been overshadowed by basketball.  And now, as you get to the end, that seems to kind of be forgotten?</p>
<p>	Q.  Good, thanks. </p>
