Indiana - 86, Creighton - 65

COACH CREAN: First thing I want to do is thank the fans and especially all the students that didn't go home when they could have.  The energy in there was fantastic, just from start to finish, it really was.  Could hear it in the back during warm-ups, and never take that for granted.  To see that kind of turn out tonight, especially with the weekend coming up the way it is and next week coming up to have them stay was big.  Our team fed off that.  Our team was really ready to play.
