Q. What was the summer like for you Deonte, you get on the Summer League team, do a great job and get signed by the Thunder?  What was that whole process like for you?
DEONTE BURTON: Scary.  It was really scary to be playing with your like nose broke and not knowing like everything right away.  So that was really nerve-racking.
Q. How tough was that to play with the nose situation, knowing that you're trying to make an impression for your career and all those things?  Had you ever gone through anything like that before, and how do you think you did?
DEONTE BURTON: No, that was my first time having some adversity like that, and I think I did well with it.  Playing with the mask, it kind of threw off my depth perception, but I managed.
Q. We asked Abdel this, a couple Iowa State guys in town now.  Does it help to have an old pal from college as you come to someplace new?
DEONTE BURTON: Yes, because you're able to get more comfortable faster because you have somebody who is going through it with you and you know them personally.  So it helps a lot.
Q. Deonte, where do you see yourself playing in the NBA?  Some people have you listed as a wing, some maybe as like a 3-4, small ball 4.  Where do you see yourself playing in the league?
DEONTE BURTON: I see myself playing wherever it gets me on the floor.  I don't really care where I play, I just want to be on the floor.
