 Q.   Coach, can you just tell us what you know about Kyrie so far?   
COACH BLATT:   He's with the doctors right now being evaluated.   I can't give you any specifics yet.   I just don't know.  
   
 Q.   What happened in overtime?   You guys just stalled out.   What did you see?   
COACH BLATT:   I thought we came out of the regulation flat and without the kind of energy that we had displayed throughout the game.   They made a few plays.   I mean, the first minute or minute and a half no one scored, and it seemed like once they got a basket or two we kind of dropped and they took the momentum and obviously continued throughout the overtime.   We sort of dropped off the map a little bit.  
   
 Q.   Was that maybe fatigue?   
COACH BLATT:   Could have been.   Yes, definitely could have been.  
   
 Q.   You guys had a big rebounding advantages in the first and third quarters, if I'm not mistaken.   It kind of went back and forth.   I was curious if you had kind of a reason why they outrebounded you so badly in the fourth?   
COACH BLATT:   Honestly, no, not at this time.   I'll have to look at the tape and give you a more intelligent answer.   But, obviously, that's very important.   It was a possession game.   A basket here and a basket there.   
So part of that certainly is securing the basketball, and we didn't do a good enough job of it in that respect in the fourth quarter.  
   
 Q.   I know you can't quite provide a status update on Kyrie, but was the contact with Barnes' knee?   Is that how it occurred?   Do you know how the aggravation occurred?   
COACH BLATT:   I don't think so, but I haven't really seen the tape yet, so it's hard for me to tell you.   But I don't think it was a contact injury, no.  
   
 Q.   First of all, did you feel as if the game was in your hands after that great start in the first quarter?   Secondly, if you can say something to your viewers in Israel, tens of thousands woke up in the middle of the night to watch your game.   
COACH BLATT:   Well, we did start extremely well.   We were prepared, and we had a game plan that we followed well early.   But the NBA game is a long game.   A 48‑minute game is a long game, lot of stops, lot of changes in momentum.   You know, a tough away game.   
Teams are going to make their runs.   They did.   We ran back.   They did, we ran back.   But still we were in a position to win that game in a very tough and hard‑fought game by both sides.   
To the tens of thousands or more that woke up in the middle of the night in Israel, I'm sorry.   But I hope you enjoyed it, and you certainly saw a good game, and I appreciate the fact that they follow us the way they do.  
   
 Q.   Coach, did you expect such a great offensive performance from LeBron tonight, him being so aggressive?   Forgetting about the assists and rebounds and just keep scoring and being aggressive for you guys?   
COACH BLATT:   Well, first of all, he did attack and play and perform at the highest level on the biggest stage in the game, which is appropriate for him.   
We've got to do more around him.  
   
 Q.   Your bench and some of your role players have been so big, especially the last couple of rounds.   Tonight their bench, 34 points, Iguodala and Speights off the bench.   Was that kind of the difference tonight you think their bench versus maybe the contributions just not coming from you guys?   
COACH BLATT:   I think that was a pretty significant factor, obviously.   In terms of numbers and in terms of the lift that they got.   But our bench has been good throughout the playoffs, as you know and, and as you stated, tonight less so.   We missed their contribution.  
   
 Q.   Coach, J.R. Smith, following up on that he request, J.R. Smith, 3‑for‑13, seven misses from three.   Were there some possessions you'd like to get back?   It just seemed that he was releasing too quickly in the 24 clock?   
COACH BLATT:   No.   Actually, I'd like to see us frame up for some more shots, you know, to get him good looks.   He's a shot maker and a tough shot maker.   But the more open looks that we can get for him, the better for us.   That's what he does for us.   That's what he's supposed to do.   We just need to get him better shots.  
   
 Q.   Are you going to try and get your bench more minutes in the next game, get more guys in?   Can you do that?   
COACH BLATT:   Certainly we can, but at the end of the day, people, it was a one‑shot game.   You're there in the first game of the NBA Finals on an away floor, and we were in position to win that game.   So in retrospect, yes, would have liked to have done that.   
Realistically, we put ourselves in position to win that game the way we played it.   But like every other game, you look, and you see, and you adjust.   When and if necessary, you change tactic.
