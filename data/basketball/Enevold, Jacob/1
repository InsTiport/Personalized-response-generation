MODERATOR:   Jacob Jensen and Gary Ritz Jr. Will represent the student body for the Drake Bulldogs.   Ray Giacoletti, the head coach, is in the middle.   
COACH GIACOLETTI:   So many ebbs and flows in 45 minutes.   Proud of our guys to fight back from down at halftime to take the lead.   Just so many different‑‑ you get down four or five points, fight your way back, get up three points.   
Barnes hits the three in transition out of our press, and actually that's what normally you want, them to shoot the ball quick.   That's what you're going to give up.   And he hit it.   That's on me.   
The last play was designed to be thrown long, and our timing wasn't right.   We've got to do a better job of being able to execute those kinds of things down the stretch.   But I'm proud of this group, and they continue to fight.   
From where we were at Christmas to where we're at now is two different teams.   I just feel bad for the guys in that locker room not to be able to play another game.  
   
 Q.   Jacob, I know it's a loss, but can you‑‑ what can you take from this game today?   24 points and 12 rebounds.   Is this something you can take over the summer?   
JACOB ENEVOLD:   Yeah, definitely.   For me, it was just kind of sealing the deal.   Just getting on it with being on the most improved teams, kind of like he said in the statement.   
I can definitely use it over the summer going in with the international team.   So it's just a great confidence booster leading up to next season.   So I'll take that with me.  
   
 Q.   The second half wore down.   You kept going to the line and shooting free throws in a close game like that, how does it feel?   How did you keep your composure?   
JACOB ENEVOLD:   I don't know.   That's a good question.   I just had it today.   I wasn't worried about anything.   The audience wasn't getting to me, not that they usually do.   I was just‑‑ I don't know.   I was just at ease, I guess, and that's when I shoot the best.   
THE MODERATOR:   Anything else for Gary or Jacob?   We'll dismiss you guys.   Thank you for coming up.   We'll stay with Ray Giacoletti for a little bit longer.  
   
 Q.   Coach, just talk about‑‑ you touched on from about December to now.   What are the things you're going to have to do now maybe in the next month to kind of take what you have.   It's about eight new faces you're going to have.   So what do you do?   What's the next couple three months?   
COACH GIACOLETTI:   Well, to take care of what we have right now.   There's five freshmen and Jacob that will be here and with Kale and Graham.   So eight we'll have throughout the school year, and each of the four freshmen will kind of be at different times.   
So it's a little bit different and unique this summer because we're going to go on a European trip in August.   So we're going to get ten days of practice.   It's probably the ideal year to do that with trying to integrate.   Even though Kale and Graham didn't play, they were at practice every single day.   I say it every year.   You walk out of practice feeling really good, and you don't have those three guys in games, it's a little bit different.   
We'll get to all that.   Just need to digest what took place.   I said all along, after two years, once this season was going to be over, the foundation's pretty solid for moving along here now.   It really is.   My head's not into where we're going.   It's just still left from what just took place.   
I just feel bad for those guys.   I've done this 30 years and been in a lot of different situations and teams, especially at Christmas‑‑ good times, tough times.   Never been in one as tough as we were in‑‑ I mean, we've never been that competitive.   For those guys to be able to dig in.   We all took three days and then compete and then go win six conference games.   
Even there at the last, we're overtime with Loyola to get out of Thursday games.   Six‑point game on the road at southern, there's a big difference between not being able to compete, competing, and then going and winning games.   
I think those seniors can‑‑ they're going to have some pitfalls in life‑‑ family, marriage, job, whatever it is.   That's what I told them, go back to where we were at Christmas, and you can get through anything.   Most students never go through anything like that.   Most adults don't go through anything like that.   They went through it and found a way to get to the other side.   
Now, were we perfect?   Did we end perfect?   No.   But from where it was to where we are now, light years.   Light years.   So it's a great credit to those special five seniors.  
   
 Q.   With 2.7 seconds left, is that the point guys need to avoid anything that would even resemble a foul at that point?   How did you see that?   
COACH GIACOLETTI:   No.   It was on a pass.   So the way I saw it, Gary was helping and trying to jump in the passing lanes.   I wasn't close enough.   He somehow got his hand on wrist or something.   He was doing the correct thing.   
If you're on the ball, yeah, we don't want to try to slap down or make something crazy, but his help came from off the ball.   I thought it was‑‑ he was able to get hand or arm somehow, but what he did was sound.   
Again, it happened so darn quick, I couldn't see it.   That's why I was a little confused.   If he would have been on the ball, that was his man.   I'm sure he fouled.   The official was standing right there.   But he was off the ball and trying to make a play on the ball, which is what we want.   Don't want to foul, but he was doing the correct technique anyway.   
THE MODERATOR:   Ray, thank you very much.   Best of luck.
