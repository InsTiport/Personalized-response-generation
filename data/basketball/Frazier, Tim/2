MODERATOR:   We'll ask Coach Chambers to make an opening statement and then go to questions for Tim and Trey.                 Coach? 
COACH CHAMBERS:   Indiana played great basketball.   Very tough, very physical.   Obviously the 20 or 16 offensive rebounds, 36 attempts from the free‑throw line, we wanted to take away their threes.   For us, we did a pretty good job, but they drove the basketball.   They did some good things. 
MODERATOR:   Question for the student‑athletes? 

Q.   This question is for Tim.   Tim, just talk about what IU did differently in the second half to slow you down.   You had 19 at half time. 
TIM FRAZIER:   I think they went to a zone.   They was able to try keep me out of the paint.
MODERATOR:   Other questions?   Anybody? 
Okay, fellows.   You may return to the locker room. 
Questions for Coach Chambers? 

Q.   Coach, when you set up to play Indiana, how big an issue is Cody Zeller?
COACH CHAMBERS:   I'm sorry.   I couldn't hear you.

Q.   When you set your team up to play Indiana, how big an issue is Cody?
COACH CHAMBERS:   Yeah, he's a problem, you know, because if they're not shooting, then they can just put it inside.   And he shoots at such a great clip.   He's just not a big, he's an athletic big.   He's strong and he's physical.   He plays like a wily veteran.   He's a very different match‑up for anybody, especially us, because we're a little bit small. 

Q.   Coach, your first year in the Big Ten.   If you would, could you just assess the 18‑game schedule and then the Big Ten tournament, just what it's like being in the Big Ten?
COACH CHAMBERS:   I love it.   I absolutely love it.   I love this league.   I love being a part of this.   I really enjoyed matching wits with some of the greatest coaches of all time. 
And it's hard.   It's hard to win on the road.   Very difficult.   But I really enjoyed this year, I've got to be honest.   I'm disappointed we lost, but I'm excited about the future, and I look forward to getting to work tomorrow to start building that future.

Q.   You talk about what Zeller brings to this team.   How difficult is it to get back into a game when you have a big guy that can shoot free throws like that when they're working through him and the clock is running down in the second half?
COACH CHAMBERS:   It was a little bit of both.   They were not only putting it into him, I think he had seven offensive rebounds.   That was critical. 
And, yeah, to get a big man who can make free throws, it makes the game a lot easier.   When you're guard‑oriented, you're hoping your guard can get you to the free‑throw line, but when you have a big who can make free throws, man, that's a whole new dynamic. 
MODERATOR:   Any further questions? 
Thank you, Coach.
