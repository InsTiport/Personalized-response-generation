 Q.   Tim, you guys got behind at the start.   I think you were 2 of 18.   Can you just talk about what Minnesota did to you guys, or were you just missing shots?   
TIM FRAZIER:   I think we just missed shots, but obviously Minnesota wants to speed you up with their defense.   That's why they pressed full court throughout the whole game.   I don't know if we shot our shots fast, but it took us a while to knock down some shots.  
   
 Q.   Just talk about ‑‑ I think you guys got down 13 or 14.   Talk about how you got back into the game and there was that one big shot that Hollins made.   
TIM FRANZIER:   We just wanted to continue to fight.   Never once did we think we were out of the game.   We were making runs and wanted to continue to fight to get back into the game, cut it down to a single possession game, single possession points, and obviously Austin Hollins made a great shot.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the resolve of this team.   You guys played a full 40 minutes.   Talk about coming back and digging in as long as you could and just making it a game.   
TIM FRAZIER:   We just wanted to continue to fight.   That's one of our staples, to have a great attitude no matter what, continue to play as hard as we can.   We continued to do that, and we cut it back it down to single digits and made it a single possession game.   They made the winning plays they needed to make to win.   
COACH CHAMBERS:   I don't make opening statements.   Please, go ahead.   That's an opening statement (laughing).   
   
 Q.   You guys clawed back and didn't pull it off, but got close.   Your thoughts on how everything transpired down the stretch and the whole game?   
COACH CHAMBERS:   You know, you just can't give a Big Ten team a 12, 14‑point lead.   You just can't do it.   You hit the word right on the head; this has been the year of close.   I'm really tired of getting close.   We have to start getting over the hump and winning these games, and I don't know if it's a perception, I don't know if it's a mindset, I'm not sure what it is, but I've got to figure it out where we can come out and compete and know that we can win games, especially on this stage.
