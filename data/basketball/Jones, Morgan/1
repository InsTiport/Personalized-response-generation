NC State - 69, Florida State - 62   
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Florida State coach Sue Semrau and student-athletes Nicki Ekhomu and Morgan Jones.  Coach, an opening statement.   
COACH SEMRAU: I want to compliment NC State.  What Wes has done with that team, they just continue to fight and played great defense.   
It was a great experience for us, though.  It was an experience with a very young team to come in and play a top 10 team and to compete at that level.  You could see the immaturity in our team.  We'll continue to grow, and this will be a great teaching tool going forward to the NCAA Tournament.   
THE MODERATOR: Questions.   
 Q.  Looked like you struggled to cope with Cunane's height, especially early when she really established herself there.  
COACH SEMRAU: We struggled when Valencia Myers got her second foul.  She didn't play that whole half.  So that was tough for us.  We're not very deep in the post.  They're not very deep in the post.  They did a better job of not fouling.   
 Q.  You talked about what an experience, a good experience this has been with such a young team.  If you could put in perspective what this whole season has been like, because I don't think very many people expected you guys to be in the place you are.  
COACH SEMRAU: I appreciate that.  And they didn't.  And how could you, with the youth and then the three major injuries that we had.  Makes me very proud.  My juniors have carried a very heavy load and done a great job doing it, to be in a position to go and compete in the NCAA Tournament with this young team.  Really excited to have 23 wins on the year and 10 in the ACC.  I think they have accomplished a lot this year.
