COACH LARRANAGA:   Well, I think the game came down to one statistical category.   We did a lot of good things, but we just turned the ball over way too much.   They got 26 points off of our 15 turnovers.   That basically means they went 13 for 15.   Considering they made twoâ€‘point shots, we had a chance.   We took the lead.   They went right to TJ Warren. 
Our intentions were to try to keep their best two players from hurting us.   We played a triangle and two the whole second half, and they still ended up with 24 and 22, so their offense was better than our defense, and our offense gave them a lot of opportunities to score in transition.   That basically was what the game came down to.
