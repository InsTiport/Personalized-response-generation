COACH LARRANAGA:   Well, I thought both teams came out and played very well.   They shot the ball extremely well to start the game.   We were in a zone; they buried three threes.   We had to adjust our defense, we did.   Davon Reed came in and really helped us by hitting four threes in the first half.   It was like a one‑point game at halftime. 
I told our guys, it's a great game, great environment.   You've got to enjoy this moment.   We went out and I thought played a very, very solid second half, did some very, very good things, both offensively and defensively, got ourselves a chance to get a three‑point lead, and we decided to foul at the end.   They made the first, missed the second, and Eddie got the rebound.   But Erik Swoope was able to block the shot, secure the rebound, and make the free throws to secure the victory. 

Q.   Much has been said about them beating you guys twice before.   Now that you guys have a win, what is it about them that gives you so much trouble? 
COACH LARRANAGA:   I would say there are a number of things that have happened in both games.   The first game they played man‑to‑man.   We had a ten‑point lead with five minutes to go, and we just didn't finish the game well, ended up going overtime, and Jarell Eddie went off. 
So when we entered the second game, our goal was really to slow him down.   We thought if we could keep him to 10, 12 points, we'd be in great shape.   But their defense changed from being man‑to‑man to zone.   And they packed it in, and we just started shooting threes.   They were there.   Weren't terrible shots, but we didn't have the balance offensively that we like. 
We took 34 threes, which is twice as many as we normally take, and we only made seven.   Had we made 12 or 14 of the 34, I would have been very happy.   But we didn't, and they ended up being able to hold on and win that game. 
Tonight, both teams zoned initially.   We switched and went man‑to‑man.   And I think our emphasis in the second half, we went to a box and one on Jarell Eddie.   Was still keep Eddie under wraps and see if we can keep the other guys from winning the game.   That's really, basically, what happened at the defensive end.   And then at the offensive end, I think we attacked their zone much better.   We didn't settle.   I can't see without my glasses.   How many threes did we take? 
So we still made seven.   We're good at getting to seven.   So we need to get to 15 so we're seven of 15 and not seven for 25. 

Q.   I know Erik has had a pretty strong finish over the course of this season.   How influential do you feel like he was today, and Erik, talk about how things have been going and how big that block was you felt, for you, there at the end today. 
COACH LARRANAGA:   A number of things:   First, Erik is a really special person.   His attitude and his work ethic has never changed, whether he was playing like he did today, probably 35 minutes or more, or if he didn't even get in the game.   That next day you wouldn't know whether he was a starter and played every game or didn't play at all.   That's a credit to him and his family as to the kind of person he is and the kind of work ethic he has. 
He's persevered through a lot this year, but in the last month, he's been the difference.   The other guys have played similarly, but Erik gives us a great defensive presence.   He helps the other guys defensively extremely well.   He rebounds the ball.   And on offense he's taking the ball to the rim extremely well, at a very high level.   And the other guys know he's capable of doing that, so they have found him.
Instead of us having another three‑point shooter, which that's what we've had in the past, normally we've had another three‑point shooter, now we have another driver.   And by driving to the basket, Erik creates a different set of circumstances for the defense to have to handle, and he's just been great. 
ERIK SWOOPE:   As coach said, one of the main things I tried to understand was trusting what I'm good at, what the coaches have pushed that I'm good at, what my teammates had pushed, that I'm trying to get to the basket, trying to put pressure on the front court.
Going into the last few games of the season, my teammates have really been pushing me to understand what that takes and what that does for the team.   Some of the early baskets I got this game, two pretty big‑time dunks that got everybody going, it was huge because everyone‑‑ the momentum shifted in our favor, we finished the half strong.   That's been the key that I've just been trying to understand, that I need to make that my identity each and every game, and understanding that I have to push myself.   I can't have lackadaisical moments on offense and then on defense doing everything I can to help my teammates.   That's communication, that's rebounding. 
At the very end of the game I was actually frustrated with myself because we knew they were going to miss that shot, and it tipped right out of my hands.   So when Jarell Eddie got it, I just wanted to do everything I could to help my team win that game.   Luckily I came out with the tipout and the rebound and just wanted to make the free throw to seal the deal.

Q.   Mr.Brown, I thought the stat that jumped off the page to me was the difference in the free throw shooting, and the game seemed to turn on the back to back free throws, the missed pair by Virginia Tech, and then the following pair that your guys sank.   Again, the percentages showed how well you guys executed at the line.   I was wondering if Mr.Brown could comment on what he attributes his success at the line to. 
RION BROWN:   Well, this game I definitely just wanted to stick those free throws.   The last couple games I've really been struggling from the line, been missing two or three which I'm not used to, so I was actually really frustrated with myself. 
But after every practice I shoot 50 free throws, and I've really got a lot of confidence after our last practice shooting free throws.   The main thing was I didn't want to be the reason, again, that we went home.   So I stepped to that line and just wanted to make them and shoot them with confidence. 
COACH LARRANAGA:   You know, free throw shooting, I believe, has a lot to do with confidence, getting to your routine.   I thought Garrius Adams said it best after our last game where he shot very well from the foul line and someone asked him what were you thinking about during that time, and he said I wasn't thinking about anything.   That is the whole key, to be relaxed, just focused on the process.   These guys are good free‑throw shooters.   The one thing you don't want to be doing is thinking about the score, thinking about the circumstances, and tonight we did a great job, 16 for 19 from the foul line, and that was the difference. 

Q.   Jim, you have NC State now 24 hours away.   You just played them not a week and a half ago.   Does a lot of the same scouting report and knowledge of that game work for tomorrow night? 
COACH LARRANAGA:   Well, you know, we don't know what their game plan is going to be, but ours is going to be basically the same as we've been playing the last month.   It really doesn't change much for the opponent before the game.   But once the game begins, then we have to figure out what we want to do.   A lot of it depends on how the other team is attacking us, what defense we'll use, and on offense what defense they're going to use that we have to attack. 
But these guys now have played together all year long, and I think you'll notice, I didn't substitute much.   Every starter‑‑ well, four starters played 34 minutes, one played 28, and we only had one other guy off the bench and he played 22.   These guys are in great shape.   I think they can play day in and day out.   They enjoy playing and not having to practice, just playing games.   That's kind of the way they grew up playing AAU ball.   No one practices, you just play. 

Q.   Coach, it would really be a lot of fun as you face TJ Warren tomorrow if you were the one head coach who did not pick him on his five‑man first‑team all‑ACC squad.   That would be priceless.   Is there any chance that was you? 
COACH LARRANAGA:   No.   No, he was definitely one of my five all‑conference players.   Are you trying to narrow it down?   You have 14 other guys to ask. 

Q.   It would just make for an interesting story line as you can imagine. 
COACH LARRANAGA:   Yeah, well, be sure to write I had him on first team.   I don't want to give them any ammunition and bulletin board material.   TJ Warren deserves all the recognition.   He's a great offensive player.   He's an NBA first‑round pick whenever he chooses to go.
