<p>	Q.  How much did Ben's shot remind you of Ray's a couple years ago?  How much does he remind you of Ray?</p>
<p>	Q.  Given all that this team has been through throughout the course of this final week, would it be an oversimplification to say you don't win this without Ben Gordon?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ben, how did it feel when they called your name to get that trophy? </p>
<p>	Q.  Emeka, can you talk about your back.  How did it feel to be back out there?  How do you think it will react next week? </p>
<p>	Q.  Emeka, when did you decide to play tonight? </p>

<p>	Q.  Coach, let me ask you, half second to go in the game, Ben's on the line.  Do you ever think, "Just miss the shot on purpose so the time would run out"? </p>
<p>	Q.  Seems like Armstrong and Tooles did a great job for you the last five minutes of the game, defensively, especially when Okafor fouled out. Can you comment on that. </p>
<p>	Q.  What will you be focusing on to prepare for the tournament?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, can you talk about six BIG EAST titles for your school.  You tied Georgetown.  Talk about the accomplishment. </p>
<p>	Q.  There's always a shot at finding the one that makes the difference.  Did you think Rashad Anderson's three he made when you were down seven  to cut it to four with 6:14 to go...</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you tell us what you're thinking on that possession when you're down 58-57 and what you see when you make that drive, Ben? </p>

<p>	Q.  Taliek, can you talk about the tremendous comeback that your basketball team made down 11 against Pittsburgh with eight minutes to go against a Pitt team that is so tough with a double-digit lead? </p>
<p>	Q.  Last night you said (inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  Ben, can you talk about growing up in New York, being center stage when you win a BIG EAST.  What's going through your mind when the buzzer goes off? </p>
<p>	Q.  Ben, you and Julius Page had a lot of good battles.  He's won some of them, but you went off on him.  What was the difference with this? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you mentioned having fun.  In the past you said this conference prepares you for NCAA.  You had many intense competitions this year.  Do you feel the BIG EAST...</p>
<p>	Q.  Ben, with Emeka's back problems, did you feel you were strong enough to carry this team? </p>
