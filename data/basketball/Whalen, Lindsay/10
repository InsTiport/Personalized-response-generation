LYNX   88
  DREAM - 63

Q.   Seimone, can you talk about what it is about the Atlanta Dream?   Seems like whenever you see their uniform‑‑ you had the great series back in 2011.   Talk about your play tonight. 
SEIMONE AUGUSTUS:   I mean, it's The Finals.   I don't know if it's exactly Atlanta Dream, but the Finals tend to bring the best out of any player because you're playing for everything.   It's the title.   Everything is on the line. 
I mean, I just wanted to come out and play well, just do what was needed for my team to be successful. 

Q.   This is for both of you.   You're up two games to nothing in the best of five series.   Is the trophy in sight? 
SEIMONE AUGUSTUS:   I mean, yeah, it's right there.   We have 40 more minutes, 80 more possessions to get to where we want to be and get to what we feel like we deserve.   But we know that Atlanta is going to bring everything.   They're going to throw the kitchen sink at us.   We're expecting them to come out and just try to do whatever they can to not be eliminated in Game 3. 

Q.   Seimone, you were 9 of 12 and as a team you hit 56.9 percent, which is a single game Finals record.   How does that highlight the ball movements, your ability to hit shots?   How have you been able to get these with such efficiency? 
SEIMONE AUGUSTUS:   Well, that's scheme, what you said, the ball movement.   We wanted to try to make their defense move around a little bit and get the extra passes.   You make one pass and you think you have a shot into someone else.   We accomplished that by moving the ball around and moving their defense around a little bit.

Q.   Lindsey, what enabled you to really go to the basket? 
LINDSAY WHALEN:   Yeah, I think that was big from the start tonight.   I just wanted to be as aggressive as possible.   I just happened to be in the lane a couple times, even if it was just getting us into our set quicker.   I feel like when we play with tempo, we play with a lot of energy on offense.   We usually get good stuff.   So tonight that was just pretty much my mindset and the team's mindset from the start, and as a point guard, the one with the ball, I want to just come down, get us into stuff as quick as possible, and the lane opened up a couple times, a couple great passes from these guys, and we all just tried to be aggressive and get in there, and we got to the line well.   We know we have to knock down our free throws, but getting there shows our aggression and how aggressive we were, and you think any time we can get in there, get in the paint early, that sets the tone for the whole game.

Q.   How uncanny is it to admittedly not be at your best like tonight but yet still win by dozens of points? 
LINDSAY WHALEN:   I think we just had the mentality the whole season of just playing together, making plays for each other, and taking it one possession at a time.   You know, of course it wasn't our best game.   We had a lot of turnovers tonight, some miscues and things like that.   But all things we know we can fix and clean up.   We'll watch the video.   We'll learn from it.   But I think it just shows that we‑‑ just our ability, when there are rough patches and when there are rough times, it's never going to be a perfect game, it's never going to happen.   So it's a Finals game and you know it's going to be tough, and you just have to be able to move on to the next play, and I feel like when we're able to do that, you move on and just try to get the next possession as good as possible, and that's what we tried to do. 
SEIMONE AUGUSTUS:   I mean, this league is a grind‑it‑out league, a 34‑game season, and then you add on the Playoffs.   I think starting with Game 1 of the Seattle series, kind of prepped us for right now, and to have a game like we did, not the best game or an ugly game, and we still be able to pull off a victory by doing the little things, rebounding the basketball, making plays down the stretch at key moments in the game, and just playing solid defense at key moments in the game.   I mean, that's what it's about, a grind‑it‑out series. 

Q.   Could you sense their frustration in general, and Angel in particular? 
SEIMONE AUGUSTUS:   That's the key. 
LINDSAY WHALEN:   I think just knowing that they're going to come back and be more aggressive the next game and even more determined.   For us what we have to worry about and what we have to think about is just coming out in Game 3 and what we have to do to set the tone again.
