LINDSAY WHELAN:  I'm just trying to continue the treatment and try to get it better, but it's probably going to take some good rest and so we'll just continue doing what we have to do the rest of the series. 

Q.  Is it sprained? 

LINDSAY WHELAN:  Yup, it is.

Q.  Have you hurt it before?

LINDSAY WHELAN:  Yes, many times. 

Q.  So which ankle is it?

LINDSAY WHELAN:  The left ankle.  It's just a little tender when I push off.  It's nothing too debilitating.  But it definitely is there and something that I have to play through.

Q.  Can you talk about your mindset heading into tomorrow's game, the team's mindset?

LINDSAY WHELAN:  I think we just have to go in and know that it's a one-game situation for us now.  And we have to go out and play as hard as you can and do everything that you can do and do what you can do to help the team win the game.  And that's the mindset that everyone is going to have going into the game.

Q.  How much of a concern is the fact that you guys are committing turnovers and they're not?

LINDSAY WHELAN:  Well, that's a huge stat.  We need to be more careful with the ball and we need also to try to create a few turnovers on their side of the ball.  And if we do that, obviously, we'll turn the tide around and hopefully create a few more opportunities for us to get easy baskets.
