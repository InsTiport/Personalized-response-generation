<p>	Q.  Luke, first time you guys played UConn, maybe not one of your best games of the year, what did you learn about going against Okafor that day? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have to have a conversation with your team about, "Guys, think about the game, not the big picture, what's on the line"? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, can you talk about how Luke has changed as a player since these two teams met?</p>
<p>	Q.  How is your team different from that first UConn game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Luke, what coach was talking about, about the officiating earlier in the year, how did you manage to not really get frustrated with that?  Do you feel they're letting you play a bit more now as opposed to maybe the beginning of the season?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about dictating the tempo. </p>
<p>	Q.  Yes. </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you go back to the early part of the season when you knew Will was coming.  After Tarver's injury, did you still look at this team as a nine-man rotation that was going to possibly get you this far this late in the season?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about the early season success against UConn, then the win at Duke.  At what point did you start to say to yourself, knowing that the tournament is all about unknowing, that this team really can be special?</p>
<p>	Q.  That game against UConn, quite a long time ago, what do you see in UConn that's different from that game?  What improvements have they played? </p>
<p>	Q.  Marvin, going back to the first day you ever laid eyes on Luke, can you tell me what you thought of the sites and what you thought of the sounds? </p>
<p>	Q.  How difficult was it for you to play six minutes in Milwaukee?  What did you learn about yourself from that experience? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jarrett, before the season, Connecticut was a No. 1 pick, you weren't that well ranked.  How much did that win change in what you thought about yourself?  Do you think it changed the way people around the country viewed your team? </p>
<p>	Q.  Luke, what makes Emeka so successful?  What makes him a great player, difficult to play against? </p>
<p>	Q.  Will, about the conversation in Milwaukee with the coach, what went on in that conversation?  What had to be understood? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you tell us what went on in the conversation? </p>
<p>	Q.  In the locker room, when did you guys start to believe that this could happen, that you could make a deep run in the tournament?  Was there a time you started talking about the fact the team was coming together?  Any moment that you realized you really had a chance? </p>
<p>	Q.  Your team seems to be a real nice blend of the obvious and not-so-obvious.  Will, Tony, could you talk about the obvious and the not-so-obvious as part of your success. </p>


<p>	Q.  Anthony, do you have a T-shirt with Luke's face on it?  Could you show us what that is? </p>

<p>	Q.  What does it say? </p>


<p>	Q.  Tell us, you're playing for the title tomorrow night, what does that feel like? </p>
<p>	Q.  Emeka's performance, what you saw in the second half, and then your big guy against their big guy tomorrow night, what you expect? </p>
<p>	Q.  Marvin, what do you take at all from the NIT win against UConn?  What exactly did you mess up when Emeka visited? </p>
<p>	Q.  Paul, how much did you pay for the T-shirt? </p>
<p>	Q.  Luke, have you ever had a posse before?  Did you know who that was when someone first showed it to you? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much of the success this season is rooted in you guys trying to prove you could play and keep the program at a high level without Chris Bosh?  A lot of people were surprised that you guys have done as well early in the season without a guy like that. </p>
<p>	Q.  When your team is picked seventh in the league, as a coach, do you use that as motivation, at least early on?</p>
<p>	Q.  Eddie Sutton said after the game last night he really believes if he played Georgia Tech 10 times that they'd win a series against you guys, basically he feels like he's the better team, but on that night they weren't able to win.  Do you think that's how a lot of coaches sometimes end up feeling about you guys?  Does that take away from the talent you have?  Seems like people disregard how talented this group is, think it's smoke and mirrors. </p>


<p>	Q.  Will mentioned the other day the Duke victory as being a turning point as far as he could see for you guys.  Could the rest of you comment on that, what the Duke game meant. </p>

<p>	Q.  Earlier in the tournament, Paul, you pointed to the Maryland team from a couple years ago, the depth, trying to get 10 guys together for a steady run.  Can you talk about developing that over the course of the season, the battles that are going to go on in practice every day as a result, starting with the two guards sitting next to you.  Jarrett maybe could follow up on it. </p>

<p>	Q.  Could you talk about BJ's first game against Connecticut in New York, you called it his national coming out party, and do you think he's been a bit frustrated with how much he's been able to contribute lately?</p>
<p>	Q.  Injury update on BJ.  Isma'il looked like he was hurt late in the game. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the feeling being here, yesterday people talked about the marquee game, the second game, some people were maybe bypassing that first game.  Tomorrow night many people feel the championship was won yesterday.  I know you don't feel that way.  Can you talk about being quite often in this underdog role where people maybe don't give you the respect you deserve? </p>
<p>	Q.  Marvin, Jarrett, I was wondering with the psychology of playing a team for a second time.  Do you think it's advantageous or disadvantageous to have won the first game between two teams?  How have you used a first game when you get a rematch against a team that has beaten you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jarrett, could you simply address what it means to play for that national title tomorrow night? </p>

<p>	Q.  With players leaving early and the win-now attitude, how difficult is it to let a team evolve and develop in this day and age?  How do you go about that, trying to be patient?</p>
<p>	Q.  There aren't a lot of coaches that this relatively early get a shot like this.  Can you talk about whatever happens to you in your career from here on out, some of the moments you're going to remember about the past few days?  Could you talk to us about Luke's physical maturation, what he's done? </p>
<p>	Q.  More about your graduation rates. </p>
<p>	Q.  Just a joke.  Georgia Tech, you've been around it long enough to realize that it's not like other schools in its academic requirements, it's academic community.  What would winning a national championship in a visible sport like basketball do for the Tech psyche, the community? </p>
<p>	Q.  We're in the age of big men who want to shoot threes.  Is Luke a natural, comfortable down there?  What are his best assets right now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you touch upon what this means to you, age 41, to be able to play on Monday night.  Are you comfortable with sort of taking the torch in the line of the great African American coaches, evolving into a role model?</p>
<p>	Q.  Yes. </p>
<p>	Q.  The game seems like it's becoming more and more perimeter oriented.  Do you see maybe a bit of irony in the fact that tomorrow night's game, a lot of the spotlight is going to be on two pretty prototypical centers. </p>
<p>	Q.  You talk a lot about your roots, being a Knick-ophile .  Just a couple quick questions about that.  Were you a subway kid?  Where did you learn to play ball that way? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think that philosophy is from Siena?</p>
<p>	Q.  About the pass coming before the shot, will that ultimately be part of your team's legacy, 25 years after Magic and Bird?  How hard is it to manage a culture of unselfishness in an industry that doesn't seem to promote it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Was it just a coincidence, the jacket you wore last night?  How many old New York guys have you heard from and how many of them are out here? </p>
<p>	Q.  His name?</p>
<p>	Q.  That was the Duke jacket?</p>
<p>	Q.  If your team is trying to emulate the '73 Knicks, are Jim's guys the '73 Lakers?</p>
<p>	Q.  Your team seems very loose up at the podium today.  How are you reading them?  Close wins kind of fed into this confidence, for them to enjoy the moment?</p>
<p>	Q.  A lot has been made of Luke versus Okafor.  Can you break down the guards, theirs and yours, how that will factor into the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you take from the game back in November?  You said you watched it last night, the tape.  Can you elaborate a little bit on what you've seen lately, the last few minutes of the game last night, in Rashad's game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Other than calling their parents, how do you get the players to buy into the team rather than the individual?  On yourself growing up in a family that emphasized academics, how did you become a coach?</p>
<p>	Q.  Other than calling their parents, how do you get the players to buy into the team thing?</p>
<p>	Q.  There was a reference in your media guide that perhaps you wanted to be a sportswriter at one point. </p>
<p>	Q.  What caused you to turn away from such a reputable profession?</p>
<p>	Q.  The other three coaches here have been around a zillion years, won a million games.  You come in under the radar.  You got a big new contract.  Did you expect this?  Do you pinch yourself? </p>
<p>	Q.  You seem to in the beginning of your stay here you want the kids to see the sights of the see, enjoy themselves here.  Has that changed now that you're in the championship game?  What is your mindset for the team for tonight and tomorrow? </p>
<p>	Q.  I asked Marvin about your love of the Knicks.  Does he revel you in stories?  His eyes almost rolled in the back of his head.  What did you tell these guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  Second of all, do you still have the Jamaica Patiois? </p>
<p>	Q.  Every season has an ebb and flow.  I'm looking at the schedule here beginning with February 14th.  You lose three out of four, starting with that game at Virginia.  Any concerns during that stretch?</p>
<p>	Q.  You were pretty steady throughout the season saying that this team was playing well.  There were people out there saying, "What has this guy smoked?"  Why did you always have confidence in this team?</p>
<p>	Q.  After the game last night, what was the rest of your night like?  From the time your day started today, what is your day today going to be like? </p>
<p>	Q.  What will your schedule be like the rest of today and tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  Being a New York sports fan, you live in a world of heaven and hell, right? </p>
<p>	Q.  What is your dad's name, and give me three or four moments you shared with him, both heaven and name?</p>
<p>	Q.  Were you there?</p>
<p>	Q.  He passed that Giants legacy down to you?</p>
<p>	Q.  What in your mind is the importance of getting teams here at-large to the conference?  What's the importance of getting teams to win championships?  You guys have done that as a conference. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think winning championships maybe helps get more teams in the tournament, higher? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned foul trouble playing a role.  Both teams that lost last night had guys getting in foul trouble.  We can say that was a dumb foul.  Is a foul like that a physical mistake or a mental mistake, you know you have two, go for a rebound?</p>
<p>	Q.  Much of the attention will be on Okafor tomorrow.  What kind of problems does Josh Boone present to teams?</p>
<p>	Q.  Walking around the meeting rooms, watching five-year starters, Luke has a hundred guys around him, on a podium.  It's almost surreal to be sitting here and watching that, following you in Atlanta.  Tomorrow night everyone will know every one of your player's names.  How have they handled it, this whole process?  I can't remember a team that has kind of come out of nowhere in terms of exposure.  Can you talk about how they're handling all this notoriety?</p>
<p>	Q.  You're obviously a very engaging, charismatic man.  You're a nice guy.  But a coach has to be very tough also.  How do you balance that with your players?  How do you get to the point where they know you're a nice guy, but... </p>
<p>	Q.  What did you take from your time with George Raveling?  Also you referred to this metamorphosis from selfishness to what you have now.  What exactly kicked that in?  What caused that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Selfishness to unselfishness. </p>
<p>	Q.  Will has a strong basketball personality.  What did you do to get him to subjugate his ego and suppress his game to fit in?</p>
<p>	Q.  You come out to California, a New York guy, work with USC, was it a big culture change for you?  Could you describe the feelings between New York and Southern California? </p>
