 Q.  Do you want to play basketball or dance out there?  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Basketball, always, always basketball.  But I like dancing too.   
 Q.  Russell, what would you say Joel Embiid's best skill is on and off the court?  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: I don't know.  I don't know.   
 Q.  What was it like to see your face [on a building]?  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Yeah, it's a blessing, man.  I had the opportunity to be able to see it for the first time today.  Just looking up and seeing that is honestly surreal for me because I never thought I'd be able to see myself on the side of a building, let alone just be here in the NBA and being at All-Star Weekend.   
So all of it is an unbelievable blessing.  I definitely will never, ever take it for granted.   
 Q.  Has anybody given you a hard time about it?  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Yeah, yeah, I heard it everywhere.  Everybody's telling me you're on every building, and I just laugh.  Man, it's a blessing, man.  It's something that you can never imagine.   
 Q.  On basketball in Los Angeles.  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: It's different, man.  Growing up here in L.A., it depends on what part of L.A. you grew up in, basketball's different throughout L.A.  Where I grew up, a lot of grit, grind.  Kind of got to get it how you live type of attitude and kind of figure it out.   
 Q.  Can you tell us about your involvement in the Boys & Girls Club?  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Yeah, I grew up in the Boys & Girls Club.  Challengers Boys & Girls Club on 51st and Vermont.  I started there when I was about nine until I was about 16 or 17.   
So I'm very, very involved.  I do a Thanksgiving dinner in Oklahoma City every year with the Oklahoma City Boys & Girls Club.  So I'm very involved in the Boys & Girls Club, and I believe it definitely helps kids and creates friends, creates relationships, and it's a good environment for kids.  So I'm definitely involved a lot.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible)?  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Definitely.  The Boys & Girls Club is always a great, great place, I think, in my opinion.  So are other organizations that will be able to put kids together in that environment to teach them, to get along, teach them life skills and different things of that nature.   
 Q.  What is your first All-Star memory?  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: My first All-Star Game was here in L.A. [in 2011].  You know, coincidence.  Here we are back again.  It's an unbelievable experience for me and a blessing as well.   
 Q.  What do you like about this new setup?  Do you think the game will be more competitive?  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Definitely.  Just my experience, my record with the West, we don't lose much, so I'm just saying.  We usually win, just saying.   
 Q.  When it comes to the Saturday night event, what would you take part in?  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Oh, probably -- what is it, dunk contest, three-point contest, skills?  I'll watch.   
 Q.  How do you think the [lineup] is going to impact [Sunday's] game?  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: It will be interesting.  It will be interesting.   
 Q.  Did you get a chance to ask LeBron (indiscernible)?  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: No, I did not.  It doesn't really matter.  You know what I'm saying?  We're all here.  That's all that matters.
