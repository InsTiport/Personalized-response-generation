 Q.  Russ, what's the most important thing you guys want to get done tomorrow on this one?  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Win.  That's it.   
 Q.  What do you have to do better to win the game?  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Oh, I mean, just got to play harder.  You know, once we play harder, everything else will go into place.  I think that's the most important part.   
 Q.  Does harder mean a quicker pace offensively?  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: No.  It just means you've got to play harder than the men in front of you.   
 Q.  Does that show itself in the 50-50 balls?  You guys seem to win them all in Game 1.  They got the 50-50 balls.  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Yeah, offensive rebounds, extra possessions, stuff like that.  Just shows they wanted it more than us.  We can't let that happen.   
 Q.  Serge used the word soft.  Do you think that applies to the way you guys played last game?  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: I don't know.  I wouldn't say that, but probably just didn't play hard enough.   
 Q.  When that's happening, are you aware of it, that they're out-hustling, when the game is going on?  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Yeah, you try to find ways to help each other out, help yourself out, find ways to not let the guy in front of you beat you to the ball, box out, do things that can change the game.   
 Q.  Do you actually feel that somebody ever outplays you or out-hustles you?  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: No.  No, not on a night-by-night basis.   
 Q.  What do you feel your role is offensively to lead this team?  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: That sounds like three roles right here.   
 Q.  It is.  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: I'm a guy that doesn't do one thing.  I do everything.  I come out and do everything and whatever it is that needs to be done that particular night.  If it's scoring, then I'll score.  If it's defending, then that's what I'll do.  If it's rebounding, that's what I'll do.  If it's passing, that's what I'll do.  Whatever it is that needs to be done, that's what I'll do to make sure we win.   
 Q.  Do you feel you need to do all of those?  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: No.  Just whatever needs to happen during the time of the game.   
 Q.  Do you think Curry going into the stands the other night kind of gave them a little inspiration, like if that guy can do that?  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: I don't know.   
 Q.  You guys lost three games in these playoffs and you've won the next game afterwards each time.  Any common denominators in the way you guys prepared or bounced back?  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: No.  Just we can see when we're messing around or we're not completely locked in on both sides of the basketball.  And we know some of the things we have to do to get ourselves ready for the next game.   
 Q.  Because of the way you are, you said you don't let yourself get outplayed and out-hustled.  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: No.   
 Q.  Can you understand how that can happen?  Can you comprehend that?  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Definitely.  As a player, I don't think everybody plays the same way.  Some guys do other things better than other guys.  So I don't think -- I mean, everybody shouldn't be thinking the way I'm thinking or I should think the way they think.  But my job is to be able to help those guys and those guys will be able to help me out.
