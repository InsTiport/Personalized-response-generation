  Q. I know you weren't on Nowitzki last night, but how do you defend a guy like that?   
 RUSSELL WESTBROOK: I don't know. I don't know. We've got to see what adjustments we have to make, and we'll see what happens.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)   
 RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Definitely. It was one of those nights. I couldn't do too much. I got to the line, was aggressive, I just didn't make none of my shots.  
  
  Q. Kevin was saying with everything that still happened you guys were still within five in the fourth quarter. You've got to feel confident going into Game 2.   
 RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Oh, definitely. It's just one game. We feel confident in our team.   
  
  Q. You fought back a couple times in the Memphis series. Does that give you confidence in this series being behind?  
 RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Definitely. That's why it's called a seven-game series; it's the first team to win four games. We're down one, but definitely can't count us out.  
  
  Q. What did you see what Barea's aggression over the course of the game?  
 RUSSELL WESTBROOK: He did a good job of getting in the paint and finding himself shots and kicking it out for threes.   
  
  Q. Did you feel like you were back in OKC when you saw all the people with blue shirts on last night?   
 RUSSELL WESTBROOK: No, I knew exactly where I was at. I didn't see too many different other color blues out there.
