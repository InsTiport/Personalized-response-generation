WEST   163
  EAST - 158 

Q.   Russ, given sort of where you were last year with the injuries and everything, all you had to do to get back to this point, how much more special is a night like this for you? 
RUSSELL WESTBROOK:   Definitely a blessing, man.   You never want to take no gamesoff, especially an All‑Star Game to get a chance to go out and show your talents.   I'm blessed to be able to play the game that I love and definitely happy we got the win. 

Q.   Congratulations. 
RUSSELL WESTBROOK:   Thank you. 

Q.   You had 41 points.   In 1988 Michael had 40.   And in '62 Wilt had 42.   What does it mean to you to be in the top three?   And what are your expectations for OKC going forward from here? 
RUSSELL WESTBROOK:   It's definitely an honor to be grouped with those two guys, especially in the All‑Star Game.   Moving forward for our team, we're just going to take one day at a time.   Try to get as many wins as possible, try to make the playoffs. 

Q.   Russ, were you knowledgeable of Wilt's record in the last minute of the game?   And did you want it? 
RUSSELL WESTBROOK:   Somebody told me, but at that time we were just trying to find a way to win the game and find a way to close the game out.   But I missed about six or seven lay‑ups.   I could definitely could have had it. 

Q.   How did you find out about it? 
RUSSELL WESTBROOK:   They was talking about it on the bench.   Honestly, I thought I was done for the game once I came out.   And then Coach Kerr put me back in the game. 

Q.   Russ, I just got to talk to Kevin, and he just said how happy he was for you, how proud he was.   What was this like to be able to share this moment? 
RUSSELL WESTBROOK:   It was definitely amazing to share this with a brother.   He's definitely happy for me.   I can't wait to get back on the floor with him and get things going. 

Q.   Your final free throw seemed to have a little extra arc on it on TV.   Marv and Reggie were debating why it was that free throw had the extra rainbow effect to it.   Why was that? 
RUSSELL WESTBROOK:   The East was trying to get me to miss the first one, so they could have the chance to win the game.   We wanted to win.   I had to try to miss the second one, but I guess I couldn't miss tonight, huh? 

Q.   Russ, during the last season you have been a great player.   But during this season you have enhanced your level.   What do you think must be enhanced in your leadership in order to convert your players, your people, your team into players that are given the high level that you are having now? 
RUSSELL WESTBROOK:   I think leadership is big for me.   And definitely big for our team.   A part of our job as a point guard is to be able to lead.   And that's what I've been trying to do this season, coming in with better leadership and trying to come in and lead every day. 

Q.   At Media Day you had said your priority for the weekend was trying to find a way to get some rest.   Did you find that game restful? 
RUSSELL WESTBROOK:   I definitely did.   I found a way to get some rest during time‑outs, halftime, and when I was on the bench. 

Q.   Can you summarize for us this experience, just everything that you've had in New York and what it meant for you today to win the MVP at The Garden. 
RUSSELL WESTBROOK:   The whole experience is amazing.   Definitely New York City.   I was definitely excited to come and enjoy my weekend here in New York, especially with Fashion Week going as well.   I was able to do a lot of other things as well.   And just the game today, I was definitely excited.   I'm happy we won.   And definitely blessed to have the MVP.
