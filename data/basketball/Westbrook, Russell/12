RUSSELL WESTBROOK: You know it's tough to say because a lot of people have styles and people dress different.  So it's difficult to say.  I'm not sure.  There's a lot of guys who dress well and have a very good sense of style.
Q. Who's your sponsor?
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Sponsor?  I'm sponsored by Jordan.
Q. You need to get me in there too.
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: You've got Jordans already.
Q. (No microphone).
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: You want this one?  I can maybe find a way to get you one.  All right.  All right.
Q. Give a shout out to India.
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: India, big shout out from Russell Westbrook.  Appreciate you guys' support.
Q. (No microphone).
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: A lot of things.  I think as a team we're in a good place.  Finish the All-Star break right and come back and do good things.
Q. The last week or so we've all been asking about Kevin [Durant] coming back.  You've said a lot of 'he's not on my team anymore, and it's time to move on.'  Have people moved on?
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: I don't know.  I don't know what is y'all's problem.
Q. But has the team moved on itself?
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: What does it look like?
Q. We're still asking the questions, right?
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: That's y'all's problem.
Q. What do you think ends that?  What makes that end?  Do you need a Kumbaya moment, a song?
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: I don't know what you all need.  I'm in a great place.  I'm having fun.  Having a great time.  I'm happy with my team I have now and looking forward to moving forward.
Q. You and Oscar Robertson have been in the news together all year.  But the scoring record for the All-Star game is Wilt Chamberlain's 42 points.  You had 41 once.  Can you get it?
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: I just play and have fun, enjoy.  If I make some shots, we'll see.
Q. Is it going to be awkward at all being on the same team as all the Warriors?
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: What's you're favorite fashion  brand, what you like?
Q. I like Saint Laurent.
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: They have a fantastic collection.  The spring-summer collection.  There's a lot of great things you can pick from.  I think it depends on what you like.
Q. How tough was it to pass up on the Olympics?
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Tough?  I like the rest.  It was good for me to rest, chill and be at home and rest.  It was good for me.
Q. What do you like about New Orleans?
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: The food.
Q. (No microphone)?
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Probably.  We can go eat anywhere, though.
Q. Jordan has three exclusive All-Star sneakers coming out this week, the 1s, the 6s, and the 31s.  Which of those three is your favorite?
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Probably 31.  I got a chance to play in them, and they're a great shoe.
Q. You and A.D. [Anthony Davis] have always trained together in the offseason.  What are your thoughts when you see those kinds of rumors, you and him going to L.A. and all that kind of stuff?
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: You like fashion?
Q. Yeah.
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: What are you wearing?
Q. Boss.
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Hugo Boss is great, man.  I used to wear Hugo Boss.
Q. So do you think he's got good suits?
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Hugo Boss makes a great suit.
Q. What do you think of our town?  What do you think about New Orleans?
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: New Orleans, I like it, man.
