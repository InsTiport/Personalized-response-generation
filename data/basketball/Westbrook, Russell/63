 Q. (Inaudible.) 
 RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Not sure, just he's the head coach, and he makes the decisions on the floor, and he made the best one yesterday.

 Q. How gutsy a decision was that?
 RUSSELL WESTBROOK: I mean, it was a good decision on his part. He did a good job. He's been coaching for a while, and he knows what he's doing, so I'm just sticking behind my team.

 Q. When you hear all the criticism about you during the Playoffs, how do you feel about it? 
 RUSSELL WESTBROOK: I just take the good with the bad. I just go out and play every day. Regardless of what I do, it doesn't matter. I can't do no right, so I'm just going to go out and play, and it doesn't matter.

 Q. Do you talk to the other players about that kind of thing?
 RUSSELL WESTBROOK: No, I just talk to my family. My family is my main supporters. As long as they have my back and my team has my back, I'm fine.
