  Q. You've never had to go against Kevin Durant coaching a team before. Is that going to be an issue?   
 RUSSELL WESTBROOK: No, that's never been a problem. Kevin is not a problem at all.  
  
  Q. Can he coach?  
 RUSSELL WESTBROOK: I know he can play, but I don't know if he can coach.   
  
  Q. Would you really like to go head on head, one-on-one (Inaudible)?  
 RUSSELL WESTBROOK: He'll probably end up switching a lot of stuff and going one-on-one and laughing at each other.
