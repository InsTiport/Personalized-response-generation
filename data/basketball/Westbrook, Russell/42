 Q.   Russell, how different do you think the Thunder are without Harden and the particular skills he brought to you guys?  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK:   It's different.   I think we're in a good position as a team right now.   Probably the same position we were in last year at this point.   So we're just trying to keep it going.
