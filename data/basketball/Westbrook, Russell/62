 Q. What did you see after watching film?
 RUSSELL WESTBROOK: We just started off slow. It was a slow start and it was hard to pick up the slack in the second half.

 Q. Adjustments for tomorrow maybe?
 RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Just play tougher. That's the biggest thing, just come out and play tough.

 Q. As a team you guys shot 36 percent and 1 for 17 beyond the arc. Where did the touch go for the whole team?
 RUSSELL WESTBROOK: I don't know. I mean, we had open shots and got easy shots, easy knock-downs, especially at home. We just weren't able to knock them down.

 Q. Some of the Mavs said they thought they came with more defensive intensity. Would you agree with that?
 RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Yes, they definitely came out like they were angry. They did a good job of attacking us. We was on our heels most of the game.

 Q. To that end what's the biggest adjustment you guys have to make for Game 4?
 RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Be ready. That's a tough team, and we've just got to be ready to play.

 Q. Do you guys need a little bit of that edge coming into Game 4?
 RUSSELL WESTBROOK: We've got to. It's a home game, and we've got to come out angry and take our home court.

 Q. Were things too physical last night or was it called about right?
 RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Oh, not too -- we just left the Memphis series. That might have been the most physical series of them all. It definitely wasn't too physical.

 Q. Kevin seems angry already. He didn't seem himself today. 
 RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Yeah, I'd be mad, too.

 Q. Is he just getting fired up for the game tomorrow night?
 RUSSELL WESTBROOK: I mean, who's supposed to be feeling the same after we lost a home game? We definitely want to come back and be ready to play.

 Q. 1 to 3 doesn't work for you math-wise, does it?
 RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Definitely doesn't. Especially at home and being down 20, it's definitely tough to get back.

 Q. Do you guys think that maybe they're an older team and you can wear them out over the course of the series?
 RUSSELL WESTBROOK: I don't know, man. I don't think neither team is worried about age or anything like that. We just have to play together. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 RUSSELL WESTBROOK: I mean, I think the reason we had nine is because they were making shots. We can't run fast breaks if they don't miss. That's the thing.

 Q. You mentioned last night that some of those are shots you like and normally make. Are there things you need to do offensively better before the shots to get shots? 
 RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Offensively -- it's just defense for us. I think defensively we're a step slow on everything, and it was tough for us to get back.

 Q. There was not anything about the offense that you'd rather do differently or have better next game than last game?
 RUSSELL WESTBROOK: No. 

 Q. Did you guys learn anything in Game 3 you can apply to Game 4?
 RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Definitely, being tougher. Like I said before, they came out and kind of pressured us on the home floor, and we wasn't ready for that, and we've got to be ready for that Game 4.

 Q. What do you think about the job Nick did on Dirk last night?
 RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Great job. Nick has been defending all season long, did a great job defending Dirk tough towards the end of the game.
