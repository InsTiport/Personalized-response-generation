 Q. (Inaudible.)  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK:   Oh, it's something I came up with.   I already shoot too many threes.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK:   I celebrated a little bit.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about Tyreke Evans.   
RUSSELL WESTBROOK:   He's a great talent.   He can do it all, very talented.   He can lead that team to get better and better each and every year.   
   
 Q.   You're one of the front runners now.   Do you like being in that position?  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK:   I mean, we was on the bottom, so we worked our way to the top.   So it's not a bad thing to be on top and be where we want to be at at this halfway point of the season.  
   
 Q.   Does it make it any more satisfying to you?  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK:   It's a great feeling.   It shows we're getting better, and that's definitely a big step for us.
