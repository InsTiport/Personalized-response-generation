San Antonio   104
  Memphis ‑ 93 OT

Q.   Mike, the shot there at the end of regulation, was that exactly what you wanted?   Coach mentioned that you might have been wanting Gasol, but what happened there in trying to set that shot up? 
MIKE CONLEY:   We just Drew up a play to try to get into the paint, let me make a play.   I think I got a little bit too deep so I had to take the shot.   But it was a good drawn up play, just didn't execute it as well as we thought. 

Q.   Where is kind of the frustration level knowing how close you are to being up 2‑1 and realizing you're down 3‑0?
MIKE CONLEY:   Yeah, it is frustrating, but it gives us hope at the same time, knowing that we can fight our way back, and we have had chances to win each one of these games, and this was a tough one to swallow.   But it's a good learning lesson, and there's no group of guys I'd rather be with down 3‑0 to try to fight back in it. 

Q.   We saw a lot more of Leonard on you, Danny Green on you.   How much does their size affect what you're able to do when you've got them on you rather than Parker? 
MIKE CONLEY:   Well, Danny Green and Kawhi are both good long defenders.   It's tough to get jump shots off on them.   They can create a lot of space.   They can take up a lot of space, especially trying to drive and create plays.   It's tough trying to score with their length, but man, when they throw different guys it kind you wears you down a little bit, so you've just got to try to find a way to exploit it, regardless of who they put on you. 

Q.   Tough night at the line for you guys as a team.   Do you think that made a difference in the game? 
MIKE CONLEY:   Well, obviously if we would have made some free throws it could have been different, but there was a lot of what‑ifs tonight, a lot of plays that we didn't make, a lot of little things that we didn't do that decided this game at the end.   They outlasted us and executed down the stretch and did the things that they needed to do to win.

Q.   What changed from that first quarter going forward, all the turnovers you were creating, the havoc you were creating defensively kind of went away.   Why weren't you able to continue?
MIKE CONLEY:   Obviously they started taking care of the ball.   They started moving the ball a little bit better.   They were able to get into their offense a little bit quicker.   I think in the first quarter we were forcing them to use some clock, forcing them out of their comfort zone a little bit.   Second quarter, third quarter coming in we didn't have that same kind of pressure, same kind of havoc that we needed to sustain a big lead.
