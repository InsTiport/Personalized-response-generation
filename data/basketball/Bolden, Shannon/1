<p>	Q.  Pam, I wanted to find out sort of the process of what it was like for you to walk into this program in the wake of the Brenda Oldfield situation and sales job you may have had to do with your basketball team.  And who you are, what you're all about?</p>
<p>	Q.  Pam, can you talk a little bit about maybe some of the early battles you had with Janel to kind of get her to mold to the player that you wanted her to be, especially as a rebounder; and No. 2, do you think that some of that had to do with her being named All American today, that she was able to give in a little bit, you were able to give in a little bit to make it work?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, can you quantify or explain Lindsay Whalen's popularity back in Minnesota?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, what have people told you about combating the just "happy to be here" syndrome and really focusing on winning a national championship?</p>
<p>	Q.  Shannon, I understand at the Nike All American camp last summer, you did a little pick-up with Diana Taurasi and that started your confidence.  Talk about that a little bit and how that maybe contributed to your confidence.</p>
<p>	Q.  Pam, with being here with the likes of UConn and stuff, do you feel like you're crashing sort of a semi-private party?</p>
<p>	Q.  Pam, what does UConn have that's different than opponents that you've faced in this tournament so far?</p>
<p>	Q.  Lindsay, can you talk about Pam coming to the program and the attitude adjustment that the players have gone through over these past two years from 8 wins your first year to Final Four now.  Can you talk about how the team had to grow and make adjustments for Pam coming in?</p>
<p>	Q.  Given all the turbulence of the program a couple years ago and the three coaches, was there ever a point where you felt that you would never get a chance to play at this level on this kind of stage?</p>
<p>	Q.  Lindsay and Janel, is there any lingering resentment towards Coach Oldfield about her departure and some of the things she may have said on the way out? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you answer that too, Lindsay?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Borton and Janel both answer this, what do you think Janel has been able to do to really throw some teams off so much defensively and especially Duke had some pretty tall and pretty athletic front court players and still just kind of seemed a little befuddled trying to guard her.</p>

<p>	Q.  For Janel and maybe Shannon, obviously Taurasi gets a lot of credit for UConn and deservedly so.  But can you guys just talk from watching tapes, they have several other players who can put up lots of points.  Can you sort of talk about some of those other players and the threat that they pose to you guys tomorrow. </p>

<p>	Q.  Janel, talk a bit about those match-ups.  So far UConn has done a very good job of shutting down other centers like at California-Bakersfield or Santa Barbara, how do you look at the match-up against UConn and what do you feel you're going to have to do to be effective against them? </p>
<p>	Q.  Janel, as you get into these tougher games with the rebounding especially, does it get harder or just more of a challenge for you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you talked about how important it is to establish relationships with them off the court, and the statistics show a really startling difference between the amount of kids graduating when it comes to the women and the men.  The women in basketball, the women basketball athletes, are graduating at a rate twice as much as the men.  Do you have any explanation for something like that or thoughts on it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Lindsay, I was wondering about your  -- when you injured your wrist and if you could talk about your recovery from that and how you came back so quickly and what you did during the time you were injured.  Just kind of hanging with the team or if you were miserable or how you did it.</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you got to see Diana obviously as assistant at Boston College and now Lindsay, can you just talk about how their games are similar and anything that you think contrasts the two of them.</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, Barbara Turner and Janel have been, I guess, two of the most dominant post players in the tournament here.  Do you expect them to sort of match up against each other or will Janel maybe go more against Jessica Moore, do you think?</p>
<p>	Q.  Pam, I was wondering if you had watched UConn's games, any of the four UConn games they had lost this year and the differences you see between them then and now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Janel, I wanted to know how you hoped this game is called by the officials, and LSU sometimes I see that you get upset after a call.  What do you tell yourself to stay effective after they make a call that's questionable? </p>
<p>	Q.  Lindsay and Janel, you guys dominated K State, beat Boston College by double digits, led Duke all the way through.  Do you guys really feel like underdogs anymore or do you feel like you have as good a chance to win this as anybody?</p>

<p>	Q.  Lindsay and Shannon, you've got nine players on the roster from Minnesota, can you talk about the pride you have that this is a true to a certain extent, apologies to Janel, a real Minnesota basketball team? </p>


<p>	Q.  Lindsay, just wondering, how have you handled this whole issue of kind of your meteoric rise in popularity and how does it feel like Coach sitting there comparing your popularity to that of Kevin Garnett?</p>
<p>	Q.  Janel, a lot has been made of your passing abilities as a post player, can you talk about where that comes from and the flair that you have dishing it off? </p>
<p>	Q.  Lindsay, along the lines of your popularity, I read about the marriage proposal from the 11 year old and some of the shrines that people have for you.  What's been the most surreal thing that a fan has to?</p>
<p>	Q.  Surreal.</p>
<p>	Q.  Democrat or Republican?</p>
