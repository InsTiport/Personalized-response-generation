<p>	Q.  First of all for Danny and Mark, address the physicalness of the game.  It seems like it took you a while to a adjust. </p>
<p>	Q.  Danny, the NCAA Tournament Committee scheduled this game so they can watch this game at this time. </p>
<p>	Q.  Mark, you wound up with twelve assists.  Were you aware that you have got that kind of game going as far as assists?  Are concerned or are you just in the flow?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you answer the question he asked to Danny about trying to make some kind of impression to the committee?</p>
<p>	Q.  You took the high road this week when you didn't win Defensive Player of the Year honors.  Did that give you a little motivation out there this week.  Where do you rank your game with the defensive performance this season?</p>

<p>	Q.  Coach, can you talk about the lift that Bambale and Tony give you?  You seemed to be sparring a little bit in the first half. </p>
<p>	Q.  Following that, how important was it to get some quality minutes from the bench if you guys are to get to the Championship and play three games in three nights?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you preach to them about sharing the ball or does that come naturally?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, would you talk about what Coach Cleveland said to you after the game?  He pulled you to the side. </p>
<p>	Q.  We didn't see Kellen Walter play much.  We have been seeing you put him in the games more.  What has he been doing to earn the playing time?</p>
<p>	Q.  Following on the Danny defensive thing.  I know you were disappointed he didn't get Defensive Player of the Year. </p>
