  DREAM - 63

FRED WILLIAMS:   I thought we came out and tried to battled, fought hard, loose balls, scrapped, and we tried to go to the rim a great deal and came out empty.   You know, no situation in the first half to really set the tone not only for Minnesota but for ourselves, not trying to attack and go in. 
They did a fine job, Minnesota, of shooting from the outside again.   They've got shooters, and they'll nail you.   We have to get back to regroup ourselves tomorrow and be ready to prepare for our game at home.   Get in front of our fans and get things rolling.   But I really felt our ladies tried to‑‑ again, foul trouble with a few players, with McCoughtry and also with Erika some and kind of limited for that game, what they needed to do.
There's no excuse.   Minnesota shot well.   They did some things second half that‑‑ back cuts and stuff that we tried to rotate on quickly and get there on them, and Maya Moore and Augustus did a good thing of cutting and making things happen.   That's why they're Olympians.

Q.   Can you talk about the things you tried to do differently tonight?
FRED WILLIAMS:   Well, you know, when Tiffany Hayes went down the other day, I thought we'd go with a bigger lineup and Aneika get on the board some, it helped us.   With Tiffany coming off the bench, give a little time to have limited minutes, I thought I'd still play her the same, and it's because of the type of athlete she is.   But I thought going bigger was where we needed to go for this game. 

Q.   You guys really stressed no panic after the game was lost.   Pretty similar circumstances tonight.   How do you bounce back?   0‑2 feels a lot different than 0‑1, doesn't it?
FRED WILLIAMS:   Well, that's why you have home‑court advantage.   Minnesota had it throughout the year.   It's tough to play here in Minnesota.   For us, panic mode, there's really no panic mode for this team.   I think the things we accomplished, this team, for this team this year have been tremendous, and I think we have an opportunity for us still to have the fire lit and keep it burning.   It's our turn to go home and see what happens from there. 
You know, in this series it's one game at a time, and I'm pretty sure Coach Reeves is saying the same thing on the other end.   We've just got to play and keep playing hard.   This team has been beat up a lot and patched up and paced, and for me to keep them going and motivated, that's my job, and I'm trying to do a heck of a lot of things to keep it going. 

Q.   You did go with a bigger lineup and Minnesota got big advantage points in the paint, rebounds.   What led to the disadvantages there even though you did have some size advantages in the paint?
FRED WILLIAMS:   Well, it wasn't really the size in the paint, it was the back‑door cuts, some of the post‑ups off of their deflections, screens off their offense, and just got kind of lay‑ups in transitions against us that adds up to points in the paint.   But I just think rotating‑wise, for us we did a little better job at it, but we didn't sustain it throughout the third and the fourth quarter. 

Q.   Your next game is going to be in Duluth, Georgia, instead of Atlanta, not playing on your regular home court.   How do you think that's going to impact the game? 
FRED WILLIAMS:   Well, I know with our fans in Atlanta, they come out and support us if it's 30 or 40 miles away, as long as it's in the state of Georgia I'm good with that.   You know, it's going to be a little different.   We've been there before in the past and had a playoff game there.   It's just like anything in basketball, just got to go out and play, and I think our fans will come out and support us.

Q.   Atlanta had 35 percent field goal shooting against Minnesota's 56 percent.   How do you work to get opportunities for your players to maybe get some better shot selection?   Angel 5 of 18, Bentley 3 of 10, Hayes 3 of 9. 
FRED WILLIAMS:   You know, I would say with Angel, to be honest with you, I've never seen a great athlete go through two or three players and really come out empty on something.   And to me with Hayes the same way.   I mean, I don't know what else to tell them, just pull up for jump shots, quite challenging and coming out empty because every time that happens their percentage shots go down and they're known as slashers and going to the basket and drawing fouls.   For me I'm going to keep it clean right now, but I don't know what else to say.   Those percentages are really deceiving, and I think when we come out empty on some drives and don't get some things we think we'll get, it puts us back on our heels on defense, and Minnesota knows that.

Q.   Can you talk about the match‑up that Seimone presents to you guys?   Why is she such a difficult match‑up for you guys?
FRED WILLIAMS:   You know, she just moves around a lot, is very active coming off curl cuts and pot shots off of the elbow.   A lot of times it's off their 5 player, and you can't do a lot of switch outs on that.   You know, she's just a tremendous player.   We, the defense, need to get a lot of shots open, kind of the old Reggie Miller type player who can find where she needs to go and get shots.   We tried to contain that the second half some, but when you've got shooters, it's tough, and especially when you've got that around the perimeter. 

Q.   Are you concerned at all that Angel's frustration is building? 
FRED WILLIAMS:   I think she's got it in hand.   I would think she'd be a little frustrated because of some of the things she doesn't really get in penetrating to the basket.   For her she still had no fouls at the end.   Her teammates were really encouraging.   But we've got another game.   We've got to regroup, and she knows that.   She's a little frustrated, yes, I can see she is a little frustrated, but she's not to the point where she's going to let it all go.   She's going to stay put and stay under control and do the right things.
