DREAM   59
  LYNX - 84

THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach. 
FRED WILLIAMS:   Well, I felt the Lynx came out on fire.   They've been here before, home stands, with the crowd and stuff.   They shot very well around the perimeter.   Our defense‑wise still going to get a rotation, but we were one step slow on the weak side for defense. 
I thought the second quarter for us had some looks at the basket, came out empty and got a couple of players in foul trouble so I had to go to the bench real quick. 
Physical game, but that's what the final is all about.   Five‑game series, how they put it on paper.   But the Lynx got the first one and threw the first punch, so we have to play harder next time we can on the court. 

Q.   Fred, there is enough with Minnesota to deal with and Monica Wright comes off the bench and has a big game.   Can you talk about what she did and how much more difficult it makes for you guys? 
FRED WILLIAMS:   Monica has been that way for them ever since she's been in a Lynx uniform.   She comes off the bench, gives the spark, like Tiffany Hayes for us, when she was coming off the bench for us.   That was one of my concerns before the game, Monica's speed and turning the corner and being able to distribute the basketball.   She did a good job tonight. 

Q.   Coach, 0‑15 from three‑point range, how do you address your perimeter shooting?   What has been noted as a weakness in less than 48 hours? 
FRED WILLIAMS:   I noted it in the locker room right away, that's got to cut in half.   We've got to take three's sometimes because teams pack it in the paint and leave it out there for us.   But we've got to get away from that percentage shot and the take one dribble in and take the "hard 2" as I call it. 
Tonight they enticed us to get out there.   Some of those were when they were up on us, and trying to get 3‑pointers outside by McCoughtry and a couple of other players.   But that is definitely going to cut in half next time we play. 

Q.   Can you discuss the play of Angel and Jasmine.   They were 9‑for‑39 tonight. 
FRED WILLIAMS:   Almost sounds like the Washington game the first time we played.   Jas usually hits those shots from outside, tonight just didn't fall for her.   I thought Angel went through the lane and split the defense and came out empty and that enabled Minnesota to come on some runouts. 
And I think we have to be more selective with our shots coming down the stretch here against a good team. 

Q.   You mentioned that you've bounced back from a Game 1 loss in these playoffs already.   How do you recover from a game like this one emotionally when it was so lopsided and so many things didn't go your way? 
FRED WILLIAMS:   Well, you go in the locker room and you talk about, like I said, about the getting down and rolling up your sleeves and getting after it for the next game. 
Minnesota came out and threw a good punch at us with the shots, and a lot of players on our end hit the floor pretty hard and felt the pain.   It gave them the message this is what the finals is all about.   I've been there a couple of times with the Dream in the past in 2010 and 2011, and you know what it takes to get there if you want that trophy. 
We got to regroup after 12:01, and be ready for the next game. 

Q.   Coach, the shots that you took, other than the 3‑pointers, did you feel like you were taking them and not making them or was the defense making it difficult for you? 
FRED WILLIAMS:   We got 77 attempts.   77 attempts and they got 77 attempts.   So the difference is that they made 38 and we hit 24.   So, you know, you got the big three around that perimeter with Moore and Seimone and with Whalen, and you put Monica in that specter, too, that's a tough defend around the perimeter and stuff. 
We just got to still try to get it in the paint and hit some of those jumpers that we were able to take the first half. 

Q.   Coach, the Lynx appeared to be coming to earth a little bit in the third quarter.   Did you spot that as a window of opportunity for you to perhaps make your move? 
FRED WILLIAMS:   Well, we tried to make that move there and we saw that window, tried to get it down to 10 points or a single‑digit‑type situation. 
We took some quick shots and they were able to come out and start getting into a rhythm.   They're a team that's on rhythm in transition a lot and once they get rolling, they get rolling.   We're the same.   We didn't get in our transition game early. 
I thought in the second quarter that's kinda helped them gain some momentum, and then for us to come out a little bit in the third, I thought we would start generating that, but it just didn't happen for us, and they kinda got some runouts on us. 
THE MODERATOR:   Coach, thank you.
