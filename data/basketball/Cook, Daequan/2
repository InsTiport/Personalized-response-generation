  Q. How does it feel going back in and defending?  
 DAEQUAN COOK: It feels good. Having had an opportunity to play the way I did in the first half of the season on a good note, it felt good, getting back into a good rhythm coming back into All-Star weekend.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible).   
 DAEQUAN COOK: You know, it's kind of hard to say, because after the Houston game, shooting pretty well, and the Atlanta game, I feel really -- I just felt like I was in a lot better rhythm the last couple games than I was before which made it a lot easier for myself.   
  
  Q. What are some of the superstitious things you try to do?  
 DAEQUAN COOK: I didn't have anything superstitious. It wasn't nothing I did differently. As a shooter you're going to get in a slump. As a shooter that's what I continued to do, but now I feel real good.
