<p>	Q.	Q.  Have you been a strong advocate about the market team of the women's college game, for parity to spread; what else do you see besides marketing that would improve and grow the women's games?</p>
<p>	Q.	Q.  So much has been made about your offense; what did you run last year that was different and also for the players?  When did you really feel like you guys really started to grasp the offense?</p>

<p>	Q.	Q.  Coach Summitt, not to take anything away from the rest of the team, it takes talent to get to this point, every year the teams in the Final Four have a great guard and have a guard who is capable of taking over a game.  Obviously in this game there is two great guards in Kara and Alana?  Will you comment to similarities between their games and the difference between their games?</p>
<p>	Q.	Q.  Speaking of Alana, I guess there has been so much made of her desire as a high schooler to come to Tennessee.  You can't be everywhere all the time, was there a mistake made?</p>
<p>	Q.	Q.  To get an idea of how far the men's game has come, can you tell us your favorite stories about what it was like to travel or play in front of so many fans when you were a younger coach.  What are your favorite stories from the old days?  </p>
<p>	Q.	Q.  I'd like to ask the players because you have both been to more than one Final Four at Tennessee.  What lessons from your previous Final Four's are you going take into the game tomorrow night. </p>

<p>	Q.	Q.  I know you are very close with Jane Albright and I just wonder if she has been in touch with you; maybe you could give her some advice on her next career move and comment on the situation at Wisconsin what happened to her?</p>
<p>	Q.	Q.  For both players, can you talk about the focus you all have right now, looking at your practice today out there your one hour there was no laughing, there was no joking, it was all serious, knowing when you walked on the court, can you talk about the attitude have you right now?</p>

<p>	Q.	Q.  Gail Goestenkors has actually said given the way you guys are playing and the way her team has struggled to get to this point she considers her team to be the underdog, I wonder if you are buying that given your record and the first time you guys met this season?</p>
<p>	Q.	Q.  Kara and Gwen, in reference to the first Duke game that you guys played, I'm wondering how much that is still ingrained in your mind and whether that's something that you guys actually, you know, still remember and will you use it for motivation and whether it's so long ago that you don't really consider it relevant?</p>

<p>	Q.	Q.  This is for Pat.  I'm sure for Pat Summitt, Tennessee basketball coach it's good that Tennessee, Connecticut, and Duke in recent years are talking about as perpetual teams coming here but for the good of the sport is it good that one, two, three suspects are usually always talked about to get to this level?</p>
<p>	Q.	Q.  Everybody knows about Beard and Tillis obviously; how difficult is it to prepare when you don't really know who that third option, third scorer, third rebounder for them is going to be; it could be anybody?</p>
<p>	Q.	Q.  Pat, just to clear up the record, would you characterize your program as the "evil empire" or is that just a gross mischaracterization?</p>
<p>	Q.	Q.  Similar question, a few years ago Tennessee was considered the team that you had to go through to win a National Championship; has that changed maybe towards the other evil empire?  </p>
<p>	Q.	Q.  In the Northeast. </p>
<p>	Q.	Q.  I spoke to each of ESPN talent, what's the hottest team, Texas or Tennessee, No. 1 mentioned UConn, some people are perceiving them as an underdog, Coach Auriemma doesn't think they have a chance of winning; what do you consider them assuming this underdog rolling?</p>
<p>	Q.	Q.  Are you planning any special strategy against a Alana Beard?</p>
<p>	Q.	Q.  You said a few minutes ago you turned your cell phone off this week, Mickey said she has 2 cell phones going with Kentucky and Tennessee?</p>
<p>	Q.	Q.  Talk about her coming into this and what she has been going through, it will be different without her after this week?</p>
<p>	Q.	Q.  Kara, you have lived a lifetime in these Final Four's.  Does this one feel any different, what is your mindset as you go into your last Final Four?</p>


<p>	Q.	Q.  I'm just curious, in the history of Tennessee can you recall another Final Four where you have already played the other 3 teams that you have here?</p>
<p>	Q.	Q.  I didn't want to bring that up. </p>
<p>	Q.	Q.  Coach, there was so much made about the predetermined sites and what possibly could happen, how it might affect the tournament, now that you can look back over that situation how would access the way those worked out this year?</p>
<p>	Q.	Q.  You mentioned '87 Final Four, the year you guys won your first title and the last year Texas was in the Final Four.  Can you talk about what Texas meant to women's basketball back then, them getting back to a Final Four and that there are 2 coaches with 800 plus victories in this Final Four?</p>
<p>	Q.	Q.  Again, in your 4 NCAA tournament victories your team has outrebounded your rivals by 16 a game what has contributed to that?  When you look at the matchups for tomorrow, do you feel that your inside people are going to be stronger, tougher, more aggressive that you have an edge on Duke? </p>
