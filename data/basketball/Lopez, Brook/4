 Q. Tell me about tonight's game. Your rookies didn't have a good record in the game last year. Now you're on the other side. 
 BROOK LOPEZ: I think we should have won last year, I'm going to leave it at that. I think we really should have won. But now we have to uphold the sophomore tradition and come out here and rule. 

 Q. (Inaudible). 
 BROOK LOPEZ: We're going to try to play up and down, as well. We think we have the strength in both categories, so we're going to push it. 

 Q. (Inaudible). 
 BROOK LOPEZ: All-Star break, I'm here to have fun, hang out with the guys and just enjoy myself. 

 Q. What's been the biggest thing the second time around the league, just kind of knowing some of the players and just learning a lot of things?
 BROOK LOPEZ: Just getting used to the schedule, all the travel and everything like that, and having four games in five nights, stuff like that, just being more in shape, I guess. Not necessarily in shape, but used to the schedule.
