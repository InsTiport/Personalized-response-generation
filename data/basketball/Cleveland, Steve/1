<p>	Q.  Like to ask your impressions of New Mexico.  Are they deserving of the NCAA tournament consideration? </p>
<p>	Q.  You were able to have some success inside, but it seemed like the constant wave of those guys, it just kind of wore you guys down a little bit. </p>
<p>	Q.  How much of a difference was it in the two games where they had Granger as opposed to the first games you guys played?</p>

<p>	Q.  Coach, you pulled Ritchie aside after the game was over.  What were you saying to him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Steve, I know this is team that had a lot of talks, what do you say in the locker room?</p>
<p>	Q.  If the Lobos get a final game, and don't get an at-large berth, is that a slap in the face to a whole conference? </p>
