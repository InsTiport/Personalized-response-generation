<p>	Q.  Can you talk about how Wade after having such a tough game responded so strongly just mentally?  How tough is it to respond the way he did after Game 1?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just describe what the adjustments were?  It looked like he was attacking the basket more.  Was that what you guys saw on the film?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just talk about the way Dwyane has been able to do this in the 4th quarters in the postseason, because he's had a couple of big 4th quarters for you in the playoffs.  A lot of players play well over the course of the game but he does it at the most important time.  What does that say about him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Early in the game Dwyane was able to do what maybe he wasn't able to do on Monday, which was penetrate and finish.  Like you said, he is just in his second year, so how important was it for him to get those easy buckets and see the ball go in early on?</p>
<p>	Q.  A two-parter:  Talk about Zo and his importance to you guys given the defensive nature of this series; and second part is, talk about your bench and how they've come through for you. </p>
<p>	Q.  What went into the thought process of going to that line-up?  Such a tight game and they don't really have much experience playing together in games. </p>
<p>	Q.  With the defensive and rebounding improvements from Game 1, do you feel that you guys got back to playing Heat basketball tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously Wade was the story in the fourth quarter but talk a little bit about Zo.  He had three blocks in the fourth, took the charge, made the free throws.  What kind of positive energy did he bring?</p>
