<p>	Q. Can you fill us in on Dwyane and how long you will wait to make a decision, if you don't have one now?  And can you tell us if you sort of have a secret plan that you'll break open at the last minute that would be a different approach without Dwyane? </p>
<p>	Q.  If Dwyane does not play, would that affect your thinking whether you need more defense or continue to get offense and particularly, I'm asking about Shandon and Rasual?</p>
<p>	Q.  Dwyane came to the team relatively unheralded, what made him develop and flourish?</p>
<p>	Q.  If Dwyane does play, will you assign an assistant or someone to keep an eye on him, to make sure that he's not over-pushing it or to make sure that he has that level of effectiveness on, or as you're coaching the game, can you maintain an eye on that?</p>
<p>	Q.  We never were told exactly how it happened.  Do you know how it happened? </p>
<p>	Q.  Dwyane said that Shaq at 50 percent is better than no Shaq at all.  If Dwyane is at 50 percent is that better than no Dwyane at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is the decision to play Dwyane's decision or is it a medical decision and would he use any type of painkillers? </p>
<p>	Q.  Shandon has had pretty good moments playing with Shaquille, what is it about his game that allows him to find spots and just play well alongside Shaquille? </p>
