<p>	Q.  Have you come up with a Knute Rockne type speech?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know you don't want to get involved in medical lore, or are you a doctor, but do you have to talk to the medical officials to say, if he takes this treatment, he can do this, and if he takes that treatment, he can do that?  In other words, do you have to have a working knowledge of what percent and what limitations you have as you draw your game plan?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is it important to have Dwyane out there just for a sense of calm and normalcy and relaxation for the whole team?</p>
<p>	Q.  As with muscle injuries, you try to keep it warm without letting it get cold or whatever or sit on the bench for too long, do you keep him out, assuming he can play at a deep level, do you keep him out for shorter stints, did you put him back in after one or two minutes or does that change at all, the substitution pattern?</p>
<p>	Q.  How is Shaq doing after these four games in a short time period? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said you have Knute Rockne speeches, but will you call on anybody, Pat Riley talk to the team or will Shaq address them, is there anything else somebody else will do?</p>
