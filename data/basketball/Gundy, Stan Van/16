<p>	Q.  You said that they guarded your guards well.  What was it specifically that they were doing to Dwyane to close the space around him?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned Shaq not being as good in the second half.  Did you feel that -- you said he really gutted it out.  Did you feel it was an endurance and conditioning issue or that it was attributable to the leg?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just take us through before the game how you guys made the decision for him to play. </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about the high shooting percentage and rebounding.  Rasheed Wallace was the big factor in both those departments.  Talk about his impact on the game. </p>
<p>	Q.  I saw you using Alonzo Mourning and Shaquille in the lineup at the same time.  Do you think as the series progresses you're going to give this combination a lot more extended time to try to offset the two Wallaces?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is your first playoff loss this year.  How do you change -- do you change anything for Game 2?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much did this particular game come down to Detroit finding a mismatch in its favor, being patient with it and using it to its advantage?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much frustration did you see from Dwyane when he was trying to drive to the hoop and every time he tried to drive it looked like he was wrapped up by two, three guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about patience on shots.  Late in the game Dwyane Wade had a three pointer with about 40 seconds left.  Were you comfortable with that?</p>
