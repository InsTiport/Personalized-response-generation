<p>	Q. We obviously know it's there's no miraculous recovery with Shaq, but can you tell us how he is and is there any improvement at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  The schedule being the way it is, is this almost like regular season where you're traveling so much every day and are you almost approaching that way or is it still different? </p>
<p>	Q.  During the season when you've had games where the perimeter guys didn't defend particularly well or keep guys in front of them well, how have they responded to that in games after that and how well do you expect them to respond tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  With Detroit single-covering Shaq, is there a ripple effect on Damon and not getting as many open jumpers, do they stay on him more and does it affect him at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you get him more looks in transition out on the run? </p>
