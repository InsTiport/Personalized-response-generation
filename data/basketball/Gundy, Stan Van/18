<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Allen Iverson's performance tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, your two guys played pivotal roles in this Victory.  Some people felt that when Shaq was traded back to the East, that the balance of power had swung.  You won the All-Star Game today.  What do you have to say about that? </p>
<p>	Q.  You start the second half of the season going from here into Chicago.  What do you have to say about that team, which has turned things around?  Your brother referred to this year's Bulls as last year's Heat. </p>
<p>	Q.  What do you think about the theory that most people think the West is still a lot stronger than the East? </p>
<p>	Q.  Just wondering if as you've gotten to know Shaq if the vibrancy of his personality has struck you as surprising or did you know he had so much personality?</p>
