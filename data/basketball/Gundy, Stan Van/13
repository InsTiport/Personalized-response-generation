<p>	Q.  How is your right thigh?</p>
<p>	Q.  Dwyane only had two foul shots in that last game.  What has to be done differently?</p>
<p>	Q.  Detroit scored 90 points last game with only scoring 16 in the 4th quarter.  Was that the flow of the game or does that point to you guys need to tighten up the defense a little bit?</p>
<p>	Q.  Different players obviously take to watching film differently.  Dwyane said he watched some film with you yesterday and then he got on his own.  How analytical is he when he watches film, and what do you notice him picking out?</p>
<p>	Q.  Your top two rebounders, Shaq has got the thigh and Udonis Haslem's got the finger and I know those are not excuses, but is there any way to assist them in rebounding?</p>
