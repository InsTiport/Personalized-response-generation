Q. This series after this game, you get back to every other day of playing.  Is that help for continuity or because teams are so banged up do you prefer having the two- and three-day breaks that you've been having until now? 
 
COACH STAN VAN GUNDY:  No, I like playing.  I think it's better for everybody.  I don't think it necessarily gives either team an advantage.  I just like playing.  I mean, after tonight, third game of the series, I mean, you're going to make one or two maybe slight adjustments after that.  There's just not a whole lot else to do.  Both teams, all the teams, we've established how we're going to play.  Let's get to it and play games.  
 
Q.  You've got about 90 minutes to game time.  I don't know if you're going to prepare with any armor or anything going out there. 
 
COACH STAN VAN GUNDY:  No, I said what I've said.  I'm not going to worry about it anymore. 
 
Q.  Upon reflection, are you thinking that maybe that wasn't the wisest thing to say?
 
COACH STAN VAN GUNDY:  I'm not too worried about it one way or another.  It probably wasn't, but I'm not going to spend a lot of time thinking about it or worrying about it to be quite honest.  I'm a lot more concerned with how we're going to execute offensively and what we're going to do defensively than what their crowd is going to do.  Thanks.
