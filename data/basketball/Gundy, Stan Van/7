<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the impact it had on your team, only eight minutes from Shaquille in the first half. </p>
<p>	Q.  For much of the game you only had like 12 assists, did you feel like you didn't share the ball enough or what was the problem?</p>
<p>	Q.  It seemed like they were face-guarding Dwyane when he didn't have the ball a lot of times and they just seemed to be swarming him whenever he did come off a pick-and-roll?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the defensive effort in the fourth quarter.  Seemed like they turned it up a notch. </p>
<p>	Q.  Theirs. </p>
<p>	Q.  The Pistons had no turnovers in the first half and only six for the game, does that reflect their execution or is it a lack of defensive intensity? </p>
<p>	Q.  Taking fouls out of the equation, are there two or three things that you guys should have done tonight that you didn't do? </p>
