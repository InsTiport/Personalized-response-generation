<p>	Q.  I just wanted to ask you about the push that you made without Dwyane Wade early in that fourth quarter, late in the third. </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you think when everything had turned around right there in the fourth quarter and the Pistons had taken a five-point lead and the crowd was going nuts, what was going through your head and what do you think was going through your team's mind?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Shaq's free throws in the fourth quarter. </p>
<p>	Q.  What did you do so well for three quarters that allowed you to have a cushion going into the fourth, and then the defense in the fourth quarter, anything different, guys just playing harder?</p>
<p>	Q.  Your team has proved a lot to you during the course of the year, but Dwyane leaves with eight minutes left, you're down five, he comes back four minutes later.  What did they prove to you tonight?</p>
