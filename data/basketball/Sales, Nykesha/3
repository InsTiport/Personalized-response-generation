Q. Talk about how this team started strong in the first half but then later on kind of like ran out of gas a little bit in the second half, what happened? 

NYKESHA SALES:  Well, I think we had a lot of energy in the first half.  We were doing some really good things.  When we came out of the halftime, we had a few turnovers that we don't usually have.  We had 15 turnovers to their seven, which made a difference in the game.  A couple of the shots that we got, which were good looks but they didn't go in, and then on the other side, they were getting no shots but they were more around the basket, so those were high percentage shots and they were falling.  We continue to stay in the game through our effort and getting a couple steals, some good shots on the other end, but it just wasn't enough.  I think that's going to tell a lot about this series.  It's going to be like that throughout the rest of the series because we are two very good teams and we match up well and you know, it's just those key things that's going to make the difference in the game.  They are very minor, but they mean a lot.
