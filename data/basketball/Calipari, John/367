<p>	Q.  Williams, I know this is only his third game with you guys, but did you envision him as potentially a primary weapon?  He had 26, and first half he was 7 for 7 from the floor, 5 for 5 on 3, and 20 points. </p>
<p>	Q.  Hence the question. </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you envision Williams would fulfill the role of the primary threat on this club? </p>
<p>	Q.  Considering how much experience and some older guys that you had last year, are you surprised or impressed or what have you with how poised your guys seem this year, despite all of the freshmen you've got playing? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have a sense of what this game Friday night will mean to the City of Memphis? </p>
<p>	Q.  People have been talking about it all week, although it's never wise to look past UCLA but people have been talking about Memphis/Duke and it seems like the city back home is pretty exceeded. </p>
<p>	Q.  In '93, if I read the history right, you had the up-and-coming UMass team and on this course you took out number one UNC and an up-and-coming Memphis team; does anything feel the same to you? </p>
