THE MODERATOR:   We'll go ahead and get started with an opening statement from coach and then take questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH CALIPARI:   It was a good win.   Wasn't happy with how we started the game, but it was a good win.   And the kids fought and guys played, did the stuff they had to do.   Didn't shoot it well, still won.   
THE MODERATOR:   Take your questions for the student‑athletes, please.   
   
 Q.   Just wondering, you're a young guy, certainly the accomplishment to date for this program's pretty incredible.   For you guys, is it just about winning the next game or does all these fans that have been around forever, does that fall on you wanting to be‑‑ you know, fall into the historically one of the best ever teams that has ever been through here?   
KARL‑ANTHONY TOWNS:   For us, we just worry about the next game.   For you to be historic, you got to keep winning every next game.   So we just worry about what we can do to contribute to the game for each other, and also just make sure that we do everything we can to not only contribute, but to also help anyone who needs it.   
   
 Q.   For much of the game, y'all trailed in the stats, rebounding and what have you, and over the last, seemed like, eight or nine minutes or so, you took control of the boards.   Was it fair to say that was the difference in why y'all won as comfortable as you did?   
AARON HARRISON:   I think we just made a few defensive adjustments and we just found a way to win, really.   
KARL‑ANTHONY TOWNS:   We just made some defensive adjustments and that's what we did to win the game.   
THE MODERATOR:   All right.   We'll excuse you to the locker room and take questions for coach.  
   
 Q.   They just mentioned defensive adjustments.   What specifically changed?  
COACH CALIPARI:   Well, there's a little bit of the pick‑and‑roll stuff that they were shooting 65 percent early and our bigs were not doing what we were trying to do.   We were also not switching the way we wanted to on a few things.   
But the reality of it is, we didn't play with as much energy as Florida played with to start the game.   And they came in and I told them at halftime, If that's what we have in store, like that's how we're going to do this, we're going to have some problems.   
But I thought in the later part of the game, we found that combination of Andrew, Aaron, Tyler, Trey, and Karl or Dakari, that's what we did.   And see that's the advantage we have.   We'll juggle it around until we figure out who is playing well and then we'll ride with those guys.   
We want to platoon.   We want to all nine players to play.   But if you get in there and you're shaky at all or you're breaking down, it's like, okay, going to go with these guys.   
   
 Q.   You've had quite a few games that have been like this where it's been pretty close until five, six, seven minutes left and then you guys stretch things out.   What is it about this team that ‑‑  
COACH CALIPARI:   They have a will to win.   They do have a will to win and we have enough playmaker kind of players Andrew to Aaron to Karl now to Trey, I think Tyler.   We got a lot of guys that aren't afraid to make the play.   To be those kind of players, you cannot be afraid to make the game‑winning play.   None of those kids are.   They will take it.   
If they miss it, they will live with the result, which is late in the game where we'll make a play or two or come up with a defensive stop, we'll do some good stuff.   
THE MODERATOR:   All right.   Thank you.
