  Q. How close did they come to giving you the fight and the effort and all of that team work that you wanted?   
 COACH CALIPARI: DeAndre and Darius were way better. Terrence Jones was off the charts compared to the last one. Brandon is Brandon; he gives you about the same every time out. Eloy and Doron were fine. You know, they've been there.   
 Like I looked at Terrence, obviously, it's in there because he did it. So if you can do it once, it means you can do it. But we're not deep enough to have a couple guys not give us some.   
 But we shot the ball. I mean, it's kind of like you make open shots, it changes what everything looks like, and we did that today.   
 Happy for Jon Hood, you know. Happy how he played. Josh in the first half, you know, played, which is why I started him in the second. Wasn't as good in the second as he was in the first.   
 But the first half, again, those guys how many minutes are they going of to have to give you? I don't know. But whatever it is, it's got to be quality. It's got to be tough. It's got to be, you know -- so 28 assists. We had talked about it the last exhibition, pass the ball to each other. We even went a couple when we passed it where we should have shot it, should have driven the ball.   
 But I'm okay. It's kind of in between where we want to be, but, there are signs. Look, folks, we shot well, so we scored a whole lot of points. We defended fairly well, rebounded fairly well, but we've got a long way to go.   
 We've got two really important days this weekend. It's been almost football practice. Short of us putting them in helmets and pads, that's what it's been. So we've got to do mornings of football practice, and then we'll come back in the afternoon to play basketball. That's what we'll do this weekend. Then we'll give them Monday off.   
 But we've got no choice. We've got to be a rougher team, a tougher team without fouling. We've got to have more pride to go after balls. Every ball has to be like, I have to get this ball. There is not an option. I've got to get it. We still don't have a team full of guys, but they're trying.  
  
  Q. What did you like best about Jones tonight?  
 COACH CALIPARI: He had a passion about playing. There was no coolness. High school kid when's it doesn't go right, they try to be cool like I don't really care. You know, this isn't really me, but you can't be that way. He even started the game a little bit that way.   
 But what you saw was when he got near that goal, the thing that he does that not many in the country do at his size, his second, third and fourth jump. So go in there and do it. Just go in there and go rebound every offensive rebound. Go after it once, twice, three times. Don't accept being blocked out. Then run that court.   
 You saw him run and say is he that fast? Well, if he's that fast, run that fast, and these guys found him. Compared to the last game where he was crying in his soup after the last game, this was a good one for him.  
  
  Q. When he reached back to get that ball, was that athleticism you saw right there?   
 COACH CALIPARI: You know, he had blocks too, ends up with six blocks, and again, understanding that we're Pikeville and Dillard, we aren't playing high school, so there are things that we're doing in this game that we're not going to do in a regular game.   
 Let me tell you a play that I love. I get so upset, one of our players comes down. He gets a guy ahead and instead of trying to shoot it to him, he gets a charge and it's his third foul. I went ballistic.   
 Well, Jon Hood comes down, Terrence makes a steal at half court and he could have driven in and shot it himself. He give it's to Jon Hood who dunks it. Now all of a sudden Jon Hood's shoulders are back, chin is up and he's ready. So the very next play Jon Hood has the lay-up, and throws the lob to Terrence who dunks it. That's the kind of play.   
 The other thing I really loved was Brandon Knight going on a breakout. He could have shot it, he throw it's back to Terrence, let's Terrence dunk it and gets everybody going. We're learning, we're getting better.   
 Again, folks, I'm dealing with all freshmen again. So we've got to do it in a hurry, but we're getting there. You saw there were some sloppy plays. We've got to play defense different than we did last year.   
 I talked to Jay Wright on the phone for a half hour, and got some ideas from his '96 or '97 team when he had Foy and all those guards. Remember that team he had? They went to the Elite Eight.   
 He and I talked about defense, and how to play with that kind of team. So there are some things I'm going to do different than did I last year. But the first thing is you've got to be tough. If you're not tough enough, doesn't matter what kind of defense you're playing. And two, you've got to rebound the ball. If you don't have a big beast, then you all have to rebound. Everything we do starts there.   
 Then when we're talking, we rebound, we can scramble it, switch it, we can trap a little bit. We can do some things that will scramble up the game which is in our favor. A grind it out game with this team, we're too young. If they grind it out with us, we're going to have problems.   
 So if we're to scramble though, we've got to be tough, we've got to rebound and really, really talk to each other.  
  
  Q. Talk about the differences from last year and on defense that you expect this year?   
 COACH CALIPARI: Well, I think we can switch a whole lot more than we did a year ago. And I think that we can also do some scrambling that I didn't want to do last year because I didn't think we needed to.   
 See, last year when you drove in on us, it was getting blocked. We led the nation in shot blocks or blocked shots that were right there. It was not just one guy, it was like three or four. This team's going to be different.   
 So now it's like, okay, in a grind-it-out game, it's going to be a little harder for us. So I think a lot more switching we should be able to do. We're all alike.   
 At one point we had Terrence at 6'9", and everybody else between 6'5", and 6'7". I mean, Denny Crum used to do it. Denny Crum did the greatest job of taking you out of your offense by playing a bunch of guys.   
 He never liked the small guard. He liked 6'5" guards. I kind of like 6'5" guards. So now everybody could switch every position, and that's what he did. He took you out of what you wanted to do. The guy won national titles playing that way, national titles at Louisville.  
  
  Q. That blue suit Dale had on, you got plans for one of those maybe in the future?   
 COACH CALIPARI: There are three suit that's I've seen that I say I don't know if I want to say gag me, but there's a white suit I saw. There was a gold suit that I saw. I don't know if it was yellow or gold where the pants were too long. The guy at West Virginia wore it. Then that suit right there. Those three right there.   
 But, hey, look, he's a great guy. A former player here, and it was so great that they walk in this building and get that kind of ovation. And it's great for his team to see that the Big Blue Nation appreciates former players and still loves them.   
 Now they wanted to beat him, but prior to the game they gave him a great ovation, which was really neat.  
  
  Q. What do you maybe hope that team will do for Hood's confidence?   
 COACH CALIPARI: Well, what I hope it does -- well, let me tell you what Doron did which was the greatest thing. Remember the dive at half court because I was killing this kid. Come on, you've got to pick it up and play. You're not doing what the other guys are doing. You're not playing at the level, you don't have the passion. Come on, baby, get into it. Come on, let's go.   
 He dives on the floor for that ball, throws it ahead, we score. The very next play he's in the corner and makes the three. When you play that aggressive, you're aggressive offensively. When you play tentative on defense and you're getting thrown into the cheerleaders and getting sparkles on your face, okay, when that stuff happens, offensively you're playing timid, too.   
 You can't just be timid on defense and aggressive on offense. No, aggressive. You're aggressive and it makes you aggressive on offense. And, again, that is a lesson. It's just, you know, we'll go to practice, and we've got some time next week and we'll see.   
 I don't know if I'm going to play the small lineup or the big lineup. Probably won't know until game time what I want to do.   
 Got to still watch some tape on East Tennessee State. I've really watched nothing. Got to get in my mind what we'll have to do to prepare for an NCAA Tournament team, our first game with this young team. Kind of scary.  
  
  Q. Were you trying to get Jon (no microphone) ?  
 COACH CALIPARI: Yeah, and he was struggling. I've seen him do it, but you've got to have an effort and say I'm going to dunk the ball. I'm going to go out and get this. Not that I'm going to wait, so. But he'll be fine.   
 I'm just telling you, Josh is in the best condition he's been in in his life. He's playing better than he's ever played in his life, and I'm asking for a little bit more. That's what it is. I'm asking for a little bit more. He gives us a little bit more, I'm telling you.   
 But we need him. And Eloy's got to make strides now. He's got to make strides. So, thanks.
