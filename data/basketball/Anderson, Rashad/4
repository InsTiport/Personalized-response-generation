<p>	Q.  In light of everything that has transpired between the ACC and the Big East in the past 12 months, do you find this match-up tonight somewhat ironic, curious, interesting?  Does that matter to you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Two schools have won multiple national championships since the field was expanded to 64 teams.  What would it mean to win a second championship?</p>
<p>	Q.  Emeka, could you talk about the match-up with Luke, what you found out about him, what you saw in him when you saw him the last time. </p>
<p>	Q.  On Josh Boone.  Last night with Emeka Okafor's foul problems, he was thrust into an important role.  Can you talk about his contribution last night?  How has he exceeded your expectations from what they were at the beginning of the season?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you started talking about Rashad, can you talk about his emergence this year, specifically about his play down the stretch, a couple big threes and a defensive play on Redick in the lane?</p>
<p>	Q.  A minute ago you sort of chronicled the tribulations of being a pre-season number one.  How tough is that, then be in the position you are tomorrow night, the year you've been through?  The past five or 10 years, is that more difficult because of the attention to each injury, each day's practice?</p>
<p>	Q.  For the players and coach, how are you preparing for the changes since the NIT game heading into tomorrow night? </p>

<p>	Q.  Emeka, 12 hours since last night.  In that time, have you had a chance to reflect on what happened, clear it in your mind a little bit? </p>
<p>	Q.  Rashad, would you go over the steal you made late in the ballgame, what you were thinking when you went to the free-throw line. </p>

<p>	Q.  Jim, was the most eye-opening aspect of that match-up against Georgia Tech their guard play, how physical they were? </p>



<p>	Q.  Emeka, talk about your memories of that game.  How much pain were you in?  What was it like just trying to get through it, and also trying to play against a guy who maybe we didn't recognize at the time, what a good player he is? </p>

<p>	Q.  Taliek was saying this is a revenge game.  Do you view the loss as a motivational tool that you can use to inspire you in this game?  Do you feel it's a revenge game? </p>
<p>	Q.  As a senior, knowing this is your final college game, what is your sense of anticipation and satisfaction knowing you finally have gotten to this point in your career? </p>



<p>	Q.  I really was going to ask the question. </p>
<p>	Q.  14 rebounds last night.  Can you talk about the importance of rebounding in this game coming up? </p>

<p>	Q.  Mike Krzyzewski was talking Friday about the devaluation of low post play, saying players don't even like to be called centers anymore.  Do you find maybe with the current emphasis on perimeter play, do you find it ironic two pretty stereotypical centers are going to be kind of in the limelight tomorrow night?</p>
<p>	Q.  Josh's points, his contributions, don't seem noticeable during the game, but when you look at the stat sheet, it seems he makes a big contribution.  Is that a fair assessment, he's sort of silent assassin, for lack of a better description ?</p>

<p>	Q.  Could you address the excitement of the fact that you are playing now for the national championship? </p>

<p>	Q.  You have spoken at times this year about how much you like this particular group.  I was wondering if you would talk about what it is that you like so much about them in terms of people.  Usually when we ask about that, it's in the context of Emeka or Ben.  Last night Denham comes off, a guy who lost the starting job, Tooles gives you some good minutes. </p>

<p>	Q.  I know you don't like to look ahead, but look way ahead, the way your conference is going to look in a couple years.  How do you feel about it?  Is there such a thing as having too many good teams in a league?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much of this team's success can be traced back to what happened in this building a year ago?  Did you ever think about asking for a different locker room? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned briefly, Rashad's defensive play, how much have you had to get on him, how far has he come in the last month?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've been in the position before of winning dramatic games on the first day of an NCAA weekend.  What is the key to the turnaround, getting them ready in 48 hours?</p>
<p>	Q.  Having gone to school and played in the shadow of the Hall of Fame in Springfield, do you have any kind of greater appreciation for people who have made that?  Did you have any disappointment in not making it this year?  Is it something you hope to be a part of someday?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about what it has been like to coach Emeka, watch him grow as a student, player, what that whole thing has been like for you. </p>
<p>	Q.  You had some very good players before freshmen that didn't play well in the NCAA.  How did Josh play yesterday? </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm so glad you brought up the women first.  What is your overview of what it would mean to the University and the basketball-loving state if UConn could become the first school to win both heavyweight titles simultaneously?</p>
<p>	Q.  The question about your affinity for this team, particularly Denham, who was starting.  I guess a kid like Tooles comes to college thinking he's going to be a four-year star.  To get what you get from them, day in, day out. </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the way Georgia Tech plays halfcourt defense and the challenge it's going to be for you guys tomorrow, particularly after the first time you played them this season?</p>
<p>	Q.  Paul talked about Red Holzman, the way his team tries to play that same unselfish, old-fashioned basketball.  You had a guy in Boston you admired.  Are we really talking the same type of basketball, old-fashioned, team-first concept?</p>
<p>	Q.  In '99 you chose to remember some of your early recruiting days at Connecticut.  Assuming that your life has gotten easier since then in terms of recruiting, how do you motivate yourself to stay hungry?</p>
<p>	Q.  If you win the title tomorrow night, joining an elite company of active coaches that have multiple titles, Bob Knight, Mike Krzyzewski, what would that mean to be held in that kind of esteem, to have two national titles when so few don't even get the chance to have one?</p>
<p>	Q.  Tell me what makes Paul Hewitt special as a person and what makes him special as a coach?</p>
<p>	Q.  You had to work your way up the ladder coaching.  He's done that.  Do you see some parallels?  Does that give you a greater appreciation for what he's done, especially this quickly?</p>
<p>	Q.  Emeka is in another room explaining that he graduated in three years because of basketball, when sometimes the thinking is kids take more than four years to graduate because of basketball.  Are you prouder of what he has done off the court academically, involvement in the community, or on the court, and why?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned earlier how so few centers come to college now to develop their game.  Because of that are opportunities like this one to challenge -- for Emeka to challenge himself against Luke, are they few and far between now?  Because of that, what experiences have been most important to him in terms of developing his post skills?</p>
<p>	Q.  How is Charlie Villenueva handling the last few weeks?  Do you think he's appreciating the opportunity of what he's learning now had he skipped college?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was there a point in time recently when you saw the team, "Hey, we're ready to make this run we're in right now"?  Was there a certain period?</p>
