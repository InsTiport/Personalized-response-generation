		  RONEEKA HODGES: So far it's been great. 

 Q. Obviously your teammate Becky was part of last year; get another win tonight? 
 RONEEKA HODGES: That's the goal to come out well and represent well. 

 Q. When you're walking around here and see all of these great players around, what do you think when you see all of these guys? 
 RONEEKA HODGES: I think I'm trying to be cool, not be as starstruck or nothing like that, but it's always good to come out and see all of these guys that you're watching on TV all the time playing and see them up close in person, it's a good feeling. 

 Q. Have you talked to Vickie about this event?
 RONEEKA HODGES: No, I haven't talked to Vicky. I mean, I've seen it a couple of times on TV during previous All-Star weekends. So I'm just going to try to come out and get the win.

 Q. Have you met your teammates yet? Are you excited to see the chemistry that you have going? 
 RONEEKA HODGES: Yeah, I'm excited. I've seen Kenny all the time on TNT talking a lot of smack, so we'll see. 

 Q. What do you think, obviously the Spurs, big talk of the NBA with the best record; what do you see in them, and do you think they can keep this up?
 RONEEKA HODGES: The Spurs are having a great season. I actually love watching them play. They play well together as a team and like past San Antonio teams, they have good chemistry and they are doing a great job in the first half of the season.
