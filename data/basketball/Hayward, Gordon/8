Q.   What's it like to share this whole weekend with two of your teammates?
GORDON HAYWARD:   That's the best part.   We've got three players from the Jazz here.   We are playing good as a team, and it makes me proud.   It's good to be here, and hopefully we have a good showing. 

Q.   What's it like being around these players, the guys, the coaches?
GORDON HAYWARD:   I think you just take the experience as a whole and just have fun and take a little break from your season.   There's a lot of ups and downs for us in the season, so it's good to kind of get away from our team.   We're still playing basketball, still thinking about basketball, but it's a different type of basketball.

Q.   Do you have any insight on Jeremy Evans in the Dunk Contest?   Do you think he's going to do pretty good?
GORDON HAYWARD:   Oh, yeah, he can win it.   He can win it for sure. 

Q.   You guys practiced last night.   What was that session like and who was involved?
GORDON HAYWARD:   I can say it was cool to be in that arena and be off by ourselves.

Q.   It was at Amway?
GORDON HAYWARD:   Yeah.   We were able to practice.   He can win it.   He can win it easily.
