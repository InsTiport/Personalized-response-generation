 Q.   Being an All‑Star what kind of motivation is it to become an All‑Star?   
JOHN WALL:   I mean, you play this game, you've got a lot of goals.   Everybody got goals that they want, and I got goals.   All the guys that made it, they deserved it, and when you go out there and watch the game you see that, you want to be out there one night.   
   
 Q.   When tonight is over with, you guys win this game, and it's just kind of motivation, more of that stuff that you were talking about, how you want to perform under the bright lights.   
JOHN WALL:   Yeah, it's always good to play in front of these people here.   A lot of NBA guys that don't get in the All‑Star Game.   Come out and watch, your family and friends.   You just enjoy yourself and have a great time, but also know that you want to come out with a win.   That's the main thing while you're here.   You still have a goal that you want to be a winner out on the court.  
   
 Q.   I didn't ask you about the first half.   33 games down, you've got 33 more to go.   How much are you using this weekend to not think about it but think about it at the same time?  
JOHN WALL:   You think about it a lot.   You think about the things you've done and how you played, how the first half wasn't great for us.   You use it as motivation to come back and have a better second half.   If you're trying to make the Playoffs, that's how you've got to finish it off.
