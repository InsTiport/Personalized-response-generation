  Q.  Talk about the challenge of trying to play Shaq?   
 DESAGANA DIOP:  He's a good player, great player.  We just have to go there and play hard, like we've been doing all season.  Hey, I'm just going and going to play hard.  He's a good player, do my best.   
  Q.  Can you talk about the differences in playing Tim Duncan in the post as opposed to playing Shaq in the post?
