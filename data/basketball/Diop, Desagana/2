  Q.  Have you picked up on that, though?   
 DESAGANA DIOP:  I mean, when you're a jump-shooting team, if you miss a shot, maybe if you make it 3.  If you miss it it's (inaudible) you don't play no defense, know what I mean.  That's how it is.  And you play pick-up in the summer.  Jump is frustrating.  But I didn't say that.   
  Q.  But can you sense that they're not the same sort of -- they have the same sort of spirit about them that they had the first game?   
 DESAGANA DIOP:  I don't know.  It's hard to tell when you're playing.  You don't really pay attention.   
  Q.  You focus?   
 DESAGANA DIOP:  Yeah, focus on what we're doing.   
  Q.  You guys having fun out there, though?   
 DESAGANA DIOP:  We're winning.  When you're winning, win by one point, winning play defense.  Playing our style the last two games good for us.   
  Q.  Let's talk about your defense.  You guys (inaudible) like you guys have.  What's been the key to it?   
 DESAGANA DIOP:  I mean, get back with defense.  The first game they kill us trying to do a lot of layups, get back with all the layups and do the best we can, make them use what they had.   
 A lot of their guys like to go right and make them use their other hand and contest every shot they take.   
  Q.  And the challenge in defending Boris, tell me about that?   
 DESAGANA DIOP:  He's a good player.  Most improved.  I got a lot of respect for his game.  Make him use his weak hand.  He likes to go right.  He's really good going right.  I make him use his left hand.  I'm so long I can contest his shots.  (Inaudible) that's what I've been doing.   
  Q.  Were you surprised to get the call in the second half and think you'll be starting tomorrow night?   
 DESAGANA DIOP:  I don't know.  I don't know of course (inaudible) win a game.  Today if you call me I'll be ready too.   
  Q.  Do you know his dad?   
 DESAGANA DIOP:  Yeah, I know his dad.   
  Q.  You know his dad from Senegal?   
 DESAGANA DIOP:  That's where I am from.   
  Q.  Ten minutes from you?   
 DESAGANA DIOP:  Yeah.   
  Q.  His dad is?   
 DESAGANA DIOP:  Yeah.   
  Q.  Is his dad a big athletic hero?   
 DESAGANA DIOP:  He is.   
  Q.  Senegal, in the middle of the playoffs?   
 DESAGANA DIOP:  We used to hang out two years ago when I was at home.  He's a good guy.
