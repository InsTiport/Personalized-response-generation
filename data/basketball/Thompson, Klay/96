SPURS   102
  WARRIORS - 92

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You had the opportunities tonight?
KLAY THOMPSON:   The shots were there. 

Q.   Was it a matter of one of those nights where the shots weren't falling?
KLAY THOMPSON:   Yeah, I mean, missed some easy midrange shots and layups should have made.   Collectively we didn't shoot as good as we did in the first two games. 
It wasn't our offense.   It was our defense.   I personally have to be more physical with Tony Parker.   You can live with him coming off of ball screens.   You got to limit how many times he does that.   It starts with me. 

Q.   Was there something specific that Parker was doing that changed from the first two games?
KLAY THOMPSON:   No, he was doing what he did in the first two games.   He was just taking shots at a higher rate and he was making them at a higher rate.   Got to give him credit. 
Can't take away everything he does.   We tried to take away his opportunities around the rim.   He just hit some tough shots.   Look at film, we'll adjust for Sunday. 

Q.   How concerning is Steph's ankle to you guys?
KLAY THOMPSON:   I have faith in Steph.   I think he'll bounce back.   I don't know how he's feeling. 
Hopefully he's with us, he's our best player, he's our leader.   But if he's not, we'll have to do it collectively and not let it bother us.   All‑Star caliber player, I really hope he's with us.   But I have faith in him. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KLAY THOMPSON:   He's a good defender, but those were shots I was hitting in the first two games.   You're not going to be perfect every night. 
I mean, yeah, he's a good defender.   I'm not going to let it affect me.   Come out and take 'em again on Sunday. 

Q.   They make it look easy almost, but I know it's not.   How tough is it to defend that kind of a system? 
KLAY THOMPSON:   Yeah, well, I mean, they're so unselfish.   They got some great talent.   They've been doing it for a decade.   They know that system better than probably they even know it. 
So it's tough.   I mean, it's kind of disheartening sometimes when you feel you play as good of defense as you can and they're hitting shots.   That's basketball.   Those guys, they got champions on their team. 
This is the great thing about the series, it's the first of four.   We've shown we can win on our home court in the playoffs and win in San Antonio.   So this hurts, but we can't dwell on it.
We have to know they're going to get some buckets and make some plays.   That's what they do.   You can't stop 'em every time.   Can't hang our heads.   Worst thing we could do. 

Q.   Your dad is a follower of your career.   Do you commiserate with him after a game like this? 
KLAY THOMPSON:   He'll definitely give me advice.   He was here tonight.   It's the basketball player he'll critique, tell me what I do well. 
I thought I could have been a lot more physical on defense.   You're not going to stop Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili every game.   They have great role players as well, guys that can really shoot the ball. 
We have to watch film tomorrow, learn from it.   I'm sure my dad will have a lot of advice for me tonight and tomorrow when I see him. 
Thank you.
