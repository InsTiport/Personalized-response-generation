Cavaliers   95
  Warriors - 93

Q.   You got off to a better start today, and as a result you finished with 34 points.   Was that part of the game plan, to get you going early tonight? 
KLAY THOMPSON:   No, I just let the offense come to me and tried to play as aggressive as I can.   But in the end, 34 points is meaningless.

Q.   This game was very different than the last game.   How are you feeling physically coming off of the concussion?   Was the last game tougher for you to get into a rhythm, and do you feel a hundred percent healthy now? 
KLAY THOMPSON:   I feel a hundred percent.   I don't think‑‑ I mean, last game I had some great shots that just didn't go in.   That's just basketball.   But I honestly don't even really remember.   I was just trying to take it one game at a time.

Q.   You got off to a good start shooting the ball, but as a team obviously it was not your guys' night.   How tough was it on this stage to kind of see Steph have a night like he had and just overall the team not be able to get the shots to go down? 
KLAY THOMPSON:   Well, we have all the confidence in the world in Steph.   We know he's going to bounce back with a great night, a few great nights.   Without him we wouldn't have been in the game there at the end.   So this is on no one's shoulders.   It's a collective effort.   It's a team sport, and obviously it really stings right now, but we've been in this situation before and we're not going to let it deflate us.

Q.   You guys did a great job defensively against LeBron.   It seemed like he didn't shoot a high percentage, yet he gets 39, 16, and 11.   Is there anything more you could do against him and how good was he tonight when they needed him? 
KLAY THOMPSON:   He played really well.   He did a good job finding people.   In the end we put ourselves in a great position to win.   That's why it hurts even more.   I'm really proud of the way we all fought. 
There are going to be a lot of what‑ifs tonight, and that just comes with basketball, and just got to regroup tomorrow, and we'll be all right.

Q.   Klay, can you assess the impact that Matthew Dellavedova, a guy who doesn't usually play a lot, had on this game? 
KLAY THOMPSON:   He had a good few plays there at the end, some big shots as well.   I forgot to box him out on that last possession where he got the foul, and I'm going to think about that for a long time.   I shouldn't have tracked the ball.   I should have found my man.   So it's tough, but you've got to give him credit.   He made big plays.

Q.   Obviously you exploded tonight.   But what is it about the Cavs' defense that frustrates you so much and stops you in both your first games with under 100 points at the end of regulation? 
KLAY THOMPSON:   They're a long, athletic team.   They are playing good defense, but I think a lot of it is on us.   We're not playing like ourselves.   We're not moving the ball like we should.   We only had 16 assists.   That's not us, man.   We usually get 20, 25 when we're playing great. 
So we've got to move the ball better and trust each other.   But they are playing well on the defensive end.   But it's more on us.   We've got to play with a better rhythm.

Q.   You seem very frustrated.   I understand it was obviously a very hard loss here at home.   Do you think your focus as a group didn't last like it has to?   Are you guys overconfident with all that Kyrie Irving stuff and you didn't start playing the way you guys needed to play tonight? 
KLAY THOMPSON:   No, I don't think so.   We got off to a great start.   Kyrie being out, it didn't affect us because we know they're still a really good team.   They've won a lot of postseason games without him. 
We played great defense, man.   It's just we've got to play better on the offensive end and trust each other.   It's nobody's fault.   It's a team effort, and we'll bounce back.   We've been in this position before.
