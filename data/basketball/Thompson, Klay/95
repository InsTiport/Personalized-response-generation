  Warriors   96

Q.   You guys shot 6 for 31 from three‑point range tonight.   Was that just a bad shooting night?   Poor shot selection, good defense, what would you chalk it up to? 
KLAY THOMPSON:   I would say a bad shooting night.   I'll go home tonight‑‑ I had some great wide‑open looks from the corners, when I see Stephen release them, I think that's a lay‑up, and we just barely missed them.   But great shots, we got good shots.   6 for 31 for three is uncharacteristic for us.   We probably hit half on Sunday.

Q.   There was the one you had a chance to tie the game.   You had an open shot.   Is that the one you're talking about? 
KLAY THOMPSON:   Oh, yeah, that was back rim.   Good back spin, that felt great.   I even was walking back like I made it.   When it leaves your hand, it felt great.   That one hurt.

Q.   Do you look at this as a positive for making that comeback or is it a disappointment? 
KLAY THOMPSON:   It's a disappointment because we can't let ourselves get down 18 to that team.   We're in our home building, and it's where we play the best.   We've got to just come back Sunday and play with the same energy we had in the fourth quarter.   We were playing with active hands, setting screens. 
Our backs are to the wall now, so we'll play with nothing to lose on a Sunday.   It was just more disappointing.   It's playoff basketball.   It's just disappointing.

Q.   In terms of the run you guys made with the small lineup, is that something that you think you may see more of or may see more of Andre on Griffin? 
KLAY THOMPSON:   Possibly.   Dre's such a good on‑ball defender.   He's so versatile.   He makes it tough on Blake.   He made some great shots tonight.   But Draymond makes it tough on anybody.   When we play small like that, we can move the ball.   We got great looks, can move the ball well.   Everybody has the ability to handle.   We'll probably see it a little bit more.

Q.   Were you able to switch everything on that? 
KLAY THOMPSON:   Yeah, it helps.   It takes a lot off on the defensive end.   When you have a small lineup like that, we've just got to help out the bigs, the guards do.   Because they have two of the better rebounding bigs in the league.

Q.   Can you talk about the presence of Jordan in the middle? 
KLAY THOMPSON:   He played really well.   You've got to give him credit.   Just rebounding, finishing, made free throws, so you've got to give him credit.   But we can't let them get that many opportunities on the offensive glass.   We were playing physical, and we did a good job of fouling when we they got the ball, so we have to keep doing that.
