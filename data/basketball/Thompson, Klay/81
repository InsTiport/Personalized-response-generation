 Q.  Klay, congrats.  What will you cherish most about this title?  
KLAY THOMPSON: Just the fact I got to go up against Steph in the finals again.  It was like dÃ©jÃ  vu last year.  Not gonna lie, I got nervous when he hit his first eight, and I didn't think he was going to miss.  But it was exciting, just coming back to Oakland [with the title], you know.  Back-to-back years for Splash Brothers, it's pretty cool.   
 Q.  How long will you have bragging rights over Stephen with this big win today?  
KLAY THOMPSON: About 364 days, and then -- but that's a daily thing we do.  We love to shoot against each other.  You know, I've never been on a team with someone who shoots it better than me, so it's a privilege to work with him every day.  He makes me that much better.   
 Q.  Did you guys have a bet before this of the winner?  
KLAY THOMPSON: We had a gentleman's bet.  That was about it.  It was just fun because we have friendly trash talk between each other, and it's all lighthearted out there.  You know, he's the best shooter I've ever seen, so this is a rare occurrence that he loses.  So I'm just happy I caught him on an off night.   
 Q.  With you, Steph and Draymond, how great can this Warriors team be this season?  
KLAY THOMPSON: It's not just us three.  It's fantastic we're all three here together.  It's crazy to see how far the Warriors' organization has come.  You've got to give a lot of credit to our front office and their drafting and their free-agent acquisitions.  But we have such a deep, talented team that it's the nights when me, Steph and Dray and the starting lineup doesn't have it, it's when our second unit comes in there and picks it up.   
So that's why we've been able to sustain what we do this year.  It's not just the starting five or us three, it's as a whole we're such a hard team to beat because we come at you in waves.   
 Q.  Congratulations, sir.  Looking at the first half of the season, what do you want to do differently so that you don't burn out toward the end of the year?  
KLAY THOMPSON: Well, being my fifth year, I know what to do.  Not only is it about staying physically fresh, you've got to stay mentally fresh.  You've got to keep that hunger and edge.  We plan on playing for a long time, all the way until June.  It's a long season, especially coming off the run we had last year.  So you just got to eat right, got to get your sleep, you've got to put off all the fun to the offseason.  You've just got to focus on the task at hand, and that's trying to win another trophy.  You can't do it on your own.  You have to depend a lot on your teammates, and that's why we have the depth we do.
