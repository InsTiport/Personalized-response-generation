Clippers - 129, Warriors - 121
Q. Why is Lou Williams so difficult to defend?
KLAY THOMPSON: He can score from anywhere.  Got a lot of foul calls tonight.  And he's good at drawing those.
Q. You guys defended him very well down in L.A.  What was different out there?
KLAY THOMPSON: We'll do the same thing we did Friday that we did in L.A., those past games.
Q. Did you get the feeling that you guys were going to make the run at the end?  Kevin got the dunk, looked like momentum was on your side.  You had that feeling that was going to happen?
KLAY THOMPSON: Yup, a little too little, too late.  And now we have to go close it out in L.A.
Q. What was the difference defending Williams tonight compared to L.A., you bottled him up?
KLAY THOMPSON: He made shots.  He made some tough shots.
Q. What about the stretch where you were able to cut into the deficit, can you build upon it in Game 6?
KLAY THOMPSON: Shoot, there's no building, we just go do what we do.  Like, build from this game?  This game sucked.  We lost.  Let's freakin' win by 30, like we're capable of.  But it's basketball.  So I'm excited for Friday.
Q. Was there any feeling that the team was looking at the next series?
KLAY THOMPSON: Yup, start with me, I was.  I thought we were going to come out and win tonight, but sometimes life doesn't go as planned.  We're still in a great position with hopefully only 48 minutes left to close these guys out.  They've been pesky.  They've been tough, but now it's time to do what we do.
Q. It's been kind of a theme this year, you've been much better on the road than at home.  Obviously it's kind of played to form in this series.  Why do you think that is?
KLAY THOMPSON: I have no idea.  I have no idea.  We still won a lot of games at home.  But we'll take a win anywhere.  That's fine.  We just have to win all our road games, whatever.
Q. What impresses you the most about the Clippers, in general?  What impresses you the most about the way they play the game?
KLAY THOMPSON: They play hard.  They play hard.
