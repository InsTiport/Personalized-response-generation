 HAKIM WARRICK:  I've been working out.  I'll try to bring something new.  I know everything has been done before.  I've been thinking, I've been thinking, and hopefully tomorrow I can go out there and pull something off. 
 Q.  Were you inspired last year by Josh? 
 HAKIM WARRICK:  That was what the Slam Dunk competition is all about.  He gets it and he's entertaining.  That's something I want to definitely go out and try to be, entertaining, have fun, that's what it's all about.
