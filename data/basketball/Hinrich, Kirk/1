<p>	Q.  Kirk, can you discuss the last three you shot and the one that you passed up to give to Michael? </p>
<p>	Q.  The free-throws, is there any explanation, anything going through your mind now, could you have done anything differently? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much did your ankle affect you over the final few minutes? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach is very sincere about his comments about what this loss meant to him, devastating as it was.  Could you guys share what your feelings are with this outcome. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the early comeback in the second half.  Did that take a lot out of you guys?  Looks like it was really tough in the middle of the second half. </p>
<p>	Q.  Nick, would you talk about Carmelo Anthony's performance in this tournament, what he means to that team. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach says he doesn't like the moral victory type situation.  With that finish you guys had, being down by 18, cutting it back to 2, could you react to that strong finish. </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the full-court press, how it got you guys back in the game.  Do you feel maybe if you went to it earlier, the outcome could have been a little different? </p>
<p>	Q.  It's going to take a while for it to sink in, when you look back at the last four years, you have had careers a lot of guys would give their eye teeth for? </p>


<p>	Q.  Are you going back with the team tomorrow as scheduled? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you react to what Nick Collison just said, the comment about going to the NIT, the heartfelt comments he made.  What's your immediate reaction to that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about McNamara's performance in the first half.  Did he stand out more than you thought he would? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about what being the head coach of Kansas has meant to you. </p>
<p>	Q.  Is this any harder with the chances you had, the opportunities you missed, the free-throws?  Does that make it even harder? </p>
<p>	Q.  Your thoughts on your future with Kansas?  Do you feel you're going to be back, so forth? </p>
<p>	Q.  In the second half, you limited Carmelo Anthony's chances, his touches.  You seemed to put a lot of different guys on him.  Could you talk about the strategy you used and what did you think of his overall game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the play of Keith and Jeff tonight.  How damaging was it to lose Keith with that much time left in the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Understanding Nick was struggling offensively putting the ball in the basket.  Have you ever seen anybody play like that, considering the ball wasn't going in?</p>
<p>	Q.  You and Jim lingered longer than most coaches do after a game.  Would you mind sharing what you said to him and what he might have said back to you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did he say anything back to you?</p>
<p>	Q.  One of the disadvantages for Syracuse was their youth and inexperience in the big game as opposed to y'all being in the Final Four last year.  Did you ever see three freshmen play with as much poise as theirs did? </p>
