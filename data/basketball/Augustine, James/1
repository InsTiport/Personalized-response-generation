<p>	Q.  Dee, Deron, Luther, all the rhetoric surrounding this has been the best talent versus the best team with Carolina being the talent.  How do you respond to that? </p>

<p>	Q.  Deron, you guys have been No. 1.  I think you were No. 1 for 15 straight weeks, with some doubters believing that North Carolina actually may be the better team.  Is this the best scenario you could imagine to prove it once and for all? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Weber, ask about the dynamic of coming in.  These are guys you didn't recruit, in taking over, selling yourself to them.  Was there a period where you had to sell yourself?  Is it different than with a group of guys you brought in yourself? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Weber, all of the things that make this a mega, mega event, the number of people in the stands, size of the venue, late start time, do you see all those things as good, a comment on the health of college basketball, or do you see it as kind of a lack, a challenge or troublesome about the grand scale of this weekend? </p>
<p>	Q.  Roger or James, can you assess your place in history, if you win, to have an NCAA record for wins in a season and the fewest losses by anybody in like 20 or 30 years?  Where do you think you would stand? </p>
<p>	Q.  Any of the players, you guys in this morning's papers are two-and-a-half-point underdogs.  Are you surprised by that?  Do you view it as evidence that you continue to be underestimated? </p>
<p>	Q.  James and Roger, you guys have already heard a bunch of questions about them being the more talented team.  You have won 37 games, which ties an NCAA record.  Does it irk you guys at all to hear that the other team supposedly is more talented? </p>
<p>	Q.  Bruce, on that point, on Deron, people always open up their description is that he's more athletic than he looks.  You said that last night.  He's going against maybe a guard tomorrow night who is so athletic.  A lot of people said after last night's game if they had one person to start a team with, they'd start it with him.  What makes him the player that he is? </p>
<p>	Q.  James, did you see Sean May's performance last night?  Can you talk about the challenge you'll have facing him on the defensive end? </p>
<p>	Q.  Roger, there's been so much talk this year about criticism of Illinois's big men.  Are you looking forward to playing a team like North Carolina? </p>
<p>	Q.  James, what do you remember about the past two meetings you've had during your time against UNC?  Does that familiarity with their personnel help you?  It may help them, but from your perspective, does it help you? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you look at the rosters of these two teams, who plays what roles, what do you think it says about the importance experience plays in this tournament? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Weber, you've gotten to this level fairly quickly.  As you were coming up through the ranks, could you have an appreciation for what Coach Williams has been through, falling short while making it here so many times? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Weber, we all look at all the great players on Carolina's team.  Other than maybe Sean May, is there a player who you think could be an X-factor in the game and someone who you are most concerned about guarding? </p>
<p>	Q.  I suppose who you play in the ACC Big-10 challenge is a crapshoot.  How does playing North Carolina twice in the past couple years factor into tomorrow's game?  You were around for the second one.  What do you remember from that game in Greensboro? </p>
<p>	Q.  Deron, do you see similarities between your game and that of Raymond Felton? </p>
<p>	Q.  James, yesterday after their game, Carolina's Coach Williams made reference to the fact that you guys were wearing some shirts that said something like "Finish the job," something like that.  Can you tell us what that sentiment means to you and what that accomplishment would mean to you also? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, do you think back at all at things that helped you get this job, any kind of irony the fact that the coaching dominos started to fall when Roy Williams left Kansas for North Carolina? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, at about what point in the process, maybe the day that Roy said he was going to North Carolina, did you realize the dominos may affect you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Deron, a lot of people have talked about you were one of the first guys to buy into coach's unselfishness theory of playing when he took the job.  A lot of people wondered if Illinois was going to be capable of playing that way.  What was it about coach's philosophy when he came in that you bought in so quickly? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, last night Sean May talked about this being like a dream match-up, a match-up everybody wanted to see.  First time in 30 years 1 and 2 plays.  Can you put that in perspective? </p>

<p>	Q.  You had many flirtations before you got the Southern Illinois job.  Where all did you interview, how many times?  Did you ever wonder at what point were you ever going to get a shot?</p>
<p>	Q.  There's been some things written about the pivotal moment in Luther's career at Illinois where he comes to you, offers to resign.  Can you describe about what the dialogue between you and him was like and why your position was that you did not want to accept his resignation? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've been lucky enough to have the same starting five for quite a while. </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there something more to it than that with these guys, their relationship with each other?  Is there anything special that you notice about them and how they interact with one another that helps? </p>
<p>	Q.  You actually came to UWM as a baseball player.  Can you recount that?  Could you at that point see yourself being where you are now? </p>
<p>	Q.  I seem to remember the Sweet-16 team at Southern Illinois, you had some sort of a pre-season deal about getting that far.  Could you talk about that.  Seems like you have a lot of motivational stuff, the T-shirts, can you talk about why you do those kind of things? </p>
<p>	Q.  Would you go so far as to call Sean May a classic center, a throwback center?  Can you analyze his game from the standpoint of a coach who has to defend him and the basketball fan in you watching him play? </p>
<p>	Q.  You may never have another season like this again.  How much of a sense of immediacy do you have to win this now, considering what you're going to lose? </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm curious about all the papers you brought in today.  Is that the scouting report? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much credit does Bill Self deserve? </p>
<p>	Q.  A lot has been said about you haven't won in a hundred years.  Do the kids take that pressure on them or do they ignore that? </p>
<p>	Q.  This is sort of being old school, new school, you guys playing old school, them playing new school.  Which team would you prefer to coach? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've heard all the questions about their talent.  You just alluded to their talent.  Do you think some of your players' talent has gotten overlooked? </p>
<p>	Q.  It's been said really that North Carolina, maybe they have the largest margin for error in any game.  Perhaps that's because of the number of possessions they have in a game.  But your team is more efficient per possession.  Given that, is that something you concern yourself with in this game, limiting possessions so their margin of error is not as high as it would normally be? </p>
<p>	Q.  Athletes, a guy like Michael Jordan, can create insults out of things real or imagined because they want something to motivate them.  Are we helping you out with all these questions to them about the talented North Carolina against you guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned the game in Greensboro, how it turned basically into a scrimmage.  Did you take anything at all out of that game?  Before that game was played, can you remember what you were thinking, what you told your guys about going down there to play? </p>
<p>	Q.  Your counterpart has been known to cry from time to time.  Can you remember a time the game of basketball brought you to tears?</p>
<p>	Q.  It's been about a month now.  How do you feel in retrospect about the Ohio State game?  Have you thought about it?  Now that you've gotten this close, do you think about it even more a bit?</p>
<p>	Q.  If you look at the tournament, the only game where North Carolina didn't score the ball very well, was their Sweet-16 game against Villanova, a team similar to yours.  Have you looked at that film?  Is there anything you can pick out of that?</p>
<p>	Q.  What was the dynamic at work when you were trying to instill your coaching philosophy?  Did you fear losing them at any point? </p>
<p>	Q.  I remember last year, it was a Purdue game or the Northwestern game, I got a letter from a reader who said, we got to get rid of this guy now.  We have to cut our losses. </p>
<p>	Q.  You know where I'm coming from.  Now you are like the Man of the Year.  You can't do anything wrong.  Do you remember the crapola you got in the past?  Do you look at it as that's what fans do?</p>
<p>	Q.  You could say that the two teams with the pure point guards won last night. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coaches understand the value of a point guard.  Why is it so hard to first recruit and find them, also then to develop them? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the mental toughness of this team, starting with the Wisconsin game. </p>
<p>	Q.  What do you make of both teams having junior, seniors, being led by those guys?  What does it say about the two programs and the direction of college basketball? </p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously this is a match-up that everyone wants to see.  Without having played the game yet, on paper, where do you think this match-up ranks all time? </p>
<p>	Q.  A lot has been mentioned about your place in history.  You're being mentioned with teams like Duke.  If you win tomorrow night, where do you feel you belong in history?  If you don't win, what's the fine line there with that? </p>
<p>	Q.  We seem to be in an era where sharing is so prominent, the Patriots, Pistons, Red Sox.  Do those stories serve as any inspiration for your guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  It seems like we've gotten away from the fact one guy may be averaging 25, leading a team.  Can you talk about the fact that in college basketball, these days, you pretty much have to have maybe three, four, five guys that can score the ball? </p>
<p>	Q.  Deron Williams might only come out for a couple possessions.  What is your fear that can happen if he isn't on the court?</p>
