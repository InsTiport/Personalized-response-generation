<p>	Q.  Luther, I believe you guys attempted 19 three-pointers in the first half.  I was curious if that was because of an inability to get the ball inside or was that the plan, just to try to shoot over that zone? </p>
<p>	Q.  Roger, can you talk about your dunk off your own missed three-pointer, and also just how you seem to really get into the flow of every offensive possession in the second half. </p>
<p>	Q.  Luther, coach touched on it, but what was the deal with you guys being able to shut down Garcia and, Dean, what were you doing specifically to control them? </p>
<p>	Q.  James, it appeared there was an emphasis to go inside early the first half. </p>
<p>	Q.  The fact that you guys pretty much saw that 2-3 zone early in the second half when they threw it at you pretty much sealed the game, let you guys go on from there?  The fact that you guys saw that two-three zone in the second half, did that lead to your run middle in the second half that led you guys to propel you on to victory? </p>
<p>	Q.  Roger, what was it like for you sitting on the bench because of the foul trouble in the first half?  What was going through your mind?  You said you prayed at halftime.  What specifically did you pray about? </p>
<p>	Q.  Roger or Luther, coach talked yesterday about how he told you guys to smell the roses and enjoy this.  You guys have spoken the last few weeks about the tension of winning every time.  You played real loose tonight from our view.  Have you just come together right?  Why not more tension this game? </p>
<p>	Q.  James, we know that Luther and Roger are the two seniors who start on the team.  Can you tell us if you saw in the second half moments where they were being leaders and what they looked like? </p>
<p>	Q.  You tied a record today for victories in a season.  You're in the final for the first time in Illinois history.  The thoughts that are going through your mind. </p>
<p>	Q.  Luther, had you ever seen Roger go off on a scoring streak like he did in the second half?  Particularly when he missed the three and dunked it, was that kind of a sign that this was going to be your day maybe? </p>
<p>	Q.  Roger, in the last few seconds of the game, you were standing there, both of your arms in the air, pointing to the sky.  What did that mean?  What were you thinking there? </p>

<p>	Q.  Coach Weber, how does Deron so consistently shut down players that have a size advantage over him like Francisco?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have any rules as far as who can take the threes and in what situations? </p>
<p>	Q.  Going back to the point about Deron playing defense on the other team's best player, are there risks involved when you put a guy who is so important to you offensively, do you worry about his offensive efficiency taking up that energy?</p>
<p>	Q.  You said you would be happy if you guys came here and just kind of played a vintage game like you had played.  Was this it?  Did you feel that?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know first Final Four is very special.  Did you allow yourself to think about that, were your nerves any different?  Is it just like another game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Deron plays great defense, dishes nine assists.  Wasn't concerned about trying to force baskets or anything.  Can you talk about that mindset and how valuable it is to have a guy who is truly willing to just win and not really care about his numbers? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about how you stuck with Luther Head last year when he had his problems and what he's blossomed into this year. </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the offensive explosion of Luther Head and Roger Powell in the second half. </p>
