<p>	Q.  John, as a Houston guy, talk about the source of pride having so many Houston kids in this thing.  Is it the kind of talent that you knew something like this could happen? </p>
<p>	Q.  John, for those of us who didn't cover Baylor last year, is it true you were benched briefly?  Can you tell us about that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Most of your top players started their college career somewhere else.  Could you both address why Oklahoma State has become such a good destination for players looking for another place to play? </p>

<p>	Q.  Could you give us a little handicap, what you've seen of the Georgia Tech team, what kind of threats Georgia Tech poses to you? </p>

<p>	Q.  How much confidence does it give you to have Coach Sutton on the sidelines?  He's the guy that took a team to the Final Four before either one of you were born, brought another, as well.  How does that play out to have him on the bench?</p>

<p>	Q.  Extra excitement in a sense because not only is this your first Final Four, but so many Houston guys, almost a homecoming of sorts. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Sutton talked about '95 when he was in the Final Four, maybe gave too much leeway, guys had too good of a time, just happy to be there.  Can you talk about the cell phones being turned off, talk about are you guys being let out of your rooms a bit? </p>
<p>	Q.  John, have you seen a lot of tapes of your father when he used to play?  If so, does he remind you of the way you play?  Has he talked to you much about the experience?</p>
<p>	Q.  A lot has been talked about the fact that Eddie is 68, this maybe his last shot at this.  Has that been talked about among the players or with him? </p>
<p>	Q.  John, one of the last memories of this tournament is you going into the stands to find your dad after the game.  What did it mean, what did you say to him at that point? </p>
<p>	Q.  Funny you both are up there because you played the biggest role in the final play of the game against Saint Joseph's.  If you could go over that.  Joey said that wasn't a play that was set up for anybody.  What was your recollection on that play? </p>


<p>	Q.  As two guys who came after this happened, can you talk about what impact the crash has on the consciousness of this team now with most of you not having been here when it happened? </p>

<p>	Q.  Joey, Georgia Tech, right or wrong, is considered No. 4 in this four-team tournament, the underdog.  Do you guys not give them respect of winning that game?  How do you approach the fact they're the "No. 4 team"? </p>
<p>	Q.  It seems like watching the games, sometimes Coach Sutton will be doing most of the play calling, making decisions, then sometimes Sean Sutton will get up.  Do they divide that up during the game, somebody handles defense, somebody offense?  I know Sean has been called a great offensive mind in the game. </p>


<p>	Q.  You've been recruiting Texas for a lot of years.  With the four Houston kids here, is that sort of indication that the talent level is better in this state than it used to be or just more publicized now? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel like you've changed since the crash in Colorado?  Do you think you've changed as a coach, a person?  You worked with Gene Keady closely for a couple years at Arkansas.  Do you have any strong feelings regarding what he's going through right now at Purdue? </p>
<p>	Q.  John Lucas has probably gone through more good and bad in 20 years than a lot of us in our whole life.  How would you characterize his personality and his maturity level? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talking about Joey Graham, kind of the role he's played on the team this year, I know at one point, I think I remember hearing in the game against Saint Joseph's you leaned over and said, "If you don't turn this around, we're not going to win this game."  He's been his best in the big games, but sometimes fades in the background sometimes.  Does that tell you about the kind of guy he is? </p>
<p>	Q.  You have forehand knowledge of Phog Allen, Mr. Iba, Wilt Chamberlain.  You had the glory and horror at Kentucky.  You've had tragedy with the plane crash.  What does this weekend mean when you line it up against all that? </p>
<p>	Q.  I wanted to ask your view of this proposal the NCAA is going to vote on later this week about the so-called incentives and disincentives.  First your general feeling about the fairness or wisdom of penalizing programs for not hitting a certain graduation rate through scholarships, maybe not even playing in the tournament, and then if they ask you what is a minimally acceptable graduation rate, to pick a number, in today's game, what is a reasonable number in your mind for those penalties to kick in? </p>
<p>	Q.  What was it like playing for Henry Iba?  Did that affect your decision to make coaching your life, your career? </p>
