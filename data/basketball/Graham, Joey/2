<p>	Q.  John and Joey, would both of you kind of amplify on Coach Sutton's comment as to how important this was for your guys confidence going into the NCAA tournament to win a game like this?</p>

<p>	Q.  Joey, talk about your ability to get the free throw; was that focus?</p>


<p>	Q.  You had a lot of fans here tonight.  Obviously Kansas 20 miles away is going to have their share.  Oklahoma State had a lot as well.  With Oklahoma losing, you guys winning, going to Oklahoma City, how big a deal would that be for you guys to have that many fans here?</p>



<p>	Q.  Do these games get any easier the more you play?  Were you any more relaxed than you were two years ago at Lawrence?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you guys feel you have outlasted Kansas and Oklahoma; do you deserve that spot in Oklahoma City? </p>

<p>	Q.  Talk about what you guys were you looking for, anything special on that last shot? </p>


<p>	Q.  Last night similar situation up three.  Last second you chose to foul Colorado; did you think about doing it again today?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about how much better Joey is when he gets to the free-throw line and is aggressive like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  How different is Kansas without Langford?</p>
<p>	Q.  Joey gets three fouls there in the first 16, 17 minutes how big was that, he didn't get the fourth?</p>
<p>	Q.  Seemed like Joey, seemed like sometimes you went through him more today; was that something you tried to do?</p>
