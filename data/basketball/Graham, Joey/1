<p>	Q.  Joey, three straight games you guys played down to the last shot, up three, other team can tie, you hadn't played a lot of tight games all year.  Can this kind of situation help you prepare you for the NCAA?</p>
<p>	Q.  Joey, you're named tournament M.V.P. Have you ever had a game though where you had seven turnovers and got a reward for it?</p>


<p>	Q.  This building has seen a lot of big basketball games.  This is probably the last Big 12 tournament game in this building.  Is there any sort of a special feeling that you will take from winning that last game here?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the doubt of course you went through in the second half coming out of that.  That speaks well for you guys persevering and coming through?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you guys feel that the game, when you were up 10, 51-41, seemed to be a moment where you didn't score, they didn't score, if you could have gotten a 3 you could have pushed them over and instead they went on a big run?</p>
<p>	Q.  As many times as you told the players you thought the shots were going to fall were you starting to doubt?  That's 10 --</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Knight said his team, even though they made it to the Final, would have benefited more by resting.  How much does winning the tournament benefit you guys going into the NCAA's?</p>
<p>	Q.  Noting your concerns coming in and the way your guys have played these last few days you are going to get some rest.  In general how do you feel about this team now as the big tournament approaches?</p>
<p>	Q.  John, after you missed that first free throw how much of a weight off you was to hit that second one?</p>

<p>	Q.  Eddie, can you expand on of course playing Oklahoma City would be a great thing, you have done well of course back east, and perhaps maybe two Big 12 teams should get to go to Oklahoma City - your thoughts just overall?</p>
<p>	Q.  Joey, between you and Oklahoma State, Oklahoma and Kansas, any one of you proved who the better team is in the Big 12? </p>
