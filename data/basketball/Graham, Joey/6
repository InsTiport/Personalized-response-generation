<p>	Q.  John, just talk about the two different halves and you really looked frustrated in the first half, especially  -- were you guys having problems figuring out where you were supposed to throw the ball in the press? </p>

<p>	Q.  John, tell us about the last shot, how it kind of broke down with Joey there and what happened, who was guarding who and give us your recollections on that.  And, when you get done with that, you've hit a lot of clutch shots, last-second buzzer beaters, go-ahead shots this has to be the biggest ever?</p>
<p>	Q.  For any of the players, what was your reaction when you saw Jameer go up with that last shot? </p>


<p>	Q.  Tony, why did you think he was going to miss? </p>

<p>	Q.  After you guys had your initial celebration after the game, a few guys went over to Jameer Nelson when he was down on the court; what did you say to him and why did you go over there so quickly? </p>


<p>	Q.  John, after the game, you went up into the stands to find your dad, can you tell us about that moment and what you guys said to each other? </p>
<p>	Q.  Saint Joseph's seemed to have the country's imagination being undefeated so on and so forth, what is it about Oklahoma State that's so special that people will want to get on your bandwagon now? </p>
<p>	Q.  John and Tony, you both have high school teammates going to the final hour, and how long will it be till you guys talk to your respective teammates and are you looking forward to seeing them in San Antonio? </p>

<p>	Q.  John, the end of the first half you threw up an air ball with about 30 seconds to go and they called a time-out, you walk to the bench, you were away from the huddle, one of the coaches had to come over to you, what's going through your head at that point? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you're on the sideline.  </p>
<p>	Q.  Why did you decide to put Bobik on Nelson instead a lot of us?</p>
<p>	Q.  This building has been pretty good to you even though there was a nine-year span between Sweet  16s.  Could you reflect on that and seeing the big man sitting behind you on the bench and the former players that you had at that time?  Could you reflect on that for a little bit, if you would? </p>
<p>	Q.  It's interesting that yesterday Tony Allen said, "it's about making buckets," and that's what it came down to.  First half, you guys were not shooting well at all, what happened to get them to come out the second half and stroke it as well as it did? </p>
<p>	Q.  I think I know your answer to this question already, I think I've asked it a time or two this season, but you're 68 years old, you're in, what, third Final Four, second at Oklahoma State, what are your emotions right now, holding your grandson out there what were your emotions? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said yesterday that, you know, winning the National Championship isn't the thing that really eats at you or defines you.  But this is your third time; a lot of coaches go a whole career and never get there once.  Does this mean anything more to you, is it any special or any more sense of urgency? </p>
