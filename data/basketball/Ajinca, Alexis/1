		  (No. 20 Overall Selection, Charlotte Bobcats)

 Q. If you could make some comments about getting drafted and also describe your style of play. 
 ALEXIS AJINCA: I'm so happy because before the draft, I was so nervous, and now I feel much better. Because before the draft, I talked to my agent and I said, "Well, I want to play for Bobcats," and said that's what I want, so do it. 
 I can shoot, run, jump, maybe that's a new generation for big guys; nobody is big like me, so that's good. 

 Q. How familiar are you with Charlotte, both the city and the actual team; do you know a lot about Bobcats and the city that they play in? 
 ALEXIS AJINCA: Yeah, I've seen the city because I had a workout there and I saw the staff and I think that I have a good feeling with the new coach, Larry Brown. I think it's a good challenge for me. 

 Q. Did Coach Brown talk to you a lot before you went down there for the workout?
 ALEXIS AJINCA: Yeah, for the workout, he teach me like a song, like if I'm playing just before the draft.

 Q. Where do you see yourself fitting in with the other big men that already play in Charlotte? How do you see yourself fitting in with the team? 
 ALEXIS AJINCA: I think on this ballclub there is a lot of big guys because I play against some of them, and everybody wanted to play for Bobcats because they got a 9 before the 20. Everybody wanted to show their skills, and if you can jump and run, like everybody. 

 Q. How familiar are you with other players from France? Do you know Tony Parker well? Have the guys that made the jump from France to the League given you any help? Have they spoken to you at all about making the jump to the NBA?
 ALEXIS AJINCA: Yeah, I saw Didier Mbenga in L.A.; he's not a French player but he is from Congo and speaks French and he gave me some lessons for playing, and the French players, they are just behind me.
