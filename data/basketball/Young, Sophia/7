<p>	Q.  Chameka, y'all were probably both, Michigan State and y'all, considered underdogs coming in.  Who is the underdog now? </p>

<p>	Q.  Stephanie, I know you have seen some strong front courts in Big 12 play and other parts of this tournament; how does their inside tandem of Roehrig and Shimek compare to what you played against? </p>
<p>	Q.  Chelsea and Chameka, even last night after the national semi-finals you guys had that even demeanor to you as you have during the whole tournament and during the whole season.  Before the season started did you guys expect to be here tonight on the eve of the national championship? </p>

<p>	Q.  Stephanie, when you were being recruited, Baylor was in the middle of a 20-loss season.  Can you talk about what Coach said, what she said to you to convince you to come to the program and from that point could you have believed that you would get to this point four years later? </p>
<p>	Q.  Sophia, could you talk a little bit about your basketball background, just how long you've been playing, maybe what you consider your strengths and weaknesses and how much maybe further you think you can go. </p>

<p>	Q.  Maybe the seniors could address this.  When the season began people were picking Texas and K State to win the Big 12 and Kendra Webber and Tiffanie Jackson as Player of the Year.  When did you guys sense or really feel like this was a national championship caliber team?  Has it been just recently during this 19-game win streak or was it early on something you believed and it's sort of developed. </p>
<p>	Q.  Chelsea, this is for you.  You said at each one of the regionals you just really can't believe that you're here.  This is like a dream.  It really hasn't hit you.  Is it pretty much the same now that you're on the eve of the national championship game. </p>
<p>	Q.  For all the ladies, if you had one word to describe your coach, what would it be? </p>






<p>	Q.  For Abby.  Wednesday morning the season is over.  You guys are almost -- you have that demeanor again, that you want to continue playing?  Do you want to go on even after tomorrow night? </p>

<p>	Q.  Chelsea, what do you guys do with that intensity that Coach brings?  How much does that drive you? </p>


<p>	Q.  Who do you feel wears the destiny tag better tomorrow night, yourself or Michigan State? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you -- I know you probably told this story a hundred times but retell the story about how you discovered Sophia.  Was she a junior or senior in high school when you first saw her and what were your first impressions? </p>
<p>	Q.  What was it about her?</p>
<p>	Q.  A little bit off the game, but looking to the future, how do you feel about the three-point line and the talks of moving that, what have you, particularly in regards to international play, which you have some history with and it seems like all of this is directed towards that as opposed to the college game. </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk specifically about Abby's story, about how you got her and then how you have sort of put this team together from some unusual roots?</p>
<p>	Q.  It was easy to see last night when a question came up about Baylor's background that you were just tired of the question, you didn't want to hear it.  What is it about these questions that bother you right now? </p>
<p>	Q.  Does not what's happening now feel good for you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Everybody's saying that since there are two new teams in here this is a sign of parity.  But what is the parity formula?  How much of it is talent getting spread around and if talent is getting spread around how much of it is the fact that y'all have become better pitchmen and salesmen and is there some other ingredient in there that's helping talent get more spread out? </p>
<p>	Q.  With the WNBA more and more part of the equation now of basketball, what do you think Sophia's time in the tournament has done for her stock there?</p>
<p>	Q.  You and Joanne both are mother's with two young kids, son and a daughter, you both took over your programs in 2000.  This seems like a lot of similarities.  I wonder how well do you know her and if you could sort of talk about maybe the similarities between the two of you. </p>
<p>	Q.  What's your routine today and how close are you able to keep it to any other day before a game this season?</p>
<p>	Q.  Speaking of watching film, how late were you up last night or this morning watching film? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you get a chance to watch the second half of the Michigan State game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you see it on film yet?</p>
<p>	Q.  What was your reaction to their comeback? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've had a few other things on your plate the past month but has anyone in your world been talking about the new Title 9 policy that's come out from the education department?</p>
<p>	Q.  The other day you talked a little bit about coming over from Louisiana Tech to Baylor as far as Leon starting that.  Can you talk about the role that Sonja Hogg played over at Baylor, because that was the other piece?</p>
<p>	Q.  Speaking of recruiting, you didn't have a lot to sell when you first got there, the last two years, should it be easier now for you to recruit? </p>
<p>	Q.  It seems like second best has never been good for you in anything; where does that fire and passion come from? </p>
<p>	Q.  If a program decides it wants to get serious about being competitive in women's basketball, what advice would you give it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Your players use the word "intensity," and I've heard you talk about your team playing with emotion and you coach with emotion, is that something that you teach when they get to Baylor or is it the kind of players you recruit or what combination?</p>
<p>	Q.  A sort of recruiting question to dovetail the last question.  There's apparently legislation in the pipeline that would potentially restrict the contact that college coaches can have with high school athletes during the high school year; do you have any reaction to that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Considering these teams had participated in two of the three greatest comebacks in a Final Four game from deficits, we may not have a winner until Thursday.  In your mind what has to happen tomorrow night for Baylor to be successful?</p>
<p>	Q.  How about defensively? </p>
<p>	Q.  What is your biggest concern about Michigan State?</p>
<p>	Q.  Emily had struggled in the post-season, even starting with the Big 12 tournament, particularly from the three-point line and I know your strategy has been just keep shooting it, but was there any strategy involved in moving her inside more last night?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about Emily and just kind of relishing that sixth person role.  She started some last year, but she seems to really like to come off and give you a boost?</p>
<p>	Q.  Both you and Michigan State showed yesterday that teams without Final Four experience can come back from deficits and beat teams more experienced and all that; what is the biggest reason that a team can succeed in spite of not having that experience that people love to talk about? </p>
<p>	Q.  As a player you've won championships, been to the Olympics, had parades thrown for you; how does this compare personally for you to this? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Kelli Roehrig on their team, just kind of problems she will present inside. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you see a lot of yourself in Joanne in terms of where you have come taking programs that have gone nowhere, five years in the Final Four the first time, you both are a little animated on the sidelines to be, you know, charitable?</p>
<p>	Q.  The national champions recently have been kind of built around one sort of superstar Player of the Year type of player.  Are these two teams here kind of an example of team over that one sort of star or does Sophia kind of fit into that sort of role? </p>
