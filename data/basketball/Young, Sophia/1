		   THE MODERATOR: Questions. 

 Q. Can you talk about your excitement level for the WNBA All-Star weekend. 
 SOPHIA YOUNG: It's going to be exciting. Can't you see the excitement in my face? 
 I think just being out here in Connecticut again the second year in a row is exciting. It shows how much committed Connecticut fans are with the WNBA. Just being here again in the All-Star Game, it's an honor. 

 Q. What is it like for you guys going up against USA Basketball? 
 SOPHIA YOUNG: I think it's going to be not like a regular All-Star Game. It's going to be tough. I think it's going to be actually a real game instead of like an All-Star Game. 
 We got to be ready to come out and compete against them. There's people on the team trying to make the USA team. So we have to play consistently. 

 Q. Are there specific parts of the weekend that you enjoy more than anything else? 
 SOPHIA YOUNG: Not necessarily. I think the whole weekend is what makes up the All-Star. But I'm looking forward to the game tomorrow. 

 Q. The Western Conference playoff race in the second half of the season, what can we expect? 
 SOPHIA YOUNG: Well, I think we can expect much more good basketball from all the teams. The West has been struggling compared to the East.
