Q.   Do you feel in your team meeting today that people have kind of moved on as a group? 
GEORGE HILL:   Yeah, I think.   Everybody's hopes are high.   I think everybody's demeanor is high, and the thought process is high. 
I'm sure everyone has gotten over it, knowing that we can't do anything about it.   I think everyone is focused and have a great belief that we can come out with Game 2. 

Q.   Did film open some eyes for you guys about what you can do better, missed opportunities that can be corrected? 
GEORGE HILL:   Definitely so.   I think that's the part of film you try to focus on being better on. 
We've seen a lot of things where they kind of exploited us and got us‑‑ turnovers and things like that.   So hopefully tomorrow is better. 

Q.   Do you feel like (Indiscernible) how do you (Indiscernible)?
GEORGE HILL:   I don't know, I feel like that's a set‑up question so the media can run with it and say I said this.   I don't know.   Next.   We're one of the top two teams in the East right now.   Is that a fair assessment? 

Q.   Are you feeling okay.   It looked like at one point you ran into Tyler and got banged up a little bit. 
GEORGE HILL:   I'll be all right.   Just another bump in the road. 

Q.   Not unusual this time of the year? 
GEORGE HILL:   Not unusual.   It happens to the best of us.   I just try to put it behind me and keep moving.
