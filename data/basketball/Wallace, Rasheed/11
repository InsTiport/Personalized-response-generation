<p>	Q. Generally you guys have done a good job against big men:  Shaquille, Tim Duncan, other players in the past, and last night, not so much.  How do you generally go about it and what do you have to do better? </p>
<p>	Q.  On behalf of the media, I'd like to thank you for the juicy quotes you continue to give us, even though it costs you a lot of money sometimes.  Will you always be this outspoken or will we see a more mellow Rasheed sometime?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chauncey after the game last night said that they tried to force-feed you the ball when you're aggressive early.  Why does that sometimes break down like it did last night when it went away from you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Was Larry trying to have the guards get you the ball more? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you explain what Chauncey Billups has meant to the team?</p>
<p>	Q.  After the quick start for yourself last night, was it something they did that slowed things down or was it more what you guys didn't do or how did that --</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys have been in the situation before, you've come back, you've done this over and over again, there's no desperate feelings in locker room after what happened last night in the fourth quarter there?</p>
<p>	Q.  Even though you lose a game like you lost last night, do you totally completely erase that or do you remember it when you go into Game 2 or motivation?</p>
<p>	Q.  I had heard that maybe you were a little bit disappointed you didn't get more touches in the second half.  Is that true and do you expect to be more of a factor in the second game?</p>
<p>	Q.  And last, what can you say about Manu Ginobli?  What kind of player? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've gone against Robert Horry a lot in the West, what makes him a good defender? </p>
<p>	Q.  We all know the stat, I think it's 8-0 or whatever when you score 20 or more in the playoffs, is it simplifying things too much to say that if you go, this team also will go?</p>
