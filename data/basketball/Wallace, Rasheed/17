<p>	Q. Rasheed, how long did you allow yourself to think about last night's game?</p>




<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Ben playing Shaq one-up like he does, and I guess the physical pounding he takes but sticks with him anyway?</p>




<p>	Q.  How about the pressure are they facing to win the next game and avoid 2-0? </p>
<p>	Q.  How do you guys keep up the sense of urgency up 1-0? </p>
<p>	Q.  You want to be greedy now, right, you want to get the second one and go home?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about what it is that you bring to the Pistons' offense. </p>


<p>	Q.  So you just fill in the gaps and do what's needed?</p>
