<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the effect it's had on you, just changing cities, changing teams?  A lot of people talk about players can use a change of venue as a fresh start, and just are you surprised at the open arms you've been welcomed with by your teammates, as well as the fans of Detroit? </p>
<p>	Q.  How has it helped you as a player, your perspective about the burdens of the way things had happened in Portland had started to weigh you down a little bit, did you feel like some weight was removed from you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Earlier today one of the Lakers, Gary Payton, did not come to the podium and he's probably going to get fined.  What's your feeling, is it too much to ask of the players in these situations?  Is it fair, what's your whole  -- as far as dealing with the media in Finals situations and situations like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think too much is asked of you guys during these playoff situations to meet the media every day?  Do you think it's fair? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about how the depth and defense that you guys have that gives you confidence in this series, because you're not a team that relies on one or two guys or your jumpshots to fall?  What does this do for your confidence?</p>
<p>	Q.  How about the defense? </p>
<p>	Q.  If you win a championship here or come real close how tough is it going to be for you to leave, especially the way Detroit has embraced you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does making it to The Finals change your thinking at all in the last couple of weeks? </p>
<p>	Q.  Larry Brown said earlier today, he complimented you on how last night, a lot of superstars would not have been able to stay on the bench for as long as you did and stay in the game and come back in and contribute as you did.  Was that a maturation process for you from earlier in your career is that something you've grown into becoming?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think those attitudes are important to winning teams?</p>
<p>	Q.  Karl Malone and maybe some of the other Lakers seem more inclined to talk about they missed shots and what they were not doing last night, as opposed to your guys' defense.  Is that a surprise or confusing or disappointing to you at all? </p>
