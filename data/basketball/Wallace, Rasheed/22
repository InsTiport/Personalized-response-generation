<p>	Q.  How good was Tayshaun's defense on Kobe tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  This has to be a satisfying win for two reasons for you:  You are booed by the L.A. fans, remember your Portland days, and then everybody seems to write you guys off before the first game, so what was the atmosphere in the locker room and it must be an enormous amount of satisfaction on the team's part? </p>
<p>	Q.  How did it feel to sit so long in the first half, and did you feel you were getting taken out of the game a little bit and how come you were so active today on offense as usually you are so much more passive?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was this the game plan or just the way it turned out?</p>
<p>	Q.  In pregame, one, it looked like you were having a good time and joying yourself and then you got in the game and put yourself in the zone, the first game of the Finals, Lakers' home floor, how do you put yourself in that zone? </p>
<p>	Q.  You opened up both halves with 3s, your perimeter game seemed better physically.  Do you feel good?  No lingering effects?</p>
<p>	Q.  You played against Karl Malone a lot in the Western Conference.  Have you ever seen him not making the shots like he did tonight, and is it something you're predicting for the rest of the series?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was it your defense?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the performance of Chauncey Billups.</p>
<p>	Q.  How important is it to be aggressive in the Finals against a team like the Lakers? </p>
<p>	Q.  Winning Game  1 in such convincing fashion, how do you guys make sure the emotions do not get the better of you going into Game  2?  Shaq said it's a must-win in Game  2 for the Lakers, how do you guys address that issue? </p>
