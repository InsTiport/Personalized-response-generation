<p>	Q. Do you feel like there's anything you need to do differently either on Shaquille because he kept getting you guys in foul trouble?</p>
<p>	Q.  Any guarantees for Game 4?</p>
<p>	Q.  What was your confidence level at Game 1?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chauncey said that the frustration wasn't caused by what the Heat was doing; there were other factors that led to the frustration. </p>
<p>	Q.  The fact that you guys were down 2-1 in the last series, down 3-2 to Jersey, how much is that kind of a confidence boost that you know you've been in these situations before?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about taking Game 4 from this team. </p>
<p>	Q.  You had pretty good success kind of baiting Shaquille to take the ball off the dribble, you got him into some walking situations where he was kind of fumbling.  Are you playing on balance a little bit there and getting him to lean one way?</p>
<p>	Q.  Why do you think you guys are survivors?</p>
