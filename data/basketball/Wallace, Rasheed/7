 Q.  How do you feel? 
 RASHEED WALLACE:  I'm all right. 
 Q.  What didn't go well for you last night? 
 RASHEED WALLACE:  Executing.  We didn't execute down the stretch.  They didn't even really bring Shaq in in the fourth quarter, they just executed better than we did. 
 Q.  Any predictions for Game 2? 
 RASHEED WALLACE:  It's going to be a good game.  We're going to go out there and do our thing. 
 Q.  Antonio said you seem to play your best when you get angry.  Do you feel that way, and what do you do to get angry? 
 RASHEED WALLACE:  Just play.  That's what they say.  We I just play. 
 Q.  You don't agree with them? 
 RASHEED WALLACE:  I don't know.  I can't really call that. 
 Q.  Chauncey is struggling a little bit, and a point guard is a big part of getting everybody else involved.  How important is it for you to get it going? 
 RASHEED WALLACE:  He will.  He missed a couple shots, we all did.  But I'm not worried about him having a bad streak or nothing like that because he's too good of a shooter.  When we're in practice he's out there working on his game.  I know he ain't going to be missing them for long.  I know that. 
 Q.  What's the best way to explain why you guys play best when you're behind or if you're going to lose or there's pressure? 
 RASHEED WALLACE:  I have no idea.  I guess it's the dog in us, just to go out there and do it.  A lot of people are against us, so we just try to go out there and do it. 
 Q.  How important is it for you to get off early? 
 RASHEED WALLACE:  I mean, it's important for any of us to get off early, no matter if it's myself, Lindsey, Rip, Tayshaun, Chauncey, somebody just to get it going. 
 Q.  In the second half at the start of the third quarter it looked like the intention was for to get you in the offensive mode? 
 RASHEED WALLACE:  That's probably a question for Flip.  I just go out there and play. 
 Q.  What percentage is your ankle at health-wise? 
 RASHEED WALLACE:  I'd say about 75, 80 percent. 
 Q.  How do you think it limits your offense? 
 RASHEED WALLACE:  I mean, it does and it doesn't.  I'm not going to speculate, but it does and it doesn't. 
 Q.  How is the frustration level after last night? 
 RASHEED WALLACE:  Frustrated.  Losing that first game was frustrating.  I still am a little bit.  But they played a good game. 
 Q.  Some of the shots were short -- (Inaudible). 
 RASHEED WALLACE:  Maybe, maybe.  We slowed it down a lot, and they were ready to rip and run, but we slowed it down a lot, and that made the difference in the game.  Diving for the loose balls, jumping out of bounds, they did the little things. 
 Q.  It seemed like in the Cavaliers series you guys haven't been doing what you normally do on offense.  What bringing you down? 
 RASHEED WALLACE:  I don't know, man.  I don't know.  We're just playing.  We're not worried about it, we're not going to stay in a funk forever.  We're just going to go out there and do it. 
 Q.  Rip said you guys need to get back to having fun and not consider it as much of a grind. 
 RASHEED WALLACE:  We're not having as much fun, but we're still having fun out there.  Even though we lost last night, it's still fun to be in a game that competitive, the Eastern Conference Finals, it's still fun to be competitive. 
 Q.  Can you remember the last time you guys had a day off? 
 RASHEED WALLACE:  A while ago (laughter).
