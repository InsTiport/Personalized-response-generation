<p>	Q. You were being more aggressive tonight.  Was that the game plan or was that just a function of the way you played?</p>
<p>	Q.  What is it about what you guys do to Dwyane Wade that frustrates him so much?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the added dimension you've had out of Ben Wallace's offense these last few games?</p>
<p>	Q.  When they cut it to 1 with four minutes left roughly, what was the mindset because it was difficult to shut down toward the end?</p>
<p>	Q.  How could you sense in Wade that he was frustrated on the court?  What could you see in the way he was playing?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you comment on what you saw from Shaq tonight.  I think he only took three shots in the fourth quarter, made one.  Did he seem like he was at full strength or close?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think that you guys have gotten the respect that a defending champion deserves this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know Miami came in winning eight straight with their first two series.  I don't think they took you lightly, but do you think they will start to take you a little bit more seriously now that they have tasted it?</p>
