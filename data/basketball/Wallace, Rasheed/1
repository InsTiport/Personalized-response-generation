 Q. Do you think to yourself, this may be the last time I get to this point?
 RASHEED WALLACE: Everyone has to take advantage of it, no matter if you're a young guy or a veteran. You don't know what the Most High has planned for you. To come out here, and if you lose the championship, you think, okay, I'll get back to it again next year. But if something happens and you're not able to play basketball again or something unfortunate happens like that, you have to take advantage of the situation that's here. 

 Q. Playing with KG after so many years of competing, what do you see in him that maybe you didn't know?
 RASHEED WALLACE: KG, I actually got to know him off the court this year. For so many years, like you just mentioned, going against him with Minnesota when I was in D.C., Portland, Atlanta and Detroit. But KG is a tough competitor. 
 I think the thing that surprised me the most I would say is off the court he's not as fired up. Some people are fired up off the court, also, but off the court -- you see him out here, and he's real -- animaniac as we like to call him sometimes. But off the court he's a laid-back cat, a cool dude.
