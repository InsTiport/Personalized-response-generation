<p>	Q. Rasheed, besides your names, what would you say that you have in common with Ben Wallace and what is your relationship with him in this Detroit Pistons team? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you see your role behind the scenes as sort of the team comic, keeping everybody loose?  It seems like guys are always talking about how you're joking around. </p>
<p>	Q.  Is it a different feeling waking up this morning and coming to the arena today now that you guys have gotten the kind of game under your belts that you know you guys are capable of playing? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you guys feel like you got back to the physical style of defense you play, or do you need to see in the next game to know for sure if you guys are back to what you were? </p>
<p>	Q.  Antonio obviously earlier in his career was a very athletic player and a lot of dunking, how have you seen him change as a player over the years and how much have you seen him embrace his role with you guys that he has coming off the bench? </p>
<p>	Q.  How emotional has this run been for Antonio, The Finals, knowing what he's been through and how much it's taken for him to get to this point?</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys threw Tim off a little bit last night and he's always had a history of coming back strong after off-games, what do you look for from him tomorrow?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just talking to Gar Heard, he was basically saying the way he saw your game as capable of scoring 20 on any given night but not really having the ego of a scorer, do you agree with that or how do you see yourself?  Do you need to be more demanding to be a great scorer? </p>
<p>	Q.  Chauncey was saying that one of the common denominators on this team is that everybody on this team or almost everybody has been kicked to the curb at some point, undrafted guys, guys who have bounced around, and you got a chance to come here and reinvent yourself a little bit.  Do you think that's one of the things that strengthens and unites this team? </p>
