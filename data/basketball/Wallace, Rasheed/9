<p>	Q.  We were talking about where your team gets its resolve and its resiliency to bounce back from series deficits like you've done.</p>
<p>	Q.  After everything you all have been through this year, what would breaking through and getting a second title mean to you and to the team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Why did this move to Detroit fit you so well, and what do you like about the team and the franchise and the city that seems to have suited you so well?</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys have said that you played with a lot more energy and aggressiveness the last two games.  What did Coach Brown do to help bring that out of you guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  Just wondering, the move to here, has it helped you personally?  Do you feel like you've benefitted other than just the obvious hardware, that it's helped you as a person or in your career? </p>
<p>	Q.  Where did you get the idea for the belts and what was that whole procedure like?  Did you have to call a bunch of people to find out where you get stuff like that?  How did that go? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Brown was just in here saying that he was glad he had the opportunity to discuss you with the public, so that people may get to know you at a different level.  Do you care about that kind of stuff? </p>
<p>	Q.  Does it bother you, the perception of you in the public is not a big concern? </p>
