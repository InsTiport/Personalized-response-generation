		   GRANT HILL: I think coming back home, getting ready to play here Sunday in our home gym. Having some days off in between games. 
You know, we get a chance to work on some things and just kind of get back, get our mojo back a little bit. And had some tough games there in LA. And they did a great job. 
And there's some things that we can improve upon. But I think having a little bit of a break and finding some time to practice, tape it up, work on the adjustments as opposed to just talking about the adjustments. Of course, get in the gym, get our crowd behind us, and go out there and lay it all on the line in Game 3.

 Q. What can you do, you talked about it, is there one thing you have to do a little better?
 GRANT HILL: There's a few things we talked about. We don't want to talk about them, necessarily, to the public. 
 But I think some things are obvious. Some things we can improve upon defensively. Some getting back and working on rotations. Really getting back to the basics. Getting back to who we are, what we've done all season. Reinforcing those. Doing them here in practice, doing them again tomorrow and getting ourselves ready to play on Sunday.

 Q. Steve Nash's numbers are down a little bit offensively in the series. What are your thoughts on the first two games?
 GRANT HILL: I haven't really focused on guys' individual performance. It's a team thing. We scored enough points, so scoring is not the problem. 
 But whatever we're doing collectively as a team we've just got to do better. And there's games where certain guys step up and have big numbers, and that's how we just played all season. Guys all contributed and helped the team win. And we're going to do need that and so much more come Sunday.
