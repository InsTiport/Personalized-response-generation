		  THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for Derek first. 

 Q. It seems like a lot of the offense your team generated in the first four wins was along the perimeter. Was it frustrating that you guys couldn't get anything going outside? 
 DEREK GLASSER: Our game plan was to attack off the dribble and use ball screens to get them to rotate and kick back outside. 
 I thought we had a great game plan for the game. I think we executed early and we played with a lot of energy. We just couldn't make that shot that we needed down the stretch. 
 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach? 

 Q. Coach, what was it like playing against Coach Krzyzewski; any flashbacks? You used to play him two or three times a year. 
 COACH HERB SENDEK: I certainly didn't forget any of those games. Our focus was on tonight's game. 

 Q. Herb, that stretch they had when they took control 19-3, how much of that had to do -- did they do anything differently defensively or was it something that you guys just couldn't change? 
 COACH HERB SENDEK: I thought their defensive effort especially in the second half was terrific. Nothing came easy for us. Everything was challenged. And I think the difference in the game was their defensive effort in the second half. 
 THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? 
 COACH HERB SENDEK: Thank you, everybody.
