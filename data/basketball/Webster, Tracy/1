 THE MODERATOR: Coach Webster will make an opening statement.   
 COACH TRACY WEBSTER: Well, the season is over now, but that's all I got. I mean, it was a tough game. We have to give South Florida credit. They did a really good job of attacking the basket, scoring inside the paint. But they got a lead on us early. The guys really tried to battle and fight back. You know, everyone, those guys, our motto is "Never give up. Never quit." These guys did a great job of not giving up.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible) Talk about your defense against USF.  
 COACH TRACY WEBSTER: It was very tough. Very tough. We allowed open points in the paint. We tried to go zone. They scored a lot in the paint not having breakdowns when defending the basketball. They did a good job. We have to give those guys credit. They did a really good job of getting into the paint. It's tough. Especially when nobody is shooting from the outside. We need to continue to learn from it.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible).  
 WILL WALKER: We let Coach Web -- he believed in us. We believed in him. We tried to play in transition, just pick up the pace. We were a little more lackadaisical, so we tried to pick up the tempo. That's what we did. We followed the game plan. It was a good game plan. Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't. That's how it always goes.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible).  
 COACH TRACY WEBSTER: I think so. I think you always learn from every game. I think our guys want to continue to get better. They will continue to get better.   
 You know, I do think they'll continue to learn and make everyone around them learn. There will be some carry-over. And the guys will do a really good job of improving their game.   
 THE MODERATOR: Any more questions? DePaul, thank you.
