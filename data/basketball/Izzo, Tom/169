<p>	Q.  Could you just talk a little bit about North Carolina, particularly about Raymond Felton and the sort of problems he'll present for you. </p>
<p>	Q.  Shannon Brown had a big game against Kentucky.  If you look at his numbers in the four games of the tournament, it looks like he's kind of stepped it up a notch in most areas.  How important is he going to be for what happens? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned your rebounding had been okay.  Have you become a better rebounding team as the season has gone along?  How big a factor do you think that will be in this game with May and Davis playing so well? </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm sure there were some seasons where maybe fans, coaches, players expected to go to the Final Four.  Was this unexpected for your team?</p>
<p>	Q.  The Big-10 took a beating most of the year.  How satisfying is it to you from a conference standpoint what your league has done in this post-season? </p>
<p>	Q.  Was wondering if you would talk about your fast break points, just mentioned, 60 to 16 in your favor in the tournament.  Can you run against North Carolina?  Do you have to be selective when you do it?  Because they lead the country in scoring. </p>
<p>	Q.  You made a reference to the Sweet-16 game.  Do you regard that loss as sort of the beginning of the turning point?  Since then, obviously four Final Fours  in seven years.  Was that a night when you realized you could play, just needed to get over the hump?</p>
<p>	Q.  Speaking of your program's presence in the Final Four, is there such a thing as more pressure once you get there if you're someone as a Roy Williams, who doesn't have a championship?</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously, the games are coming down to pressure-backed, crunch-time situations, probably will continue in the Final Four.  I just wonder, what do you tell the team,  tell the guys to calm them down?  Is there a risk of maybe getting too complicated with a player?  Also, are crunch-time players, are they made or born? </p>
<p>	Q.  You guys have been on both sides of it this year.  How is the mentality different in playing from behind and playing ahead in a pressure game? </p>
<p>	Q.  What is the key,  like in a game situation like when Kentucky is coming from behind or you guys are coming from behind, what's the key to getting your team? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've got ten guys averaging nine minutes or more.  How big of a factor is depth going to be in this game for you guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  Sean May leads the NCAA tournament in scoring.  Do you have to keep the ball out of his hands?  If so, how do you do it?  Is it harder than just saying it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Based on your tournament record, what makes you so good at preparing for a team on short notice?  What are some of the behind-the-scenes things that are going on that allows you to break down an opponent? </p>
<p>	Q.  How difficult is it, conveying that message to the players, to get an 18, 19, 20-year-old kid to soak that in and then go ahead and execute? </p>
<p>	Q.  About your relationship with Roy Williams, if you could talk about how well you know him, if you served on committees or anything like that with him. </p>
<p>	Q.  Everybody is going to be focused on Roy going for his first title.  Pitino is back again.  We heard these incredible stats about you at the beginning, four trips in seven years.  Do you feel overlooked at all?  You talked about a little less pressure at Michigan State than maybe some of these other places. </p>
<p>	Q.  What is your daily or at least several times weekly workout regimen?  How does it help you in a stressful time such as this?</p>
<p>	Q.  How fast and how far do you go? </p>
<p>	Q.  Counting Mike Krzyzewski's American Express commercials, you can make the argument there will be five marquee coaches at the Final Four this year.  What type of recruiting advantage do you think those commercials give? </p>
<p>	Q.  You made a couple of football references.  You come from a football background.  Is there such a thing as a football mentality, and if so, do you apply that to coaching basketball?  Does your team reflect any of that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Haven't talked about Paul Davis yet on this call.  You tell me, he's having a great NCAA tournament. </p>
<p>	Q.  Michigan State obviously is known for its toughness, having tough players.  You look at a guy like Shannon Brown, son of a police officer, Shannon had to kind of defend himself when he was in high school in tough situations, do you look for toughness in a player when you recruit them? </p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of people have been saying after this past weekend all the great games, in some ways it kind of resuscitated the college game.  TV ratings have been going down for the Final Four the last few years.  Would you agree with that?</p>
