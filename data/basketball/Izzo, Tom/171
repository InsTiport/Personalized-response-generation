<p>	Q.  Paul, I am sure you are aware of the job the three guys did inside last night on Bogut.  Could you talk about what you expect from them tomorrow night and how key inside play may be to the picture?</p>
<p>	Q.  Interested in the concept of buying into the idea of diminished minutes and the superstar mentality might be that you want to play 35 minutes per game.  What does it take to accept the role that you are not going to get out there that much?</p>

<p>	Q.  Wondering what any of you guys remember about last year's game with Kentucky and how important you think pace will be and whether you think you can outrun Kentucky?</p>
<p>	Q.  Paul, how many times in the past have you thought you got -- why hasn't it gotten together lately for us?</p>
<p>	Q.  Kelvin, Coach touched on this last night.  The coach feels that the underclassmen feel like they stepped up a little bit to help the seniors. </p>
<p>	Q.  Tom, can you talk about the decision to use the sledgehammer with those videotapes and the impact of that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chris, just wanted to ask you a little bit about the paths these two teams have taken.  It seems to be similar paths in using your depth.  Them having to neutralize Bogut and you using the back court to neutralize Redick?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you think how Michigan State plays reflects Coach Izzo's personality and approach?</p>
<p>	Q.  Alan, do you feel any more important for being one of the few seniors that gets a lot of minutes?  Also, does Kentucky remind you of any of you?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is for Kelvin and Coach.  Could you talk about the connection between Flint and Michigan State?</p>
<p>	Q.  Paul, from the underclassmen state of view, I know it is important for the entire team to keep this going, your thoughts on trying to do this for the seniors as well?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible?)</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the energy, the surprise energy at practice today.  I just watched the game and slept till noon.  Are you on adrenaline?  Are you jumping out of bed?  Or what is the deal?</p>

<p>	Q.  Along those lines, just looking at you guys up there and watching you play, as the tournament has progressed have you guys gotten more relaxed?</p>
<p>	Q.  The other day when you talked about Duke, I think you phrased it "revenge tour," to get revenge on the teams that have beaten you , obviously the Kentucky game last year.  Does it now include Wisconsin and Illinois?</p>
<p>	Q.  Kentucky has been shooting the ball really well in the tournament so far.  How big of a concern is that?  Can you pinpoint on where their shots are coming from?</p>
<p>	Q.  I watched a lot of Big-10 basketball this year.  You realize you were as athletic as you were last year.  Who has the best vertical on the team?</p>

<p>	Q.  For any player, with three Big-10 teams advancing now, what does that say about the conference?  Is it maybe a validation of the strength of the conference?</p>
<p>	Q.  Kelvin, you guys just seem so relaxed right now.  Not getting the win, but the win against Duke, is that part of the reason that we're seeing this?  Maybe it has loosened you up a little bit to know that you have accomplished something no other Spartan group has done?</p>

<p>	Q.  Can you just talk about the sledgehammer idea and how that fit into this trust you have started to develop between yourself and the players?</p>
<p>	Q.  This drive that you took with Paul Davis to get him motivated sounds like something out of The Godfather.  What did you talk about?  It didn't take I guess at the time?</p>
<p>	Q.  Tom, they say that teams that press don't like to be pressed.  The teams seem very similar in style and approach.  How do you see that impacting what happens tomorrow?</p>
<p>	Q.  It seems like especially from this region there are some examples of guys that have stayed four years and become stars.  In today's college basketball, are those guys more valuable to programs than the guys that are a one and done?  Is there a switch where you need guys that will come in and switch roles?</p>
<p>	Q.  Tom, does your philosophy mirror that of Flint Michigan and describe a typical Flint player?</p>
<p>	Q.  Tom, when you guys beat Kentucky in '99 in the regional final it was a breakthrough for you and the program.  This game tomorrow, maybe it will be just as big for this group?  Can you talk about the strange symmetry of playing them again?</p>
<p>	Q.  We're talking to Shannon about the time you went to see him play in Texas when you were recruiting him.  What do you remember from that?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible.) </p>
<p>	Q.  Chuck Hayes was talking with great respect about you and even joked about your hype.  What are your impressions of him?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible?)</p>
<p>	Q.  Tom, Chuck Hayes said that your team looks like a team that is peaking.  It has been a long time in coming for this group.  How motivated were you that they might leave without reaching their potential?</p>
<p>	Q.  For both you guys, I think this is your second Elite 8 in the last three-years.  Without one or two dominant programs, how important is it to have a program consistent enough that you are there knocking on the door getting yourself in a position where you will break through?</p>
<p>	Q.  If the skeptics who talk about the Big-10 this season were wrong, what did they miss about this conference?</p>
<p>	Q.  Kentucky has played 13 players in the first half of its last two tournament games.  Have you ever seen a team playing that big of a rotation this deep in the tournament?  The second part is somebody who plays that way, is that an extra onus on a coach?  To stay on top of match-ups when you are using that many people?</p>
<p>	Q.  This time of year it seems now in college basketball now more than ever the coaches have become the focal point.  How did college basketball become so coach centric and do you think and is that a good or bad thing?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, how will you remember Alan Anderson ten years from now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Joe Crawford is a guy that admired your program.  Can you talk about what you admire about him and what you first noticed about him maybe as a player?</p>
