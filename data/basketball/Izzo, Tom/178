<p>	Q.  I'd like to ask this to both coaches if I could.  I'm wondering how you think affects the coach's career and reputation to make it to the Final Four, and then to actually win the Final Four, in all areas, everything from media perception to public perception to recruiting to the way the university looks at you? </p>

<p>	Q.  Just wondered if you could address Loren Woods' season a little bit, and how important he is to you Saturday?</p>
<p>	Q.  With all of the openings that have been created in the last month coaching-wise around the country, it occurs to me that none of the four coaches in the Final Four have been fired from a head coaching job anywhere in their career.  Is there a lesson in that, possibly for administrators to maybe be more patient?  And also, Coach Izzo if you could kind of go back to your first couple of years at Michigan State.  I know you said you were getting clobbered by talk radio and you feared for your job, as well?</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys have seen teams get to the Final Four in a variety of ways, and, of course, there are a variety of ways to do that.  What is the single most important thing in your minds to getting there and to win the Championship? </p>

<p>	Q.  I was wondering if you could talk more about those pressures that coaches face now.  I know you've said before that that  -- how much does it serve given what you guys are compensated and how much of it is undeserved?  What's your take on that? </p>

<p>	Q.  Just wanted to ask you a little bit about the last year at the Final Four.  You guys went out and purchased the floor to put over in Lansing, and what did that  -- was that  -- does that symbolize anything or how did that work for you and how do you look at that after you did that?  And also, can you talk about what made you guys such a great rebounding team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would you talk for a minute about how helpful it would be to you to have a guy like Eugene who has already been part of a National Championship team with some veteran experience to help some of the younger guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm wondering how you think the loss of players to the NBA early, do you think that that affects the game in any way?  Some people feel that the quality of the game is going to suffer because guys are not around four years and there are not teams of four seniors anymore that play together for four years.  Can you talk about how it affect the game of college basketball? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Izzo, what's your opinion on that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the influence Ernie Anderson had on your life and your coaching career? </p>
<p>	Q.  I was hoping that you could tell us about when you guys seriously talked about the possibility of repeating, and if you -- now that you are two games away from doing that, if you've sought some advice from anyone on, you know, what it will take to do that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you went through this process of having your program recognized when you finally got to some Final Fours.  What does this mean for Michigan State, getting to three, in terms of where that puts them among the top programs in the country? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, when Loren Woods left Wake Forest, there seemed to be some genuine concern about his personal development.  Could you talk about the year off, the effect that had on him, and how he handled things since?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Olson, I was wondering what you saw in Arenas that coaches around the country did not see? </p>
