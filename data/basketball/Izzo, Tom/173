<p>	Q.  Tom, I am guess when you were growing up some, of your vivid memories were of the UCLA dynasty.  How do you compare Duke to that 10 or 12 year run that UCLA had then?</p>
<p>	Q.  Your thoughts on how you might want to handle Ewing and Redick this time around? </p>
<p>	Q.  I know after the Vermont victory you said your team had taken a big step but wasn't there yet.  Could you talk with any specificity about the unrealized potential you see in your players?  Can they make a leap still?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about how stacked this region is and how the challenge will be to get through this bracket?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked to us at the beginning of playing the cream of the crop.  Usually that comes with some factor of intimidation.  Has that is changed for Duke?  You have Coach Krzyewski talking about how they are not intimidating. </p>
<p>	Q.  Duke has played fairly short bench rotation but obviously that hasn't affected them so far this year.  I got sense from your teleconference the way you guys play you might be able to wear them down some.  Is that correct?</p>
<p>	Q.  Tom, you have spoken about this before.  Was there a time when you had awe for Duke, respect, and then now maybe frustration because you would like to beat them?</p>
<p>	Q.  Tom, can you talk about your point guard position and where it rates as being a strength for your team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Tom, you mentioned great players here in this region.  How many do you think a team needs a singular great player to get to the Final Four and win it all?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned Sweet 16 being so special to your players.  Through the year having a chance to talk to the seniors, obviously special to get here.  They kind of wanted Duke all along in this next game.  Is that something they feel like they also maybe need to get over?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about beating the cream of the crop in the regional.  Three of the coaches have national championships under their wings?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned about being one and two in the NCAA tournament.  Do you think there is common elements that kind of offset you and knock apart from the rest of your peers in March?</p>

<p>	Q.  Paul, just wanted to know first of all how you are feeling physically, and second what have you seen from Williams on film?  What do you need to do against him?</p>
<p>	Q.  For all of the players, for most of your lives Duke has been the gold standard of college basketball.  When you were in grade school, what were your impressions of Duke?  Were you Duke fans?  What were your favorite Duke players?</p>


<p>	Q.  What are you guys doing better now than you were at times when you were struggling in the season?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel like you have a mental edge since you played them tough at home?</p>
<p>	Q.  I saw a stat today, you are shooting 63 inside the arc but 19 percent from beyond the arc.  Is that something you know you have to do better against Duke tomorrow night?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chris, along those lines.  This week have you done anything differently?  Have you shot more, shot less?  How did you feel shooting the ball today?</p>
<p>	Q.  How long did you shoot those two nights?</p>
<p>	Q.  I just want to ask, you said something last week about you wanted to play Duke in this round.  Is that correct?  If so, why did you want to play Duke?</p>
<p>	Q.  For any of you guys, the game at Cameron you guys made a comeback at the end.  Did you feel like you are wearing them down towards the end?  Do you feel like this is something you might be able to do tomorrow?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chris, Coach Izzo said he would like to tie Redick and Ewing up this time around.  But barring that, do you think you have a better defensive plan and is that a key in this game?</p>
<p>	Q.  The coach mentioned too that part of the reason you guys said you Duke was to leave a mark, do something no Michigan State team has done before.  Is that important for the seniors to have on their resume before you play your last game at Michigan State?</p>

<p>	Q.  Chris, everyone talks about what Redick does.  Can you talk about what Daniel Ewing does for Duke?</p>

<p>	Q.  Talk about being physical with Redick and Ewing talk and how important that is. </p>
