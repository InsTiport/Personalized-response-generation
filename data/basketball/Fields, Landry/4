  Q. How are you feeling about it so far?  
 LANDRY FIELDS: Feeling great. It's been a lot of fun so far. The week is just getting started.   
  
  Q. How has it been walking into a team that's rebuilding?   
 LANDRY FIELDS: It's been great. I don't know much about it before because I've been out here on the West Coast, but to be a part of something like that is great.   
 Jamary is playing great. That's my nickname for him, my nickname for him is Monster. He's a big reason for the success that we have.  
  
  Q. What is your favorite All-Star memory?   
 LANDRY FIELDS: The Dunk Contest with Vince Carter in it. I've never seen anything like it. That's my favorite moment.   
  
  Q. Did you expect to be playing here this weekend when the college season wrapped up last year?  
 LANDRY FIELDS: No, I was just worried about trying to get drafted at that point, and then when the season started, just try to make the rotation. But you know, it surprised me. Very, very blessed to be here.   
 I think going out there helped me a lot to showcase some of my skills for the GMs and coaches.   
  
  Q. You don't do anything silly on the court; would you credit that to the fact you stayed four years in college?  
 LANDRY FIELDS: Maybe a little bit. I think the four years helped me grow as a person on and off the court and helped put me in a position where I am now.
