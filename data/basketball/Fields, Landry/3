Q.   How come you couldn't get Jeremy the MVP?
LANDRY FIELDS:   You know, magic can only go so far.   No, I'm kidding.   Just going out there having fun.   It was fun to be out there with all these guys, and this guy right here (holding up Time Magazine cover featuring Jeremy Lin), he did his thing.   Short minutes, but he still did his thing. 

Q.   What do you think about these kind of events, no competition, just fun?
LANDRY FIELDS:   Yeah, a lot of fun, a lot of defense (laughter).   Yeah, it was just all fun.   It's more of a celebration this weekend than anything else.

Q.   Relaxed?
LANDRY FIELDS:   Yeah, definitely relaxed.   We don't want to get hurt out there.   We've still got a second half of the season to go. 

Q.   Now looking forward, the Knicks, you are complete now.   What do you expect this part of the season, second half? 
LANDRY FIELDS:   You know, I expect a nice run from us.   We've got to come together and practice.   We've got some practice days right after this Allâ€‘Star Break.   So it should be good for us.
