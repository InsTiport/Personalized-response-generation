		  LANDRY FIELDS:   We're not here to make excuses.   We're going to go into practice after All‑Star break and get better. 

Q.   How do you take the pressure and all the tension?   One game people say he's (Lin) a God and the next‑‑
LANDRY FIELDS:   He's extremely humble.   He's handling it very well, and at the end of the day he's only human.   We're going to have off games like he did, but with his character and the kind of player he is, he's going to bounce back strong.

Q.   And are you excited about the All‑Star Game?
LANDRY FIELDS:   Very excited to be here.   It's my second one.   It's an extreme honor for me. 

Q.   What do you think was the key point for the Heat in the victory?   We know defense was key, but there were other problems. 
LANDRY FIELDS:   You know, the Heat played extremely well.   They played very well, especially at home right there.   It's something to not hang our hats on and get too caught up with.   It's something that we've got to go into practices after All‑Star break and learn from it.   We'll be all right.
