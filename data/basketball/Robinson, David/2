 Q. Are you ever going to get this out of your system? 
 DAVID ROBINSON: As soon as we lose. Obviously, the unexpected joy of winning, the competitive part of you comes into play and says, I have to come back and defend this game. Even though it is just for fun --

 Q. Do you still have the juices going? 
 DAVID ROBINSON: Oh, yeah, not in the same way as before. The preparation it takes to be out there to play is a whole different game. But, you know -- how many times do you get a chance to shoot balls in front of 15,000, 20,000 people. It is fun.

 Q. Do you have your family around you? 
 DAVID ROBINSON: Yeah, the boys, they were young during my career. So for them now to be able to experience some of this stuff and see Dad out there, even if it is me missing layups, it is still a great experience. 

 Q. Give us a quick scouting report. 
 DAVID ROBINSON: Mason is coming along. And a guy like Matt Bonner really filling in the big-man spot, they need somebody beside Tim Duncan who is going to rebound and make some baskets. 
 I think early in the season we probably relied a little bit too much on that three-point shooting and maybe we still do a bit, but the understanding of what we are trying to accomplish is there. Guys are playing hard and playing well. We are healthy. Obviously for us, health is the number one issue.
 We are an old team. If we can get our guys on the floor, I think we will have a chance to win.
