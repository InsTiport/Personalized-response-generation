   MEHMET OKUR:  They need me out there, I will be out there, offensive end.  But now they are doing good job on offensive end.   
  
  Q.  What has been the biggest difference last night than the first two games?   
 MEHMET OKUR:  We played with a lot of energy out there from the crowd fans.  Everybody was active, especially second half we were active on offensive end and defensive end.   
  
  Q.  What did you do so much different on Tim Duncan?   
 MEHMET OKUR:  Well, I was more focused on him on defensive end.  I didn't want to force the ball on offensive end.  I was focused, you know, just on him, you know, tried to push him off the block, make tough shots over my hands.   
 And not only me, it is on my teammates they did a good job on him.   
  
  Q.  Mehmet, in the first round you had to battle Yao Ming and now you are battling Tim Duncan.  Are you enjoying the challenge of the battle?   
 MEHMET OKUR:  It is a great challenge.  I tried to enjoy the moment out there especially on the defensive end.   
 Like I say, I tried to do my best on him.   
  
  Q.  So you are going to concentrate on defense and let the offense come?   
 MEHMET OKUR:  Well, yeah.  I mean, I didn't want to force him.  I want to take 15, 18 shots last night.  I was focused on defensive end, so -- well, if they need me out there, I will be out there on offensive end, too.   
  
  Q.  Did you see something at halftime?  It seemed like still it was a battle in the first half.  The second half you guys came out.   
 MEHMET OKUR:  We just talked about at halftime we've got to do a better job on defensive end.  We got to play with more energy out there.  And everybody did a good job on defensive end, and we play better basketball at the other end.
