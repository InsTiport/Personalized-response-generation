  Q.  Talk about playing for Jerry Sloan?   
 MEHMET OKUR:  He spent 20 years with the Jazz and he has a long experience with the NBA.  And he hates losing.   
 He's such a good teacher.  He likes to teach, day in and day out.  So I've learned a lot of things from him.  It's all about winning.   
  
  Q.  What do you think of Vegas?   
 MEHMET OKUR:  This is my first time here.  It's a huge honor for me.  For me family and my country.  So it's definitely a dream come true.
