   Q.  How is the confidence level of the team right now? 
 MEHMET OKUR:  I mean, everybody feels better now because, you know, we lost twice on the road and it is great to be home.  It is going to be an exciting two games for us.  We need to go out there and play hard because we are such a young team. 
 We try to learn every game.  Hopefully we learn our lesson from the last two games. 

 Q.  What do you need to get it going offensively, to find your shot? 
 MEHMET OKUR:  Well, try to, you know -- first of all, we are going to play off of the crowd.  It will be a different story on the defensive end probably.  And we just need to help each other more on the defensive end. 
 My shot it is just, you know -- keep working on my shots every day and I can't give up right now.  I have to play good defense on Tim Duncan, and I missed some shots, you know. 
 So hopefully it will fall for me the next couple games. 

 Q.  Jerry said you guys seem lost on defense.  Is that how you characterize it?  You just can't find guys? 
 MEHMET OKUR:  We gave them what they wanted, especially, you know -- I don't know what happened in the second quarters, first and second game. 
 They took what they wanted.  They penetrated inside.  They had easy baskets, dunks.  They got to the free-throw line.  We missed some shots.  Hopefully we are going to be more focused on the defensive end. 

 Q.  Do you think you have the advantage here?  You are undefeated in the playoffs on your home court.  You are at home. 
 MEHMET OKUR:  It will be an exciting game, no doubt about it.  We have to go out there and play hard, play with energy.  Everybody will bring their best effort, 110% out there.  And that's how we have to play.  We have to play good defense. 
 Also we can't turn the ball over to these guys because they are too good.
