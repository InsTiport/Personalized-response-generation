  Q. Do you feel like you got robbed?
 OBI TOPPIN:   No, I don't feel like I got robbed at all.  Anfernee is a great dunker.  He got all three of his dunks on the first try, and that's what I was just talking about.  I was like, the second and third dunk, I messed up on, and I had to do it a second time.  I felt like if I got those on my first try, it would have been a different result.
 But I don't think I got robbed at all.  Anfernee did a great job, and he deserved that trophy.
 Q. How has this experience been as an overall for you, being your first year in the league and you're already in the Dunk Contest?  And second part, I don't know if you're into the rookie card market, but what do you think this experience the first year will do to your rookie card value in the future?
 OBI TOPPIN:   So the first question, my experience here, like I said before, it's a blessing that I'm here on this stage.  A lot of people dream to be in this position, and I'm living it.  It's an amazing feeling, and I wouldn't change it for the world.
 I don't know the question for the rookie card.  I don't know how to answer that question.
 Q. I know you didn't get to socialize a lot down there, but was there a moment where you saw somebody and you were like, wow?  Did you ever get star-struck in the time you were down there?
 OBI TOPPIN:   I always said LeBron was one guy that if I saw him, I'm going to be like, wow.  As soon as I saw him, he looked at me, came up to me and he was like, What's up, Obi?  I was like, dang, you know my name?  That whole experience was good.
 But obviously everybody, every player who's here is a great player.  They got here for a reason.  Just being here with all these guys is amazing.
