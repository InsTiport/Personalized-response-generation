Colorado 76-Dayton 76, OT
MODERATOR: We now welcome Dayton. Head coach Anthony Grant, Jalen Crutcher, and Obi Toppin.
Coach.
ANTHONY GRANT: You got to give Colorado credit. Those guys did a great job. We knew coming in a few things about them as a team. Obviously really talented group, well-coached. They're excellent in transition. They're really, really excellent in their ability to get second shots.
Obviously a couple things in terms of from our standpoint, we knew to be able to keep them out of transition, we would have to do a good job of executing our stuff and taking care of the basketball.
A lot of things today. I think a very hard-fought game. Obviously the end of the game, the way the game ended, it's tough to take. But we'll go back and look at some things that we can learn from this game in terms of what we need to do to make sure we don't have this feeling again.
This is a team I think still has a lot of room to grow, a lot of room to improve and what we have got to be able to do is mature in some areas as a team to be able to reach the potential that we think we can reach.
MODERATOR: Questions for the players.
Q. Obi, obviously not the result you wanted. What was it like having basically a home game here?
OBI TOPPIN: Yeah, our fans are very loyal. They travel everywhere we go. They're amazing. It's like we got the No. 1 fan base in the world. For all the fans that came out today, we want to thank them. It was great seeing them there.
Q. What did you see on the last play, the big shot by Schwartz?
JALEN CRUTCHER: They threw the ball in the post. We worked on it in practice that we were going to double the post. It was just a good find by him, a good shot.
Q. Obi, the game-tying three-pointer, you just missed one earlier. You were 0-5 at that point. How much of a confidence booster was that going into overtime?
OBI TOPPIN: The whole game I wasn't hitting any threes. My teammates were staying with me, had trust in me, telling me to keep shooting if I was open, don't stop shooting.
It's crazy because right before that play, Trey was looking at me. It's like, If you're open, shoot the ball. It was in the timeout. I was like, I got you.
I guess it just went in. It was a good feeling.
Q. The turnovers in the second half were probably your biggest issue. What did you see? What was going on with some of those turnovers?
ANTHONY GRANT: I'll go back and look at the film. We have to mature as a team. We really do. I think a lot of it is self-inflicted. Maybe it was something that Colorado did that caused us problems.
But for the most part, you know, it's stuff that we need to be able to clean up as a team. If we're going to reach our potential, we have to do better.
Q. Jalen, second loss like this, you know how good you can be, but do you feel like you're just a little bit short of being the great team you want to be?
JALEN CRUTCHER: Oh, yeah, we got a lot of room to grow. Like coach said in the locker room, It's still December. I think we got a lot of room to grow. I don't think we reached our peak yet.
MODERATOR: Thank you.
