<p>	Q.  Hollis, I don't know whether you got a chance to see the Indiana/Kent State game in person or on tape.  Your thoughts on their 3-point shooting.  Have you ever seen a display like that?  Is there a thought that they can carry that over to another game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Aaron, will you talk a little about what Hollis brings to the court?  Do you think opponents sometimes underestimate him because he's not physically imposing? </p>
<p>	Q.  Defense has really got you where you're at.  Even though you had games one stretch you scored a hundred points in three days.  Does it all start with intensity or great skill level on defense?  Where would you say it all begins? </p>


<p>	Q.  How often do opposing defenses come out with specific intent of roughing you up a bit?  How do you keep your head when they try that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Hollis and Aaron, last week after the game in San  Jose, you went to visit Coach Sampson's father in the hospital.  What was that like?  Has Coach talked about his condition at all this week?  Will you see him before the game tomorrow? </p>


<p>	Q.  Ebi and Hollis, a lot of people are making you guys, Oklahoma, a heavy favorite for this game, particularly because of Coverdale's injury.  What is your reaction to that? </p>

<p>	Q.  Knowing that Coverdale at best will be injured, how much does it change your preparation going into the game?  Is there a plan going in to press more now that their backcourt will likely be hobbled? </p>
<p>	Q.  How would you describe the improvement and development of McGee and how important has that been to where you are right now? </p>
<p>	Q.  If you guys could talk a little bit about the difficulties of transferring  -- the adjustments of coming from junior college to a big-time program like this? </p>

<p>	Q.  Hollis, you shot the ball a lot better this year from last year.  Did you spend a lot of time working on that off-season?  Is that something you concentrated on?  Is that kind of the key to the season you had individually? </p>
<p>	Q.  It seems like Jeffries can do a lot of things offensively.  What do you think of his game and how do you go about defending him? </p>
<p>	Q.  Hollis, after last year's injury, you talked about how that was the most frustrating feeling in your career.  Can you understand what Coverdale is going through now?  Can you imagine what it would be like to be injured at this stage, the Final Four? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk a little bit about the toughness and physical nature of your practices and how you're able to translate that into the ballgames? </p>



<p>	Q.  Coach, how do you get your guys to play so hard all the time? </p>
<p>	Q.  If somebody told you when you began practice in October that on March 29th, you're going to be 31-4, playing in the Final Four, what would you have told that person? </p>
<p>	Q.  Will you talk about Hollis on the court, his shooting has improved, how he stepped up his game this year on the court? </p>
<p>	Q.  How would you describe your two-year relationship with Aaron McGee?  Was there ever a point   - I don't know if you call it tough love  - was there ever a point that you were concerned you were taking a risk with the way you approached him?</p>
<p>	Q.  What was it like working in the tobacco warehouses as a 12-year-old?  How did that shape what you've become as a coach? </p>
<p>	Q.  Greensboro. </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about your dad's condition, whether you expect him to be here?  I looked up the thing on the web today, I see there's a reminder today to watch the Oklahoma game on the website? </p>

<p>	Q.  Speaking of your father, I know you've always dreamed of being at the Final Four, him being there, your parents being there.  Plus you've always wanted to take a team here.  Reflect on that, if you would, because you're still a gym rat coach, the fact you are here and get to do the things you always dreamed about. </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk a little bit about your philosophy for bringing in junior college players and why it's been so successful to you? </p>
