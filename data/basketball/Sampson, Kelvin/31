COACH KELVIN SAMPSON:  I thought Texas Tech had that one stretch in the second half where they separated from us and our kids got it back to 62-58.  I didn't think we played with as much zip, as much energy.  Obviously our defense wasn't as good as the last time we played them.  But like Coach Knight said about the other two games, we didn't play very good in Norman and they didn't play very good in Lubbock.  Today I guess it was our turn.  We didn't play very good. 
 
 
Q.  I know you don't like to lose, but is this you know, with this tournament being kind of a physical toll, three games in three days, can this possibly help you next week?
 
COACH KELVIN SAMPSON:  We're going to try it look at it that way.  It's a long season.  We have been through a lot of these tournaments and we're going to go back home tonight, I think we got a flight leaving in a few hours.  We get to take Sunday off now.  We will probably take Monday off too because we entered the regular season, two straight road trips then we had to come right here, but we're going to get excited about playing next week.  This team has won 24 out of their last 31 games.  Texas Tech deserved to win that game.  We didn't, but we're looking forward to next week. 
 
Q.  Do you think you squandered a chance to go to the Ford Center or do you think you still have a good shot?
 
COACH KELVIN SAMPSON:  There's three teams, only two can go.  Whoever loses this game you can ask them the same question.  We won the regular season, we were the number one seed, we shared the regular season.  We were the one seed, so we have that going for us.  Somebody is going to be in the same boat in two more hours as we're right now.
