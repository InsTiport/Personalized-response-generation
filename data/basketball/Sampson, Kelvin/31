<p>	Q.  Coaches always have a lot of what-ifs in their career and I was wondering if Tubby Smith had taken the Oklahoma job instead of turning it down, where do you think your career might have landed?  And secondly, you talk so much about Hollis Price, about his character, sometimes does his ability as a player get overlooked?  Talk about what makes his playing ability purely at that level?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk a little bit about Michael Cano means to your team.  He doesn't play a whole lot, obviously you think enough of him to keep  him on the team; voted this year as team Captain.  Talk about what he means to the team.</p>
<p>	Q.  I was just wondering for those people that always think of Oklahoma as a football school, how much of a dent are you putting in that reputation?</p>
<p>	Q.  Has there been one thing that really struck you the most about the response in town?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jason Detrick really kind of played under the radar here in high school.  Was curious as to if you knew of him as a high school player and then what attracted him to you as a junior college player and what he's brought to the squad this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  You have been a spectator of this event for many years.  Now you are a participant.  Obviously you have watched a lot of teams handle the distractions and pressure.  I am curious how you are trying keep things as normal as you can with your kids especially while you are still involved with all the hoopla.</p>
