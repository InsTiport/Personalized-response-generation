THE MODERATOR: Okay, we're joined by Houston coach, Kelvin Sampson, and sophomore, Galen Robinson Jr.  We'll take statement from Coach Sampson.   
KELVIN SAMPSON: I don't have anything to say.  It's getting late.  If there's no questions.   
 Q.  [Inaudible]?  
KELVIN SAMPSON: You know, let's be honest.  Connecticut did a great job tonight feeding off that crowd.  Their crowd was tremendous.  You know?  That might have been the toughest crowd we played in front of all year outside of at SMU and at Cincinnati.  I thought their kids, that crowd, really buoyed them and they did a great job.  They really fed off that crowd.  That was a huge, huge deal for them having played last night, you know?   
 Q.  You called a couple time-outs, you trying to tell the guys to settle down?  
KELVIN SAMPSON: Well, we got up 20-9.  I thought we -- we needed to get in the paint.  Shooting too many threes during that stretch.  We're not at our -- we're not a shoot threes off the dribble team, you know?  We're a ball movement team, and we played to the third side and penetrate and kick and then we shoot our threes there.  I thought we were a little impatient at that time.  That's probably why I called those time-outs.   
 Q.  Did that prevent you from going back inside?  
KELVIN SAMPSON: Well, we don't throw it to them anyway.   
 Q.  Galen, can you talk about the crowd, trying to counter that.  Trying to fight the crowd in the second half?  
GALEN ROBINSON, JR.: I remember a couple times I was trying to call plays and people couldn't hear it.  My teammates couldn't hear it.  So I had to try to act like -- act what I was trying to call, like, but, they played a major factor, gave them energy and they fed off of it pretty well.   
KELVIN SAMPSON: Huge advantage.  Huge advantage.   
THE MODERATOR: Is that it for the questions?   
Coach, thank you.
