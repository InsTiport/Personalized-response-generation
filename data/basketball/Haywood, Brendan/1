 Q. Was it down to the Heat or the Mavericks, or were you going back to Dallas as a courtesy? 
 BRENDAN HAYWOOD: At the time I was reading the market. The market changes every day. One guy signs and everything totally changes. LeBron is proof of that. At the time I was reading the market. I was looking at Detroit, I was looking at Dallas, I was looking at Miami, I was looking at Boston, Doc Rivers. I had a lot of different options. I didn't know where I was going. I was calling Andy Miller every day. 

 Q. I think you already answered this, how physically do you feel? 
 BRENDAN HAYWOOD: A lot better than yesterday. I don't know what that means for tomorrow, but I definitely feel better. 

 Q. You guys have had to deal with a lot of different injuries. Rick likes to use a lot of different combinations. How will it help to have some of that background in your repertoire? 
 BRENDAN HAYWOOD: The good thing is we have had a chance to play some of our guys this year, so it's not like we're playing guys who haven't played. Played some of our guys off the bench this year. So it's not like we're throwing in a guy who hasn't played. Guys like Mahinmi, Cardinal, they've played several roles and they've played well. We'll need the same thing tomorrow. 

 Q. Is it a game-time decision? 
 BRENDAN HAYWOOD: Probably. 

 Q. Can you talk about Marion's defense. He's gone from guarding Brandon Roy to Kobe and now LeBron. 
 BRENDAN HAYWOOD: We wouldn't be here without his defense. His defense has been great. One of the underrated parts of his game. He has stepped up the challenge to guard some of the top offensive players in this league.
