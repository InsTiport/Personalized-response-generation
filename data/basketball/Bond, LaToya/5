<p>	Q.  LaToya, could you talk about the last six and a half minutes, they scored only once in the field.  Talk about your defense at the end of the game. </p>
<p>	Q.  LaToya, did you feel like you owed Kansas something after the two games that you played during the regular season? </p>
<p>	Q.  Christelle, what was it like going in there?  It seemed pretty physical? </p>
<p>	Q.  Christelle, what about -- LaToya talked how important this was, the third match-up with Kansas.  Did you come in feeling especially energized to try to win this? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about her defense.  Talk about her offense. </p>
<p>	Q.  LaToya, maybe you can give a little comment about Baylor tomorrow. </p>
<p>	Q.  LaToya, could you talk about your basket to tie it up at 55?  It was a drive with 2 minutes, 30 seconds left.  Do you remember that? </p>


<p>	Q.  Could you talk about that last six and a half or so minutes where they really scored the two points, had big plays from LaToya. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, can you talk a little bit about the differences today versus last time you guys played Kansas? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the match-up with Baylor? </p>
<p>	Q.  Maybe talk about how a victory like this can put a different paint job on the season?  It's been a little tough. </p>
<p>	Q.  They shot over 50% in the first half, I believe 25% in the second half.  Did you make some defensive adjustments? </p>
<p>	Q.  The last time you played them, after the game you used words like "embarrassed, disgusting."  What words do you want to use today? </p>
