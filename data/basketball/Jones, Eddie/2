Q.  You're getting the home court back. 
 
EDDIE JONES:  We're just worried about coming out and playing our game.  We've got to be the Miami Heat, no matter if it's in Miami or Detroit.  We came out tonight, the Big Guy is starting to feel better, and the healthier we can get him, the better we'll be. 
 
Q.  Shaq looked almost close to 100 percent tonight. 
 
EDDIE JONES:  He looked pretty good.  He's still at about 75 percent.  I've seen the Big Fella play in the playoffs so I know what he's capable of.
