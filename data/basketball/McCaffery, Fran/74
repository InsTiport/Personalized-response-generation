Michigan - 77, Iowa - 71 (OT)   
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach McCaffery.   
 Q.  What did you see different from the defense today than yesterday against Illinois that gave you guys trouble shooting in the second half?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Illinois plays such a unique style you can't really compare them with anybody.  I thought they -- you know, they were up into us, our key guys, like you would expect.   
They're long.  They're athletic.  They've got veteran guys.  And they were physical and moved their feet.  I don't think there was anything tricky.  Just good, solid, fundamental defense, which you would expect from one of John's teams.   
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.
