Kennesaw State - 74, Iowa - 91
Q. How do you feel about Cordell Pemsl's play?
COACH MCCAFFERY: It was really good.  I thought he picked us up when he first came in.  I thought he was posting hard, he gave us a low post presence offensively.  He missed a couple that I think he'll make.  He struggled at the free-throw line obviously early, but we'll get that straightened out, he's got a nice stroke.
Q. Christian went out in the second half.  Is there any medical update?
COACH MCCAFFERY: His back was bothering him so he could have gone back, I just decided that I'm looking that I'm up 16, 18, so I said I'm not going to put him back in.  Especially with a 2:30 game Sunday.
Q. Jordan Bohannon, did he kind of take over the night?
COACH MCCAFFERY: I thought Jordan was really good, a couple passes deflected, but he was really looking to get it in the post, which is something we really want him to do when he looks for his shot.  Makes two threes.  Defensively he was really good.  Knows what we want to do.  Smart, tough.  I was really pleased with him.
Q. What was the best thing you saw in your team tonight?
COACH MCCAFFERY: Well, I thought defensively in the first half, we had stretches where we were really good.  But it's not unlike it was in the last game, we had stretches where we weren't as good defensively.
17 turnovers is too many turnovers.  So, those turnovers, defensive lapses, at times.  Good enough, tough enough, smart enough to overcome it, but we have to be better than that in those situations on a consistent basis.
Q. Was there a number of shots that you're looking for from Pete or is it does it really matter as long as he's in the flow of the game?
COACH MCCAFFERY: He pretty much has the green light.  He's good for at least four bad shots a game.  But they're good shots, he's taking them.
Q. On a night when Tyler and Dom struggled a little bit, but Ahmad really gave you --
COACH MCCAFFERY: Ahmad was really good.  I thought, again, at both ends, energy, athleticism, scoring, shot blocking, I thought Dom did some really good things.  He is what, eight and five, 6-10 from the line.  Usually a little better than that.  Tyler had some trouble early getting it in.  He'll get that figured out.
Q. Maishe Dailey didn't play, is that an indication of a red shirt or still thinking about it?
COACH MCCAFFERY: That was an indication of I was struggling with it.  Because he deserved to get in there.  I think we'll put him in there on Sunday, yeah.  I just, he's too good a player.  I was concerned with burning a year for him, but he wants to play, so I'll play him.
Q. Do you think Cook was trying to do too much tonight?
COACH MCCAFFERY: He was a little amped up early I thought.  His energy level was good, it usually is.  He had a couple things didn't go right for him, he got it close to the rim a couple times.  Good thing is he made 10 rebounds, 4-4, 4-4 from the line, five offensive rebounds, I was pleased with him there.  He'll get it figured out.
Q. Are you comfortable with a lineup now or do you still want to experiment?
COACH MCCAFFERY: No, I'm still experimenting.
Q. Pete posted up a few times.  Is that something we're going to see more?
COACH MCCAFFERY: He just did that on his own, yeah, that wasn't anything set.  He's good as a post-up player, because he's got a turnaround jump shot and he can pass out of the post, and he draws fouls and he shoots 90, so we'll try to do that when he goes in there.
Q. And little defensive lapse early in the second half?
COACH MCCAFFERY: Yeah, that's unacceptable.  We worked really hard, we had one stretch in the first half we had six consecutive stops and build a 20-point lead, give up a three at the buzzer and then come out really not ready to go starting the second half.  That is unacceptable.  And I pointed that out.
Q. Jones play Sunday, do you think?
COACH MCCAFFERY: I thought he might play today, but the problem is he hasn't practiced.  So, in fairness to him, it's hard to figure out what to do with him right now.  As frustrated as he is right now, I'm probably as frustrated for him.  He's such a great kid and he's a weapon and he's talented.  I think he's a little scared, too because, typically, after surgery, you have swelling.  He didn't have any swelling.  And all of a sudden now he's got swelling.  So, you know, I think it will go down and when it goes down he'll feel better and he'll feel more relaxed and we'll get him out there.
