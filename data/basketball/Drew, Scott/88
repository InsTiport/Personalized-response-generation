<p>	Q.  Aaron, talk about that early run they had.  Were you all a little bit shellshocked by that?  Just talk about the start if you could?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about having completed your first run through the league, your first year and just what you think about your decision to come to Baylor and what the future holds now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ryan, can you talk about your last game?  You got in there and hit some points just maybe -- just what it's meant to you to be on this team as it's rebuilding?</p>
<p>	Q.  Aaron did you feel like Iowa State was really keying in on you today?</p>
<p>	Q.  Aaron, what do you foresee for this team next season?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know it hasn't been very long since this game ended but do you have a pretty good idea of how much work you have got ahead of you hear in the next season I guess?</p>
<p>	Q.  You think your guys might have been a little bit struck by the big stage here today, especially the start of the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you want this team to be remembered?</p>
