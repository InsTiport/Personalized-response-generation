THE MODERATOR:   Coach, an opening statement.   
COACH DREW:   I was very proud of the second half, and especially the last ten minutes how we clamped down on the defensive end, really did a great job rebounding.   Then Brady was obviously on fire, but his teammates did a great job getting him the ball.   Brady's one of the first to tell you my teammates really got me open and got me the ball.   That humility is what makes our team successful.   
As far as Colorado, I think we were in the championship game of the Big 12 Tournament playing four games in four days and lost.   I have so much respect for them in how they won that tournament and were able to come in here and win a game.   They've done an outstanding job and have a lot of toughness.   They're going to be very successful in the future.  
   
 Q.   Brady, how would you describe your evening?   
BRADY HESLIP:   I'm just feeling great right now, first of all, because we won.   I'm just happy for my seniors.   Quincy Acy, nobody wanted to go home today.   We played like that in the second half for sure.   So it's an amazing feeling right now.   
As for the shooting, Pierre does a great job finding me when I'm open and finding me in transition.   Acy sets great screens and it was just one of those nights.  
   
 Q.   Brady, can you describe what it feels like to get into that kind of groove?   You just kind of know you're going to hit it when you're that hot?   
BRADY HESLIP:   Yeah, when they say great screens and they make passes that are on target and on time, it just make it's easy for me, especially if I'm in rhythm and feeling good shooting.   It just makes it even easier.  
   
 Q.   Brady, can you talk a little about your lineage?   Everybody knows you were practically born with a basketball in your hands and how that got you to this point with your father and your uncle?   
BRADY HESLIP:   Yeah, it's something that I've been around since I was 3 years old.   I think I made my first basket.   Ever since I was growing up, they never forced it on me.   It was just something that I fell in love with.   My dad, my uncle, my mom, and grandpa and grandma have just been really supportive of me through all my years and supportive of me following my dream.  
   
 Q.   Pierre and Quincy, do you have a name for this when he goes off in games like this?   What do you call it?   
QUINCY ACY:   Straps.   
   
 Q.   Why?   
PIERRE JACKSON:   Strap the scene.   That's what we say when you make threes, and Brady strapped the scene tonight.   
QUINCY ACY:   We got that from the red shirt Bobo Morgan.   
   
 Q.   How would you describe, Pierre, Brady's shooting night?   
PIERRE JACKSON:   I don't know.   I know he's capable of it, man, we've just got to get him open, and he did a great job of getting his shot off fast and it went in.   Strapped the scene.   
   
 Q.   Question for Quincy about Brady, when you see him putting the ball up, how confident are you that it's going in?   How comfortable are you when you see him about to drop the three?   
QUINCY ACY:   I know how hard he's worked.   When he came in, we knew how good of a shooter he was.   Every time I went to the gym at night, I would see him in there sometimes twice a day.   He works for it.   I know whenever he gets hot, he can outshoot anybody.   I think he got me two assists, so, you know, that's always good.   
   
 Q.   Brady, on a typical summer day, how many threes are you taking in the gym by yourself?   Number two, what is your brand of chewing gum when you're playing?   
BRADY HESLIP:   Oh, man, the brand I chew of gum is supplied by Mr. DC, the best trainer in college basketball.   It's Doublemint.   And on a summer day, I don't know exactly how many threes I would get up, but I wake up early in the morning before class and I go work out.   Then I go to the gym after class and work out.   Then I'll have whatever we do in the afternoon, and then I'll get more shots at night, so, a lot.  
   
 Q.   Quincy and Pierre, can you talk about the decision to switch to the zone and how effective it was at the end of the game?   
QUINCY ACY:   Well, that's the advantage of having a great coach.   Sometimes we might have to switch to man and guard people.   But the zone, I think it really bothered them, and I think it was unexpected.   Sometimes they might prepare for our zone and they might have stuff for it or whatever.   
But I think whenever we started out in man, they got comfortable, then we switched to zone, and that really threw them for a loop.   We did a good job of flying everywhere.   Whatever defense we choose to play, if guys buy into it, I think we'll be successful.   
PIERRE JACKSON:   Yeah, Quincy said it all.   It goes to the coaching staff.   Decided to switch it up on them.   
   
 Q.   Brady and Quincy, from what I understand, Brady Heslip was the number one trending topic on Twitter in the United States.   Not sure what you can say to it, but how does that feel and what does that mean for Baylor basketball, actually?   
BRADY HESLIP:   Pierre knows all about that.   He's the Twitter master.   He's got all the followers, so I'm just trying to catch him.   
No, it's cool.   I guess that's what happens nowadays with the media.   But I'm really just happy that we won the game.   
QUINCY ACY:   That's a big deal to have a lot of people talking about you.   I guess that's good in a positive way.   You don't want to be trending for anything bad, so good job.   Follow us on Twitter too, guys.   
BRADY HESLIP:   Yeah, you can put that in there.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach Drew.  
   
 Q.   Coach, K‑State's out today, Missouri loses yesterday.   It's just and you Kansas left.   How important is it for you guys to fly the flag for the Big 12 from here on out?   
COACH DREW:   Well, obviously there is a lot of pride in the Big 12 conference, and we think‑‑ is Iowa State out?   Shows you that I haven't seen any scores today.   I've been focused on what we have.   
But definitely the Big 12, we think, is an outstanding conference.   We're going to work as hard as we can, not only for Baylor University, but for the Big 12.   I think that's why it shows the parity, number one, the match‑ups you get in the NCAA Tournament.   The last thing with that, again, that's why it's March Madness, the excitement that anybody can beat anybody on any given night.   
I think going through the grind of the Big 12 conference, some teams might not be able to do that, but on one game, one night, 40 minutes, anybody can beat anybody in Division 1.   There are that many good players, that many good coaches, that many good fans.  
   
 Q.   Coach, I think Brady only got one shot in the first nine minutes of the second half?  
COACH DREW:   Bad coaching (smiling).  
   
 Q.   Did you change anything, or was it just emphasis?   
COACH DREW:   Well, we ran some plays to get him open, but most of all, the credit goes to the guys.   They found him and they got him open.   I thought Colorado really made it tough for our interior to score as efficient as we normally do.   I think we missed some easy buckets.   Because they were helping so much, it allowed Brady to get open on some of the screening action.   
What I was most impressed with, and we haven't mentioned anything about the altitude to our team, but he was the only one that I thought shooting‑wise didn't show any affects to play 39 minutes, shoot that well, and not have any effects of the altitude.   
I think that goes back to Quincy Acy talked about his hard work.   He's in the gym two times a day, sometimes three times a day.   So he's used to fighting through fatigue and shooting when he's tired.   That's why he's a successful player.  
   
 Q.   I think the story is going to be the three‑pointers.   But that defensive switch there at the end, how big was that, and why did you decide to go to it at that point?   
COACH DREW:   First of all, credit Colorado.   We were having trouble stopping them.   They were shooting 50‑something percent.   They had scored a bunch of times in a row.   That is the biggest challenge we've had all year as a coaching staff.   We have a lot of depth and a lot of options.   
What's so tough for a player, and anyone can relate in work, if one day your boss gives you the top story, gives you the top story, and then the next day doesn't use you for days and you're like, "What did I do wrong?"   
So that's been tough for us because when we play certain lineups, we play a certain style.   When we play other lineups, we play a certain style.   
Credit the leadership to the team because very easily it could have been about me, myself and I; and if it is, then none of that works and your depth becomes your biggest weakness rather than your biggest strength.  
   
 Q.   Pierre's ball handling in penetration provided a lot of problems for Colorado.   How important is that for you guys to make a run deeper into the tournament?   
COACH DREW:   Well, Pierre's penetration and ball handling that's bothered a lot of opponents.   He missed a lot of shots tonight he normally doesn't miss.   To have ten assists is outstanding, five steals.   He just does so much stuff.   When he turns it over, there is a good chance he steals it back before they get it down the court anyway.
