  Q. Can you believe just a few years ago you were sending out text pledges seeking potential jobs in sports media and now you're a key cog in the Miami Heat getting to the NBA Finals?
 DUNCAN ROBINSON:   I can believe it -- can believe it, but I certainly didn't expect it.  I understand that nothing is guaranteed and throughout my career if there's one thing I have learned, it's not to expect anything.  So, I'm incredibly grateful to be in this situation, humbled by it in many ways.  It's still kind of been surreal but IÂ’m certainly not content and I'm excited for the opportunity to compete and hopefully leave my mark on this series.
 Q. Now that you are in the Finals, I've got to ask you a follow-up question.  If you were pursuing a job in sports media, what avenue would you go into?  Would you want a job, say, doing what we do as the guys asking you questions, a play-by-play guy?  What would you want to do in sports media?
 DUNCAN ROBINSON:   Probably something to do with content.  I like to write.  Whether it be content -- like everybody, I have no shortage of opinions.  I have my opinions on everything.  Maybe something kind of in that avenue.
 Q. Have you been able to work in the gym late at night to work on your shot?  Have you heard from any friends, former coaches, teammates, who have said to you:  Can you believe you're in the NBA Finals over these last couple days?
 DUNCAN ROBINSON:   I've heard from a lot of people, people that have come out and supported from all different stages of my life in my basketball career, which I'm really appreciative of.  That's one of the things that is so special about this is you get to share with people.  Definitely felt the support.
 As for shooting, NBA has done a good job of making gym time available and I try to take full advantage of that.  Some days it's resting, just to -- obviously these playoffs have been somewhat of a grind, as well, so it's always about finding that balance between rest and repetition.  But the NBA has definitely made gym time available which has been great.
 Q. Have you gone late at night?
 DUNCAN ROBINSON:   Yeah, not like midnight.  We have a gym slot every night either 9:00 to 10:00 or 10:00 to 11:00.  Earlier on in the bubble I was pretty much at every single one.  Now it becomes more how your body is feeling and go from there.
 Q. Referencing that text message that has gone viral, and we all agree you are at a high point in your career.  Can you reflect on the low points of your career and how this paved the way for you to be here today sitting here in the NBA Finals?
 DUNCAN ROBINSON:   Sure, you know, I wouldn't necessarily refer to them as low points as much as just learning experiences. I've had a handful of them.  I got pulled out of the starting lineup my junior and senior year, so I didn't start much of my college career.  I wasn't starting in high school.  I was hosting coach DNPs my junior year of high school, so that's pretty unheard of for a guy who goes on to play college basketball, let alone the opportunity to play in the NBA.  For me it's about building the trust and resolve to continue to push through in those moments and I feel like those plateaus can turn into spring boards for success if you approach them with the right mindset.  I give a ton of credit to my family, people in my corner, close friends, and people who kept me grounded in those moments.  It's not some secret recipe or whatever.  It's really just about continuing to push forward, be persistent, continuing to show up.
 Q. What is the best advice you've heard through the years and who told you?
 DUNCAN ROBINSON:   I've gotten so many examples of great advice.  It's hard to pinpoint one.  The best advice has been from either my family or close friends of just really being present.  There's a tendency to get caught up in what's next or how can I parlay this into my next opportunity or how can I do this or that.
 One thing I feel like has been an advantage throughout my career is I've tried to just excel where my feet were and just be the best version of myself, whether that be in a role, school, the team, what have you, and I've just continued to push forward with that.
 Honestly I don't remember your first question so you might need to ask that one again.
 Q. I guess you watched the games, the NBA Finals from your TV a few years ago.  What does it mean to be here, your work and sacrifices?
 DUNCAN ROBINSON:   I referenced it earlier but it's a humbling opportunity.  First and foremost, incredibly grateful for all the opportunity I've been given within this organization, within this team, and it's been a ton of fun with this group of guys to just compete and just have another championship.  It's been an incredible run and we're certainly not content with where we are and want to push forward.
 Q. Jimmy came into the celebration the other night wearing a Spo University of Portland jersey. Did you ever see him [Erik Spoelstra] pick up a basketball and play?  Did you know that he was a player and do you see any of that point guard still in him today?
 DUNCAN ROBINSON:   Occasionally he'll like mess around with just like dribbling the ball or finishing or shooting jumpshots, like very occasionally but he'll do it.  I did know he was a player.  I remember listening to, I think it was the Woj podcast or something, he was talking about his experience overseas and his experience at Portland.  I knew he had a career as a player and been a good one, so it's funny to kind of see it come out just in spots here and there.
