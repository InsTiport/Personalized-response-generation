  CLINT CAPELA:   For me it was a really big dream because I'm from a country who's far from here.   So when I was over there, it was like a big dream, really far.   
When I saw a player like Thabo Sefolosha here, he really pushed me to work hard, and I really enjoy this now.   
   
 Q.   Are you going to play this season, and how do you feel to be in Houston?   
CLINT CAPELA:   I really wanted to go to play this season.   What did you say after?  
   
 Q.   How does it feel to be in Houston?   
CLINT CAPELA:   Really great because these are great players that I can learn with.  
   
 Q.   Have you ever been to Houston?   
CLINT CAPELA:   Yes, for my workout.  
   
 Q.   What's your impressions of the city?   
CLINT CAPELA:   I don't see much about the city because I come over there late night, and the day after I did my workout and I left.   So I don't see more.  
   
 Q.   Do you know anyone on the team?   Do you know anything about the team?   
CLINT CAPELA:   Yeah, James Harden, Dwight Howard, Patrick Beverly good, electric player.   Chandler Parsons did a really good job, too.   Terrence Jones.   So they're a really good team.   I appreciate this team.
