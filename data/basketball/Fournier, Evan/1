Q.   If you would give us remarks about being drafted by Denver. 
EVAN FOURNIER:   I'm just so happy right now.   It's amazing.   It's like a dream.   And I can't wait to go to Denver to meet my new teammates in the organization. 

Q.   Wanted to ask you, Denver has a lot of young talent, a lot of depth.   How are you looking forward to the challenge of being able to carve out some minutes for yourself? 
EVAN FOURNIER:   I'm just going to work hard.   That's the only way. 
But, you know, I think Denver is good for me, because the way they play, they run the floor a lot, and that's what I like. 

Q.   What about your game is a strength for American fans to see? 
EVAN FOURNIER:   I'm a slasher.   I'm a kind of Ginobili.   I can charge to the basket and finish around the rim.   I think that's my biggest strength. 

Q.   Are surprised at how the French election went and are you happy to be paid in dollars as opposed to Euros by working here in this country?
EVAN FOURNIER:   Yeah, of course, of course.   I'm happy to represent my country.   So, yeah, what can I say.   I'm just happy right now.
