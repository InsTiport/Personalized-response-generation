NEBRASKA   76
  IOWA - 61

Q.   Jordan, talk about the success against Iowa; what has been the key?
JORDAN HOOPER:   I think it's our preparation.   Our coach has done a great job of getting us ready for Iowa every single time.   I think it's kind of a pride, too, wanting to beat   Iowa, kind of a rivalry, right across the border and stuff like that. They are a lot of fun to play. 

Q.   For either of you guying, coming off the Penn State loss, how nice is it to get that loss out of the way? 
LINDSEY MOORE:   I think it's definitely key for us to come back and bounce back from that, and obviously, you know, I don't think we played as well as we could have, and so it's nice to come back and play well and shoot the ball well and pass the ball well. 

Q.   Jordan, what did you do special on Morgan Johnson? 
JORDAN HOOPER:   We didn't really change our game plan from last game.   Just played behind her and pushed off the ball a little bit. 

Q.   How critical was that stress going into halftime, it was an 8‑0 run?
COACH YORI:   Well, huge, you want to have momentum going into the half, and it was on our side.   And then we came out of half and did a lot of good things to extend the lead, as well.   I thought Rachel's shot at the top of the key, the half was a big one.   They are all big ones. 

Q.   You've beaten Iowa three times in the past few games‑‑ what's the secret to that? 
COACH YORI:   Well, there's no secret.   We respect Iowa.   We know they are a really good basketball team, got good players, well coached.   You know, we have played a lot of close games with them.   The last two have not been as close. 
You know, I don't know if there's any one thing I can identify other than, you know, we just know we have to play well.   But you have to do that really throughout the suspect.   It's fairly unusual to beat a team six times in a row as good as Iowa.   We obviously feel good about that. 
But we won in different ways, too.   Sometimes we won with defense and sometimes we won with offense.   So there's been a lot of different things that have happened in the games. 

Q.   Hailie and Katie both had a lot of offensive rebounds, and why is that, what's working so well for you? 
COACH YORI:   Go to the glass.   If there's a shot, go to the glass.   Emily is a really good offensive rebounder and we knew that today, they don't play Hailie, they leave Hailie.   But one thing you can do, if you get left is that you can get on the offensive glass and she did a good job of that. 

Q.   Emily didn't score much but her impact on the game was felt, six assists and the offensive rebounds, but how big of an impact did she make without even scoring?
COACH YORI:   That's Emily's game right there.   Emily is a really good all‑around player but doesn't always put up a lot of points.   She's a right‑side‑of‑the‑stat sheet kind of player.   She plays good defense and she's going to get you rebounds on both ends, she's a really tough competitor.   She doesn't get as much notoriety, or as many of the accolades as Williams and Jordan, but she's equally important. 

Q.   Three days and three games, how important is it to get your berth players going and get some energy going that don't normally see time in the game?
COACH YORI:   I thought the way the game played out is obviously advantageous for tomorrow.   Not only did we get some represents for some of our kids, but it gives some of the kids some confidence being on the floor. 
And it wasn't perfect the last six minutes, but they kind of sold out and tried to make every play.   But I thought Tear'a and Brandi getting eight points apiece and Hailie getting eight, that's big for us. 

Q.   Non‑game question, your second year in the Big Ten now, if you can comment on the rise of the RPI and the Big Ten's power as a conference?
COACH YORI:   I think first of all, you've got institutions that have made a commitment to women's basketball, and across the board, they have hired good coaches.   I think that's kind of where it starts.   You know, good coaches are not only going to coach well but they are going to recruit well, and it's improved. 
Again, I wasn't in the league three years ago, but we have some new blood in this league and we also have a lot of veterans, and it looks like right now there's a lot of stability of coaches across the board.   So that means that we're going to continue to get better because of that.
