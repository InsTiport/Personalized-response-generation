<p>	Q.  V.J., you wanted to come in and try to slow them down in transition.  Did you feel like you did a pretty good job of that throughout the ballgame? </p>
<p>	Q.  Veronica, do you feel you may have had them on their heals a little bit, a little panicking, wondering what was going on there? </p>
<p>	Q.  V.J., how long is it going to take you to get over this? </p>
<p>	Q.  Ever had a game where you had -- I don't know what the number of steals were, but --</p>
<p>	Q.  Yes. </p>
<p>	Q.  Was there something they were doing that made steals easier for you? </p>
<p>	Q.  What did you tell Anna in the locker room? </p>

<p>	Q.  Coach, I don't know if you had time before the game to envision what the final moments of your final game may be like, but was it anything close to this?</p>
<p>	Q.  I'm sure with people asking you questions about retiring and everything, it's been slowly sinking in.  When will this actually sink in, that it was your last game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Having had this kind of finish, are you having any second thoughts? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you let it soak in at all when you were walking off the court? </p>
<p>	Q.  Was this overall game about as well as you played? </p>
<p>	Q.  Was this maybe as good a coaching game day, coaching experience, that you've ever had? </p>
