STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: First off, my hat's off to Kevin.  Kevin is one of the best guys and best coaches in college basketball.  So he had a really good thing happen for him tonight.  So for that, I'm happy for Kevin.   
I've never had anything like that happen in a basketball game before.  It's unexplainable.  Unexplainable.   
 Q.  Coach, what happened with Markus' wrist?  What's the update with him?  How did that affect his game?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: He was fine.  He was well enough to play.  He banged his wrist.  There's a lot of guys that are banged up.  He's well enough to play.  Boy, he takes punishment, man.  He takes a lot of punishment.  We're going to just have to get him through with all the bumps and bruises he's endured, especially over the last few weeks.   
 Q.  Coach, what was the explanation they gave you for ejecting Sacar?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: He said it was his second technical.   
 Q.  What was unexplainable tonight?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: Did you watch the game?   
 Q.  Yeah, I just wanted to know why you felt it was unexplainable.  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: Just so many unusual things happened.  I don't know if I want to get into specifics.  It was the most unusual basketball game I've ever been a part of, and I feel bad for my kids.  They're in there, and they're sobbing.  I wish our kids would have had a chance to decide the game and their kids, too.   
 Q.  What did you think of the officiating?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: I don't judge officials.  That's for you guys to decide.   
 Q.  Coach, with everything that happened --  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: It's hard for me to keep track of everything that happened.  You're going to have to ask a more specific question.  So many things happened in that game.   
 Q.  With regards to the stoppages --  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: It was really tough for us not having our two best defenders in the game, Sacar and Theo.  Two of those guys are all-defensive level players.  It was hard for us, but I thought the other guys stepped up.  We put ourselves in a position to win.  We didn't make some plays that we are capable of making, and so down two guys, you know, and our two best defenders, our guys showed a lot of grit.  So that was good.  That was really, really good.   
 Q.  What would you say to your players and all the fans were disgusted the way that game ended, unfolded?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: We've got more basketball to play.  We're going to the NCAA Tournament.  We've got a chance to do some things.   
Hey, the game of basketball can be extraordinarily crazy.  We all were in the gym tonight for an extraordinarily crazy game, and hat's off to Seton Hall.  Best of luck to them in the championship.  We wish it was us, but it's not.  We're going to the NCAA Tournament.  We're going to the NCAA Tournament, and we're going to attack that.   
We're looking forward to having a breath of fresh air because we need it.  We need it.   
 Q.  Coach, you're going to the NCAA Tournament, you say.  How do you put this completely behind you?  And any concerns about Howard and the bruises and the bumps?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: No, he's going to be fine.  Markus is a hell of a player.  He's bumped and bruised.  He's been bumped and bruised all year.  He'll just be fine.  We've got to regroup and get better.  You know, usually in the NCAA, they get back to the initial points of emphasis.  So I think that will help Markus, too.   
 Q.  It looked like there was some words exchanged in the post-game handshake line.  Do you want to share anything that was said?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: No.
