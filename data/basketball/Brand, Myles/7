<p>	Q.  I know there was some movement at the NCAA convention to move in the direction of eliminating the five-and-eight rule in college basketball.  I wanted to know what your position was, what the progress of the elimination of that rule would be at this point. </p>
<p>	Q.  Has there been much talk about changing the way graduation rates are calculated, particularly since there are going to be these new rules about disincentives?</p>
<p>	Q.  Along those lines, how much does it hurt the NCAA and college sports when those current graduation rates are used, it was done during the bowl season, Sweet-16, based on a class of six years ago to, you know, say that current teams are either not doing their job or doing their job? </p>
<p>	Q.  In other words, will y'all continue to release the graduation rates as the way the government is, and also do the snapshot?  Are there going to be two ways of looking at graduation rates?  I'm not sure I understood exactly what you were saying. </p>
<p>	Q.  As you know, a couple years ago the Knight commission recommended that schools that failed to graduate 50% of their student athletes not be allowed to participate in post-season play.  My question is, as the NCAA moves forward to put specificity on what the lowest level is, acceptable level under the incentives, disincentives program, would you support a minimum graduate rate of 50%, and if not, what message is the NCAA sending if its minimally acceptable graduation rate is something less than 50%? </p>
<p>	Q.  If I can do a quick follow-up.  When you reference the urban commuter schools, the 30% rate, it's my understanding urban commuter schools have a lower rate because so many of the students attend part-time.  Obviously, your pool of athletes attend full-time.  Isn't that misleading to point to how part-time students graduate as some sort of reference for how full-time scholarship athletes ought to be graduating?</p>
<p>	Q.  With billion-dollar television contracts, do you feel like this event has gotten too commercial over the years? </p>
<p>	Q.  Considering that money that is generated, would you be in favor of perhaps some of that TV money paying for a stipend for athletes in some form or fashion? </p>
<p>	Q.  Why not? </p>
<p>	Q.  Back on academics for a second.  The whole problem is that coaches recruit athletes who can't or don't want to do the academic work at the institutions they happen to be at.  How are the incentives and disincentives packages going to address that problem?</p>
<p>	Q.  I didn't say all of them.  I said that's where the problems arise. </p>
<p>	Q.  Maybe I missed this, but I was curious, with some of these graduation rates, how you're going to change those, what kind of time frame are you looking at? </p>
<p>	Q.  It's been about a year now since we first heard about the changing in conference realignment.  Now we still have two or three conferences out there in limbo.  Is there anything you believe that your office could have done to have facilitated that, that we wouldn't have a year of lame duck conference membership coming up? </p>
<p>	Q.  This morning there's a column suggesting the NCAA needed to vacate Duke's title from 2001 because they used a player who was later found to have taken money from a former coach.  Can you address that. </p>

<p>	Q.  Mr. Price, is that 1999 you're talking about?  Maggette did not play on the 2001 team.  '99 was his one and only year. </p>
<p>	Q.  No.  '99 was the year he played, I'm pretty sure.  The. </p>
<p>	Q.  No, he didn't.  It was '99.  Check the facts. </p>
<p>	Q.  Next few weeks I believe the recruiting task force is going to make some recommendations.  Are there three, four things that you think absolutely have to be recommended?  How soon could they be in place?  Could they be in place for this coming fall? </p>
<p>	Q.  My question is about the emphasis on graduation rates, and that sort of thing, whether or not you're ever concerned that that emphasis might lead to either students themselves pursuing less than the optimal education that's available to them in order to protect eligibility, or the school perhaps emphasizing eligibility overeducation, for instance, a student who is interested and capable of majoring in engineering, choosing to major in communications because it might be easier? </p>
<p>	Q.  I used that for a good reason (laughter). </p>
<p>	Q.  The question is whether the incentive program and the emphasis on continuing eligibility would lead athletes to do less than they're capable of. </p>









<p>	Q.  I guess I'm going to pick on Mike Montgomery.  With different disincentives looming for graduation rates, forgive me for not knowing if Josh has actually graduated or not, but in general, should coaches shy away from the prospect that you look at and say, "He's not going to be here for four years, he's going to be an NBA lottery pick in four years"? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mr. Montgomery, it's an ethics question is why I'm asking you rather than a rules violation.  But given the final exam that was given at Georgia by Mr. Harrick, I'm wondering if you feel it's a conflict of interest for members of a coaching staff to teach courses for academic credit with their own players enrolled now that the NCAA is moving in a direction where the number of scholarships will depend quite likely on players' academic performances?  I'm wondering if you see any conflict there, and if so is that an issue that your group or committee plans to take up? </p>

<p>	Q.  The reason I'm asking about athletics is because we're here talking about athletics, and the NCAA is moving in a direction where the coach's job, his number of scholarships, therefore his ability to succeed at the job, is based on his students' academic performances.  It seems to me that raises some more issues. </p>

<p>	Q.  Mike and Kelvin, the incentive, disincentives, how much do y'all know about it?  Do you think it's going to improve things?  Obviously, there were some problems with the previous thing as far as graduation rates, how those were counted.  With over 320 schools, Mike, you have a different situation at Stanford, Kelvin has a different situation at Oklahoma, but they seem to be wanting to put it all in the same cookie cutter to try to have a way to measure academic performance.  What do y'all think about that? </p>


<p>	Q.  Jim or any of the coaches, one of the historic problems I think in dealing with the NCAA specifically as it deals with football and basketball is the one-size-rule-fits-all doesn't work, and there's been a lot of argument and debate about having sport-specific legislation, for example for basketball only.  I'm thinking last night they played the McDonald's All-American game, and not only was every NBA team there, every NBA team had a minimum of two people there, but there were no college coaches there because the rules prevent it.  To me, that speaks at a common sense problem, that you should be able to overcome. </p>
<p>	Q.  My point was not that they were there, but that you weren't.  Would you prefer the opportunity for college coaches to be in that same environment? </p>

<p>	Q.  Mike, your ethics committee, talking about the finding of lack of coach control, do you envision trying to propose penalties that would go with that finding?  Would that be left to the committee on infractions?  Regardless, personally what kind of ramifications do you think a finding like that should carry? </p>

<p>	Q.  With the incentives and disincentives package, to be simplistic, sometime in the near future your teams could lose scholarships, lose access to the tournament if your players aren't performing academically.  Is that fair or appropriate? </p>
