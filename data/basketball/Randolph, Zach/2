  ZACH RANDOLPH:   It's definitely good to be home.   We can practice on our home court, get to sleep in our own bed.  
   
 Q.   Is there a sense of angst, a sense of pressure?   What are you feeling?  
ZACH RANDOLPH:   We just had a good practice.   We know what we've got to do.   We've got to win the game tomorrow if we want to have a chance to win the series.   We've got to be ready and come and try to win tomorrow's game.  
   
 Q.   What's the biggest challenge playing against their front line?  
ZACH RANDOLPH:   Our guards got to be aggressive because they're double‑teaming us.   Every time I post‑up there's a man behind me and a man in front of me, so we've got to make them guard our other guys, the perimeter guys.   That's about us being aggressive and getting moving.  
   
 Q.   You missed some shots you don't miss right at the rim.   What did that come down to?  
ZACH RANDOLPH:   That rim's tight (laughing).   No, I'll just be confident.   I'll take that shot again tomorrow and hopefully it goes in.  
   
 Q.   Do you hold some responsibility for the team?  
ZACH RANDOLPH:   I definitely do.   I've been here, so I definitely do.   I want to win and I want to lead these guys and come out and play hard 48 minutes and give it 110 percent out here.  
   
 Q.   What can this crowd do for you tomorrow night?  
ZACH RANDOLPH:   We need them.   They've been big for us this whole Playoffs and throughout the entire season, feed off the energy, gets us going, so we're definitely going to need them.  
   
 Q.   Any worries that you put too much pressure on yourself out of the gate?  
ZACH RANDOLPH:   We can't worry about that.   We've just got to come in and relax, come in, let it come to us and play our game.
