   ZACH RANDOLPH: It's just a great feeling to be here with the elite players. 

 Q. You made a visit to South Africa a few years back. Do you realize how popular the game is on that continent and how it's growing there?
 ZACH RANDOLPH: Definitely. When I was there a couple years ago, it was growing then, so I know it's definitely growing now. It was a great experience. I want to go back. It was great, the kids, they enjoyed it. It was a lot of fun. 

 Q. Do you find it strange to be playing basketball in an NFL stadium? Have you done that before?
 ZACH RANDOLPH: No, it's going to be different.

 Q. One of the things about basketball is it's played in smaller arenas where the crowds are close by and it's pretty intense. Do you think you'll lose any of that with 90,000 people? 
 ZACH RANDOLPH: No, I don't think so. I don't think it's going to be a problem. There's going to be 90,000 people, it's going to be the largest crowd ever for a basketball game. I'm probably going to get some butterflies. It's going to be a once in a lifetime experience to play in this stadium.
