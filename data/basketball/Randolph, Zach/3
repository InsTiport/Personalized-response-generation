Q.   As you guys come back to Memphis trying to get resettled, encouraged by what happened going into overtime in Game 2 and now happy to be home?
ZACH RANDOLPH:   We're definitely happy to be home.   We're encouraged and a little disappointed.   We could have played better in the second game.   Now we're home, just like the first series, down 0‑2, got to hold serve, home court, and win these games to try to even things up.

Q.   So no pressure, right?
ZACH RANDOLPH:   No, there's no pressure.   We've just got to come out and do what we do.   I don't think we've been playing as good as we can individually and as a team, so we've just got to play better and be better.

Q.   What makes you believe that you guys can come back from 0‑2 for a second time in the Playoffs?
ZACH RANDOLPH:   Well, we've got to believe.   You have to believe.   You have to be confident.   We have to believe.   Game 2 we came all the way back and went to overtime, so we've got to have that confidence and believe in ourselves.

Q.   What is it that gives you confidence?
ZACH RANDOLPH:   Just knowing that we can play.   We can get up to a fast tempo, we can get in the game, we can make shots on the inside and make free throws.

Q.   Did you see something in the fourth quarter that adds to that confidence?
ZACH RANDOLPH:   Yeah, the way we came back, the way we put pressure on them in the game.   In overtime we missed some shots, they made some shots, just little mistakes here and there kept us out of the game.

Q.   Was it frustrating?
ZACH RANDOLPH:   It was frustrating.   When you miss shots that you usually make, it's frustrating.
