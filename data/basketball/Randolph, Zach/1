 Q.   Talk about the fatigue factor last night in the fourth quarter and overtime.   
ZACH RANDOLPH:   Man, it's the Playoffs.   Both teams are fatigued, especially going into overtime, working so hard for 48 minutes.   That's to be expected.  
   
 Q.   Is it their experience or depth that keeps them fresh?  
ZACH RANDOLPH:   I don't know.   You've got coach Pop doing a good job of rotating guys, bringing them in and guys making plays.   It's a combination of things.  
   
 Q.   What's your mentality now, the team's mentality?  
ZACH RANDOLPH:   We've just got to take this one game.   We've got to win a game.   It's not over with.   We've got to stay positive and just take one game at a time and come out tomorrow and try to get a victory.   
   
 Q.   After 90‑some odd games, what does it feel like to be staring at what could be your final game of the year?  
ZACH RANDOLPH:   I don't know.   I haven't looked at it like that.   I feel like we come in and get a win tomorrow and keep playing.   
   
 Q.   You guys have been down in a series but not this down.   Different mindset?  
ZACH RANDOLPH:   It's different.   Like you said, we ain't been down like this, 0‑3, so it's a different mindset.   It's now do or die.   We've got to come out tomorrow and come out like we came out last game and just sustain it and not break down towards the end of the game.  
   
 Q.   Are you confident that everybody is up to trying to fight this challenge?  
ZACH RANDOLPH:   Oh, yeah, everybody is going to fight.   I believe that's what we're going to do.   We're going to come out and play hard and give it the best we got.  
   
 Q.   Pride factor not to be swept on your home court?  
ZACH RANDOLPH:   Oh, there's definitely a lot of pride in this, at least to win here on our home court.
