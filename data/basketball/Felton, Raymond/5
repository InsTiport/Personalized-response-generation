<p>	Q.  Raymond, can you talk about, did you have to talk Coach Williams into letting you stay in after you got your second foul?  What did you see on that last steal when stole the ball from Luther? </p>
<p>	Q.  Sean, what was it about Illinois's defense that led you to have the game you had? </p>
<p>	Q.  When it got tight the middle of the second half, you went into Sean six straight possessions.  Were you under orders to do so or was that reading the situation?</p>
<p>	Q.  Sean, you said before that you'd like to win a championship to ease the criticism on Coach Williams.  What does it mean to you to finally do that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Sean, you ran off with the basketball in your hands like you wanted to keep it.  Who did you give it to?  Now that you're 21, do you think your father will allow you to toast with champagne? </p>
<p>	Q.  Who? </p>
<p>	Q.  You matched your father's 26 points in a final game and also matched his most outstanding player in a championship.  What does that mean to you what does that say? </p>

<p>	Q.  Sean, along those lines, I don't know if you've had a chance to talk to your dad yet.  If you have, what was that conversation like?  If you haven't, what do you think it's going to be like? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did your father say anything special to you before the game tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  You watched your dad's film a bunch of time.  Will you ever watch it again?  When you watch your own film, what particular parts will you keep playing back over and over again? </p>
<p>	Q.  Raymond, yesterday you talked about it makes you mad when people say you guys are talented and not a team.  What does tonight's championship say?  What does it mean to you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Ray, kind of relive those last few minutes for us.  You hit a big three, you make the steal, get a big rebound.  If you could just talk about the tenseness of the situation, the kind of things that went through your mind down the stretch. </p>
<p>	Q.  What were your thoughts when Illinois tied the score at 70-70? </p>


<p>	Q.  Coach, you're up three with 25 seconds left, 30-second timeout, did you consider at all giving their propensity for the three-point shot, did you consider fouling in that situation?  What went through your mind in that timeout? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned this being a team victory rather than a talent victory.  You held them without a score for the last 2:37.  Does that kind of illustrate your point? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did Raymond have to talk you into keeping him in after the second foul?  Did you think about taking him out?  I assume the zone was at least in part to protect him. </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked in the past about how painful it was to kind of watch from afar a few years ago when this program slipped so far from the status it enjoyed for so long.  What does winning this national championship mean, not just for this team but for North Carolina basketball? </p>
<p>	Q.  I know you haven't had a lot of time to think, but does winning tonight make you feel better or more comfortable about your decision to leave Kansas? </p>
<p>	Q.  Two years ago you had a really hard loss and a really hard decision to make.  Can you talk about how difficult the last two years of your life have been, how much travel you've had, and what the end of it is like. </p>
<p>	Q.  40 out of their 70 shots tonight were three-point attempts.  They only got to the line six times.  Can you talk about why you guys were so effective keeping them from penetrating, getting into the paint?</p>
<p>	Q.  After the way your team played defense in the first half, when Illinois started to explode offensively in the second, how much did that worry you about your team's performance? </p>
<p>	Q.  What was your first emotion as the final seconds ticked off you and knew you won?  Did Coach Smith say anything to you in the locker room? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Smith. </p>
<p>	Q.  Does winning a national championship feel as good or maybe even better than you anticipated?  Do you feel like there is a load off your shoulders now? </p>
<p>	Q.  While your players were still celebrating on the podium, you went into the bleachers with your family.  Could you describe the moment. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you know, how does it feel to have a national championship underneath your belt? </p>
<p>	Q.  Yes. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you've been in Coach Weber's shoes before.  Your thoughts on the year he's been through, what he's done, what he's been able to accomplish. </p>
<p>	Q.  Interested in your reaction, your national association of basketball college colleagues were pretty much unanimous, quoted in the media, saying they were pulling for you, people like Jim Boeheim and others were really pulling for you to win a national championship.  You got to feel awfully good that you have such a wide amount of respect amongst your colleagues. </p>
<p>	Q.  Your high school coach, Buddy Baldwin, was crying tears of joy after the game.  Can you tell me what that means for you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Like you said a couple times tonight, a pretty emotional guy, we've seen you shedding tears on the podium.  You managed to hold it in tonight after such a momentous occasion.  How is that?</p>
<p>	Q.  No one works harder at recruiting than you do in terms of your travel.  I understand working personally on the top two or three recruits yourself.  Have you had time before the game or now to think about the irony of how hard you worked to construct your team in your image at Kansas, but then you win it now with a team, besides Marvin, that you basically inherited?  Do you see irony in that? </p>
