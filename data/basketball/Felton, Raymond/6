<p>	Q.  Last year, did you come close to losing your voice or mind when you were trying to get your point across to these guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  Sean, I know you've probably talked about this a lot, but I understand you have a tape of your dad winning the championship.  How long did you have the tape?  Have you carried it around with you?  Have you shown it to your teammates yet? </p>
<p>	Q.  Sean, have you given any thought to what you'd like for your 21st birthday tomorrow? </p>
<p>	Q.  Roy and any one of the players, can you think back to last year's meeting with Illinois, could you have imagined that both your teams would have changed so much and gotten to this point? </p>

<p>	Q.  Sean, the last two years, all the things that the program has gone through, you thought about moving on, things were difficult.  Have you had an opportunity to think about that?  While your expectations before the season were to win the national championship, how amazing is it that you actually have this opportunity with what's gone on the last two years? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jawad, can you talk about last year's game, how is this team different now this year than you were a year ago?  Where do you think you've grown? </p>

<p>	Q.  Could you talk about turning your practice facility into the pit, turning up the heat, taking off the rims, and how effective you think it was? </p>
<p>	Q.  Raymond and Sean, can you talk about before Coach Williams came to North Carolina, did you pay much attention to him?  Did you know what he was doing at Kansas, how he coached?  Can you talk about your impressions of him when he was at Kansas and how it changed if at all after you got to know him as your coach? </p>

<p>	Q.  Rashad, can you kind of break down the guard match-ups here, how you guys can guard a guy who is so fast like Dee Brown and then a guy like Deron Williams who just seems to have really the complete package? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Weber was talking about the number of players he thought could have moved on to the NBA among teams in the Sweet-16, how good a year it was for college basketball.  Why do you think that is happening?  What do you think it means for college basketball? </p>

<p>	Q.  People talk about the names McCants, May, the various Williams, where does Raymond Felton fit in this mix?  With all the names and big star players on this team, where does Raymond Felton fit into this mix? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much of a factor is it going to be to have Jawad back at full strength as he seemed to be yesterday?  Illinois players talk about how they have fun playing defense.  Is that going to make this game a different kind of game than what you've played in the tournament? </p>
<p>	Q.  Maybe Jackie's perspective, then coach's, when coach first took over, do you think he did some things to make it easier on you, adjusting to a new coach, or did he just make you guys, "Hey, this is my system, this is how it's going to be, you have to do it"?  If coach could address the same question. </p>

<p>	Q.  Rashad, how much did Williams guard you in any of the previous match-ups?  What are your impressions of him as a defender? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much did Williams guard you in either of the previous match-ups and what are your impressions of him as a defender? </p>

<p>	Q.  What first gets your attention about the way Illinois plays?  What intrigues you about them? </p>
<p>	Q.  Sean and Raymond, your coach just talked about Illinois being a team.  They're kind of saying that you're the talent, and they're the team.  That's how they're approaching the match-up.  Your thoughts on that? </p>

<p>	Q.  Jackie and Jawad, can you just describe your thoughts and emotions sitting here today as you prepare to play for the national championship when four years ago your world was upside down after a season you never imagined in your dreams. </p>

<p>	Q.  You talked about reemphasizing defense last week in practice.  I'm wondering in yesterday's game, where do you think that work paid off?  How do you think you were a little better defensively yesterday than maybe last week? </p>

<p>	Q.  What was your toughest season in coaching?  How did you work through it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Roy, in the mid '90s, college basketball seemed to get sort of stodgy in style of play, not very quick.  You're one of the coaches who got rid of that, playing faster.  Where did that come from? </p>
<p>	Q.  What is your relationship like with McCants?  How has that developed over the two years?  Is the perception -- is it a fair perception that many of the fans have of him and the media? </p>

<p>	Q.  Sean, can James Augustine or Roger Powell guard you one-on-one? </p>

<p>	Q.  Coach, I was wondering if you could talk about, when you first got to started working with Sean, what was the first step in his development or the first priority you had when it came to coaching him and making him a better player? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you came to North Carolina a couple years ago, was there ever any doubt in your mind you could get this program to this point sooner or later? </p>
<p>	Q.  Marvin, could you talk a little bit about how this amazing transition, going from high school to now suddenly both the talent level of the Final Four and the lights, cameras?  Coach Williams, generally just starters up there.  Why did you or someone feel it's important that Marvin deserves to be up there today? </p>

<p>	Q.  Marvin, as a freshman coming in, did it take you a while to figure out assessing this group, which player really truly was in charge and had the respect of the group the most?  What is your feeling today?  Is there one leader today or are there several leaders of this team? </p>

<p>	Q.  You said that you didn't want the kids staying through this too much because they obviously haven't seen a scouting report.  Can you talk about how you guard the three fantastic guards that Illinois has, match-ups, if you care to share them?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you thought about --</p>
<p>	Q.  -- how the dominos have fallen, and it's the first time since '75 that the 1 and 2 are meeting? </p>
<p>	Q.  What about the coaching shuffle, had you not left?</p>
<p>	Q.  To what extent at any time do you believe in pedigree, and specifically now with Sean being the son of Scott, who was such an efficient player and non-flamboyant players?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know you've said you're going to be on the first tee Tuesday win or lose.  When you watch Phil Mickelson at The Masters, do you pull for the guys who are in a position that you seem to have been in, who have tried for a long time and finally succeeded? </p>
<p>	Q.  You have two teams here that are very balanced.  Two teams ranked nationally in assists who play very hard.  Is there a message from this game, a statement on the value of playing the game a certain way?  Is tomorrow night good for college basketball? </p>
<p>	Q.  Has the game evolved defensively to where you can shut down, if a team has two good scorers averaging in the 20s, you can take those guys out, the teams tomorrow night do have all five starters in double figures? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you realize or sympathize or care if you win tomorrow night in some small way it puts more pressure on Bill Self? </p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously you had other things going on in 2001/2002.  As an alum, what were your emotions about what was going on as that season was unfolding in Chapel Hill?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is a country where college sports generates great passion and labels.  For years and years, Notre Dame football was the franchise.  For a long period of time, Carolina was the franchise.  Do you feel that you can get back to that point?  Is there a feeling in that state, other than in Durham, that a lot of people are almost clawing for you to get back to that point? </p>
<p>	Q.  Saturday Richard and Roger Powell of Illinois stepped up big, guys that normally wouldn't be the second or third or fourth option.  Can you talk about that.  They're both seniors on junior-dominated teams.  Do they have similar roles, do you think? </p>
<p>	Q.  After everything that's been written for the last few years of the game was down, not up to the standards of the past, does this match-up have a chance to stand with the '82 game, Larry-Magic? </p>
<p>	Q.  Bill Self has kind of made it clear that he would have preferred for you not to have any contact with your former Kansas players.  Do you feel in any way that was unfair to Bill or interfered with his ability to communicate with his team?  How do you respond to the people that are saying this is talent versus team?  How does that make you feel?</p>
<p>	Q.  Team versus talent. </p>
<p>	Q.  Last few days, Bruce Weber has talked a lot about his early struggles in coaching, getting that first job.  Could you reflect on that first year as an assistant for you in '78.  I know you did a lot of things other than coaching to make some money.  How did the first job come about?  Do you remember the specific call? </p>
<p>	Q.  I meant the first job as an assistant at North Carolina. </p>
<p>	Q.  In what area or areas has this team matured the most over the last two years, and how important has that been to getting you here?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned you served as a reference for Weber.  I was wondering, you mentioned you called coaches when they're having a difficult time.  Six, seven games into his tenure with Illinois, some people wanted to run him out of town.  Did you call him?  What do you like about him?  Why do you think he's been a good coach, assuming you think that?  Just your relationship with him. </p>
<p>	Q.  What do you think makes him an effective coach?  He has a different personal style.</p>
<p>	Q.  Raymond and you both kind of refuted or were offended by the suggestion that it's not a team compared to Illinois.  Is there anything they do that sometimes suggests to you that maybe it could be a better team?  Last night you mentioned going for loose balls in the first half. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Weber mentioned he saved a couple of emails, nasty ones, he got last year, for motivation.  People thought he should have been run out of town.  You have a great reputation as a coach.  Do you still get that kind of mail, calls? </p>
<p>	Q.  If you don't know, do you consider yourself old? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked all around this now, this talent/team thing.  The year started out, you had a couple guys on the team that were going to be NBA players.  Now we're up to like nine. </p>
<p>	Q.  It's out of control. </p>
<p>	Q.  Apparently so.  You could have put a stop to it by saying that people are going too far.  It's built and built and built.  Do you walk a thin line there?  Do you want to be able to say, "No, we don't have players that are that good," you know what I'm saying?</p>
<p>	Q.  With all the troubles and the controversy surrounding how the college football selects the national champion.  How do you feel about the system of college basketball?  Do you think maybe not just this season but in seasons past, is the team that wins the NCAA tournament the best team in college basketball for that year? </p>
<p>	Q.  Are you complimented or insulted by the title "Best Coach Never to Win a National Title"?  Also, considering your situation, why wouldn't you root for the Red Sox or Phil Mickelson? </p>
<p>	Q.  College basketball is pretty much an imported sport into North Carolina.  The five guys who have won national championships from the state of North Carolina aren't from there.  Can you put into perspective, if it means anything to you, from your home state, leading them to a national championship, what that means?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jay Price from the Illinois staff is a guy that used to be on your managerial staff at Kansas.  Can you talk about what he was like back in those days? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think there's a bias against talent?  "If you're talented, you probably don't work hard.  If you're strong, you're probably not as smart."  Have you seen that, or do you think not?</p>
<p>	Q.  There are guys who win this the first time they get here.  Is there something to kind of learning from previous situations, things that you know now about dealing with this situation that maybe you didn't know in '91 or even two years ago? </p>
