 Q. Any goals for next year, for offseason? 
 ERIC GORDON: Well, probably try to be more of a point guard and just learn more of that routine and I have been doing a lot better of it this year and just get better, playing hard each possession.

 Q. What's it like playing in L.A. with a team that doesn't have exactly a winning tradition?
 ERIC GORDON: Yeah, it is tough. This is definitely a first time for me. 
 It will be tough for anybody to go through with this many losses early in the year, but you just got to keep on playing every night.
