		  (No. 7 Overall Selection, L.A. Clippers)

 Q. Eric, you and O.J. and Russ were all in the top seven, and all kind of have had combo guard game. How do you see that fitting into the league as the play has developed over the last few years? 
 ERIC GORDON: I would say that's a great situation for us. Some teams need point guards and some teams need shooting guards and just play whatever position the coach has us assigned to. 

 Q. You certainly have the L.A. look tonight; from a business point of view, how important is it to be in a big market, someone like yourself, successful athlete, with the endorsement opportunities that are available to you, is that on your mind?
 ERIC GORDON: Not really. I'm just glad to be drafted here today to the L.A. Clippers. Better weather than Indiana, and just overall I thought it would be a great situation. 

 Q. Bad traffic, though. 
 ERIC GORDON: Yeah, you've got to get used to it, though. 

 Q. A lot of people like to compare where your game to Ben Gordon but he's yet to be a starter in the league, so how do you feel about that?
 ERIC GORDON: Well, it just depends on your situation. There's a lot of guys who played that position that are All-Stars. 
 I mean, just because I pattern my game after his doesn't mean that I might not be an All-Star in the future.

 Q. What do you see as the best strengths of the fact that you can be a swing man and sort of play either one of those two positions; and specifically, in your offensive game?
 ERIC GORDON: I think being able to play point guard and shooting guard, I think I'm strong enough on power guys that are either 1s or 2s in the league, and obviously the scoring part of it, I think I can take over.
