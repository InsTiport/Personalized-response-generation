 THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Wofford. Coach, if you want to begin with some opening remarks.   
 COACH YOUNG: Congratulate a very fine Brigham Young team. They were just a little bit better than we were tonight unfortunately.   
 Had you told me before the game, I thought we'd do a great job, our team would do a great job on Fredette. They did 10 of 25 from the field, 2 of 9 from three. I thought we would have won the game.   
 I thought we did a terrific job on him. He's going to score. He is such a good player. So much of their offense is geared to his talents.   
 But couldn't be prouder of our team. These three guys have meant the world to our program and our school and our community. They fought. They fought till the bitter end, as they have for a long time now.   
 THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions to the student-athletes.   
  
  Q. Jamar, what are your thoughts on guarding Jimmer this evening?   
 JAMAR DIGGS: He's a great player, great scorer. I mean, you can see his numbers put up. Up for national Player of the Year. Felt like we did a decent job on him, but not good enough. Guarding him, probably one of the toughest guys I guarded in my career. But he's a pretty good scorer.   
  
  Q. Jamar, what was it that made him tough? You blocked his shot a couple of times.   
 JAMAR DIGGS: I think he's really deceptive, deceptively quick. You look at him, you think you're in front of him, he's by you. It's not just me individually guarding him. It's my team communicating. We have a game plan, force him this way, do this, expecting help. He's really quick, unlimited range. You got to get out there so he can get by. It's a tough matchup.   
  
  Q. Noah, they caught you in a cold shooting spell in the second half. Shot selection or tired legs?   
 NOAH DAHLMAN: Just one of those nights when the shots weren't falling. We've had nights like that all year. Unfortunately shots don't go your way. It's a bad time for it to happen, but at the same time you just got to keep playing through it.   
 Down the stretch, missed some shots that would have changed the momentum of the game. But unfortunately didn't fall our way this time.   
 Just got to smile. It's the game of basketball, you know. It's the game of basketball.   
  
  Q. Do you think elevation had anything to do? You looked slower in the second half.   
 TIM JOHNSON: No. There's really no excuse. Sometimes on the road you have to deal with adverse conditions. I'm not going to say that I didn't feel myself a little winded because of the elevation. But at the same time I caught my second wind, as did the rest of my teammates. We still had a chance to win going into the half down four.   
 So, I mean, it was a minimal factor, if any.   
 THE MODERATOR: Anybody else want to comment on that?   
 COACH YOUNG: Didn't bother me at all (smiling).   
 THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes and continue with questions for Coach Young.   
  
  Q. Magnusson hit a couple threes for them. Playing the odds there or poor defense?   
 COACH YOUNG: Was it Magnusson? I think it was Magnusson? 27% going into the game, right? Isn't that right?   
 We're going to take our chances with it. Probably stayed on Jimmer a bounce too long there. We're going to X the bigs, but we didn't want to string ourselves out. We started Xing to Magnussen. I mean, that's the game. That's the game.   
 Yeah, we were playing the odds. That doesn't always work in your favor. Those will be decisions and maneuvers that I'll wrestle with for quite a while. I think Hartsock was the other that got two down. Those, you know, came off the same thing.   
 You know, they have a very good team. They have other very good players. Jackson Emery is really good, as are Hartsock and Abouo and so on.   
 Hate to walk out of here having given up four threes from their two bigs. But we felt like we had to. We felt like we had to with such a great player in Fredette.   
  
  Q. Talk about BYU's defense a little bit. Pretty low field goal percentage for you guys and for them as well. How much of that might have been their defense and how much might have been the shots not going down?   
 COACH YOUNG: I think a combination of the two. Have some friends in this league. You know, had a couple say, Hey, listen, Fredette, Fredette, Fredette, guarding Emery, so forth, you better have a handle on how you're going to get shots longer, more athletic zone than you may believe on film.   
 They were pretty good defensively. We had a difficult time. We had very few dead possessions, dead possessions in a shot late in a clock. I attribute that, you know, to their defense.   
 But, you know, you can go back and we had some great cracks at it. From the guys, we weren't shooting it. We just didn't get it in the basket on this particular day.   
  
  Q. Tim Johnson grabbed his 1000th rebound in this game. What kind of contribution does he mean for your team?  
 COACH YOUNG: He's really smart, he's articulate. He's been fabulous for us. He's got such great timing. He's a tough-nosed guy. We'll look back here a month from now, 10 years from now, he had every bit as much to do with where our program has gone over the last four years as anybody.   
 One of the finest people we've had, as well. Just a super, super individual, as well as a player for our team.   
 Good question. Thanks.   
  
  Q. Denver has been upset city in the afternoon. Did your guys recognize that? Did you think they were going to feed on that?  
 COACH YOUNG: Talked about it before we walked out. Magic in this building. There's magic in this building. Going in at the half down four, hadn't played very well. We were down four in our league championship game to College of Charleston. They played us majority of man with the exception of their OB under, which they always play zone. But we had the ball where we wanted it. We were getting great cracks at it.   
 Had seven first-half turnovers, which is out of character for us. 13 is a high number for us. A couple of ugly ones. But as they always do, I mean, they're playing their tails off. It just didn't work out.   
 THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.   
 COACH YOUNG: Thanks, guys.
