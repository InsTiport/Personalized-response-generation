Q. If you could start out with opening remarks about your style of play and what you'll bring to the Kings.
KJ MARTIN:   Right, so starting off I have the 3-and-D role, getting it done on defense 1 through 5. Whatever Coach needs me to do, whatever my teammates need me to do, I'm going to try to get it done for them.
On the offensive end, I'm going to be able to stretch the floor and create for my teammates without exactly having the ball in my hands. So just taking stress off the team, pretty much, and being the Energizer Bunny and doing what it takes to win.
