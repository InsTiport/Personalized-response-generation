 Q.  How disappointing is it not to be able to participate in the game because of your injury? 
 YAO MING:  Yeah, but the reason I came here is because a lot of fans voted for me and I come here to appreciate them. 
 But I'm more focused on the rest of the season and the playoffs.  That's very important for us. 

 Q.  How was your conditioning? 
 YAO MING:  Horrible now, but I'm working on it. 

 Q.  When do you think you'll be back? 
 YAO MING:  I would say in about two weeks. 

 Q.  How are you feeling now? 
 YAO MING:  Of course I need to work on my conditioning, having missed eight weeks.  I am totally out of shape.  So I'm doing a lot of work to get my conditioning and strength back. 

 Q.  What are you doing now? 
 YAO MING:  Full workouts, but with no contact. 

 Q.  When are you going to start with full contact? 
 YAO MING:  That depends on the doctors. 

 Q.  The fact that you received so many votes, is that really the most important part of making an All-Star team, to know that you have the love of the fans? 
 YAO MING:  An All-Star team is about giving the fans the kind of team that they want to look at.  I think that's what All-Star means.  So I'm very appreciative and very honored.
