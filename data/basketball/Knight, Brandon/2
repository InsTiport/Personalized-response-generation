 Q.   What do you think about your team in the second half?  
BRANDON KNIGHT:   We just need to come out every single game and make it count and see where we fall after that.   And just get 110 percent effort.   Every game we want to make it count.   And just trying to continue to work on our principles and finish the season strong.  
  
 Q.   Is All‑Star break also a time for reflection?   Can you look back at some of the games that got away that you could have won?   Is it a time for reflection for you?  
BRANDON KNIGHT:   I think you reflect right after the game.   Not sitting here at the All‑Star break thinking about all the games we lost, but thinking about how to be positive and move forward.  
  
 Q.   Could you tell us a little bit about the transition to the NBA game.   
BRANDON KNIGHT:   It's a faster paced game.   The guys here are a lot more talented and they're also very smart.  
  
 Q.   As a point guard how is it to control the tempo in there?  
BRANDON KNIGHT:   You've got to see how the flow of the game is going and who you're playing against, all that stuff.
