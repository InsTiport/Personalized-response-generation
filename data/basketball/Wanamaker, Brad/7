 THE MODERATOR: Coach Jamie Dixon. We also have Jermaine Dixon and Brad Wanamaker.   
 COACH JAMIE DIXON: All right. You know, obviously we're disappointed in the loss. It's a close game that came down to the last possessions. And we just didn't get it done. They seemed to make shots at the end of the clock and they executed well. And we need to do a better job.   
 To their credit, they're playing well. We're playing well. And that's why you saw a game that came down to the final possessions. You know, we'll get better for it I think. I think we have a couple of days to prepare. We'll get ready and find out who we play Sunday. That's why I told the guys afterwards this is disappointing. But as we know, we need to be ready for Sunday. And that's the most important thing at this point right now.   
 So congratulations to them. I was happy with how we played. We played hard. We really committed this week. We really got after it and I thought we got better because of it. But the end of the day, we just got to shoot better. We've got to play better. And we had plenty of opportunities to take the lead. And we just couldn't get over that hump. So I'm very proud of how our guys played. I thought we really worked hard. We really focused and came out and did some very good things. But just came up short.   
  
  Q. Coach Dixon, talk about how gratifying this season has been surpassing everyone's expectations.   
 COACH JAMIE DIXON: It's not gratifying right now. For us it's disappointing. Every loss for us in our program has always been a disappointment. Right now we don't feel good. I'll speak for myself. I don't feel good. But I'm very happy with our effort and what we did. These kids have given everything they can. And they've been called young, inexperienced all year, but they haven't played like it. I think this will be a good learning lesson for us today. I think this is something we can get better for.   
  
  Q. Jermaine, they were able to switch off of you guys defensively. Talk about how they did that. Were they utilizing screens or how were they doing that?   
 JERMAINE DIXON: Well, like you said, they were switching. We kind of picked it up late. And, you know -- I don't know what to say about that. They were switching and they did a good job at it. Still, I think we got some good looks. We just missed a couple of shots we usually knock down.   
  
  Q. Coach, and this is probably really for all three of you: How frustrating is it for you playing against that style of play from Notre Dame?   
 COACH JAMIE DIXON: I mean, I don't call it frustrating. You have to be prepared and understand what they're doing. You know it's going to be low scoring. You know it's going to be a low-possession game. You know it's going to be close game. It was those few possessions. There's not going to be any real separation. It kind of went as you might expect. You know, we're in a position to win the game. So I don't say we were frustrated at all.   
  
  Q. Guys, could you respond to that? Is it difficult adapting to that style of play?   
 BRAD WANAMAKER: I wouldn't say it's difficult. It's something we have to adjust to. I think we did a good job. Like Jermaine said, we missed some lay-ups we should have made.   
 JERMAINE DIXON: I feel the same way. I think we did a pretty good job at attacking them and getting -- driving kickouts or drive to the lane, and feeding our big men. Even going up to try to finish. We just didn't make shots that we usually make.   
  
  Q. Coach, two years off the double bye, what effect do you think that has on your squad when you get out there?   
 COACH JAMIE DIXON: I mean, we have to get ready. The league is so good. The teams are so good. I think usually when you get a double bye you think in most situations you're going to get a team that's a big difference in those situations. In this league, that's not the case. You're playing a team -- we're playing Notre Dame. Everybody is talking about how well they're playing. It's just who you get and where they finish. It's such a long year, guys are going to be playing better in January than other teams. And then at the end, the team -- so a double bye had nothing to do with it. It's just a team that's playing well against another team that's playing very well. Probably the teams with the best records down the stretch are playing together in the quarterfinal game. And that's really what you had.   
 So I think we won eight of our last nine. They won their last four. Those two teams playing in the quarterfinals. It speaks to our league.   
 THE MODERATOR: Pitt, thank you.
