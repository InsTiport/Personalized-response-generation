Q.   Is there one dunk contest that stands out to you? 
ZACH LaVINE:   I just remember Michael Jordan went baseline.   I used to watch Michael Jordan tapes when I was younger, VCR, and he did like a windmill on the sideline.   You didn't really notice how good it was, how graceful it was until you slowed it down.   His head spun around, his feet kicking around.   Only one person could do that.   He's probably the only person that can do that. 

Q.   How about any teammates in this contest, perhaps fellow rookie Andrew Wiggins? 
ZACH LaVINE:   I might be able to hit that.   I don't know what dunk I'm going to do yet.   I don't know yet. 

Q.   One quick question about your teammate:   There seems to be a big difference in the last few months in the way he's played.   Did you notice that?   What do you think has been the switch for him? 
ZACH LaVINE:   He's got a lot more aggressive.   Dude like that has so much potential.   (Inaudible) it's not up to him to do that.   He's been playing really well.   Hopefully he can continue that. 

Q.   Overall how tough have the losses been for this team?   And how have you been able to focus on growing since you guys are so young? 
ZACH LaVINE:   It's been tough, but at the same time, we know we have to look at it day by day getting better.   I feel like now with everybody back we're getting a lot better.   We're looking forward to the rest of the season.
