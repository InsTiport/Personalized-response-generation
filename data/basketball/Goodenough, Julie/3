<p>	Q.  Nina, Nebraska was talking about how they felt like they played you guys differently defensively.  That was a big difference.  Can you address that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Nina, you guys didn't shoot real well in the first half, but you were tied, come out even colder in the second half.  Can you talk what happened the first 10 minutes of the second half? </p>
<p>	Q.  Nina, can you talk about the progress that you feel like y'all made as a team this year even though the wins may not show it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Taleesha, have you paid much attention to all the speculation about the future of the program?  Has that been a bother or a hindrance to you guys as players? </p>

<p>	Q.  What do you think your future is at Oklahoma State? </p>
<p>	Q.  In practice yesterday y'all talked a lot about slowing down Kiera Hardy.  Do you feel you did a good job of that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Speaking about the future of the program, your lead by a freshman in scoring tonight.  Do you feel like you have some things for next year? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about how difficult it is in three years to keep hitting your head against a wall in a conference like this, maybe how tough the expectations are for somebody to come in and get something done when it is so hard. </p>
