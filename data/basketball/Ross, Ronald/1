<p>	Q.  Was that a little bit of payback for what they did to you all in Lubbock?</p>

<p>	Q.  What was the difference in this game than a week ago?</p>
<p>	Q.  What is the key in defending their guards? </p>
<p>	Q.  What was the biggest point of emphasis at half-time?  Was it them crashing the boards and getting 10 offensive rebounds or what did you talk about mainly at half-time?</p>
<p>	Q.  How big was the contribution by Damir today especially with Darrel getting in foul trouble?</p>
<p>	Q.  You barely took a shot in the first ten minutes of the game.  Were you having trouble getting into the flow or were they defending you well; what changed that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Everett ended up with some pretty good numbers.  It seemed like you made him work for his points.  What was the approach going into the game against him?</p>
<p>	Q.  It's been a while for you guys, nice to win back-to-back games? </p>

<p>	Q.  You guys were picked 7th or worse in the conference here, you are in the finals.  Why do you think the people including the writers tend to underrate you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Considering you guys don't play a lot of people, will you have enough energy for a third game tomorrow?</p>

<p>	Q.  You guys seemed to play a lot faster, pushed the ball up more in transition the second half.  Was that by design or is that just something your guards felt?</p>
<p>	Q.  Oklahoma had 10 offensive boards the first half and only two in the second.  Was rebounding a real point of emphasis at half-time?</p>
