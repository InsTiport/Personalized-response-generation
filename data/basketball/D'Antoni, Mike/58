<p>	Q.  Any strategy change for this game?  Looking at this differently than I do in the past?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do the Spurs match up better talentwise than any other team you have faced?</p>
<p>	Q.  Joe Johnson is not going to go today.  Is more of a discomfort with conditioning?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you ruled JJ out on Tuesday?</p>
<p>	Q.  Long way off you are going to have between Games 2 and 3?</p>
<p>	Q.  What did you try and take away from the Spurs?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you take anything away from your experience in San Antonio to your experiences now?</p>
<p>	Q.  When a player gets on a roll like Steve Nash has been coming out of that last series, do you just kind of play it out assume it's going to keep going for a while?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is this quick turnaround a good thing or bad thing?</p>
<p>	Q.  How important is it Quentin to have a good game today to get back in the flow offensively?</p>
<p>	Q.  Your team, conventional wisdom all the time you are supposed to wear down because of a short rotation; not supposed to be able to bring your style of play.  Is that over with now or --</p>
<p>	Q.  Since Mike mentioned you weren't a writer, why do you think that was always mentioned about Nash and Dallas?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have to win a Championship before you persuade everybody?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would you argue with this style you can actually be fresher later in the year because you don't have the bump and grind?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is it possible to hold you guys under 100 points?</p>
