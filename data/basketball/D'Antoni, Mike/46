<p>	Q.  Do you think a team like the Spurs that plays defense could have success -- no (laughter). </p>
<p>	Q.  It's been a couple days now where your team has been compared to the Red Sox and all these miracles.  They are back home and Joe Johnson is back.  We're not tired from the last series anymore.  How do you get it out of their head coming into this game, or do you have to that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just talk when you see Amare (Stoudemire) doing this at this age, just what goes through your mind and what do you think about for the future?</p>
<p>	Q.  Since Game 2 you have had Amare (Stoudemire) guarding Tim Duncan, is that high risk?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you said anything to him about staying out of foul trouble?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about obviously it's obvious that you need to have a good quick start.  Talk about how important it is that first quarter not having to play catchup like you did the first 3 games?</p>
<p>	Q.  In all seriousness, do you have some sort of medication you are using for your voice?  What would you do if you lost your voice during the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talking about the importance of winning the first quarter, San Antonio but at the end of the half, they hit you with an 8-0 run.  Was that a little discouraging to you?</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you expect defensively, they have got -- they have been able to have Bowen and Shawn Marion quite a bit --</p>
<p>	Q.  The last game -- I'd like to ask the question.  Then I will help you with it, if you'd like?  What do you expect to see from those two key players?</p>
<p>	Q.  First three games you said you were trying to pack the lane more than you did, you had more success in it in Game 4.  Why at that point even though you were trying?</p>
