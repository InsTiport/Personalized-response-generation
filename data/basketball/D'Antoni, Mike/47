<p>	Q.  You packed your defense back in tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much would you say Tim Duncan's performance was affected by your double team and defense?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about Amare's (Stoudemire) block down there at the end and just his play down the stretch?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you say anything special to your team?  Did they just all step up?</p>
<p>	Q.  In the first quarter you guys had struggled last couple of games.  You talked earlier about having to get off to a good start in the first quarter.  How much of your good performance would you credit your defense for?</p>
<p>	Q.  You had to be scratching your head a little at Marion's lethargic first half.  Looked more like himself second?</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys seemed to get a lot more open looks at the 3 point line than you did in the first 3 games.  Have you been happy with the shots in the first 3 games?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much do you think your team grew up tonight?</p>
