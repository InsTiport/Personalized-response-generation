<p>	Q.  For those who didn't go to shoot around give us an update Joe (Johnson)?</p>
<p>	Q.  What is the mindset today after losing Game 1?  Are they putting more pressure, need to get the win before they go on the road, it's the same?</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys look to anything to try to get Quentin Richardson off just maybe Steve Nash, perhaps that he would try to find him in certain places just maybe to move their defense around?</p>
<p>	Q.  Anybody talk to Leandro (Barbosa) last 24 hours about slowing down, about four times in the first game kind of lost the ball -- you want him to play aggressively but under control?</p>
<p>	Q.  How would you describe the way Robert Horry has been year after year, Playoff series after Playoff series, kind of attention the teams he plays for?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talk about Tony Parker just especially with Joe (Johnson) not here just how much you can put Steve Nash on him, how often you have to put other guys and just what he does as quick as he is going one end to the other, what it does to you?</p>
<p>	Q.  You didn't want to obviously -- didn't want to admit it before going into the series, but you are coming off an emotional overtime type game -- it is clear -- could you say now that your team was really tired in Game 1?  You only didn't want to put that thought in their head?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you fall asleep watching those Eastern Conference Playoff games?</p>
<p>	Q.  It's a setup. </p>
