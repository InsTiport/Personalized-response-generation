<p>	Q.  Just an update on Joe (Johnson) for coming into this game, what you expect from him based on what you have seen the last few days?</p>
<p>	Q.  If you put Joe (Johnson) on Tony (Parker), what do you think that might accomplish for you guys defensively?</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously you are going to say something before the game, but do you have to say anything about the situation, or is that too obvious?</p>
<p>	Q.  Will you have any anxious moments when Joe (Johnson) first goes out there, I mean not -- I think it's an unusual circumstance to go out so soon after surgery?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have to warn -- I mean, talk to Joe (Johnson) about it's not all on you bringing you back and we are down 2-0 and that the pressure is not all on you and the team shouldn't expect -- and you wouldn't have this sort of responsibility or guilt hanging over him for not --</p>
<p>	Q.  Prioritizing what they do, if Duncan -- stopping Duncan is number one, is Ginobili or Parker number two?  Or are they two and two-A?</p>
<p>	Q.  You are going to be able to cut everybody's minutes a little bit.  Do you think minutes have been a factor in the first two games?</p>
<p>	Q.  What happened in Game 1 and 2 has to be due to the youth of this basketball team?</p>
<p>	Q.  You had talked before the first game, I think it was, about that you will do what you guys do, they will do what they do.  You will play your game and it won't matter.  The conventional wisdom sort of coming into the series was that you are the offensive team, they are the defensive team and to see which one -- which wills out.  Has it disrupted your players that they are being so defensive and scoring so many points? </p>
<p>	Q.  Your offense has been such an entertaining thing this year, it's gotten so much notice, is it just because of your peculiar roster that you can do it?  Or are there more teams out there that can do it?</p>
<p>	Q.  While Joe has been cleared medically and that's not a concern.  Being down 0-2, the sense of urgency, him wanting to get in, I mean, do you think it would have played out this way if this would have been in January of a regular season game or is there --</p>
