<p>	Q.  Of all the defensive messages you try to get across this season, which ones do you feel like the guys adhere to --</p>
<p>	Q.  Which one --</p>
<p>	Q.  Another loaded question. </p>
<p>	Q.  Expectations weren't really that high for your team when this season started.  Any sense at all that they were maybe surprised, happy to be here?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think in some ways, assuming you don't turn around miraculously, you guys need to go through this to see what it takes to get to the Finals and win a Championship? </p>
<p>	Q.  Pop was in here, offered the cliche about closeout games being the toughest.  Why do you think so rarely when teams are down 3-0 that they win that fourth game?  It becomes 3-1, then it becomes 4-0, I don't know 95, 98% of the time?</p>
<p>	Q.  I am in trouble.  I forgot my question.  No.  It's unusual for your team every game in this series that you have been outscored, right from the beginning, being such a fast breaking team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Second possession on, say?</p>
<p>	Q.  It's been very unusual watching your team all season long, what in your view has happened in those first quarters?</p>
<p>	Q.  You knew even last season Steve Nash was a perfect player to run your offense.  What ways has he surprised you this year with his game?</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys have been in all three of these games at the end and yet there are people who are talking as if they want to throw out small ball with this series.  What do you make of that?</p>
<p>	Q.  There's certain disciplined things that the Spurs sort of have been known for doing year in and year out.  You mentioned before the last game the way they get back defensively, with all the changes in their personnel and maybe style, how are they at those things now compared to some of the other teams, compared to the rest of the regular --</p>
<p>	Q.  You said you played small ball in Italy.  Obviously you probably didn't have a team quite as athletic as this one.  What does it take -- is the big thing the coach's commitment or the organization's commitment?</p>
