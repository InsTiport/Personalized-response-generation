<p>	Q.  You probably used your big lineup more than you have probably this season, probably 12, 15 minutes.  How do you think it fared?</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you have to do to stop them, especially late, because they kind of outdid the Suns with the threes late?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is Duncan so difficult because if you go one and one he's going to get his points ?</p>
<p>	Q.  You are on short rest.  I am sure some of things you just mentioned may be a factor?</p>
<p>	Q.  I am tired by the way. </p>
<p>	Q.  Your theory is that teams are not going to be able to keep up with your pace.  You spoke about it even before the game, about we're going to play our tempo.  Do you feel that Spurs team can sustain your pace and play your game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Shawn Marion struggled today.  Was it more what they were doing to him or in the energy department?</p>
