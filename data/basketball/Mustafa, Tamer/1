Q. You were drafted with which number?
TAMER MUSTAFA: I was picked No. 8.
Q. What's it like going to the Celtics?
TAMER MUSTAFA: It's a great feeling.  All my friends are there.  I've been playing with Fab and Mel for a really long time, so I just can't wait to meet them and play with them.
Q. That's interesting, like you've formed a community online.  You've never met face-to-face.  I know that happened a lot last year with players.  What has it been like playing with these guys all these years but never meeting them and now you get that chance?
TAMER MUSTAFA: It's been great.  They've always been great teammates, and I know they're great friends, so just to see them and meet them is going to be a great feeling because I already know -- I feel like I already know them already.
Q. What position do you play?
TAMER MUSTAFA: I play small forward.
Q. And that's what you'll be looking to play?
TAMER MUSTAFA: Not really.  I play like all positions, so I'm just waiting to see which position the team wants me to play.
Q. When did you start playing video games?
TAMER MUSTAFA: I've always been playing video games since a kid.  I started playing 2K in 2K11, so I've been playing nonstop, and now I'm here.
Q. What age were you?
TAMER MUSTAFA: Age, probably like -- I don't know, I've always been playing games since I was a baby, so I don't really know the age.  Ever since I can remember.
Q. And when did you realize that you were good at 2K?
TAMER MUSTAFA: Just always putting the hard work in and just always seeing the outcome.  Every time I worked hard or focused on a game and you just start playing really good and just seeing it, it motivates you and you just want to keep going.  My friends and family, they all support me, motivate me, so yeah.
Q. I was going to ask, what does your family think about your chosen career?
TAMER MUSTAFA: They're really happy.  They're as excited as I am.  They're all back at home watching right now.  I already know they're just super happy right now.
Q. Where is your home?
TAMER MUSTAFA: I'm from Chicago, Illinois.
Q. So are you a Bulls fan?
TAMER MUSTAFA: Well --
Q. Now you're a Celtics fan?
TAMER MUSTAFA: Yeah, I'm a Celtics fan now.
Q. Do you follow the NBA?
TAMER MUSTAFA: Yes, I do.  I do follow the NBA.
Q. Who's your favorite player?
TAMER MUSTAFA: Favorite player, Kevin Durant.
Q. And do you think your game mimics his a little bit or very different?
TAMER MUSTAFA: Yes, it definitely does, just scoring-wise and defense, yes, it does.
Q. You were one of the surprises of this draft, I think, going eighth overall.  I don't think a lot of people had that.  Do you think that says a lot about the confidence that the Celtics have in you?
TAMER MUSTAFA: Yeah, I love the Celtics.  It means the world for them to pick me.  I wanted to play there, and for them to pick me up means everything to me.
Q. When did you get a feeling that they were going to pick you?  Did you know before today?
TAMER MUSTAFA: During interviews and just hoping I did good in my interview.
