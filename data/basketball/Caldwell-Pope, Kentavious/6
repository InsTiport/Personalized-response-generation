Q.   I m assuming you've worn a pair of Jordans in the past.   What were your first Air Jordans?   What was that experience like? 
KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL‑POPE:   My first pair?   High school. 

Q.   What do you think of shoes in general?   Building a shoe brand?   What does that mean to you? 
KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL‑POPE:   A lot.   A lot of people just fall into that. 

Q.   Who are the loudest fans you've experienced so far?   Craziest fans? 
KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL‑POPE:   I haven't really experienced any.   I wouldn't know.     I wouldn't know. 

Q.   Where does "Kentavious" come from?   It sounds like "contagious".   Where are you from?   Where did your mom come up with your name? 
KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL‑POPE:   My mom actually didn't come up with it; my Auntie did.   I never asked. 

Q.   You never thought, like, this is an exotic name, where did it come from? 
KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL‑POPE:   No.   I wondered, but I never had‑‑ I never got a chance to ask. 

Q.   When you met with Stan, did you sense there was going to be a real opportunity, the conversations you had with him over the summer and stuff? 
KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL‑POPE:   When we had a conversation, he was talking about just like the team situation.   He wanted to get everybody an opportunity to play, to perform and show what you got.   So it was good. 

Q.   Did you expect you would become a real mainstay, a starter and a guy that this team looks to each night?   Last year was a little bit more of a learning year, had your moments.   Now you're kind of one of the key guys.   Did you think it would happen that quickly? 
KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL‑POPE:   I didn't think it was going to happen that quick, but it did.   So I had to take on a big role.   I'm still learning as I go.   It's been kind of hard, some.   But I'm getting it. 

Q.   It seems like the team has sort of rallied a bit.   Obviously losing Brandon was tough.   How have you guys come together since that? 
KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL‑POPE:   Kind of like stayed together.   We didn't break apart.   Kind of kept the chemistry going.   (Inaudible).   We are trying to stay strong. 

Q.   Is Stan tough on you?   Is he a tough guy to play for?   Demanding? 
KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL‑POPE:   He's a tough coach.   But I mean, when he goes over a gameplan, he just wants us to perfect it.
