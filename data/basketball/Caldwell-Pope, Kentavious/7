THE MODERATOR:   Start with some opening remarks.   Then we'll open it up to questions from the media. 
KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL‑POPE:   I'm just right now, I'm just‑‑ my heart is just racing right now.   I'm happy I got selected eighth overall in the first round by Detroit.   Right now I'm proud of myself, man, and I'm just proud‑‑ my family is proud of me as well. 

Q.   Kentavious, congratulations to you.   With Detroit this organization has struggled, but they have good young talent.   Brandon Knight, Greg Monroe, Andre Drummond.   With the addition to what you bring to the table, tell how this team can improve and make some waves in the East. 
KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL‑POPE:   What I bring to the table, we can improve.   I bring offensive game and a defensive game.   I can defend around the perimeter and also just know Brandon Knight from playing AAU against him.   He's a great point guard.   He's going to lead the team. 
I know that going to Detroit and looking up to either him or some of the older players that's been there.   It's going to help me. 

Q.   Kentavious, first of all, congratulations.   It seemed like Minnesota was where you were going to be and then Detroit.   Was that sudden?   Did you feel like Detroit was a possibility? 
KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL‑POPE:   I mean, I felt like it was a possibility.   But I didn't get a chance to work out with them.   So I was a little surprised.   Just them selecting me is great. 

Q.   What was your immediate reaction when you heard the pick? 
KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL‑POPE:   My heart just dropped.   My heart was racing when it started.   But Detroit selected me, and I just‑‑ me and my family was happy.   I was happy as well. 

Q.   Before it was announced, were you thinking, were you hoping it could be Detroit?   Were you starting to prepare for it?   Did it catch you off guard? 
KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL‑POPE:   It kind of caught me off guard.   I was kind of hoping that I was going‑‑ not kind of hoping, but I thought Minnesota was going to get the pick, but Detroit got it.   So Detroit is a great team.   What I bring to the table and what Detroit is going to get out of me is a great player. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
