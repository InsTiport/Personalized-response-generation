<p>	Q.  Coach could you talk about the guards and their offensive contributions?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you play a team that's dominated you the first time  -- is that something you forget about  -- what's the mind set going in?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about what you expect, what's it like being here now, especially with Purdue  --</p>

<p>	Q.  Inaudible?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about how  -- feeding off  -- where defense has really been  --</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  In the last couple months, even through January  --</p>
<p>	Q.  The rivalry with Purdue, you played your first NCAA Tournament game against them in the championship  --</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about how you never gave up on this team  --</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk just about  -- I know you are thrilled with the team's success, and the other team's focusing more on you right now or are you starting to press a little bit? </p>
<p>	Q.  Was there a team in the biggest tournament either in practice or meetings where someone sort of said to you, I think  -- inaudible -- very good chance to go out and get it done?</p>
<p>	Q.  During the stretch where they didn't score a free throw  -- Kansas State -- is that the gives defense --</p>
<p>	Q.  Were you aware of the head gear being worn  --</p>
<p>	Q.  Kansas State, you were able to?</p>
<p>	Q.  Alicia, why don't you talk about the leadership  --</p>
<p>	Q.  She also talked about that four-game break there, she's loosened up a little bit, is that something that the team and players have noticed?  (Laughter)?</p>
<p>	Q.  In January did you ever think that you would make it this far or the season  --</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the fact that no team 11th seed or worse has never made it past  --</p>
<p>	Q.  Megan, you were asked earlier about having played in Dayton, what does this mean for you to be able to go home and just as a follow-up, you played in Dayton  -- did you cross paths with  -- (Inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could the players comment on what they remember about the first match with Purdue this year and what has to change for this weekend? </p>
<p>	Q.  This question is directed towards Megan, and I'm sure you've been asked before, but add me to the list, it's about leadership.  Explain to me, did you ever feel uncomfortable when you were 14 years old and captain of a group of older girls?  How did that work out?  How does it feel now in the unusual position of not being captain of the team mechanism?</p>
<p>	Q.  I want to follow that up, when you say it came natural is that partly because you started playing basketball so young?  And which sport did play first, golf or basketball? </p>
<p>	Q.  Muffet, when you look at Purdue and I know you've probably seen a lot, a lot of film of them because it's the second time you're playing, there was a common belief before the year that they had three very good players -- inaudible -- do you see a team that was pretty successful in getting all of the parts to merge together?  Comment on their team a little bit when you watch them on film.</p>
<p>	Q.  Muffet, what do you think about what you've been able to do, going to someone's floor like that and take away a victory; that maybe there is more parity in women's basketball than perhaps the NCAA wants to represent in the early round of the tournament?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach McGraw, how did you come up the name for "The Storm" for your matchup zone?</p>
<p>	Q.  I just wanted to follow-up on something you said earlier, you know you talked about how losing to Purdue might be extra motivation for your team and some of your players picked up on that.  In all seriousness would you rather be playing a team that you are not as familiar with  or that you play all the time?  And obviously you and Purdue have a pretty deep history now.  Would you rather be playing a team that maybe you don't know quite as well and vice versa?</p>
<p>	Q.  It sounds like in this bracket you were stuck no matter what.  </p>
<p>	Q.  I was going to ask you about the Big East semifinals, seeing all of those teams that you've seen all year? </p>
