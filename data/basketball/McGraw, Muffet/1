Pittsburgh - 67, Notre Dame - 65
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Notre Dame Muffet McGraw and Katlyn Gilbert. Coach?
MUFFET MCGRAW: Just another disappointing game in a very disappointing season.
Q. Coach, talk about the last play offensively what you were looking for and what happened there?
MUFFET MCGRAW: Yeah, we make a pass into the wing and we didn't meet the ball. They stepped in and stole it.
Q. Katlyn, you had the big steal there and the layup and things have been breaking your way for the last few weeks, won three in a row. Did you feel like you could keep it going, was that the momentum you needed at the time?
KATLYN GILBERT: At the time I wasn't thinking too much about it I was doing whatever I needed to do to help my team win.
Q. Not the outcome you guys were looking for this season and in the tournament but where do you go and where are you looking moving forward?
KATLYN GILBERT: We have to use this year as a learning lesson, do whatever we need to do to not get back to this year. We have some bright futures ahead of us.
THE MODERATOR: Thanks.
