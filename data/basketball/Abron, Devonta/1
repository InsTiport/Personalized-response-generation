Texas   70
  TCU   57

THE MODERATOR:   We're ready to begin with TCU Coach Trent Johnson and Kyan Anderson and Devonta Abron. 
Coach, we'll call on you for comments on tonight's game.
COACH JOHNSON:   We got a bad start, the start of the second half, Texas went to the zone.   A lot of open looks didn't go down for us. 
They played well.   They're playing well.   They're real physical.   And basically the bottom line was they made open shots, we didn't, down the stretch.   And that was the ballgame in itself.
THE MODERATOR:   Questions for the student‑athletes. 

Q.   Kyan, you started the game shooting so well.   What was that zone doing to you all?   Was it affecting the shot selection that you were getting?
KYAN ANDERSON:   I think it came down more on us than anything.   We couldn't knock down open jumpers.   I mean, they knew that, so they stayed in the zone.   And it just comes down to us being able to knock down open jumpers.

Q.   Devonta, you guys, I think, made your first 12 free throws, something the team struggled with.   And down the stretch, I think, you made four of your last nine.   Did you feel like as long as you guys shot the ball well from the free‑throw line, that you could stay in this game?
DEVONTA ABRON:   It was all a mindset.   Like Coach said, we just had to play hard.   Shooting free throws is just you and the free‑throw line, just gotta knock them down.
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.   Questions for Coach. 

Q.   You gotta be happy to a certain degree with how well they shot the ball.   But what happened there in the second half?   Was it the zone that was causing the struggles from the floor?   You still think the shots were good?
COACH JOHNSON:   First of all, there's nothing happy with the looks.   We have had a lot of experience on losing this year.   Second thing was they did a good job getting us out of rhythm, but basically we had a lot of open looks and we haven't shot the ball well all year, with the exception of certain people, the ball just didn't go down for us, versus Kansas State on the road and last time at home we made some shots.   And tonight we didn't. 
It was more us than what they did.   Obviously they're big, strong.   They're a dangerous team right now.   If anybody's capable of winning three more, they're it.
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, Coach.
