Q. State your name and who you play for.
AARON ROOKWOOD: My name is Aaron Rookwood, and I play for Bucks Gaming.
Q. What propelled you from going casual into competitive?
AARON ROOKWOOD: What propelled me from going to casual to competitive was just that I'm a competitive person, so I wanted to play against the best and just measure myself up against the best.
Q. What's your go-to team in 2K?
AARON ROOKWOOD: Oh, my go-to -- well, Cleveland.  (Laughing.)
Q. What's it like to be a part of a real NBA franchise?
AARON ROOKWOOD: It's surreal.  It's something I wanted to do always when I was younger and unfortunately I couldn't get it as the basketball player, but now I am some part -- in some way I am part of the NBA now, and it's just still surreal.
Q. What's your favorite game other than 2K?
AARON ROOKWOOD: Madden.
Q. You good at that, too?
AARON ROOKWOOD: Yeah, I'm good at that.
Q. You this good at Madden?
AARON ROOKWOOD: Not this good, but I'm good.
Q. What was going through your head when you heard your name getting called?
AARON ROOKWOOD: What was going through my head?  I knew my name was going to get called; just didn't know when.  It's still surreal -- just going from where I grew up at just on this big stage now.  Just definitely a surreal moment.
Q. Talk about the process, this whole experience.  What has this felt like?
AARON ROOKWOOD: The process was definitely a grind.  It was fun moments.  It was worrying moments about making it to this point.  Doubting yourself.
It was definitely a whole lot of mixed emotions, but it finally paid off just from playing, perfecting my craft, then to the combine playing in a whole new environment, playing with people I never played with before, and just being able to have a successful combine to put me in this position today.
