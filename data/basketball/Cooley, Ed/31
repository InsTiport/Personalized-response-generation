SETON HALL   79
  PROVIDENCE   47

COACH COOLEY:   First, congratulations to Seton Hall.   I thought they played a great game.   You know, I thought we picked the worst time to have the worst game of our season.   Everything that could possibly go wrong went wrong.   They were better than us at every single position, one through five, no matter what we did.   They played with a sense of purpose. 
I think they're a team that deserves to be in the NCAA Tournament to begin with, and we played a tournament team today.   We picked our worst time to have our worst game.   I don't think we were physical.   We weren't attentive to detail.   You know, hopefully this is a learning experience for our program as we build our program to continue to move forward.
It's unfortunate, today I thought we looked tired, and I don't know why.   I thought we had a couple of great days of practice.   I don't know if it's the year, playing a really small lineup and small group for multiple minutes.   It seemed like it all caught up to us at the worst possible time at a great place to play.   I'm proud of our guys.   We had some good games and we definitely had some bad games, and today was the worst.   But I don't want our players to have their head down.   I think we achieved a lot given the circumstances, and we'll look forward to continuing to build our program. 

Q.   What did the defense do to really upset your offense?
COACH COOLEY:   I thought it was more what we were doing offensively because we had open shots.   This is back to back games where I thought we had really good looks, we just couldn't put the ball in the basket.

Q.   So you don't think the zone bothered you?
COACH COOLEY:   We have seen zone all year, run the same things.   Again, I thought we had open looks.   When you look at our guys that normally shoot the ball, LaDontae is a 40 percent three‑point shooter, Cotton is a 40 percent three‑point shooter, our interior guys.   Again, we missed a lot of shots.   Credit them.   What did we shoot, 2 percent?   I don't even know what it is.   We just missed a lot of shots.   They had a lot to do with it.

Q.   How quickly will it take you guys to get past this‑‑
COACH COOLEY:   I'm never going to get past it, my man.   I didn't come here to lose.   I'm never getting past it.   We'll move on.   We won't forget about it, but I've got to do a better job building our program. 

Q.   All season long there's been trouble with ball screens. 
COACH COOLEY:   Again, we've tried to mask a lot of shortcomings with our crew.   I'm really concerned with ball screens.   I think all coaches are concerned with ball screen defense, especially in this league when you have the best guards in the country night in and night out, they really exposed that with some of our guys.   Hopefully we can get better at it.   But they did a really good job with their offense.   They played well. 

Q.   On a brighter note, you're only graduating Bilal Dixon, talk about that aspect moving forward. 
COACH COOLEY:   The fact that the guys played in the game like this, hopefully they can learn something from it.   I'm excited about our future, but our present, we've got to make some adjustments.   We need to continue to add depth to our front court and to our backcourt.   I like the guys that we have committed to us, but recruiting is an everyday process for me.   I go to sleep, I think of recruiting, I wake up, I think of recruiting.   First thing I do when I get to my desk, we recruit.   We have recruiting meetings night in and night out.   Recruiting is the way to build a program.
