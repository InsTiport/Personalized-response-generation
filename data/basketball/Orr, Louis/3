<p>	Q.  (Question regarding Marcus shooting free throws)? </p>
<p>	Q.  How disappointed is your team right now? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is the fact that he gets the shot that close to the basket a defensive breakdown?  Did it just take a decent play? </p>

<p>	Q.  Coach, I know this is a tough loss, but you have 20 wins, 10 wins in a very tough conference.  Is it in your mind a conclusion you're going to the NCAAs? </p>
<p>	Q.  When Nardi tripped in the last 15 seconds, did you want the ball to go out of bounds or...? </p>
<p>	Q.  Andre, the other times that you lost here, the coming days were going to be uncertain about where you get to play again.  Does it feel a little different, a little better even though you lost? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kelly and Andre, can you guys, maybe for next week, learn from what you did or did not do tonight?  Obviously, this was a tight game.  Can you take a little bit of that into next week? </p>
