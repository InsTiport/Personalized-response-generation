<p>	Q.  Barry, can you talk about the decision not to start Jake?</p>
<p>	Q.  Apologize. </p>
<p>	Q.  Joe, can you talk about that last shot?  Did it look good?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about what Missouri was doing defensively in the first half, how you guys finally got it going?</p>


<p>	Q.  The decision not to start Jake and how you told him and how that went, and then talk a little bit about the spark he gave you in the second half.</p>
<p>	Q.  I don't know if this is the norm for you but do you like to run out the play at the end of the game like that, do you normally keep a timeout in your back pocket or was it a different situation?</p>
<p>	Q.  You had six turnovers the first couple of minutes and then four the rest of the way.  Not a single turnover in the second half.  Any explanation for that?  Were the guys just not focused or too excited?</p>
<p>	Q.  Looking back on this thing now -- first of all, what your chances are for the NIT in your opinion, and secondly, was this final couple of months disappointing or was it more encouraging?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are you pretty confident that you will be back next season?</p>
<p>	Q.  How hard has it been just in the last month or so operating under this like not knowing what is going on; have you known what is going on with your future and stuff?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk a little bit about the play Linas Kleiza, how you guys held him in the first half, then he scored Missouri's first six points?</p>
