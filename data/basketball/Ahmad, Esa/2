THE MODERATOR: For West Virginia the student-athletes are Jevon Carter, Daxter Miles, Junior and Esa Ahmad.  Questions for the student-athletes?   
 Q.  Defense is key for your team.  How do you plan to stop the quick guards of Marshall especially Jon Elmore?  
JEVON CARTER: We're going to key in on him, team defense, just like we did against Murray State.  Everybody is going to get a chance to guard him and we're going to focus and do our best on him.   
 Q.  You've seen Jon Elmore some.  What are your thoughts?  
JEVON CARTER: He's a very good player.  He can shoot the ball.  He can score many different ways.  He's a very good player.   
 Q.  Marshall is a team that's heavily into analytics and bases a lot of what they do around it.  How much do you guys use analytics?  Are coaches coming to you and giving you advanced statistics, or are you an old school team that grinds it out and plays your system?  
JEVON CARTER: Very old school.  We just go out there, play hard, try to be the aggressor and rebound it, play defense, try to turn 'em over, speed 'em, and just do what we do.   
ESA AHMAD: Like he said, just try to take things away from 'em and just make 'em uncomfortable.   
 Q.  How do you guys feel about playing Marshall in particular, 2000 miles away from West Virginia?  
JEVON CARTER: Don't matter.  This is March.  We're here to win a National Championship.  It's just happens that we just matched up against Marshall.  Don't matter who it is.  We're going to come to play and do our best and get a win.   
ESA AHMAD: Just another game.   
 Q.  Would you like to play them during the regular season every year if it were up to you?  
JEVON CARTER: That's not up to us.   
THE MODERATOR: Okay, gentlemen.  Thank you.
