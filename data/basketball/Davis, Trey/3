COACH MOONEY:   I thought it was a great game, really well played, highly‑contested game.   Wish we would have been able to do a little bit more, but congratulations to VCU as they move on.   
I'm very proud of my guys and how they have competed all season, and especially tonight.   I thought we were tough and we competed and just didn't have enough to win tonight.   
   
 Q.   The first half of the second half, you were very difficult to score on and that changed as the game went on.   What did they do to sort of loosen up offensively and score more?   
TREY DAVIS:   They hit shots.   Made a lot of open shots, shots that we had not been giving them the first few times we played them‑‑ winning streak that we had.   
   
 Q.   Just talk about defending them early in the first half, they were knocking down all their threes‑‑  
SHAWNDRE' JONES:   We wanted to limit the open looks they had in the first half.   In the second half, I think we were kind of playing back a little bit too much like we wasn't supposed to.   Second half we tried to get a hand‑out, and like I said, that kind ofbothered them a little bit but then he made a big shot at the end of the game.     
   
 Q.   Several times you went into the paint, made shots from angles that when you are almost parallel to the floor, when you go in, are you thinking what you had to do, or do you just get into the mix and do what has to be done?   
SHAWNDRE' JONES:   I don't go into the game trying to shoot those shots.   Just something that ends up happening during the game.   I just try to do whatever I can to help us win.   Unfortunately I didn't do enough tonight.   
   
 Q.   Looking at the stats, you had a lot of advantages shooting‑wise, fast breaks, turnovers in the paint.   Are you kind of wondering how you all didn't win this game?   
SHAWNDRE' JONES:   It was a tough game.   We used a lot of energy.   They used a lot of energy.   We battled tonight.   Unfortunately they scored three more points than we did at the end of the game.  
   
 Q.   Same question.   Kind of wondering how you didn't win this game?   
COACH MOONEY:   Yeah, we had a big advantage in a lot of the important statistical categories.   Our field goal percentage was super high.   Our points in the paint, we outscored them by 30.   Fast break points was 19‑2.  
So a lot of‑‑ statistics can be a little bit misleading.   They don't always tell the whole story, but I thought the discrepancy, and they made 16 free throws; we didn't make any.   That obviously is one big advantage that they had in their statistical line.   
   
 Q.   Without getting into any inflammatory comments, it wasn't so much that you didn't make any; they also shot 14 more than you did.   Were they more aggressive to draw more fouls?  
COACH MOONEY:   The other stats wouldn't suggest that since we had more fast break points and more points in the paint.   I don't know the answer to that but the other statistics wouldn't suggest that.   
   
 Q.   In the first two games, they were like 6 for 39 on threes and ten for 21.   What was the difference?   
COACH MOONEY:   I think early in the game, they made a few and really got confident.   Jordan made one in the corner.   Melvin Johnson made a couple.   I think that really helped them.   
I think Doug Brooks made one at the end of the shot clock in front of our bench.   So I think the confidence; they really had not been shooting great recently.   But when they got out there and had the confident of seeing a few go in, they are good shooters and they made them tonight.   
   
 Q.   What did you tell your guys afterwards in the locker room?   
COACH MOONEY:   Really, that I was proud of their effort; how we have represented Richmond all year, I think, hey, I'm just really proud of them and how much I care about them.   We are looking forward to playing again.   
Obviously the guys are pretty devastated but so far, we have accomplished some things and I think we have some good basketball left.   
   
 Q.   I was going to ask you for an elaboration on that about continuing the season somewhere and some way.   Are you fairly confident that's going to happen, and if so, would that be the NIT?   
COACH MOONEY:   Yeah, I would think so, I would think we are pretty solidly in the NIT and we'll be excited to play.   
   
 Q.   This was quite a game.   Is it difficult to enjoy it when you come out on the losing end of it, or during the game, are you not thinking what a great game it is, just thinking what you have to do to get your team in a position to win?  
COACH MOONEY:   I think partly you can understand how good of a game it is, how well the players are playing to make the plays they are making.   I think I can recognize, you know, it's very ‑‑ it's a big rivalry.   It's a great rivalry and it's very intense.   But I do think that we recognized how some of the great plays that both teams made, and just how hotly contested the game was.   
   
 Q.   Kendall was spectacular, as usual, against VCU.   Can you elaborate on his play and what you told him?   
COACH MOONEY:   Yeah, he's just tremendous.   He is so competitive, so tough, and he's asked to do so much.   Even though he's played well against pressing teams throughout his career, he's even gotten better in terms of controlling the ball and making great decisions, scoring the ball, of course, when he has to.   He's tremendous.   He's had an incredible impact on me personally and on our program.
