Indiana - 111, Michigan State - 109 (4 OT)
Q. Take us through your thoughts.
SHAY COLLEY: Just came down to execution.  Four overtimes, so they were the better team that executed at the end of the day, and that's that.
Q. Your knee, I know Coach said that you were questionable at the start of the game.  How bad did you want to play in this game?
SHAY COLLEY: Very bad.  You saw it out there.  I played the four overtimes until I fouled out, so I think coming in my knee wasn't an option; I knew I was going to play regardless.
Q. At the end of the day, you played nearly 50, 60 minutes.  To do that, that's still something to be kind of proud of, right?
SHAY COLLEY: I mean, yeah, anything for my team.  We really wanted this one.  If it came down to like 70 minutes, I was still going to be out there.
