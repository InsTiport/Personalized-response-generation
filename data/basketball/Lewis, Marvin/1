<p>	Q.  Marvin, it seemed like you went through a stretch, you could not buy a basket.  Was it a combination of you guys not shooting well, their defense?  They seemed to take you out of your offense. </p>
<p>	Q.  You cut it to 10.  Will made a couple of shots.  The free-throws, they started missing.  How tough is that to go in the locker room knowing that you had a chance to get back in the game, all of a sudden you're looking at a 15-point deficit? </p>
<p>	Q.  BJ, yesterday Coach Hewitt predicted you would come out and have a big game.  Did you feel that you had that in you?  How frustrated were you not to be able to submit a big game here today? </p>
<p>	Q.  You both said a second ago, it was one of those nights that the ball didn't fall.  Is there any particular reason why that was the case, the national title game, the ball didn't go for you? </p>
<p>	Q.  When Taliek threw the ball in the stands, you just walked off the court, didn't congratulate anybody, look back.  What were you thinking there? </p>
<p>	Q.  Marvin, they seemed to grab a lot of rebounds, particularly at the beginning of the game.  What was Okafor doing in there and Boone, some of those guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  The governor of Georgia and your fans and a lot of people have said even though you lost tonight, you brought a lot of pride and exposure to your campus.  Can you see past your loss to see any of that? </p>

<p>	Q.  Marvin, how much does it take out of the energy level when you're missing foul shots, open looks? </p>

<p>	Q.  Paul, were you getting the shots you wanted out of the offense, just a matter of not knocking them down, or them contesting every shot?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the disappointment?  It was a game that was pretty much controlled by UConn.  I know you kept trying to come back.  Never could quite get in that range. </p>
<p>	Q.  At the risk of asking you to analyze once again, did you see nerves in your players in the first half?  Was that an issue at all? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about what a rarity it is to have a true center like Emeka in this game, how he controlled the game tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the two early fouls on Luke, how they impacted you guys, and also if given the nature of the calls, did your plea for respect for Luke not reach the West Coast? </p>
<p>	Q.  How did the calls on Luke affect the way you guys played? </p>
<p>	Q.  You guys were as close there, then the first six minutes, they went on a run.  Gordon got fueled by Luke, there was the Gordon 3-pointer where it looked like he might have traveled.  How big were those six points in that run?  You guys were close at that point in time. </p>
<p>	Q.  In the first game you did a great job of really limiting the effectiveness of Okafor and Gordon.  What was the difference tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you sense at halftime that your guys were shell-shocked at all? </p>
<p>	Q.  How confident were you to make a run?</p>
<p>	Q.  There are a lot of great coaches, like Sutton, who might trade a few years of their life to get to this game.  After watching film, will you allow yourself time to appreciate you what you have done here?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned looking ahead to the future.  You guys have a really good team coming back in what's going to be I think a phenomenal conference.  Can you talk about that. </p>
