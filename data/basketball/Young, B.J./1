VANDERBILT  Â– 75
  ARKANSAS - 72

THE MODERATOR:   We're ready to begin with Arkansas.   We'll ask Coach and for some opening thoughts on the game and take your questions just for the two student athletes, excuse them back to the locker room, which is now open, and then we'll finish up with coach. 
Coach?
COACH ANDERSON:   First of all, congratulations to Vandy, they shot the ball extremely well.   I thought at times we were really trying to be disruptive on defense and they had some guys, Kyle Fuller, made some big shots for them going down the stretch.   When we play the style we play, we never out of a game.   Even after the last 30 seconds, we create a steal and we end up kind of forcing something that probably wasn't there and you get that basket there or get to the free throw line, it's a different game.
But our guys gave everything they had.   I thought Odom did a great job for their basketball team.   They made shots when they had to.   We got to the free throw line and didn't do a good job of knocking them down.   But it's disappointing because I thought our team was really primed for in this tournament and I always say the most important is the first game.   It's a little disappointing from that standpoint.   Wasn't because of our guys not trying.
THE MODERATOR:   We'll take your questions for either of the student athletes.   Raise your hand and give the floor microphone to you.   Hands up.

Q.   This is for both guys.   Just how frustrating is it to go one-and-done again?   You haven't done all this, but it's five straight years for Arkansas now.
BJ YOUNG:   It's very frustrating to lose any game.   But this particular game we lost, it's frustrating.   We went out there and gave a good effort.   Vanderbilt, they played hard, played tense.   They took a lead early and they rode it throughout the game.   We just kept fighting right up to the buzzer.
THE MODERATOR:   Same for Rashad.
RASHAD MADDEN:   It's a hard loss.   Like he said, every game in a tough loss but this one especially.   We should have came out harder from the jump.   If we would have played like we played at the end of the game like at the beginning of the game, it probably be a different circumstance.

Q.   For both guys, just the struggles at the free throw line tonight, why do you think that was and how costly did it turn out for you?
RASHAD MADDEN:   I guess it cost us a lot, you know.   We leaving points at the line.   Not only that we're going 0 for 2 a lot.   Like a turnover, empty possession.
BJ YOUNG:   It was very crucial.   It was very crucial thing in the game.   We got up there, had chances, opportunities and capitalized, didn't capitalize sometimes.   Got to make those.   We have the opportunity at the free throw line, take advantage of it.

Q.   This would be for both guys, talk about Vandy's 3 point shooting, 12 out of 28.   They're out early to get the lead.
BJ YOUNG:   It's hard to defend a team like when the shooters are making and guys are getting to the paint, creating drive and kicks and mismatches and your shooters are knocking shots down from you from 1 through 5, really pretty much for them and it was hard to combat that.   We still tried to apply our defensive pressure, full court is how we like to apply it.   We got a steal sometimes.   Sometimes they broke it.   That's how it happened.   They knocked shots down today and they deserve to win.
RASHAD MADDEN:   Yeah.   That's a good point.   If we would have sort of, you know what I'm saying, cut a couple of those down, we would have won the game, be different.   Have something to do with us as well.   They did break the pressure a lot.   That's got something to do with our effort and closed out on the shooters.   We have a lot of open and you're supposed to make.

Q.   That play down the stretch where I think you forced the steal, Qualls got it and kind of rushed it ahead.   What did you guys see on that play there? 
RASHAD MADDEN:   We came with the steal.   Like we do every today at practice, get up and down and push the ball, advance the ball.   It's a good pass.   Could have been a better shot, but, you know, I mean, that's what we practice on every day.   We just missed the shot.
BJ YOUNG:   I didn't even get to see the play.   I was transitioning and just got pushed into the crowd.   I didn't even get to see what happened on the play.   I really can't speak on that play.   I didn't get to see it.   I just jumped up off the ground and hoping we would score but it was going the other way.   Really couldn't do nothing about that but keep playing.
THE MODERATOR:   One more question for the student athletes.

Q.   I guess you guys will have a shot maybe to go to the NIT.   How would you feel about the NIT?   Do you want to keep playing?
BJ YOUNG:   We'd love to keep playing.   I want to play as many games as we can, and I feel like we play hard every game this season and came out there.   Whether was a win or loss, we fought and tried the stay together.   More games in the season, I would love to play.
RASHAD MADDEN:   I would love to play as well, as many games as we can get.   I feel that way, and I'm sure everybody in the locker room do, too.   It's a game we enjoy and love to play.   We get the opportunity, I'm all for it.
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.   We'll excuse the student athletes back to the locker room.   Thank you.
We'll continue on with questions for Coach Anderson.

Q.   Coach, I saw you shaking your head looking at the stat sheets, what jumped out at you?
COACH ANDERSON:   The sluggishness on defense, getting out and covering the shooters.   I thought, you know -- excuse my voice, anyway, it's not from hollering.   I want you guys to know that.   I've been having a little sinus infection, but for the most part, the free throw line.   I think that's the killer.   When you get into a game where it comes down to possessions, we have a lot of empty possessions where you got guys you want to go to the free throw line to knock free throw down, and we just couldn't knock them down when we needed to and that would enable us to get into our defense.
But, again, Vandy did a good job of shooting.   They had some guys that had career highs.   We always done a good job against Odom.   He made some big shots for them.   Fuller, seemed like Fuller had a career night for them and when they need it the most.   But we had some critical plays going down the stretch.   The flagrant foul that took place, they're at the free throw line, miss the free throw, they get two free throws and they get the ball.   They make two free throws and get the ball pack.   Pushes the lead out a little bit.   Seemed like always had a cushion and we were fighting uphill.   Give Kevin and his team credit.   They fought a lot harder than we did.

Q.   Coach, in the half court set, it seemed like they're on their on the ball screens, really took you guys out of rhythm on defense.   Did you talk about that and do you think that was -- helped them out offensively?
COACH ANDERSON:   I think we did a good job in spreading and attacking us.   Our guys kind of got back on their heels, especially when they called a couple fouls, many when our guys really got out there, whether switching or doubling up on the ball, we caused some havoc with it.   They did a good job of stretching us out at times and penetrating, throwing it inside, kicking it outside and making shots.   You got to make shots in the game.   They did.

Q.   Coach, you mentioned Kyle Fuller, he had a big game off the bench.   Why do you think he was able to have so much success against you guys?
COACH ANDERSON:   He played well.   I thought he did a good job of attacking.   He made some shots.   I thought his confidence was really going.

Q.   The first half Vandy was getting down the paint pretty easily, also getting some pretty good looks from 3.   Why do you think your defense got off to a bad start?
COACH ANDERSON:   The energy wasn't there, the effort wasn't there, we weren't in sync with one another.   Of course, that's my fault.   I thought I had these guys played for that.   This is our third time playing Vandy.   We know what they do.   That's what they do.   They shot 28 out of 55 free throws, 56 shots.   With that being said, you got to be patient defensively as well.   You got to keep people in front of you and you got to get on to the shooters.   I thought the second half we sped them up a little bit and that enabled us to get back in the game, and not only that, when they shot it, rebound the basketball, we put a little bit more size out there.   I thought Kyle played one of his better games for us and helped us making that run.   Michael Qualls.   You could see the young guys are really starting to come on Coty Clarke, Anthlon Bell. 
With that being said, now your main guys have got to really bring it in this setting.   When I talk about that, there are guys like BJ Young.   Those are guys we count on big.   They're our impact guys.

Q.   Mike, how do you fell about your NIT chances?   How much would you like the keep playing?
COACH ANDERSON:   I'd love this team to continue to play.   They've had a good year.   They've improved from last year.   They did some good things.   I think, you know, we have an opportunity to play and get some more practice time with only benefit our basketball team.   So, no doubt about it.   Hopefully we'll have an opportunity to continue to play.
THE MODERATOR:   Two more questions.

Q.   Coach, in the first half you guys had 8 turnovers and then finished with just 11.   What was the difference in the halves for that?
COACH ANDERSON:   We were not in a hurry.   We had some sloppy turnovers where we didn't take care of ball.   That's what we pride ourselves on, taking care of the basketball.   We had turnovers.   Guys -- we had a couple of charges, I think.   Guys jumping in the air, making passes.   Our guys kind of settled down.   Just that turnover atmosphere, you know.   That's why people don't understand the first game of the tournament, you don't understand how your kids are going to come out.   You can prepare them, but you never know, because some of these guys have never been in this setting.   So that's the thing I was concerned about, and I thought I saw some of that nervousness in the first half.
THE MODERATOR:   Last question, anyone?

Q.   Mike, I know this is just your second loss here.   It's been five in a row for the program.   Is that kind of hard to believe and just talk about how frustrating it is to not be able to advance.
COACH ANDERSON:   Again, I thought our guys had the right mindset coming in and coming to the tournament play, and this is the time we play some of our better basketball.   It's disappointing for me from that standpoint.   It gives me the mindset that, you know what, we ain't going to let it happen again.   But there's nothing you can do.   Vandy played better than we did today and we'll learn from it.   We'll learn from it, and hopefully it's going make us better as we continue hopefully to play.
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
