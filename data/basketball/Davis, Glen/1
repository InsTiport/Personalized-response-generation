  Q. Lakers say they're going to meditate tomorrow morning, like they do every game day.  
 GLEN DAVIS: They meditate? What's that.  
  
  Q. They sit there in the dark and concentrate on their breathing and make their minds calm.  
 GLEN DAVIS: For real? I'm going to try that.  
  
  Q. You can paralyze yourself doing that, hurt yourself.  
 GLEN DAVIS: If it's what they do to get ready for the game, hey, let them find their lost remote.  
  
  Q. Could a better description have been written, Game 7 --  
 GLEN DAVIS: This is what the NBA wants. This is what the fans want. This is what the world wants, Game 7, Lakers-Celtics. It's history.  
  
  Q. What do you want?  
 GLEN DAVIS: What do I want? I want to be on a float taking my shirt off, screaming, celebrating a championship. I want to be on a float next Monday. It'll be probably Sunday or Monday.  
  
  Q. Do you feel like because of Perk's situation that --  
 GLEN DAVIS: We're capable enough to take up the slack for Perk.
