 Q. Who do you think is the most annoying celebrity Laker fan? 
 GLEN DAVIS: I love all the Lakers fans.

 Q. You like them all?
 GLEN DAVIS: All the celebrities and things like that. I'm a big fan of Jack Nicholson, a big fan of everybody who sits on the court. I'm a big movie geek. I love it. 

 Q. Do you say anything to them?
 GLEN DAVIS: I kind of say a little bit, make eye contact with Jack Nicholson. He doesn't know me, but hopefully he will after this. 

 Q. (Inaudible). 
 GLEN DAVIS: I have a lot of nicknames. I always stick to Big Baby, though. I have a lot of nicknames. I'm everywhere. 

 Q. What have you made of your play in the playoffs?
 GLEN DAVIS: You know, this year has helped me tremendously. Well, the year before has helped me tremendously, but this year -- before I never really had a chance to play in the playoffs. I played a little bit my first year; didn't play a lot. I played like the Atlanta series and Cleveland series. I didn't get a chance to play, and then I played a little bit in Detroit. 
 But last year I kind of established myself as a player in this league and as a bona fide player as far as coming through in the clutch and playing big when it's needed. It just helped me tremendously. With me coming off the bench, I really don't have a lot of pressure, I just go out there and play. I play better with more pressure. 

 Q. (Inaudible). 
 GLEN DAVIS: Oh, most definitely. A lot of my confidence in my career so far is understanding what it takes to be a complete player, a more consistent player. He's not the only one. Ray Allen has been right there for me. He's a guy who's been in the league for a lot of years and is real successful. You learn from watching them.
