   GLEN DAVIS: Kind of disappointed that we didn't play to the caliber that we know how to play. We didn't do a lot of things that we normally do. But hey, we're not perfect, but we do have high spirits about everything. Look at the tape, look at the film and know what we have to do for the next game.

 Q. Was there something that you did right in Game 1 that you can build on? GLEN DAVIS: Not really. We needed to go out there and play more aggressive defense, and we didn't do that. And when you can't go out there and stop them, you really can't play good offense because defense creates offense. We didn't go out there and do that.

 Q. Did you feel like you got outplayed in Game 1?
 GLEN DAVIS: I think we played hard. I think we played hard, but I don't think we played hard and smart. I think we were just a little bit late on everything, just a little bit late on boxing out, late on a loose ball. We were just late on a lot of things. I think next game we'll -- the approach will be different, and there will be things that we were lacking in the first game that will happen next game.

 Q. Were you surprised by the way the Lakers came out?
 GLEN DAVIS: No. We shouldn't be surprised. They have a lot to play for, we have a lot to play for. They're at home, and they know how good we are on the road. So I think their approach to the game is a little bit different from ours from the jump-off, and we've just got to keep going and not relax.
