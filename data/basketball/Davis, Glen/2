   GLEN DAVIS: Kobe has his opinions. Bynum does help them. But you never know. If Bynum or anybody was there that day, I still would have done what I've done.   
  
  Q. Are there things you can do to Lamar Odom (Inaudible).   
     GLEN DAVIS: You know, Lamar Odom is a different player than Bynum. You know, Lamar is a good player. He's a great player. You know, I just try to play to my advantage. I feel like if I play to my strengths, no matter what I do, no matter who it is, if I stay focused on what I have to do, it'll work, I guess.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible).   
     GLEN DAVIS: Yeah, looking forward to it. Hopefully we can get it going again.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible).   
     GLEN DAVIS: One of my focal points is being consistent.
