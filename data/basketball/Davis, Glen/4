  Q. What did you do after the game last night?  
 GLEN DAVIS: I got some sleep. I watched the film over again, kept rewinding it. I didn't make bedtime until probably like 3:00.  
  
  Q. What did you see on the film?  
 GLEN DAVIS: That the refs are some special people. They're one of a kind, and it's hard to be them. I wouldn't want to be them at all.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible).  
 GLEN DAVIS: I don't know. You think it's out? I don't know. Could be in. There's a lot of things that come into the game of basketball that you have to deal with, but the refs have to take it from everybody.  
  
  Q. How would it be if the players called their own fouls?  
 GLEN DAVIS: Oh, my gosh, that would be bad, also.  
  
  Q. Would you rather have their job?  
 GLEN DAVIS: Would I rather have their job? No way. They can have that. You know, the game goes so many directions, so many ups and downs and turns, and I just think they do a great job of staying in there and trying to make the right call at the right time. Sometimes it's not going to go our way. Sometimes it's going to go the other team's way, and sometimes it's going to go our way. One thing we have to do as a team is just play through it, despite things not going our way. We have to keep going and keep pushing and try to overcome.  
 The thing about it, you know, we played bad, we still have an opportunity to win the game. That's the tough thing about it. We have to stay focused.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible).  
 GLEN DAVIS: No, the refs call the game like it's supposed to be called.
