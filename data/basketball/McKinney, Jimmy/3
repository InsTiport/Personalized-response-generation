<p>	Q.  Thomas, maybe you can talk about the first half and how you guys got out to a big lead; what was working for you guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jimmy, can you talk about the play of Linas, because he had a big game for you guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can both of you players talk about playing Oklahoma now? </p>


<p>	Q.  Quinn, I think Jimmy said it best, " He telegraphed that pass to Kleiza."  Was he so focused in on that's what he did, because the whole arena knew where that pass was going?</p>
<p>	Q.  Following up Kleiza, it looked like Nebraska throughout the first half was saying there's no way they are going to let Kleiza beat them again.  What changed that, your ability to let him beat them again?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked a lot about rebounding coming into this game.  You out-rebounded them in the offensive rebounds.  Talk about beating them on the boards.</p>
<p>	Q.  Earlier in his career, Linas, would he have pouted in the situation like he did in the first half?</p>
<p>	Q.  Yes.</p>
