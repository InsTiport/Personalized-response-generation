<p>	Q.  What have you been able to observe about this team through the first couple of days when the practices began?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked at the start about wanting to get the team playing.  What specifically is missing and what do you want to see?  You said it is still elusive?</p>
<p>	Q.  Getting that team play that you emphasized at the start. </p>
<p>	Q.  How much has Marshall Brown improved and what do you expect out of him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Kevin, last year there were times particularly on the offensive end when you were obviously having a hard time.  You could barely speak after the game you were so upset.  How tough was last year and how ready are you to put those in the past? </p>

<p>	Q.  Last year when you guys were at your best, you weren't scoring a lot of points but you were playing good defense.  Is this team well conditioned enough to be able to do that for an entire season?</p>
