Q.  How hard is it, and I know after last year, everyone wants to push making this a real competitive event.  How hard is it to do that in a game like this, to make it competitive? 

BOB McADOO:  Well, it's always hard, especially for young players, I guess, because, you know, it's not their own team.  They worry about getting hurt because the regular season starts again next week, and some of them are nursing injuries.  Josh Howard was feeling real bad tonight; that's why I didn't play him.  He had a cold.  LeBron's ankle was aching him a little bit.  You kind of worry about your own guys, we're holding on to first place in the East and I'm watching Dwyane jumping and jumping and I'm afraid he's going to come down on somebody's ankle, or Udonis.  Guys are usually going to be careful in these type of games.

Q.  Which of the young guys impress you the most? 

BOB McADOO:  All of them, really.  All of them.  It's a very talented bunch.  LeBron, especially, because he's so big and physical and he sees the court so well.  And now he's developed a three-point shot.  He's just going to be impossible to stop the rest of the year and in the future.
