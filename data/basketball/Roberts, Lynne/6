Colorado-66, Utah-56
LYNNE ROBERTS: Tough one today.  Certainly not what -- no one goes into this thing thinking you're going to lose, but you have to give Colorado credit.  I thought they just played really well.  They played better than we did today.  I think JR and her staff have done a nice job, but Colorado is playing really confidently right now.  They shot the ball well and just when it seemed like we were poised to make a run, they answered, and it's a credit to them.
We just couldn't -- offensively we were out of sorts and didn't make shots we've been making and didn't shoot for percentage.  Turned it over too much and just didn't have a great day.  We put way too much pressure on our defense to get stops because we weren't scoring.
But, again, congrats to Colorado.  They beat us today, and that's the way it goes.  But I'm proud of our team.  We've had a good season, 17 wins.  You know, just kind of a bad day to have a bad day.  But I do love my team, and we'll regroup and get ready for postseason.
Q. Coach, you got it down to 5 or 6 in the third quarter.  What kept you from continuing that run to close the gap?
LYNNE ROBERTS: We didn't get stops.  I mean, it's not as simple as that, but I think they answered.  They made shots and then we turned it over.  There was that key run there where we turned it over two, three times in a row, and that was kind of the flood gate.  We just offensively were not great today.  But, I think -- additionally, I think Colorado answered.  I think it's as simple as that.
Q. Tori or Tanaeya, when the shots aren't falling like they weren't today, how does that change your approach on the court to stay within distance?
TANAEYA BOCLAIR: I mean, like Coach Rob said, we put a lot of pressure on our defense, like we know when we're not making shots our defense is something we rely on, and something that is a big part of our team.  So when we're not getting stops on defense and we're not scoring on offense, I think we get a little frantic and everybody tries to make the home run play on offense, which just compounds the mistakes, so...
THE MODERATOR: Tori, would you like to add?
TORI WILLIAMS: Yeah, just going off of Tay, we really rely on our defense.  That's what we take pride in.  When we don't hit shots, I think that puts a ton of pressure on our defense.  And like Tay said, we just get frantic, and it just goes downhill from there.
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Utah.
