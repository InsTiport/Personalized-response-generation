Florida State - 51, Duke - 41   
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Florida State coach Sue Semrau and student-athlete Kiah Gillespie.  Coach, an opening statement.   
COACH SEMRAU: About this win, I know Duke has been playing extremely well.  Won their last four, hit 12 3s last night.  I thought our players did a great job of making sure they knew what the assignment was, what the game plan was and stuck to it the whole game.  We didn't shoot the ball extremely well but we rebounded it really well.  I think that was the difference in the game.   
THE MODERATOR: Questions?   
 Q.  You mentioned rebounding.  You're not a huge team.  Don't have any 6'5" or 6'6" players.  But you controlled the board.  How did that happen?  
COACH SEMRAU: That's what we talk about every day.  You don't have to be tall to be a warrior.  And we talked about toughness ever since the Clemson game.  And these kids have continued to grow every single game.   
 Q.  Let me ask you about the job you did on Miela Goodchild, who has been shooting lights out from 3.  She didn't get any looks at all today.  
COACH SEMRAU: I think our length on the perimeter was really -- and the speed that we had -- Morgan Jones is so long as a freshman.  Nausia Woolfolk has such great athleticism.  She had to play on Gorecki a lot.  And that put Nicki Ekhomu on Goodchild, and I thought she did a fantastic job.   
I really have to give credit to my assistant, Joy McCorvey, did a great job on the scout.  We were really well-prepared.   
Kiah had a double-double.  Anybody want to talk to her about that?  Thank you very much.
