  Auburn   54

THE MODERATOR:   We'll take an opening comment from coach and open it up for questions. 
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY:   Credit to Texas A&M.   I thought they came out and played extremely well right as the game began.   We didn't start the game like we wanted to start the game.   Just didn't play well tonight. 
THE MODERATOR:   Questions. 

Q.   It seemed like you weren't able to do the same things you did against them in Auburn.   Seemed like they got easy shots. 
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY:   Maybe so.   I mean, Texas A&M is too good of a team.   Gary Blair is too good of a coach.   They weren't going to come in and allow us to turn them over 27 times again.   They probably started working on the press offense a long time ago to make sure we didn't force them into as many turnovers as we did the first time. 

Q.   Talk about the shooting night tonight.   What was it like out there trying to score the ball? 
TYRESE TANNER:   Pretty tough.   We couldn't knock anything down.   They started their transition.   It just let them lead the game with a lot of points.   If we weren't scoring, they were scoring. 

Q.   Peyton, inside, they controlled the boards from the first tip.   Looked like Tra'Cee and yourself were having trouble with Karla.   What were they doing on the rebounding? 
PEYTON DAVIS:   We didn't push back on rebounds.   Coach told us from the get‑go we got to push them back.   We're not going to win the jumping war with them.   It's obvious they out‑rebounded us. 
I had five.   They had eight, seven, six.   That can't happen.   You can't win a game like that.   They killed us on the boards, so... 
That's just something that we've got to do better. 

Q.   Been kind of an up‑and‑down season.   Do you anticipate it going on in the WNIT?
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY:   You always want to play in post‑season, be it WNIT, NCAA tournament.   We're a very young team.   As much as you want to say we're in the second half of our season, regardless, we're a young team.   At one point we had four freshmen and a sophomore on the floor.   You're going to have ups and downs with young point guards, new point guards.   It's kind of to be expected. 
Our expectation is always to play hard regardless and always play defense.   Two things we didn't do completely tonight.   But we'll get better.   The young ones will grow up and they'll understand our expectations of our women's basketball program. 

Q.   Coach, can you talk about how it snowballed right away.   It started quick. 
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY:   I mean, 33, she was hot as soon as she took her first jump shot.   It's hard to even think about if we would have got stops.   You got to play a little bit harder.   You got to understand at that point once she hit her first two, you got to move a little bit closer, try to defend her a little bit better. 
But for a player like her, once she's on, she's on. 

Q.   Can you talk about the emotions right now.   You can see it in your face.   To go out in such a lopsided manner, what's going through your head right now? 
TYRESE TANNER:   I'm disappointed in how we played today.   I'm looking forward to the post‑season.   Hopefully we can play in the NIT. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
