<p>	Q.  What did you say to Marc to make him want to return, what were those conversations like and how did you convince him?</p>
<p>	Q.  What stood about Andrew versus American high school aged kids?</p>
<p>	Q.  Developmentally?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned the previous five games and much has been said and written about it in almost all of those because Kentucky won because they had better players.  Is there a talent difference this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is somebody preparing for Kentucky?  What are your impressions of what Chuck Hayes brings to that team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the trip to Australia to talk Andrew about coming to Utah.  That is obviously a long trip, and how much longer was it with your uncertainty?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ray, I was curious about the company you are keeping here with other three coaches.  Have you heard of them before, had any relationship with them?</p>
<p>	Q.  On the trip to Australia, how long were you on the ground?  Did it put a crunch in your recruiting budget?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the guards playing tomorrow, and how you are going to match up and particularly your impression of Rajon?</p>
<p>	Q.  Since expectations are pretty high this year, the Sweet 16 in your first season, are you concerned next year when Marc and Andrew may be gone, the expectation will remain the same and you might not have the tools?</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously you didn't know that Marc was going to be with you when you took the job.  I was wondering if he had to mend any fences with either you or his teammates when he came back to the team, or did he just get an automatic free pass to come back?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Andrew as a player, what were your expecting from his skills?  How has he competed?  In what ways has he gotten better this year?</p>

<p>	Q.  Andrew, you said in one of your statements you would love to spend the Drazen Petrovic.  What would you want to say to him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you beat him one on one?</p>
<p>	Q.  Marc, what about the playing for COACH Majerus made it so difficult for you that you wanted to come back?  What did COACH Giacoletti say to you to make you want to come back?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was in here talking about the big game in the Olympics against Greece against the big brawny center.</p>
<p>	Q.  I was curious when you came back to the basketball team how your teammates welcomed you back.  The COACH said you had some private moments with them before you were welcomed back.  Can you talk about their acceptance of you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Andrew, growing up were you aware of teams like Duke and Kentucky?  Do those names have any recognition in Australia?</p>
<p>	Q.  You actually played against Kentucky in Nashville two years ago.  You are aware of the blah-blah blah.  Why this time could it be different, and why if Kentucky knocked Utah out of the tournament how this time be different?</p>
<p>	Q.  What made you believe that you could better develop your skills in college this year than perhaps playing professionally in Europe?</p>
<p>	Q.  Question about the Australian Institute of Sports.  What part of your game was most developed with your time there, and now that you are in the headlines, how many people have asked you about it?</p>
<p>	Q.  No that you know how the NCAA tournament works do you think this of yours has the ability to win four more games? </p>
<p>	Q.  Andrew, have you played against anyone this year who has intimidated you?  If not, was part of it because you didn't pay attention to NCAA basketball when you were overseas?</p>
<p>	Q.  Marc, do you have any sense in the game that what people are clamoring for is to see Kentucky and Duke?</p>
<p>	Q.  Andrew, I was curious to know if Marc had to do any fence building or fence repairing with you, with him coming back?</p>
<p>	Q.  Along those lines, Marc, can you talk about how much easier he makes the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  We talked about how you were on the floor the last time that Utah played Kentucky. </p>
<p>	Q.  Marc, when you were working with your uncle, did you think it could get back to any point like this?</p>
