  MIKE FINN:   We're now joined by Maryland assistant basketball coach Scott Spinelli.   Coach, just a brief opening statement and then we'll go to questions. 
COACH SPINELLI:   Obviously on our end, kind of disappointed a little bit in terms of our performance, especially on the glass against Duke on Saturday.   Give Duke credit.   They out‑muscled us, were able to convert a lot of second chances against us.   They had 21 points off of second‑chance opportunities. 
With that we like the progression of our team.   Lost Pe'Shon Howard to a season‑ending injury.   We played nine games without him, so our team is used to playing without Pe'Shon.   Overall, that's where we're at today. 

Q.   After the game was over, there were some tweets going back and forth with Terrell Stoglin.   Was he talked to about that Twitter at all and is there any policy regarding players using Twitter after games?
COACH SPINELLI:   Everything is fine on this end.   Coach Turgeon handled that with our team on Saturday.   The policy here is Coach Turgeon really wants his guys or our players to mature and he allows them to use social media networks like Twitter as part of being a young college student and maturing, so they should be able to handle it. 
So Coach Turgeon has handled it.   All is fine on this end.   He talked to the team after the game on Saturday.   I think sometimes, as you know after a loss, everybody is frustrated.   But he's handled it and our team has accepted what he said to them and everything is fine here. 

Q.   About the game itself, did coach talk at all to Terrell himself about his shot selection?   I know Terrell has made a lot of progress, that seemed possibly to be a step back in terms of his shots. 
COACH SPINELLI:   Not really.   I think Terrell is a competitor.   Coach Turgeon and him have a great relationship.   I think coach has allowed Terrell at certain times to kind of take shots that, again, as long as they're in the context of offense, coach has allowed him to take a lot of shots. 
I think at the same time when Terrell gets it going, as we all know, he can get on a roll.   Coach being the former player that he was, he understands that. 
Again, he's talked to Terrell quite a few times during the course of the season about sometimes being a little bit overaggressive.   At the same time on Saturday's game, I think coach has talked to him more about the Twitter stuff. 
Again, Terrell is a competitor, he wants to win just like all of us.   But at the same time I think coach and him have a great relationship, and he allows Terrell to get it going at times during the game.   On Saturday obviously he didn't have one of his better games. 

Q.   I know Mychal Parker struggled a little bit as a freshmen.   Some of the Maryland guys said they thought that was his best performance of the season.   Did you see him doing anything that you've been looking for and could that be a breakout performance for him?
COACH SPINELLI:   He did have a very good offensive game on Saturday.   It was encouraging to see that.   Mych was six‑for‑six from the free‑throw line, obviously hasn't shot a great percentage throughout his first couple years here.   He played with a lot more confidence, a lot more swagger, especially on offense.   It was good to see that. 
Again, I think in Mych's case now that Pe'Shon is out, obviously Coach Turgeon has talked to him about assuming a more aggressive role.   He stepped up Saturday, and hopefully that game Saturday carries over to Thursday night's game benefits Boston College. 
Mike is long.   He's athletic.   He's got a lot of skill.   He was highly touted coming out of high school.   Much with our team, confidence has a lot to do with the success of these guys.   In Mych's case, hopefully he can build on that performance on Saturday.   He did have a very good game.   Encouraging to see that. 
I think all season long we've been trying to do, especially in his case, instill a little bit more of a defensive mindset with that long, athletic body of his.   He's got quick feet.   Coach Turgeon has tried to stress and emphasize that he gets after it defensively and at the same time plays with more confidence on offense, which he did on Saturday. 
MIKE FINN:   Coach, thanks for being with us.   Good luck this week.   We'll talk to Coach Turgeon next Monday.
COACH SPINELLI:   Thank you.
