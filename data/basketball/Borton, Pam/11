 THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening statement from Coach Borton, then go to the student-athletes for questions.   
 COACH BORTON: Obviously we're very disappointed with the second half that we had defensively and offensively. I think shooting 20 percent doesn't help you win basketball games.   
 And I thought a lot of things broke down defensively in the second half with a lot of penetration, and offensive boards. You know, having 22 turnovers didn't help. I thought Penn State did a great job and wish them good luck for the rest of the tournament.  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions for China, please.   
  
  Q. You came in and you sparked them a little bit with some 3-pointers and then after that really didn't get a spark from any other player. Was it the turnover that hurt your offensive verve?  
 CHINA ANTOINE: Yeah, I think we just had a rut where we didn't score and that caused us a little bit of problems. But after we tried to regroup and tried to focus in on what we had to do and came back and went on a run ourselves. But unfortunately we couldn't finish the game out.   
  
  Q. Brittany, obviously coming into the tournament, you guys knew what you had to do to make a run, to have a chance at the post-season. Can you talk about the mindset coming into this game, just having to think about making a run?   
 BRITTANY MCCOY: I think we had a positive mindset. We knew this was something we could do, make a run at this tournament. Take it one at a time and look at the bigger picture, know we had a pretty good draw and we had a good opportunity to win it all.   
 I think people's minds are in the right place, and unfortunately we just didn't get the win today.  
  
  Q. Can you talk about what you'll learn from this year? I know it's been a rough year in the Big Ten play especially.   
 CHINA ANTOINE: Absolutely. I think the seniors this year showed us a lot. They showed us how to stay as a team and they kept us as a team, even though we were struggling. So I learned a lot from the seniors and their leadership that they brought to us as the younger players and as the future of the team.   
 So I'm proud to have played with them and they've helped me and helped the rest of the team get through this. And I think that's the main thing we learned from this.  
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll continue with Coach Borton.   
  
  Q. Coach, what do you do as a coach, just talking to your team about coming to the tournament when you know you have to make a run otherwise the season is over? How do you get them prepared for that?  
 COACH BORTON: You talk about this is a new season. The Big Ten has been tough this year from No. 1 to No. 11. I think it's the first time in a long time that every team has won six games in the Big Ten, and I think it really depends on your match-ups. And it was a new season. We knew we had to win four games in a row, but just coming in with a positive mindset and trying to get everybody to play on the same night.  
 That's been our issue all night, just getting everybody to show up on the same night and have a little bit of consistency. So we knew it was going to be one and done. And we came in and we were going to go out fighting.  
  
  Q. What did you tell the team afterward? I know you've been having a lot of speeches after games, trying to keep the morale up and trying to keep them from totally breaking down. But this is it. What was the kind of final words for the team?  
 COACH BORTON: I think, you know, this isn't how we wanted to end the year. We've had a tough season. It's been a disappointing season.   
 But for the seniors just mention that they've had a great four years with memories and three post-seasons, and the friendships and they've given a lot to this program and for everybody that's coming back, we've got a lot of work to do.   
 We've got a lot of work to do to right the ship. It's going to take a whole lot of hard work, but hopefully we've learned a lot about ourselves throughout the course of the year and -- to fix things for next year.  
  
  Q. You mentioned the 20 percent shooting. Did you feel you got the looks you wanted, or do you think they took you away from some of the good shots you had in the first half?  
 COACH BORTON: I think about all the layups we missed. I thought we had some wide-open outside shots that normally go down. I thought we got some looks. I thought there was very few bad shots that we took throughout the course of the second half. And we have struggled shooting the ball.   
 And you've got to be able to make layups. You've got to be able to go to a post player inside to score pretty easily. We've really depended on making a lot of outside shots this year and just being able to finish in the lane has been an issue.   
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.
