Q.  Obviously you spent a lot of time on this winning strategy.  Can you talk about that? 
 
SHAWN MARION:  I said we were going to win.  
 
Q.  I heard you. 
 
SHAWN MARION:  Oh, okay.  (Laughter). 
 
Q.  But you lied to me before.  No, I'm just kidding. 
 
SHAWN MARION:  No, I didn't.  
 
Q.  How much did you attribute to --
 
DAN MAJERLE:  I contribute it to Diana starting us off right, and obviously making a long one pretty early helps, but I think we shattered the record? 
 
SHAWN MARION:  Yeah, by 21 seconds I heard, hey.  
 
Q.  Were you guys that fast in practice? 
 
DIANA TAURASI:  Actually we were slow in practice, what did we get, 42?  We were slow.  
 
DAN MAJERLE:  42. 
 
DIANA TAURASI:  Which still would have got first.  
 
Q.  How much fun was it? 
 
DAN MAJERLE:  Oh, it was a blast for me, just to be back.  I haven't been in an All-Star Game since '95, so it's good to be back and see everybody and see the events.  I've got my two little ones here, so they are going to have a blast.  It was great for me.  
 
Q.  How much did it compare to that shot you hit against the Lakers in '92 '93? 
 
DAN MAJERLE:  Doesn't compare at all. 
 
DIANA TAURASI:  This is a lot better, huh?  
 
DAN MAJERLE:  As soon as I get that check, it's going to be a lot better.  
 
Q.  Were you surprised you still fit in your uniform in?
 
DAN MAJERLE:  That's a low blow, but I think they gave me Charles' (Barkley) old uniform because this is really big on me, a lot of room in there? 
 
Q.  What were you guys thinking, you all said before you went out there to win, but did you realize you were going to it do this quickly? 
 
DIANA TAURASI:  During the run-through we were serious about it.  I mean we wanted to win it. 
 
DAN MAJERLE:  I thought we had a good chance because all three of us can get the ball at the basket from half-court.  Seriously I think if I didn't make it, one of these two would have made it right behind me.  That was the biggest thing because all three of us could have made that shot, and that was the key to it.  Plus we know we have a lot of Phoenix people here for the All-Star Game, and we wanted to start it right to represent Phoenix and we have a few people in the Dunk Contest, and the 3-point shootout and the Skills Challenge.  It will be good to see Phoenix do well.  
 
SHAWN MARION:  We'll win them all.  I ain't playing.  
 
Q.  What do events like this add to the whole All-Star Weekend?  And what does it mean in addition to the game? 
 
DIANA TAURASI:  It's just fun for the fans come out and see us go out there and fun and not in serious mode like they see us in game time, so we think it's great for the fans.  At the same time we joke around with Magic, Dan.  For myself, I grew up watching them play and now Shawn.  It's a great experience for myself.  
 
Q.  Is that a shot you perfected in practice back in the day? 
 
DAN MAJERLE:  No, I've always had pretty good range so that's a shot that has not bothered me at all.  I was surprised, the second one went in because like I said I haven't been shooting at all, so it's not like I'm in very good shape.  
 
SHAWN MARION:  Man, don't believe that.  You've been shooting, playing pick-up every other week.  
 
DIANA TAURASI:  I see him at the Phoenix Y.
