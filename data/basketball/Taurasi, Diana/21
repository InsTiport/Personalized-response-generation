<p>	Q.  Diana, I saw you and Jess looking at the stats and shaking your head; what do you see on the paper that you didn't see on the court?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the last play when they came down court, what were you thinking at that point in time, and did you get a hand to the ball when she went up with it?</p>

<p>	Q.  Diana, down 9 with about 12-and-a-half to play; what are you thinking there mentally?</p>
<p>	Q.  Geno, you have often said that you have Diana and nobody else does; can you talk about some of the plays that she made down the stretch tonight.  I think she had 11 points in the last 9 minutes or something?</p>
<p>	Q.  I'm (Inaudible) flexing your biceps looking strong; you guys weren't that strong, you got those boards, games, open summer weight room; is that what you think or is it pure heart (Inaudible).</p>
<p>	Q.  Is it fair to say this is a top-5, top-10 win for you?   You've won 500, but this was pretty good?</p>
<p>	Q.  Geno, could you speak to the contributions from Willnett Crockett?</p>
