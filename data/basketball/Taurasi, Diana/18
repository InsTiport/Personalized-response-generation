<p>	Q.  Coach, there seems to be a conditioned feeling that you and Tennessee will again wind up playing for the championship game.  In this season, should we not be surprised by whoever wins this tournament? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, two things, one for you and one for Barbara.  What do you suspect Willnett Crockett's contributions are going to have to be against the big center, and Barbara, for you, having played with Lindsay Whalen, can you compare her to Diana and in terms of her style and her impact on a team? </p>

<p>	Q.  Diana, Shannon Bolden talked about an experience you guys had last summer at the Nike camp, and she said you and her played a little pick-up game every now and then.  Can you talk about that and what you remember about that. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, have you thought at all about how much things have changed for you and your program since your first Final Four in New Orleans, and also what do you remember about that first trip here?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, in the last game it really didn't matter, you won, but you didn't get a lot of offensive production from anyone that's not sitting up there.  How important is it to get offensive production in the Final Four from some of your role players?</p>
<p>	Q.  Yeah?</p>
<p>	Q.  That's my buddy.</p>
<p>	Q.  This is for Geno and Diana, and this may have been asked earlier, but seeing as how Tennessee is the only No. 1 seed here, is the Evil Empire the favorite this weekend?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, along the same lines of the role player, Ann didn't score any points in the last game, but talk a little bit about what she does without the ball away from the ball defensively that has been helping you.</p>

<p>	Q.  The question for Diana and maybe Barbara both, do you feel like based on the history of the past few with as amazing a run as your program has had, when you guys step on the floor to start a game, do you almost have a maybe a mental edge over your opponents that they are thinking, I don't know if we can hang with these guys? </p>

<p>	Q.  Geno, I wanted to ask you, how much it helps for a team to have come here so many times and know what to expect in this tournament and does it give you an advantage over Minnesota since they have never been here before?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you answered pretty much my question, but I wanted to come at it another way, if I can.  What do you like better, do you like playing a team that you haven't played, at this stage of the tournament?  Do you like playing a team you haven't played or and also for the players, or would you rather play a team that you have touched before?</p>




<p>	Q.  Coach, the Tennessee Lady Vols, seeding aside and the names aside, was this a team that you looked at in the preseason as a team like their old juggernauts of the past or how impressive has the coaching job and the progress that they have made this year, losing Loree Moore and having some injuries and some other things, to get to this point with this team?</p>
<p>	Q.  I would like to ask the players, I believe only one team, I believe it's Tennessee has won three consecutive championships.  Is that a motivation for you this weekend or is it just this is a championship this year to win? </p>

<p>	Q.  Geno, how much sharper mentally has your team become since the tournament began the NCAA Tournament began and how long does a regular season become when you're trying to defend a national championship?</p>
<p>	Q.  Geno, I know you've been asked before about comparisons and whether Minnesota reminds you of Notre Dame in 2001, if they remind you at all of any of your teams in the past, would it be more your first Final Four team, or the '95 national championship team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, how does your guys' experience affect your ability just to focus on tomorrow instead of looking at it as two games?</p>
<p>	Q.  Diana, you've been here so many times, the UConn players, the Tennessee players are used to sitting up there.  How big of an advantage is it over the kids from Minnesota and LSU just to be in this environment to be able to handle it?  </p>
<p>	Q.  Diana, after watching film of Minnesota, did anything surprise you about them? </p>
<p>	Q.  Diana and Coach, could you guys kind of address how your personal relationship has developed this year as opposed to maybe previous seasons? </p>
