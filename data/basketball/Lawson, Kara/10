<p>	Q.  Kara, I would like to ask you since there have been so real battles with this Connecticut team what is it they that they do offensively that makes them this difficult to defend?</p>
<p>	Q.  Both players congratulations on a great career, can both of you or one of you talk about the challenges guarding Taurasi presented tonight.  You mentioned too many 3's, she seem to have some big shots tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  To either one of you, are you disappointed to being this close to a National Championship?</p>
<p>	Q.  Kara, it looked like in the second half you really came out with the intent of being more aggressive; is that something that you guys discussed at half time?</p>
<p>	Q.  Yes, this is for Gwen, you obviously had a very emotional month on and off the court.  I want to know now that it's over what it's been like for you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Some of Connecticut's writers are talking about them needing another player to step up and hit some big shots; can you talk about what Strother meant to them today?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, in the middle 90s you were the program that everybody had to catch and right now Connecticut appears to be the program that everybody has to catch; you have made changes this year from your offense and how you shuffled your players.  What else do you think you are going to have to try to catch Connecticut?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, Kara only had 3 points in the first half and came out with much more intensity in the second; can you talk about the difference in her play in the second half?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, it seemed like in the middle to late 90s Chamique was the one players had to catch; Diana Taurasi, is she sort of the hump you have to get over?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you had many different lineups, some interesting arrangements out there especially late in the first half; can you comment on that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you talked about Ann Strother's performance.  I was wondering could evaluate it in the context of her being a freshman and what she looked like out there?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, the first the nine minutes, Diana is scoreless, she is not going go scoreless the whole game, what got her going after that point?</p>
<p>	Q.  From a coaching standpoint what do you see again that Connecticut is able to do that makes them difficult to defeat?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you talked about Ann Strother's affect on the game tonight; what about the other players, Maria Conlon and Barbara Turner both in double figures tonight?</p>
