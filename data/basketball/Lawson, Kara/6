<p>	Q.  Nicole, last year you was with a team -- well, let's not get into that.  But how do you feel now?  Last year you was frustrated with your playing time on the East Coast but this year now you're a champion.  Tell us about it. </p>
<p>	Q.  You were a little worried about making the team, too?</p>
<p>	Q.  Kara, this team was, had so many things to get over this season.  With your injury in the very first game, and then DeMya and then Ticha in the playoffs and everything like that, did it just make you guys tougher?  Is that what happened? </p>
<p>	Q.  How great is it not only to win a championship but to win it here on the home floor at ARCO Arena and in front of such a great crowd tonight?  Kara, why don't you go first .</p>

<p>	Q.  You two are the hired guns for the Monarchs.  In the second half, you didn't make a three until the second half.  Were you looking to hit a big shot to get the team from the offensive doldrums, to get them going?  I think you hit the first three, right?  Nicole?  And so what were you looking for, the three or was it just something that happened? </p>
