<p>	Q.  Wayne, can you talk about how Aaron stepped up, especially with the absence of Keith?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you get the feeling at all that being up and down lately and then to have Keith out that you really needed to do something to kind of hold it together tonight to play well to do that? </p>

<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Michael Lee and how he was able to contribute tonight; he didn't make a field goal but he did so much else out there?</p>

<p>	Q.  Update on Keith for tomorrow?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked a little bit about the impressiveness and magnitude of the streak -- (inaudible)</p>
<p>	Q.  Bill, you talk a little bit about as a coach the intangibles guys have to do.  Talk about what Michael Lee did tonight without even making a field goal?</p>

<p>	Q.  Could you talk about your decision to go with Alex Galindo down the stretch during that long stretch second half?</p>
<p>	Q.  Probably recognizing they would play zone and not having Langford, that slashing ability, did you anticipate a game where you'd shoot this many three-pointers, more than half your shots?</p>
<p>	Q.  You played Jeff Hawkins a lot early.  Can you talk about his contributions tonight and also his progress over the last couple of months?</p>
