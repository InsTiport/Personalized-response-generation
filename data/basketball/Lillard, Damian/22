 Q.  Before you got your own shoe, would you consider yourself a sneaker-head?  DAMIAN LILLARD: Not really.  I don't follow all every shoe.  I see what I like.   Q.  Are you wearing sneakers?  DAMIAN LILLARD: I'm wearing my shoes.   Q.  March is Women's History Month, is there a woman, not a relative, in history that has inspired you?  DAMIAN LILLARD: Rosa Parks.   Q.  And why?  DAMIAN LILLARD: For standing up for herself.  It's the best thing.  In the world we live in it's big to stand up and speak for yourself.  That gesture by her had such a huge time in our history.  People don't give it as much credit as it's worth.   Q.  What's the story behind your number?  DAMIAN LILLARD: I wear No. 0 because I'm from Oakland.  I went to school in Ogden, Utah.  And now I'm playing in Oregon.   Q.  What is it like to be a replacement All-Star?  Was it hard for you to accept it after the fact you weren't selected originally?  DAMIAN LILLARD: No, because I expressed how I feel about it.  The opportunity came regardless of how it came.  I felt like I had earned the right to be a part of it.  So that was kind of after.  There was nothing to be gained acting like I didn't want to be here because I didn't get picked right away.  At the end of the day I'm here.  I'm thankful for that.   Q.  (Inaudible) .  DAMIAN LILLARD: I think this one -- before I got put on the team it hurt a little bit more because I didn't make it.  Like I said, it all worked out.
