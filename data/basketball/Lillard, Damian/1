Q. On his childhood friend from Oakland, Juan Toscano-Anderson, who recently signed with the Warriors:
DAMIAN LILLARD: Yeah, I'm just really happy for him. We grew up together. I grew up on 98th. He's on 95th. Just to see his route. He got so much better in high school. We played for the same AAU team. Then him going to school, playing in Mexico, and just him being in the G League and finally getting that opportunity, I'm super happy for him and his family.
Q. Damian, it's a shame we can't see you play in the All-Star Game, but what can we expect from Dame D.O.L.L.A.?
DAMIAN LILLARD: It's a shame I can't play in the All-Star Game because that's what I'm here for. I'm going to miss the 3-Point, but it also gives me something to do. It gives me an opportunity to show my versatility and what the NBA is becoming and give us a chance to put our other passions on this huge platform. So I'm excited about the performance too.
Q. Just touch on the advice you've given Devin [Booker] and how excited you are for him.
DAMIAN LILLARD: Like I said, I'm a huge fan of Devin Booker. I watch a lot of their games just because I like to watch him play. But I felt like, once I knew I wasn't going to be able to play, it was an opportunity for somebody else who was deserving in the first place to be here, and I thought he deserved to be here originally. So I'm really happy for him to get his first one.
Just watching his demeanor and how he interacts and the things that he says, I assume that he probably would be like, I don't know if I want to go. So when I spoke to him, I told him, you need to go. Just go. So I'm happy he's going to be here.
Q. How was the experience to be the first team to play the Los Angeles Lakers after the death of Kobe Bryant?
DAMIAN LILLARD: Being the first team to play the Lakers after the death of Kobe was emotional. It was a tough game to be a part of. Just, you know, the icon that Kobe was and how hard of a time that was. Everything that they did before the game, I think made it tough, but I felt like we honored him the way we should and going out there and competing and leaving it on the floor because it's family and friends close to him who are going to feel the impact of that a lot more than we ever could.
So I tried not to make it about how we felt and how we hurt for him and just go out there and honor him in the way we could, and I thought we did that.
