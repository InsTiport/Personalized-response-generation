 Q.   How is the weekend going so far for you?  
DAMIAN LILLARD:   It's going well.   It's been exciting going through the whole process.   Growing up as a kid I was such a fan of this whole event.   And now I'm a part of it being in the NBA, I'm just trying to go out there and have some fun.   I think as long as everybody is having fun, everything will play itself out.   
   
 Q.   What do you expect your team to do in the second half?     
DAMIAN LILLARD:   I think we have a real shot at it for the playoffs.   We've got some home games coming up, and if we put some wins together, we might be able to turn it around.
