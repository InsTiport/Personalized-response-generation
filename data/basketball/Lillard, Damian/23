Q.   How is your experience to join all these guys tonight?
DAMIAN LILLARD:   So far it's been really busy, but it's been an exciting time so far.   I'm happy that I'm really a part of the weekend, I get to compete in all these events, and just to be in these guys' company with all these stars.   It let's you know that the hard work is playing off. 

Q.   You're the latest in a long line of point guards to play in the NBA from Oakland.   What does that lineage and heritage mean to you?
DAMIAN LILLARD:   It means everything.   You come from Oakland, it's, that alone means something, just being from Oakland.   Our success as basketball players has been at the point guard position.   They have always excelled in the NBA, with Jâ€‘Kidd and Brian Shaw and Gary Payton. 
So for me to be from Oakland and to be in the NBA, I know I got to represent that and take pride in being a point guard from Oakland. 

Q.   Are you surprised at how quickly the Warriors have gotten so good?
DAMIAN LILLARD:   I wouldn't say quickly, because I was a Warriors fan growing up and it seemed like it took forever.   But then over the last couple years they just made a jump and Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and all those guys that they brought in, they really changed that team.   And they're a great team now. 

Q.   What's it like to play against Curry?   A lot of guys say he's the best shooter they have ever seen.   Would you agree with that?
DAMIAN LILLARD:   I would.   I think he's the best shooter that has been in the league in a long time.   And it's tough to play against him, because he has a great handle, he can pass the ball, trying to catch up to him and guard him, he just raises up and shoots from anywhere.   And all you can do is hope it don't go in.
