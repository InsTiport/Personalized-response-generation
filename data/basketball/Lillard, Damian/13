 Q.  How do you feel about being in the All-Star Game?  
DAMIAN LILLARD: Like I said, it's always an honor to be considered among the best players in the league.  Being here twice before and having to go and get it and make it a third time the way that I had to, it made it even better.   
 Q.  So many Chinese young players like the style you play and your team plays.  Do you have some advice for them?  
DAMIAN LILLARD: Like rising stars players?   
 Q.  Like young players.  
DAMIAN LILLARD: Just keep working.  Just keep working.  I'm a product of that.  I wasn't highly recruited.  I didn't go to a high major school.  Wasn't expected to have a great career in the NBA.   
So I've always just depended on my foundation, which is my work ethic and my trust and belief in myself.  It's guided me to where I am now.  I would encourage all kids to have that type of foundation because it's something you can always lean on.   
 Q.  Speaking of that and young kids, Donovan Mitchell, someone I know you've said some good things about, I'm with the Jazz, what have you seen from him?  
DAMIAN LILLARD: I think obviously every draft pick that comes into the league has talent, a lot of confidence, usually.  But it's different when they're able to perform, not only from starting in the league, but to be able to do it consistently all the way up to this break we've had.   
We've played at least 60 games, and he's still going strong and getting better.  Not just individually, but their team has won 10 or 11 games straight.  So I think that says a lot about the type of player he is.
