  Q. How important was last night's win in Game 3?  And about you, how big of a responsibility is replacing Goran Dragic?
 TYLER HERRO:   I think last night's win was probably our biggest win of the playoffs.  Obviously we played in some big games, but last night we definitely needed that one.
 You know, it's a different series if we go down 3-0 opposed to cut the deficit to 2-1.
 Last night was a must-win for us and we did what we were supposed to do, but there is a lot more games, three more games that we need to win.
 So we're going to get back to work today and make some adjustments and be ready for Game 4.
 Q. And about the snarl during the game, what can you say about that?
 TYLER HERRO:   The snarl?  I kind of just did it.  I've never really made that face before, like ever in my really entire life.  Kind of just happened in the midst of things, in the moment.
 Just how it is when you're a competitor.
