 THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Jordan.
 Q. What was the conversation like after the first quarter, trying to get back on track?
 JORDAN LEWIS:   I mean, we didn't start the game well obviously.  I think we let them come out and push us around.  I think we just had to get a timeout, sit down and reset.  Once we reset and decided we wanted to fight back, we just played our game, what we do.  We just can't get down like that at the beginning.
 Q. Now you look forward to the selection show, the NCAA tournament.  What is the plan over this next week as you kind of try to reset and prepare?
 JORDAN LEWIS:   I think we just need to go home and just rest our minds, our bodies, just restart.  It's a new season.  It's season three.  It's post-season.  So I think nothing matters that you did before because everyone's fighting for the same thing at this point.
 I think you just have to go home, rest, reset, get your bodies right to play, and fight hard because that's what it's going to come down to.
 THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, Jordan.
