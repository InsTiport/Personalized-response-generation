 Q.  Coach, I wanted to ask you just about an experience for you, what it was like coaching out there these All-Stars and Kobe's final All-Star Game?  
TYRONN LUE: It was a great experience for me.  I was just honored and privileged to have an opportunity to coach these guys and enjoy this weekend with them, and then being Kobe's last All-Star Game, it was a great experience for me.   
 Q.  Coach, can you talk about Paul George and his performance?  
TYRONN LUE: Well, PG and John Wall, they were serious.  They weren't messing around tonight.  They took the game more serious than everybody else did, and you could see the outcome with Paul.  I think he had 41, I think.   
 Q.  Did you talk about Wilt's record and trying to break it for him?  Did you realize Paul was that close to it?  
TYRONN LUE: No, we didn't.  We talked about him breaking Carmelo's record of eight threes, and I think PG had nine threes, so Carmelo was talking stuff about that.   
 Q.  LeBron played 20 minutes tonight.  Was that by design?  Did he tighten up or what happened there?  
TYRONN LUE: Before the game he just said he wanted to play six minutes in the quarter, in the fourth quarter.  If it was close, in reach, he'd play more minutes.  Just talking to Carmelo, D-Wade and LeBron, once it got out of hand, just sent the young guys in to play and let them enjoy it.
