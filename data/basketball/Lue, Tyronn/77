 Q.  Has there been any sense from you over the the first two games that guys were getting away from the game plan?  Was that part of the problem in either game?  
TYRONN LUE: Well, we just need to execute the game plan better.  I wouldn't say getting away from it.  I just think the way they play puts you in some bad positions, some bad spots.  But I wouldn't say getting away from it.  Just we need to execute it better.   
 Q.  Are you ready to announce who is starting in place of Kevin tonight or are you going to wait on that?  
TYRONN LUE: RJ [Richard Jefferson].   
 Q.  And I guess why RJ?  What did you like about that?  
TYRONN LUE: Just like his physicality, able to catch the ball, straight-line drive, moves well without the basketball when we get stagnant.  Just going off his last game in Game 2, I thought he really played well, and that's who we decided to go with.   
 Q.  I think you said after Game 1 you want to try to get more minutes for Channing and he actually played less in Game 2.  Is it a matchup thing or is that a point of emphasis tonight in trying to get him on the floor more without Kevin there?  How are you viewing Channing right now?  
TYRONN LUE: Yeah, it's a matchup thing, but we've got to do a better job getting him on the floor.  We know how lethal he is when he's making shots.  When we put him in the game, they immediately go small.  But we need to find ways to keep him on the floor.   
 Q.  Coach, we've seen a lot of side action, and they kind of closed off the weak side from you guys.  I wonder if we might see some flat screens or corner action to try to take full advantage of the middle of the floor.  
TYRONN LUE: We're going to try to do some things to take advantage of that.  They do a good job switching 1 through 5, and making you try to play one-on-one.  So we've got to take advantage of our mismatches and just play the game.   
 Q.  How vital is it tonight to get off to a quick, early, confident start, set the tone for the Cavs to get back into this series?  
TYRONN LUE: It's very important.  As you come out at home, play very well throughout the Playoffs, and just to play well early, I think means a lot.  Just being aggressive, being physical.  Starting the game like we started at Golden State when it was 21-19 in the first quarter.  Just being aggressive, being confident, and playing with a lot of pace.   
 Q.  Ty, last couple of days there's been a lot of conversation about the offense and getting back to who you guys are.  But through two games, how would you assess the defense, and how many changes or what kind of changes do you feel like you need to make going into tonight?  
TYRONN LUE: Well, I think our offense affects our defense at times.  When you're not scoring the basketball or you're turning the basketball over, they're able to get out in transition and get easy baskets or they're always playing in transition.  So if we're able to score the basketball, we're able to get back and get our defense set, which would be better for us.   
 Q.  Are there any other potential lineup changes planned for tonight?  
TYRONN LUE: No, sir.   
 Q.  I understand you were preparing in case Kevin Love was not able to play with Richard Jefferson, starting with the first unit.  Were you not disappointed, but were you looking forward or did you think there was a good chance that Love would have played tonight?  What was your mindset on approaching this and what was your mindset after learning of Love's fate?  
TYRONN LUE: Well, the approach is you have to go through the protocol.  We know Kevin wants to play, he's eager to play.  He's frustrated that he's not able to play.  But that's the protocol and that's how we're trying to protect our players nowadays in the NBA.  That's just what it is.  So someone else has to step up right now.   
 Q.  Does it seem like it's dÃ©jÃ  vu all over again with the NBA Finals, what happened with you guys last year?  
TYRONN LUE: I mean, it's part of the game.  Injuries are a part of the game, and someone else has to step up and be ready to play.   
 Q.  I'm just wondering if you are kind of like LeBron and don't read or listen to all what's going on, what's being said?  There's been a lot of second-guessing about lineups and styles and going big or going small.  Do you tune that out?  
TYRONN LUE: No, I don't care.  They should be coaches.   
 Q.  I'm going to guess that this means LeBron starts at the 4?  
TYRONN LUE: Yes.   
 Q.  Is that the best place for him in this series, just with the way the Warriors play small and fast?  Are you better served with LeBron at the 4?  
TYRONN LUE: We've tried a lot of different lineups that haven't worked, so we've been big, we've been small.  But putting LeBron at the 4 and trying to match their speed I think will help us out a lot tonight.   
 Q.  When you're going through a situation like you've had with Kevin, you sort of touched on this a little bit already, but do you try multiple options?  Do you pick one option and test it and then maybe think of something else?  How do you approach when you're not sure if you're going to have a guy, how do you start figuring out a replacement?  
TYRONN LUE: We start with RJ and just try to see how the flow of the game goes.  If it doesn't work out, you have to make an adjustment.  So to start the game, we feel confident in what we have on the floor right now.  If it doesn't work, you always have to make an adjustment.   
 Q.  I'm sorry, I meant as you're trying to game-plan?  Like the days in between Game 2 and Game 3, in your mind did you say, RJ's our guy, let's start working it?  Do you try different things?  What's your process toward deciding?  
TYRONN LUE: Yeah, yesterday we started some different things and went over some different things with RJ being in the lineup, and today we reviewed everything, so, yes.   
 Q.  A lot of discussion about J.R., great Playoffs but hasn't fired in The Finals yet.  It appears that you're sticking with him today.  Why have you got that faith?  
TYRONN LUE: Because with J.R. on the floor they're standing next to him, like we're doing with Klay and Steph.  They have to guard him.  That gives us driving lanes on his side of the floor with Kyrie and LeBron.  They attack.  They're not leaving J.R. at all.  So it gives us spacing.   
In order for J.R. to be effective with the way they play defense, we've got to be more aggressive in transition to get him open shots.   
 Q.  I guess we'll see if we can get you to open your entire playbook.  Is LeBron going to guard Draymond then or how does that --  
TYRONN LUE: Come on, Joe?  God dang, man (smiling).   
 Q.  Draymond has been a tough matchup for you guys, regardless of who is on him.  He guarded Kevin a lot.  He guarded LeBron last year some.  I'm curious how you approach that?  
TYRONN LUE: Just got to do a better job on him.
