 Q.  The Cavs have shot 29% from three-point range in the last three games.  Are you happy with the quality of looks you're getting?  Do you think it's a matter of at some point they're going to go down, or are some of them too contested?  Why do you think the struggle from beyond the arc when it's been such an important part of your offense?  
TYRONN LUE: Well, two games before our last game here, I thought we got some really good looks.  The game here, Game 1, we had some shots.  But we could have put the ball on the floor and attacked.  I thought we rushed some threes.  When they were flying out and trying to contest, we could have put the ball back on the floor.  We got some decent looks, but not as good as we did the two previous games.  So we've got to do a better job with that.   
 Q.  Game 1, the way it ended, I can imagine that most coaches would not sleep that night after that.  Given your time off earlier this season, did you develop strategies to help you just kind of get over some of those tough losses and be able to get the rest and the recovery that you need to head into Game 2?  
TYRONN LUE: I think everyone was pretty upset the way the game ended that night.  But I thought the next day we did a good job of having a team dinner, the guys bonded, having a good time.  Yesterday, having a good practice, coming together and cleaning up some of the mistakes that we made in Game 1.  So we're in a good place right now.
