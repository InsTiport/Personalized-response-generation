Q. You talked all season and all through this postseason about how LeBron has been so good because you've been able to rest him at times and not always put him on the other team's best player and that sort of thing.  There aren't many places to hide him against this team.
COACH LUE: Those days are over.
Q. How do you expect that to impact him on the offensive end, when he is going to have to work much harder defensively?
COACH LUE: He'll be fine.  He's up for the challenge.  We know Kevin Durant is a tough guard, a tough matchup.  But Steph, Klay, Draymond, whoever you put him on is going to be a tough challenge.  So those days are over.
Q. You sort of are famous for holding stuff back through the years.  Have you held stuff back before this series like defensive coverages, plays that you want to run?
COACH LUE: No.
Q. At all?
COACH LUE: I mean, they're a tough team to play, and we understand that.  So a lot of things we've done over the last couple years, you're not going to be able to do the same things with Durant on the floor now.  Our coverage will change a little bit, but we just have to have a mindset to take care of the basketball, no turnovers, can't give them easy points and easy baskets because they're already a tough team to stop.  So we haven't really held a lot of things back, but we're excited and we're ready to go.
