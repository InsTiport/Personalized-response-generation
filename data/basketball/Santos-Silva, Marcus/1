 Q. Marcus, can you just kind of speak to what the Longhorns were able to do in the last four minutes?  Seemed like you had that five-point lead but you weren't able to find that basket to really separate that game there against them.
 MARCUS SANTOS-SILVA:   They were able to find their shooters off the pick-and-roll and they were able to -- they were out toughing us and they were getting second chance points, rebounding, and getting to the free-throw line.
 Q. Terrence, same thing:  What did you feel you did coming out into the second half that allowed you to take that lead?
 TERRENCE SHANNON:   I feel like we were aggressive and we knew that we were down and we were just trying to get back in the game, and I feel like we had like an urge to come back and take the lead.
 Q. Obviously not the result you wanted, but what do you take away from this knowing that there's still the NCAA Tournament and a new season for you to enter again?
 MARCUS SANTOS-SILVA:   Got to have that killer mentality, take care of the ball, make our free throws and box out and get stops on the defensive end.  If we want to continue in the NCAA Tournament.
 Q. Marcus, more specifically on that offensive end, what kind of disappeared in terms of what you guys were able to do offensively that final four minutes that allowed Texas to take that advantage?
 MARCUS SANTOS-SILVA:   Not finishing and not being aggressive to get to the free-throw line, I think.  I think at the end we missed like four easy lay-ups and we could have just jump stop and gotten fouled because they were jumping for everything.
 Q. For you, what allowed you to have that success for a lot of the game in terms of offensive rebounding against especially those two formidable Texas bigs?
 MARCUS SANTOS-SILVA:   Just being aggressive and attacking the offensive glass.  If I can't grab it, just tip it out to my teammates and just have that mentality the whole time.
