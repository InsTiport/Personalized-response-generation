 Q.  Discuss playing being a rookie and playing in The Finals. 
 DANIEL GIBSON:  It's great.  Everything right now, it's all new.  It's my first year playing in the NBA, playing on this stage, everything is new. 

 Q.  Is there something exciting about that or does it put additional pressure on you? 
 DANIEL GIBSON:  I never really put too much pressure on myself.  It's all just enjoying playing the game of basketball, enjoying the opportunities and just living in the moment. 

 Q.  How do you mentally prepare for tomorrow, something this big with so many people, all this media?  How do you stay focused? 
 DANIEL GIBSON:  You know, it's a matter of just preparing mentally, but overall it's tough to prepare for this, for the media.  But when it comes to playing basketball, it's all pretty much the same.  It's just something you've been doing for a long period of time, something that you're comfortable with, something that you enjoy doing.  So preparing for the game is a lot easier than preparing for after the game and before. 

 Q.  How does it feel to come back to Texas for The Finals? 
 DANIEL GIBSON:  Oh, it feels great.  It feels great.  To be playing in front of my family, playing in front of the awesome fans that are here with me in Texas, just to be playing in Texas, it's a great feeling. 

 Q.  Do you believe one year ago you were here and now one year later you're in the final? 
 DANIEL GIBSON:  It's just unbelievable.  Sometimes it's hard to even imagine that this is really happening to me.  I'm dreaming.  I don't want to wake up.
