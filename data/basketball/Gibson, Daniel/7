 Q.  Do you think the defense that the Spurs incorporated is quite different from the Pistons?  You got a lot of open shots against the Pistons, whereas last night you had guys that had their hands in your face. 
 DANIEL GIBSON:  That's how it's going to be.  I know things are going to close out, they're going to close outside shooting, try to shut down the paint on LeBron.  There's things that we did they'll have to adjust to and we'll try and capitalize on things they're trying to do, and we've got to take advantage of it. 

 Q.  Any indication that your minutes might be increased? 
 DANIEL GIBSON:  No. 

 Q.  What's your thoughts on that? 
 DANIEL GIBSON:  Me?  I mean, any opportunity I have to play, I'm going to go out there and give it everything I've got, whether it's 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 5 minutes.  Any time I'm on the floor, I'm going to play as hard as I can. 

 Q.  Given how fast Tony Parker was driving to the hoop, do you think if your minutes are increased that you can help shut him down? 
 DANIEL GIBSON:  I would just try to stay in front of him, try my best to try and keep him out of the paint.  I mean, he's a quick, quick guy, so it's going to take a lot of help on defense.  I don't think one guy can contain a guy like that.
