  Q.  Do you see yourself starting again in Game 4 after what happened the last game?   
 DANIEL GIBSON:  I don't know.  I never know.  I just try to go out, and whatever happens, we're prepared for it and ready to go.   
  
  Q.  (How difficult is it to play against a team this good?)   
 DANIEL GIBSON:  I mean, they're great.  They play well as a unit.  Everybody is where they need to be.  They do exactly what they were supposed to do on the defensive end.  They're out on a string.  Everybody is playing together.   
  
  Q.  (Inaudible).   
 DANIEL GIBSON:  I mean, they're a great team.  It's hard to compare them against another team, but they're a great team defensively.  I think that Cleveland has got a shot at figuring it out.   
  
  Q.  (Talk about the difference between coming off the bench and starting).   
 DANIEL GIBSON:  I mean, there's really not a difference.  When you're out there on the floor, you get an opportunity to get a feel for the game, and when you're on the bench you get that same opportunity to get a feel for the game.  I don't really think there's a difference; it's just a matter of going out there and doing what you need to do.   
  
  Q.  (What was the reason you're your sub-par performance last night?)   
 DANIEL GIBSON:  Just not shooting the ball, just not making shots, you know, just that's it.  I felt like the shots that I was taking were shots that I'm capable of making.  I've just got to step in and be confident and knock them down.
