<p>	Q.  Your thoughts on this team, another week of practice has gone by?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you kind of address the pre-season expectations that are already being put on this group?</p>
<p>	Q.  D-Gib, can you talk about J.D. Lewis and those other two guys, what you think they are going to add to the team this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just talk about having B.J. and LaMarcus back this year and what that will do to this team and how it will help you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about your frustration with the injury and the long rehab and when were you able to get back on the court?  You said that was your greatest moment. </p>
<p>	Q.  When did you get back on the court?  And isn't a hip injury or little old guys?</p>

<p>	Q.  Rivalry is with Oklahoma in football.  Wondering where that's headed in basketball?  Earlier today Coach Sampson was asked what it's going to take to get to the top of the Big 12, and I think he said (inaudible) quit and I think P.J. is probably going to class now.  Maybe a small shot.  Is that rivalry brewing in basketball like it might be in football? </p>




<p>	Q.  Are you ready to name your head coach (inaudible) now?</p>
<p>	Q.  LaMarcus, are you still having to do any kind of rehab at all?  If you didn't even know any better, would you have known that you hit your hip, judging the way it feels now? </p>






<p>	Q.  When we talked to you in Austin, you mentioned about what you went through.  It was a learning experience that made you stronger.  Elaborate on what you did go through last year and how that might motivate you more on the court this year?</p>






<p>	Q.  Talk about how you see you and LaMarcus working together in tandem?</p>
<p>	Q.  You kind of for many reasons had to shoulder a larger burden last year (inaudible) you kind of score this year.  Are you going to concentrate more?  Are you looking to distribute this year?  Is that kind of the route you want to go, kind of be the passer and let these other guys take a load off? </p>
