  Q. What's made the difference --  
 DANIEL GIBSON: It's great having somebody out here to look up to and he gets to the gym three hours before and he's always preaching, you know, the number of attempts you get, the more you shoot, the more comfortable you get with the shot. So it's all about repetition.  
 Normally I shoot more in the area where I am the majority of the game, but I try to get a feel all the way around.   
  
  Q. How glad were you to get the first half out of the way? You had a lot of lows and a couple of highs.   
 DANIEL GIBSON: I felt like it was a part of my platform. I wasn't in a rush to get it over with. I felt like it was a process that we needed and that was to get to the point we were at the break. We went through that tough stretch but right at the end, we won some key games.   
  
  Q. When you are shooting with that kind of special --  
 DANIEL GIBSON: When I first picked up the ball, my dad, I always told him, I had a knack for being able to put the ball in the basket, no matter how small I was or how big I was. He just told me, I had a knack for being able to shoot.   
  
  Q. Do you have any players you want to be like?  
 DANIEL GIBSON: When it comes to technique and shooting, I mean, they have to have the perfect jumpshot. But Chauncey Billups is somebody, the way he handles the ball and shoots.   
  
  Q. Do you have your own technique?  
 DANIEL GIBSON: Yeah, I think I have my own little special way I shoot and it works for me.   
  
  Q. A lot of talk about the NBA lockout and everyone is worried, but let's look on the bright side, if you had to get a second job and couldn't play basketball what would it be? What would you want to do?   
 DANIEL GIBSON: I haven't thought about it. Maybe I'd take your job.   
 That's a very tough question. I would go back to school.
