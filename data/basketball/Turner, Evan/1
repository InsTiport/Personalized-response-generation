Q.   Do you feel like you were in second grade waiting and watching to see if you were going to be a part of this Rising Stars game?
EVAN TURNER:   No, to tell you the truth, I wasn't really too tied up into it.   I was just worried about becoming a better basketball player. 

Q.   What is next for you?   What's the next step in your game to get you to the next level?
EVAN TURNER:   I have to play my way into the lineup and become an integral part of the Sixers.

Q.   How hard is that with the guys ahead of you?
EVAN TURNER:   It is what it is.   We have a team unit.   (Inaudible.)

Q.   What value did you learn growing up that will help you become a better player?
EVAN TURNER:   Never give up on yourself and always work hard.   Anything worth having is worth working for.   Anything you do builds confidence in yourself.
