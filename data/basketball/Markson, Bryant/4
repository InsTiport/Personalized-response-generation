<p>	Q.  Andrew, I understand you were not feeling so well yesterday.  Were you feeling okay today?  If not, how were you feeling poorly and what happened?</p>
<p>	Q.  You look like you might have been a little drained out there. </p>
<p>	Q.  Andrew, beginning of the game, you pretty much took over.  I think you have the first 11 or 13 points for your team.  What was that like and then what did they do to keep you from being able to continue doing that in the first half? </p>
<p>	Q.  Andrew or Marc, could you point to a turning point in the second half?  You know you have had some games like that, been close in the first half?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you feel like you had to step up more, be more aggressive in the second half?</p>
<p>	Q.  For Bryant or Marc, why has this turned into such a pattern?  For the last month seems like you have close games at halftime then you take control in the second half.  How come?</p>
<p>	Q.  Bryant, outside of Andrew and Marc, the rest of the team shot less than 25 percent.  Any concern about that or do you look at the next game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Andrew, as you're starting this tournament, a lot of NBA scouts are here.  How do you handle all this talk about will he come out, will he be the No. 1 pick, and all that?  How do you separate that?</p>
<p>	Q.  For any of the players, just want to ask, is there any point in this game where you felt like it was getting way from you a little bit?  Or did you feel like you were comfortable the whole time?</p>

<p>	Q.  Congratulations, Ray. </p>
<p>	Q.  79 points and 51 rebounds for Bogut against CSU.  This is probably the biggest team you face and probably the best center in the league after him is Nelson.  What does that say about him that he can do that against a team like that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you see something defensively that was key in the second half?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you address Andrew, were you worried about him last night when he got ill?  Today, to look at him, he seemed drained. </p>
<p>	Q.  Ray, I will ask you the same question that was asked some of the players.  Are you concerned with the performance in the first half?  It seems like every game you were tight in the first half.  You haven't played particularly well?</p>
<p>	Q.  Looked like you opened up the substitution pattern a lot.  Is that trying to make it through three games in three days?</p>
