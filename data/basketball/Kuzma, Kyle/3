  Q. What would you like to change about your game plan ahead of Game 4?  And how important is for you to bring back the winning streak?
 KYLE KUZMA:   You know, it's all about just watching the film, seeing what they kind of did to succeed, and then also just figure out where me and the team can really just progress in schemes and understand what they're trying to do and what we're trying to do, and how do we deflect certain things, certain objects within their scheme. So that's just the biggest thing from Game 3 to Game 4 to get back the streak.
 Q. Bam said today there he's day-to-day.  When he plays, how does this change what you guys do and when he doesn't play?
 KYLE KUZMA:   I think the biggest thing is we get to play a little bit more traditional.  You know, obviously when they have him not in there they're five out, five space shooters, cutters, movement, and it's challenging to guard.
 Obviously, he presents his own challenges as well because he's a great player and an All-Star.  But they're just two different teams when they're on and off.
 Q. In that Houston series you noted that you wanted to stay out of the corners and move off the ball, be active.  Obviously last night most of your attempts came from the corners.  How has Miami's defensive scheme changed the way you approach the game?
 KYLE KUZMA:   You know, that's a great question.  I think the biggest thing is for me just studying the game, realizing what my strengths are and what teams are trying to take away from my game.
 Obviously like you said, the Houston series I was corners cutting, and, you know, this series they're definitely keying in a little bit more on those cuts.  I'm just making my own adjustments and they work.
