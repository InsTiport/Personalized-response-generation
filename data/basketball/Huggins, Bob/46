THE MODERATOR:   We're joined by the Mountaineers of West Virginia, head coach Bob Huggins and student‑athletes Terry Henderson and Eron Harris.   
Questions for the student‑athletes.  
   
 Q.   Either Terry or Eron, you guys beat them the first two matchups.   Did they do anything differently today?   
TERRY HENDERSON:   I think they played harder, because it's a do‑or‑die situation.   Crazy things happen in the tournament.   They just took the opportunity and ran with it.  
   
 Q.   They got 14points at one stretch.   Then you guys went on a long run.   Sometimes that takes something out of a team to have to recover from a big deficit.   Finally get even, and did that happen to you guys?   Did you‑‑  
ERON HARRIS:   I don't think we were supposed to be down that much in the first place, but we fought back.   So it might have took a little bit of energy out of us, but that shouldn't matter.   We've got to play 40minutes regardless.  
   
 Q.   Terry or Eron, what are your impressions of the Big 12, first year here?  
ERON HARRIS:   I mean, I don't know any other conference.   So it's pretty good to me.  
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.   Questions for Coach.   
   
 Q.   Bob, did it matter at all that this team that you have this year was recruited for the Big East?   I'm not saying they're not good players, but was that a factor at all in the way you kind of had trouble getting traction in your first year here?  
COACH HUGGINS:   I don't know.   The fact of the matter is they were recruited, they were all signed and on board before we switched leagues.   But certainly should have done a better job than what we did.   That's my fault.   I'm not blaming anybody other than me.   We should have done a better job.  
   
 Q.   Did you get a satisfactory answer as to what the two player technicals were, since they happened on the other end of the court?  
COACH HUGGINS:   I guess there was some talking going on.   They told them to shut up, and our guys I think said something after they were told to be quiet.   The truth of the matter is it should never happen.   You can go back and look, my guys don't do that.   They have never done that.   It's inexcusable.   
   
 Q.   Does the way this game ended kind of sum up this season?   You did a few little things like block the shot at the end.   But you just never carried it through to fruition?  
COACH HUGGINS:   Our credo for as long as I've coached has always been get to the ball.   It's hard to win when you don't get to the ball.   I think that's any sport, that's just not basketball, that's any sport.   And this group, for whatever reason, is the worst that we've ever had at getting to the ball.   
Eron makes a block on the ball and unfortunately it gets knocked to them.   I mean, if it bounces over the rim, we rebound.   And it didn't bounce over the rim.   We didn't block out either, though, which I guess sometimes happens in situations like that.   
But as much time as we spend on rebounding the basketball and blocking out, you would think that at a time like that maybe you try to get the ball.   They got a very fortunate bounce.   It bounced right back to where they were.  
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, Coach.
