BOB HUGGINS: We're ready to get started. That's about all I've got to say about it.   
 Q.  Derek Culver, what did that experience do for him last year?  
BOB HUGGINS: I guess I think just some confidence. I mean, he is not going to change how he plays. That's Derek. That's his identity.   
I think it's given him some confidence. Other than that, I'm not sure what it would have done for him.   
Why don't you ask Derek that? He'll probably lie to you, but you should ask him anyway (smiling).   
 Q.  You were on the Rules Committee. What was your input with the cleanup post play and how much of an emphasis do you think that should be in college basketball moving forward?  
BOB HUGGINS: How are you going to clean up post play when you have 6'10", 270-pound guys leaning on each other? There's going to be contact.   
I think the thing that needs to be called, if they're displaced, shouldn't be allowed to do that. I mean, obviously if it affects their shot, you shouldn't be allowed to do that. But there's going to be contact.   
This thing that we're going to have a no-contact sport, those people have never played our game. You got 10 big, strong, fast guys in a confined area. There's going to be some contact.   
Is that what Curt said? Curt was a guard, kind of stood out there away from the fray, never really got involved (smiling).
