Arizona   79
  Colorado   69

THE MODERATOR:   Coach, an opening statement, please. 
COACH BOYLE:   Well, obviously, we're disappointed with the result.   We congratulate Arizona.   They played a hell of a game.   You could tell from the very beginning they were ready to go. 
I thought our guys responded to some adversity tonight very well, but we just didn't have enough to get over the hump there at the end.   Made a valiant effort, but it just wasn't enough today.   The end of the first half I thought was the difference, because, obviously, we turned the ball over a lot, and we missed some free throws. 
But our guys battled in the second half and showed the heart of a Colorado Buffalo and what that's about.   These guys have more basketball ahead of them this year for the job they've done this season.

Q.   How big a factor, Tad, was it that Josh Scott got in early foul trouble? 
COACH BOYLE:   It never helps when your bigs get in foul trouble, especially in a physical game like you see.   That was a high‑level basketball game out there by both teams.   When you get one of your bigs in early foul trouble, that never helps.   But I thought he played through it in the second half and gave us some good minutes.

Q.   Spencer, if you could, Nick Johnson defending you for much of the game, it seemed like it took you a little bit to get going.   Could you describe what they were doing early on to limit you?   And once you did get things going in the second half, what changed?
SPENCER DINWIDDIE:   I mean, they just played solid defense.   It wasn't nothing special.   I mean, in the first half we ran offense and things like that.   I mean, they did a great job team defensively the whole game.   I don't know what you want me to say to that.

Q.   The bench for Arizona had 25 points.   Will you talk about the production he was able to get off the bench tonight, Sean Miller? 
COACH BOYLE:   Yeah, Arizona's got good players coming off the bench.   They've got guys that are starting the games.   Brandon Ashley was a starter for the most of the year.   I thought our bench gave us some good minutes in the second half.   But Arizona, when you look at their lineup, they've got the most quality depth of anybody in our league.   And they go ten deep.   That Chol kid is a hell of a player, and he didn't even get to play much tonight. 
So they have good players on the floor.   They bring good players off the bench, when they're all playing well, and they were dialed in tonight.   You could tell from the git‑go. 
Like Spencer said, they had great team defense.   It's tough for us to score at times.   But they've got good players.   They're well‑coached.   We lost to a good program tonight.   There is nothing to hang our heads about in terms of who we lost to.   We're always disappointed with this result, and you always look internally at what you can do better, and that's what we'll do.

Q.   AndrÃ©, when you guys start staging the comeback in the second half, can you talk a little bit about what was going through your minds?   Did you feel like that game was there for the taking and you guys would finish it off? 
ANDRE ROBERSON:   Yeah, we definitely thought that.   Coach Boyle always preaches defend and rebound, and I felt like that's when we started to do that and we had a run.   I feel like we just didn't do it consistently throughout the whole 40 minutes.   That's how we fell off in the first half, and that's how we got back into the game in the second half.

Q.   AndrÃ©, it looked like you had really good energy today.   Are you no worse for wear from your illness?   And how important do you think that was to show the NCAA Tournament that you're back? 
ANDRE ROBERSON:   Can you repeat that? 

Q.   It looked like you had really good energy.   Are you feeling good after your illness? 
ANDRE ROBERSON:   I'm feeling really good.   I have fresh legs.   I just recently got back and cleared.   I feel like that's my job to bring energy to this team, just a player with fresh legs so get out there and run.   But it's definitely important to get back in shape and show everybody that you're playing your best.

Q.   I know it's up to the selection committee, but do you feel like you've done enough to get in the tournament? 
COACH BOYLE:   Yes.

Q.   Players? 
SPENCER DINWIDDIE:   Yeah.

Q.   Why so? 
ANDRE ROBERSON:   We battled throughout the whole season.   We took a couple of tough losses, but I feel like we definitely have some quality wins under our belt, so I feel like we did enough. 
COACH BOYLE:   I think, when I look at it, our strength of schedule, non‑conference, obviously, we played in a heck of a league.   We came up a little bit short here in this tournament, but the way we played tonight and the fact that we got AndrÃ© back, what we did over our whole body of work, strength of schedule, went on the road.   We had the fewest home games of any Pac‑12 school.   We had 15 home games.   That is the fewest of anybody in the Pac‑12.   I don't know what other BCS schools had at home, but a lot of people played a lot more than 15 at home. 
So we went on the road, played a good schedule, and we weren't perfect.   But we're one of the top 37 at large in my mind.   But that's not for us to decide.   That's all I'm going to say about it.

Q.   Only six assists tonight, did you feel that ball movement was a bit of an issue? 
COACH BOYLE:   Yeah, we talked about it.   We had two at halftime.   When we're at our best, we're at double digit assists.   This team's been like that all year long.   So it's nothing unusual.   Yeah, 6 assists and 13 turnovers, when we look at our losses, that's usually a result of not making plays for each other offensively.   We played good enough offensively.   We had 69 points and four guys in double figures.   Our offense wasn't the problem tonight. 
Our problem was not getting stops at critical times.   The shot that Lyons hit from the corner with one second on the shot clock was the play of the game.   That was a breakdown on our part defensively.   We've practiced that situation.   We just didn't do what we were supposed to do, and it cost us.   When you play against good teams, they make you pay for your mistakes.

Q.   How is Shane?   And can you talk about some of the minutes you got from him? 
COACH BOYLE:   Yeah, let me say this about Shane.   We've had two blatant no calls that have led to concussions on our basketball team, and I'm really disappointed about it.   What was the second part of your question? 

Q.   Just minutes from your bench? 
COACH BOYLE:   Yeah, I thought Jeremy is coming into his own, playing extremely well.   I feel very comfortable with him on the floor, Xavier Talton, I thought in the second half when we made our run had good minutes. 
Ben, I was more proud of him than anybody coming in.   When Shane did go down, he came in and played well and battled.   And, again, Josh was‑‑ we're making a comeback.   We went small with AndrÃ© and X out there, and three guards. 
So there weren't as many minutes for him in the second half.   But I was really proud of Ben Mills, and I don't know what the prognosis will be for Shane.   But Ben will be a time for him to step up.   And I'm really proud of him for doing it tonight in a very tough environment.
