 Q.  Talk about your whole career to this point.  You are an All-Star.  
GORAN DRAGIC: Yeah, it's been a long journey.  I mean, 2008 when I came to the NBA the first year, I didn't play a lot.  It was really tough on me.  I was thinking to go back to Europe.  But luckily I have a mentor like Steve Nash, Grant Hill, Amar'e Stoudemire next to me, and they were always saying to me:  Be patient.  You're going to get your opportunity as long as you stay ready.   
At the end of the day, that really happened, and I get a chance.  I played well, and I'm really satisfied with how my career went from that point on.  It's been a tremendous year for me.  First time at 31 years old, first-time All-Star, won a gold medal [in EuroBasket] with my [Slovenian] national team.  So it's been an unbelievable ride.   
 Q.  Like you said, you won the gold medal with the national team.  What is missing in the NBA?  
GORAN DRAGIC: The ring, of course.  That's something that every player is dreaming of.  Hopefully in my career I'm going to achieve that.  But the most important thing for me is to be healthy and try to play as long as possible.
