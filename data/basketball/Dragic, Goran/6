Q.   Talk about your feelings being here. 
GORAN DRAGIC:   Well, I'm going to fight every night.   I try to play hard.   That's my job. 
So I was really sad and disappointed when I found out that I didn't make it, but in the end I know that in the West the competition is so hard.   You have great guards, and it's tough. 
But my dream was to play in the Allâ€‘Star Game.   It's always next year, so I'm still going to try to do my best and hopefully some day I'm going to play in the game. 

Q.   Talk about the importance of Leandro Barbosa to the team. 
GORAN DRAGIC:   L.B. is great.   He's a great teammate, great guy.   Really nice to have him on the same team. 
We know each other from before.   When I was a rookie, we played together for three years. 
And he's an X factor for our team.   He can score, he can defend.   And I think that was a great pickup for us when we got him. 
Everybody likes him.   He's a positive guy.   If you need some help, he's going to be the first guy to be there.   And he's a great teammate. 

Q.   So you guys were happy when he extended his contract to the end of the season? 
GORAN DRAGIC:   Oh, definitely.
