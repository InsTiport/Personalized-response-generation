Vanderbilt  Â– 69
  Georgia - 61

 THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Danielle Taylor, 6 points, 6 rebounds and 2 assists. Also Angel Robinson, career high 29 points, 16 rebounds. 29 is the most scored by a Georgia player this year. Coach, if you will open with comments. 
 COACH LANDERS: So the bottom line in terms of our inability to win a game is that we didn't defend the two things that Vandy does and needs to do very well to win. We didn't defend very well the three. They put up 26 of those. 
 And we didn't defend very well the drive, they got the ball into the paint off the dribble. Far too much. They got the close shots off the dribble that they needed to compliment the threes that they got. 
 And then the last ten minutes of the game we were very ineffective in rebounding the basketball after they missed, as much as anything. That really hurt us and may have cost us the chance to win, because I remember a few possessions where we actually had defended well and taken the shot clock down to the end and they shot and got the ball back. I remember a couple of things like that. 
 We didn't defend the dribble, didn't defend the three with any consistency. We defended it, that's the thing, we defended it, basically did what we needed to do about 80% of the time. That 20% of the time it looked like we mentally just collapsed. We were standing with no intent or no sense of urgency about defending those two things. 

 Q. Coach, I seem to recall a couple of three and four-shot possessions they had. Were you surprised you actually outrebounded them? 
 COACH LANDERS: Yeah, I was surprised when I saw the final number that we outrebounded them as a team. You know, the thing is, the number that counts for them is 16, the 16 offensive boards. 
 But, yes, I was surprised that we outrebounded, not at all surprised that they got 16 offensive boards because we didn't box out. Not at all. Nor did we proceed to hustle. We got outhustled. 

 Q. Actually, did you think Ashley would be such a focal point of the offense and --
 COACH LANDERS: I supported both, but not to the extent of either. We suspected we would have an advantage in size with the inside game, maybe not great, but an advantage. So we certainly wanted to go there and try to exploit it, see how they -- how they would attempt to defend the low post. 
 Angel was very, very good and her team was very, very good with getting their basketball there. You know, we suspected that they would try to take Ashley out. 
 A lot of people have done that, they've tried to do it before, and tonight rather than fighting it, as we have with other teams, we decided that we would go with Angela Puleo in a certain number of sets that she was comfortable with that she would run the offense. And that was a real big problem. 

 Q. Coach, I want your perspective about how different Vanderbilt is without Tuomi in the post. 
 COACH LANDERS: They're not a lot different, really. Tuomi is probably going to have more of a post-up presence, but once either of them have the ball four or five feet away from the basket, they're similar. They're going to attack you with the dribble and they're going to be good offensive rebounders. 
 Today I thought where we just got our tail kicked was their guards outrebounded our guards on the offensive end. I think their guards got nine or ten of their offensive rebounds, which I'm not surprised that that happened altogether. 

 Q. Angel, it seemed like you guys were down 10 at half, you came back and got close several times in the second half and they came back with a possession and scored. 
 When you expend that kind of energy on the floor, is it hard when you don't get the lead to come back like that? 
 ANGEL ROBINSON: We knew we had to step it up and make a few changes. We were down by, I believe, 14 going into the second half. We knew we had to have the energy like we had against Kentucky, and apparently we started slacking a little bit when we got real close. 
 Vandy fought to come back and take advantage of it. They outhustled us. We didn't get out on 3-point shooters, that was a huge thing. Once they started shooting those threes, they had two or three shooters on the floor at all times, so we didn't do a good job of recognizing that. 

 Q. (Away from mic.)
 DANIELLE TAYLOR: A couple of times we got close, and one of their big shooters would put down the three, we just weren't aware.

 Q. (Away from mic.)
 COACH LANDERS: I don't know. I rather suspect that we're at the table, but oftentimes these things come down to how conference tournaments go, upsets, and those kinds of things, so I really don't know and I haven't studied it a great deal lately. I shouldn't comment on it. 
 It wasn't the reason for me that we came out here. You know, I thought we had an excellent chance if we played well to win this tournament, so I really haven't thought about the other deal very much. 

 Q. Danielle, along the same lines, a couple of days before the selection, what's that time period going to be like for you until you guys get a verdict on that? 
 DANIELLE TAYLOR: Like Coach said, we don't know, we sit and hope that we do get in. 
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach, ladies.
