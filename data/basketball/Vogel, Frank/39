Q.   Frank, do you feel like you guys need to make more of a concerted effort to get the ball into the low post the way you did in the first half of Game 3? 
COACH FRANK VOGEL:   Yes and no.   We've been shown‑‑ we've proven to shoot ourselves in the foot when we try to overexpose that.   We need to take advantage of our big guys to move it as much as we can by dumping it inside the post, and they make it very difficult to catch it in there. 
Certainly, we want to take advantage of our big guys, but it doesn't always have to be in post play.

Q.   This team is determined to get off to a good start in Miami, it looks like.   Is there something you can do for that with a special emphasis on the starters? 
COACH FRANK VOGEL:   Not any more than normal.   We're determined to get off to a great start every night. 
We understand that's what they've been talking about, and we have to start strong. 

Q.   If they're denying in the post, low post or high post, do your guards have to attack more and try to make them pay? 
COACH FRANK VOGEL:   We've got plenty of counters built in for that, but we've got to execute them.
