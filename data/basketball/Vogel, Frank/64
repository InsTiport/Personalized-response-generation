Q.   Frank, do you look at what you failed to do defensively, or do you just look at them and say they just kind of put on a clinic? 
COACH FRANK VOGEL:   It's both.   Obviously they're one of the great teams that this league has seen, defending champs on an historic run this year.   If you're not perfect guarding them, they'll do what they did to us tonight.   Sometimes when you are perfect with your coverages, they still find a way to make baskets. 
But we didn't have a great defensive night.   It wasn't horrible, as bad as the numbers looked.   You have to credit Miami for playing a great basketball game. 

Q.   Frank, Udonis Haslem had a huge impact on this game, and I think he had an impact on Hibbert, too.   Can you explain what he was able to accomplish in terms of opening things up for Miami. 
COACH FRANK VOGEL:   Yeah, that's what Miami does, they space you out.   They make it difficult to have a rim protector in the game at all times.   They challenge you to keep a guy at the rim and still make them close out to an 18‑foot jump shooter.   We have to account for that. 
Is he going to shoot 8‑for‑9 every night?   I don't know, we'll see.   If he does, it's probably going to be a long series for us.   We have to make some adjustments for sure. 

Q.   You talked pre‑game about maintaining your adrenaline and poise and composure.   Do you feel that was a factor tonight? 
COACH FRANK VOGEL:   Not really.   I think our guys were pretty poised.   I was referring to sort of when we were going on our runs, not getting out of control.   They had more runs than we did tonight.   So I didn't think that was a factor. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
