 Q.   When it was shown on TV, you spoke about coming out and stepping up and fighting the fight.   Was there anything disappointing to you about this game, and how do you explain one start and then letting it get away with a 23‑point deficit?   
COACH FRANK VOGEL:   We let it get away with the Heat.   I wasn't disappointed in the fight, I was disappointed in the result.   They got off to a quick start.   Give credit to Chris Bosh and to Spo for creating situations for him to get going early.   
   
 Q.   Can you pinpoint to anything why you guys have had struggles defensively in terms of slowing them the last three games?   
COACH FRANK VOGEL:   The best offensive team in the NBA.   That's the biggest reason.   They have great weapons.   They're very difficult to guard.   
We played better probably tonight than we had in the first three games defensively, but we've got to just keep getting better and understand all the challenges they present.   
   
 Q.   I don't mean to walk down that moral victory line, but the way you finished, it was a nine‑point game at one point.   Can that carry into Wednesday at all for you?   
COACH FRANK VOGEL:   That won't, but our belief in our basketball team will.   We've got to go home in Game 5 and protect our home court and come back here and get a win in Game 6.   
   
 Q.   Do you think Lance psyched himself out at all, or was it just a bad night?   
COACH FRANK VOGEL:   No.   I think once the ball went up, all that stuff was behind him.   I don't think it had anything to do with it.   
He got in foul trouble and didn't get in a rhythm.  
   
 Q.   Frank, LeBron created a lot of offense, being aggressive going to the basket.   Is there anything else that you guys can do differently to sort of slow him down in situations like that?   
COACH FRANK VOGEL:   We've just got to do our best to keep ourselves in front of him and be early to help.   
He's the best player in the world.   He's going to get going.   You've just got to make everything difficult for him.  
   
 Q.   After three strong games from Hibbert, he kind of regressed in this game.   What did you see that he was doing or was it the Heat defense?   
COACH FRANK VOGEL:   He got some touch fouls that put him on the bench and didn't get in a rhythm.   
   
 Q.   You said after Game 3 you guys feel really confident, that this is a long series.   Was there anything said in the locker room tonight that made you think that s still the case?   Was there any discussion about that?     
COACH FRANK VOGEL:   Our guys believe in what we do, and we know that.   Once we've lost Game 2, we need to win one time here and then take care of our home court.   So we have three opportunities to do that.   We didn't do it in Game 3 and 4.   Our belief is strong that we'll go back and get Game 5 and then come back and fight Game 6.
