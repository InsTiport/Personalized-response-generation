Q.   Coach, are there any guidelines or are things to keep an eye on with Paul?   Have you been told to keep an eye on Paul? 
COACH FRANK VOGEL:   No, other than just to understand that his legs got more of a workout than he typically does in between games.   So just keep an eye on that.

Q.   I was going to ask you also about Paul.   What was the last two or three days like in terms of his ability to workout (inaudible)? 
COACH FRANK VOGEL:   He just went through the concussion protocol, which is a lot of endurance training to really get your heart rate and your body taxed and then go through the neurological exams after that.   But a lot of that is a heavier load than guys will typically see in between games.

Q.   Frank, it's been said you guys got into your game the first two games a little bit more than they got into theirs and you were able to get on them early.   Do you feel that way, like maybe you guys were able to dictate them a little bit more than the reverse? 
COACH FRANK VOGEL:   I don't know.   I think there's stretches where they've gotten into their style and there's been stretches where we've gotten into ours.   I don't think it's been dominant one way or the other.
