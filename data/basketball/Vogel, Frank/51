 Q.   Do you wish they would still have (indiscernible) position as part of the voting?   
FRANK VOGEL:   I wouldn't have a preference on it either way.   I mean, it just has to do with the starters, I think, more than the reserves.   I guess it would probably help more, but I'm okay with the way it's done.     
   
 Q.   Do you talk to the players before the game to give them how many minutes they're going to go with?   
FRANK VOGEL:   I talk to them and see what their expectations are.   And we try to meet what their expectations are and I haven't talked to them yet, probably talk to them later today.     
   
 Q.   What do you expect for the second half of the season?   
FRANK VOGEL:   Well, we got to keep getting better.   We need to make a heck of a charge toward the end to try to earn the No. 1 seed and we're going to need every single night.     
We'll need every single win.
