Q.   Frank, I apologize if you've been asked this this morning.   How much does this feel like Game 7 last year, and how much does it not feel like Game 7 last year? 
COACH FRANK VOGEL:   It feels like Game 6 this year.   It feels like we're down 3‑2. 
We've got a great belief in our basketball team and look forward to getting the game started.

Q.   Coach, Erik kind of joked about how‑‑ or maybe he wasn't joking ‑‑ about how LeBron could play 48 minutes tonight.   We've seen how you haven't been afraid to push your starters long minutes.   How do you feel generally about how your bench has played in this series? 
COACH FRANK VOGEL:   I think they've contributed really well.   I've given them shorter rotations than they saw mostly throughout the regular season, but they performed well when they were in there.
