Q.   David West update? 
    COACH FRANK VOGEL:   I actually haven't gotten an update, but we're not anticipating anything other than fever broken and he's going to play. 

Q.   Do you have any idea how high a fever we're talking about? 
    COACH FRANK VOGEL:   Slightly over 100.   Am I allowed to disclose that? 
    (Laughter).
    100.375. 

Q.   How is Tyler right now? 
    COACH FRANK VOGEL:   A little sore, but he's ready to go. 

Q.   Andersen's absence, does that factor at all into your game plan? 
    COACH FRANK VOGEL:   Not really with the game plan, but it impacts their depth a little bit.   Joel Anthony is a heck of a player.   We have great respect for him.   Obviously they have more than enough bodies to fill in. 

Q.   Will you limit David minutes‑wise at all just to see if you can‑‑
    COACH FRANK VOGEL:   No.   We'll play with the normal plan.   If I see something or if I notice he's struggling, we'll make decisions at that point.   What did they say in Rocky, what did Apollo Creed say, "Don't stop this fight."   I think we're going to have a hard time pulling him out of the game.
