Q.   Frank, what's the primary message you want to get across to your guys today? 
COACH FRANK VOGEL:   That we've got to be the team that improves, that played better.   I think we're capable.

Q.   There's been a rhythm to your playoff games, for the most part.   There's going to be a gap in here, in the schedule.   How do you look at the gap?   It's outside your control, but how do you plan to navigate it?   Positive?   Negative?   What do you make of it? 
COACH FRANK VOGEL:   I don't know if it's positive or negative.   We'll probably have an off‑day and a couple practice days and just fine tune some things that‑‑ in regards to the game plan against Miami.

Q.   Frank, what are you anticipating in terms of their lineups, their matchups, how they will approach things, and how that might impact you, if at all? 
COACH FRANK VOGEL:   I think we'll see more Udonis Haslem, but I still think we'll see their small lineup with Bosh at the five.   I think we'll still see that a bunch. 
I think we'll just see an overall increased level of aggressiveness on the defensive end and assertiveness attacking the basket on the offensive end.

Q.   Frank, you said you want to see the team improve.   What areas do you specifically want to improve the most in? 
COACH FRANK VOGEL:   I think we have a lot of room for improvement on the defensive end.   Giving up 20 points on the break, 54 points in the paint, and 51 percent shooting.   That's not good enough on most nights.   So we've got to get better there.

Q.   Everyone healthy and available? 
COACH FRANK VOGEL:   Yes.

Q.   Evan Turner's in the rotation? 
COACH FRANK VOGEL:   If he's available, we'll see.
