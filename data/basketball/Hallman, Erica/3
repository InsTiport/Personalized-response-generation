<p>	Q.  Crystal, the last six and a half minutes you were only able to score once.  What do you think happened there? </p>
<p>	Q.  Erica, I wonder if you could talk about that, too, that stretch.  Did you feel the game just got away from you there a little bit? </p>
<p>	Q.  Crystal, I think you had a career high today.  Can you talk about that? </p>

<p>	Q.  If both of you could talk about what Coach Henrickson just said.  You'll both be seniors.  What did you learn this season, how you're looking forward to next year? </p>

<p>	Q.  Erica, in the late going, you had several close-in shots that just didn't go in.  How frustrated were you by those that didn't go in?</p>
<p>	Q.  Crystal, late in that first half, right-handed layup, they came down and hit the layup, was that the momentum switcher having them going into the lead in the half? </p>
<p>	Q.  Crystal, Coach Henrickson was talking about the growth this team made this year.  Can you touch on that, where you are now, as opposed to maybe where you were in October? </p>

<p>	Q.  You've seen your team blow hot and cold offensively the whole season.  Where does this rank?  You made 15 of your first 25, then missed 13 of your last 14. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the rebounding. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, the difficulty of being undersized all year, did you feel like that was important tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you evaluate your season.  Is this where you hope to be? </p>
<p>	Q.  With how well Crystal and Erica played tonight, can you talk about how excited you are for next season? </p>
<p>	Q.  Crystal only got two shot attempts in the last seven minutes. </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you sense she was more well-covered? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the decision-making at the end of the game?  19 seconds left.  You're down by three. </p>
<p>	Q.  You played Blair 16 minutes in the second half.  Was that size? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about at times Bond can really do a lot out there. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Taylor's off-season development, what you're looking for from her? </p>
