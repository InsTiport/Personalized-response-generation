<p>	Q.  Last year you guys -- there weren't a lot of rotations or substitutions because there weren't too many kids.  You didn't have the opportunity to do all the things that your coaching staff probably could have implemented if you had more bodies.  Talk about from the guard position and from the post position how different will Kansas be this year in terms of having those extra bodies and how does that help each of you two individually? </p>

<p>	Q.  What you worked on in your game for your senior year, what you worked on? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, how much different is it having one full year under your belt going into your second season?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you guys came in as freshmen, you probably had no idea what was in front of you.  It was an O-and-16 Big 12 season.  (Inaudible) talk about I guess the journey and some of the tough times you have been through, obviously changing coaching staff but also what kind of leaders that makes you guys as seniors which you didn't have when you were freshmen?</p>

<p>	Q.  How do you think Shaquina can help your team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you consider her the most important piece of the puzzle for being successful this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about Shaq's winning attitude.  When you take over a program that's been down a little bit, how do you -- what steps do you take to instill that attitude back into the program and when did you start to see that with this team?</p>
<p>	Q.  For several seasons Kansas was really hurt by its lack of ability to shoot the three-pointer on the same level that most of the top Big 12 competitors did.  Is having your two -- Erica was your top 3-point shooter.  Is she going to be even more free to be your 3-point weapon with additional help at guard?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about your nonconference schedule, talk about why your home games are --</p>
