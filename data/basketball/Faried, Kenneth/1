KENNETH FARIED:   I don't really think of it that way.   I speak to my mom about it.   But I don't really ‑‑ that's not why I joined.   I'm not looking for recognition.   That doesn't matter.

Q.   Were you surprised when you were picked in the low 20's?   Everybody knew you were going to come in and rebound on the NBA level.
