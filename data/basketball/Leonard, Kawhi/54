 Q.   What is your feeling?   Do you think he's (Tony) going to go?   
KAWHI LEONARD:   I believe so.   
   
 Q.   Is he going to play?   Do you think he'll play?   
KAWHI LEONARD:   I'm not sure.   You have to ask him.   
   
 Q.   Tell me about the invitation you have to the USA Basketball camp.   Why do you think it happens?   Because of your performance in this series?   
KAWHI LEONARD:   No, I've been selected, I think, two series ago.   But I mean, I'm not thinking about that right now.   I'm in The Finals, that's all I'm worried about.   
   
 Q.   How much of a blueprint the defense Indiana Pacers played in the last series helped in this series?   
KAWHI LEONARD:   The Pacers didn't help me at all.   They didn't help the Spurs.   The Pacers versus the San Antonio Spurs.   We don't work together.   
   
 Q.   What kind of thing did you use?   TV?   You studied the games?   Because you're having a great performance.   
KAWHI LEONARD:   I'm studying my team concepts and just buying into our game plan.   That's all I'm doing.   Playing hard.   
   
 Q.   You just like playing ball.   
KAWHI LEONARD:   I'm enjoying it.   We're in The Finals.   You know, we're playing basketball.   Just going to get me better as a player.   That's how I approach the game.   I just go out there and give it my all so I can get better each and every day.   
   
 Q.   How do you look at this stuff, the interviews?   
KAWHI LEONARD:   Whatever.   It's the offâ€‘court stuff.   It not basketball.   I don't really love doing it or anything like that.
