 THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Kawhi.
 Q. Now that you know you're going to play Dallas, what are some of the things you guys are looking forward to accomplishing and getting prepared for?
 KAWHI LEONARD:   Number one, just getting everybody here, then just building habits pretty much.  Just talking, making sure we covering each other, playing as a team on both ends of the floor.  That's pretty much it.  Just trying to build habits, make less mistakes as we move forward.
 Q. When you look back on the moment you signed with this team, getting Paul George, everything you guys have been through this season, to get the No. 2 seed now, what does that mean?
 KAWHI LEONARD:   Just happy we were able to make it to the Playoffs.  Right now it doesn't seem like seeds matter.  It's a great accomplishment.  For me and Paul and the rest of the guys that was here, them being the AC last year, us coming into a new system, able to play that well together our first year under all these circumstances.
 We still in the journey.  We just got to keep enjoying each day and the process.
 Q. You mentioned it seems like seeds don't matter as much.  With no true home-court advantage in the Playoffs, will it be a more unpredictable Playoffs?
 KAWHI LEONARD:   Yeah, I mean, just like tonight we played Denver.  We're not traveling there or pushing through that altitude that they're used to playing to at home.  Also fans.
 But the little things like that, you know, just traveling to that different city and trying to establish yourself and see what routine you can make out there, those are pretty much the difficulties of ballgames in the Playoffs.
 THE MODERATOR:   Thank you for your time.
