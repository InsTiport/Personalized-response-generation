 Q.   What's your reaction about Ibaka being upgraded to day‑to‑day and possibly playing?   Any reaction to that?   
KAWHI LEONARD:   No, not really.   I mean, we've still got to go out and play the game.   Before the series we said we didn't know if he was going to play or not, but we've just got to still buy into our game plan and still stay focused to what we're doing.   
   
 Q.   Kevin Durant has only two shots in the series inside the restricted area.   What have you and the rest of the team been able to do to keep him from getting to the rim?   
KAWHI LEONARD:   Just taking notice of when he has the ball, just having an extra shift available just in case he tries to drive the ball, and just being focused, really.   I think that's about it.   
   
 Q.   As good as you guys have played in the first two games, do you feel like you have to play better up there?   
KAWHI LEONARD:   Most definitely.   They're going to come out hard.   Like everybody has been saying, we were up 2‑0 two years ago, so this is a very important game, and we have to come out strong and have the same intensity as the Thunder.  
   
 Q.   Have you guys been talking about that a little bit, what happened two years ago?  
KAWHI LEONARD:   No, we're just reminding each other that we were up 2‑0.   We're going to try to come out Game 3 strong.   
   
 Q.   Having so many scoring options, how much does that take the pressure off you offensively?   
KAWHI LEONARD:   I really never felt pressure offensively.   Like you said, we've got a lot of scorers, and our offense works that way.   You never know who's going to have a great night.
