Q.   (Inaudible).
    KAWHI LEONARD:   I felt engaged in the minutes I did play in.   Not really, I don't feel like the heat‑‑ are you talk about the air? 

Q.   Yeah. 
    KAWHI LEONARD:   No, I don't feel like the heat took anything away from me besides just being hot. 

Q.   Where do you rank yourself? 
    KAWHI LEONARD:   Where do I rank myself?   I don't know.   I never thought about it. 

Q.   When you talk about the all the turnovers, some of them may be sloppy but how much do you credit the defense of the teams for that? 
    KAWHI LEONARD:   We definitely did a good job.   That's why these teams are in The Finals, but a lot of our turnovers was unforced. 

Q.   Are you a believer in wearing compression gear, sleeves, padding, thinking maybe that could make things worse. 
    KAWHI LEONARD:   No, I don't think so.   The players that are used to wear it play with it every night.   I'm not sure. 

Q.   What do you wear?   Do you wear padding around your ribs or elbow? 
    KAWHI LEONARD:   No, I don't wear sleeves or compression shorts.   But I don't think anything would have made you more cooler in that gym. 

Q.   How did you feel this morning?   More fatigued than normal? 
    KAWHI LEONARD:   I felt good.   Same fatigue after any other game.   Only played 20‑some minutes, so I probably didn't feel it as much as other guys playing in the high 30s.
