 Q.  Do you have a prediction for the Slam Dunk Contest?  
KAWHI LEONARD: No, I don't have a prediction.   
 Q.  Thoughts on Zach LaVine in the 3-Point Contest?  
KAWHI LEONARD: I think he'll do well. He's a great three-point shooter. You've got to get hot in those types of games. He's a guy that can get hot and streak out 10 in a row. So I think he'll do a good job.   
 Q.  What's different for you now as a four-time All-Star?  
KAWHI LEONARD: Just from my first time with the Spurs? It's a lot different. I mean, the offense is ran through me pretty much. It's a totally different team, different city. I'm more aggressive. I'm older. I learned a lot more than -- this is my ninth year in the league now. That was my third year. I just learned a lot more. Smarter player, understand the game a lot more.   
 Q.  On San Diego State:  
KAWHI LEONARD: Oh, yeah, I think what are they, 25-0 right now, got a chance to make history, keep making history. I know the coach isn't satisfied and the players aren't. They're playing hard and still want to win.   
 Q.  Do the Clippers need to make adjustments as a team?  
KAWHI LEONARD: Not necessarily adjustments, but just keep trying to gel together and see if we can become better. Just trying to get better every day.
