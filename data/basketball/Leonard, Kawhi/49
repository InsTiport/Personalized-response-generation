Q.   Kawhi, how did KD get to the line so often last night when in the previous two he didn't?
KAWHI LEONARD:   Just fouling him on his shots.   He did a good job getting in people's bodies, making them over commit and getting to the line. 

Q.   What has to change in Game 4 at the defensive end?   What does the team need to do better? 
KAWHI LEONARD:   Just bringing more energy, really, and just a moreâ€‘aggressive nature.   Just being there for one another for our shifts and just believing that the next teammate will be there for you. 

Q.   How about aggression at the other end of the court?   You need to be more forceful going to the basket? 
KAWHI LEONARD:   Yeah, I mean, I feel like we did a good job of getting to the basket, but just overall, just got to put on a different mindset offensively and try to attack more or just try to get a shot, open look.

Q.   Individually how was it different with Ibaka in there in terms of what you were seeing, what the looks were like? 
KAWHI LEONARD:   I mean, he helps the rim for the defensive end for him, changes shots, blocked shots yesterday, so just another body in the way. 

Q.   Did you feel like you had to settle for jump shots and maybe didn't try to got the ball inside?
KAWHI LEONARD:   I mean, I take what the defense gave me, but I got to the paint a few times yesterday.   Shots just didn't really fall for me yesterday, but other than that it doesn't change my mindset.
