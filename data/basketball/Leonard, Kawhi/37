 Q.  Obviously without the benefit of seeing film, what do you think went wrong for you guys offensively in the fourth?  
KAWHI LEONARD: A couple key turnovers.  Missed some easy layups, some wide-open threes.   
And we didn't play too well on defense.  They ended up scoring the highest quarter points in the fourth, 32 points.  And offensive rebounds.  That pretty much sums it up.   
 Q.  Did you feel like this was a game that was there for you guys to win?  Do you feel like you kind of let one get away here?  
KAWHI LEONARD: Yeah.  We came out with a good first quarter, and after that, they pretty much outscored us every quarter.  Just better defense.  Hopefully we can make some of our open looks.  We had a lot of clean looks in that second half.  We've got to limit them.  They can't have this many offensive rebounds, especially at home.   
 Q.  Were legs at all a factor coming off playing three days ago and then just the emotion from all of that, in the fourth quarter?  
KAWHI LEONARD: I mean, it could be, but it's no excuses.  We're all out on the floor.  Like I said, we had open looks that we could have made.  We started off the game well.  We just didn't finish it up too great.
