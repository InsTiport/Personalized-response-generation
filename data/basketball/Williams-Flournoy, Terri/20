THE MODERATOR:   We'll begin with an opening comment from coach and the student‑athletes.   
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY:   I thought we did a much better job defensively in the second half holding Ole Miss to 17 points.   We definitely let McFarland get away from us in the first half, 20 points in the first half.   But we came back and did a better job in the second half defensively.   
I think we did a better job of getting to the offensive boards.   
THE MODERATOR:   Tyrese.   
TYRESE TANNER:   I'm just really proud of my team, how we came out.   We stayed focused the whole game, stuck to our game plan and got the win.   
THE MODERATOR:   Tra'Cee.   
TRA'CEE TANNER:   Like she said, we stuck to our game plan but emphasized getting the ball inside.   That's what we did today and that's what helped us win the game.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions.   
   
 Q.   You shot 27% in the second half and outscored them by 15.   Is that a unique statistic?   
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY:   Shot 46% in the first half and was only up by one (laughter).   
I don't know.   I mean, I thought we did a better job in the second half getting to the free‑throw line.   First half we were standing around, shooting more jump shots.   But we had both bigs in foul trouble in the first half as well.   Kind of messed up our game plan a little bit of getting the ball inside.   
   
 Q.   What did you do differently from the first half to the second half after giving up 20 in the first?  
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY:   We went over the screens a little bit more.   We kept Tyrese at the top to give her a little bit more lift for her three.   We kept everybody else inside to help on the penetration.   
Valencia McFarland is a very good point guard.   We tried to do as much as we can.   At the end of the day she's still good and she's still going to get hers.   
   
 Q.   Coach, what would you consider the turning point to have been in the second half?   
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY:   I definitely think it was our defense.   I thought we understood the game plan.   Certain people we didn't want to go out on that did hit shots in the first half.   Like we told them, just stick with the game plan.  
I thought we rebounded the ball a little bit better defensively in the second half.   
   
 Q.   What was the biggest difference from tonight's game versus Sunday's meeting back in Oxford?   
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY:   I'd like the players to answer that.   
TRA'CEE TANNER:   The biggest difference for me is I would say we attacked the basket a lot more.   We finished at the basket.   We made most of our free throws tonight.   
TYRESE TANNER:   Also we just played harder this game.   I thought at Ole Miss we didn't play hard.   This game we played both halves hard and we got the win.   
   
 Q.   Talk about Texas A&M, what you've seen from them, what you expect tomorrow.   
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY:   Texas A&M is a very good team, another team with a very good point guard.   They can attack you inside, they can go outside.   They have two great wings that have incredible pull‑up jump shots.   They're a good team.   We have to control the inside game.   
Defensively I thought they did a really good job at our place defending us and taking away our point guard.   We're going to have to be better at that.   
   
 Q.   Coach, could you describe how it is when you're in this one‑day turnaround format.   
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY:   It's tough.   But you really try not to focus so much on the other team because at this point there's not much you can do about it.   You've played them before.   You try to go back and look at that film, try to fix some of the things you did wrong.   
But mainly you really try to take care of your team and make sure we're doing what we need to be doing.   You just don't have much time to prepare for it, like you say.   
   
 Q.   Tyrese and Tra'Cee, were y'all happy when you found out you were going to get another shot at Ole Miss?   Extra motivation in this game?   
TYRESE TANNER:   Oh, yes.   We were just watching.   Whoever won yesterday, we were going to come out and play hard.   It didn't matter.   It was good we got to play Ole Miss again and got to show who we really were.   
TRA'CEE TANNER:   I agree with her.   I really think we came out and redefined ourselves from how we played on Sunday.   Today we were a lot more hungry than we were Sunday.   You don't really get a quick turnaround like this to play against a team you didn't get to play that good against.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
