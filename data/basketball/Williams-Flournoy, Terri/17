 Texas A&M   57
  Auburn   47 
  
THE MODERATOR:   We're joined by Auburn head coach along with student‑athletes Katie Frerking and Tra'Cee Tanner.   
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY:   It was a tough game for our ladies, but I thought we continued to fight through.   We've always had tough games with Texas A&M, they've usually beat us pretty bad.   For us to have a 10‑point basketball game, for our ladies to continue to fight, that says a lot about our team.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions.   
   
 Q.   Coach, you had the run to cut it back to four at halftime, then Texas A&M put the game back to double figures.   What changed the second half?  
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY:   I thought Courtney Williams, number one, hit some really big shots.   I really thought she took the game over in the second half.   She's a very good player.   I really thought she stepped it up in the second half and hit some really big shots for them.   
   
 Q.   Coach, how proud are you of this team that they kept fighting towards the end?  
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY:   I'm very proud of this team.   I just told them that.   I've told anyone that have asked that same question.   
It was tough.   The losing streak was tough.   They could have easily just said, Forget it, the season is over with, we're done.   They decided to turn it around themselves.   They decided to turn around and work a little bit harder, and that's what made that turn.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you very much.
