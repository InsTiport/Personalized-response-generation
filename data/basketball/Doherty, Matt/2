<p>	Q.  What can you say about a performance by a freshman, I think his second time playing in the Garden, McCants' All-American game  --</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think you can beat them down the floor with your speed the way you've been doing?</p>
<p>	Q.  Most people were taking a wait-and-see attitude with this team; what statement was made? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is that one AM or one PM?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was it any more or less emotional than you expected? </p>
<p>	Q.  I know you said you are not ready to anoint them to national champions, but with four games what do you know now that you did not know before Game  1? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about your extended man-to-man defense, still allowed only just a couple back door looks? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about the matchup with Stanford? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said after the Penn State game, you said it's just one win, just one basketball game.  Now it's four wins and this being probably the better win than Penn State, understatement. </p>
<p>	Q.  What can you say now about those expectations that you thought were maybe a little out of control after one game?</p>
