  Q. Talk about the last series?  
 TONY PARKER: The last what?   
  
  Q. The last series or when y'all had the ball with two points.   
 TONY PARKER: The last play?   
  
  Q. Yeah, talk about it.   
 TONY PARKER: We were just trying to run something for Manu, hoping it was going to to switch and the ball ended up on Brent and you saw what happened. Just a tough play and it didn't go our way.   
  
  Q. It seemed like most of y'all never got into rhythm, had so little scoring from just three of you.  
 TONY PARKER: It was just a good defense and missed a lot of easy shots, you know, myself, Timmy, we missed a lot of layups. It was just never -- we never in a good rhythm. They played good defense. When we play good defense, it seems like we never got a rebound.   
 They got a ton of offensive rebounds, and that really hurt us in this game because we never had a chance to go on fast-break or transition because every time they get second-chance points and that hurt us tonight.   
  
  Q. Second chances, fact you were never able to take the lead --  
 TONY PARKER: Every time we had a chance to get close, they hit a big 3 or they get a big rebound and they just keep scoring and so we never had a chance to really make a run.   
  
  Q. Did Manu's ankle stiffen up? He didn't seem to have the quickness and the elevation?  
 TONY PARKER: I have no idea. That's a question you have to ask him. He looks fine. I don't know.
