<p>	Q.  Tony, what do they do that makes it so difficult at times to control the ball? </p>
<p>	Q.  You and Manu both had great success in the first half, triple penetration, getting to the rim, did they do anything specifically in the second half to take that away? </p>
<p>	Q.  They hit as many three-pointers tonight as they had the entire series.  What were they doing on offense that allowed them to get those open looks? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think that you guys lost tonight because of things that y'all did not do or things that the Pistons did, like making plays?  I felt like they just hit tough shots, not that y'all played bad halfcourt defense. </p>
<p>	Q.  Unless my memory is incorrect, it's been a long time since there was a Game 7 in the NBA Finals.  Can you just talk about -- and I'm sure you wish there was not a Game 7 this year coming into, this but can you talk about what it means to be in a Game 7 with everything on the line? </p>
