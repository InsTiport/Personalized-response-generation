 Q.  Talk about playing with Manu. 
 TONY PARKER:  You never know what he's going to do.  He can do anything on the basketball court.  You just have to be prepared and you'll see something you've never seen before.  He's that type of player, great moves, a great defender, great competitor. 

 Q.  Probably the most used word is aggressive when you talk about your games, especially the good games.  Could you get into a little bit more what does aggressive mean in your experience? 
 TONY PARKER:  It's just trying to make some stuff happen, just being in attack mode in defense and in offense and make sure I'm always ready to create for myself or for my teammates. 

 Q.  Is there a link to the number of shots you take or -- 
 TONY PARKER:  It depends, because the way they played defense, you know, they're going under, and heavy pick-and-rolls, so I have to try to be in attack mode.  Coach Pop, we talked about it, to try to use the same strategy like Phoenix tried because you're not going to shoot the ball every time, so that's why they go under and make sure I don't penetrate.  But I have to stay aggressive to make sure we keep pressure on that defense. 

 Q.  What do you expect from them tomorrow night? 
 TONY PARKER:  No idea.  I think they're definitely going to play with a lot more energy, a lot more intensity.  I'm sure they're going to try to clog the paint and make sure everybody is in the paint and make us take outside shots, so our shooters have to be ready tomorrow, make sure we move the ball.  That's going to be the key, ball movement, and make sure we take good shots. 

 Q.  Do you expect to be able to get to the rim the way you did in Game 1? 
 TONY PARKER:  I'm going to try, but I'm sure they're going to play better defense, better pick-and-roll defense, so we'll see what happens.
