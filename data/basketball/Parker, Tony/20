  Oklahoma City   77

Q.   Tony, what does it say about your team that Kawhi, maybe your most valuable player in the Playoffs, has no impact on this game and you still win by 35?   What does that say about the depth and the makeup of this team? 
TONY PARKER:   I don't know.   We just stepped up.   Other guys stepped up, and it was a great team win. 

Q.   What happened at the last seven minutes of the second quarter, first four minutes of the third quarter when you guys blew it open?   What happened and why did you guys play so well? 
TONY PARKER:   I don't know, we had some key stops and pushed the ball, got two big threes from Danny end of the second quarter, gives us a boost, and third quarter we just kept making stops and pushing the ball and got some easy lay‑ups, found Timmy two, three times inside, and just after that we had a big lead. 

Q.   You not only had lay‑ups there, but you had them to begin the game and end the game there were lay‑ups.   What's going on with the Thunder defense that allows you guys to shoot lay‑up after lay‑up? 
TONY PARKER:   We just try to move the ball.   We have to make a decision.   I have a lot of shooters around me, so sometimes they come.   If they come, I'll pass the ball.   Like Game 1, if they don't come, I'll just go all the way to the basket. 

Q.   Do you sense them starting to fray maybe at all, just sort of composure?   These leads you guys are building, do you sense that you're mentally taking advantage‑‑
TONY PARKER:   No, not really.   We just did our job.   We won our first two games at home, and I'm sure they're going to go back and say we have to do our job and win two games at home.   We were in that position in 2012.   We were up 2‑0, and so‑‑ I know after the game, nobody is very happy in their locker room.   Everybody is very focused, and we respect that team.   We know that they're very capable of a comeback, and they did that against us in 2012.   We're just very focused, and nobody is satisfied. 

Q.   Can you talk a little bit about Danny Green, just the roll he got on and how he's come along the last few seasons?
TONY PARKER:   He's playing well.   He's making shots.   When I penetrate, when Manu penetrates, he's going to benefit from all that.   He's a shooter, and that's his job.   He made some shots tonight. 

Q.   Manu says you guys got to be careful because a game like this is not real. 
TONY PARKER:   Totally agree.   Totally agree with Manu.   That's why I said nobody was really satisfied after the game.   We were like, okay, it's just a win.   We just did our job, and let's focus to the next one.   The next one is going to be the hardest one.   That's all we care about is Game 3 and how can we keep playing well because we know OKC, they play very well at home.

Q.   After last year's final against Miami, was Danny Green kind of a marked man coming into this season, and has his role changed any at all in the offense? 
TONY PARKER:   No.   He's got the same role.   If he's open, he's going to shoot the ball. 

Q.   Are you shocked that you continued to have guys under 30 minutes, and this is Game 2 of the Western Conference Finals? 
TONY PARKER:   Not shocked.   I feel lucky.   I don't know if we've had that happen that I didn't play in the fourth quarter in the Conference Finals, but we'll take it.   We have a veteran team, and any rest we can get is going to help our team. 

Q.   Durant and Westbrook, 13 for 40.   Is it the goal to kind of keep them shooting jumpers as opposed to getting to the rim?
TONY PARKER:   Yeah, you're not going to stop them and we know they're going to keep being aggressive and they're going to score some points.   That's for sure.   We just try to make sure they take a lot of shots to score those points.   So far we're doing a pretty good job.   I think we can do even better.   It's going to be harder to stop them at home.   We'll see what happens in Game 3. 

Q.   How did your hamstring feel today?
TONY PARKER:   A little bit better.   I'm still doing a lot of treatment, and my goal is hopefully Sunday I'll feel 100 percent.   Right now I don't feel like it, but it's good enough to play. 

Q.   Tiago had no role in 2012 and he's played so well in the Playoffs and especially these last two games.   Can you just talk about the development you've seen from him? 
TONY PARKER:   Yeah, Tiago is feeling more and more comfortable.   Now he's got a bigger role obviously on the team and is playing great defense, and in the offense I always feel like he's in the great pockets to pass the ball to the next guy or to finish.   Obviously with myself and Manu, he's going to be open a lot.   He's playing very well.
