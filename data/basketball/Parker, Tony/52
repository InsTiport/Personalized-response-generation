 Q. Growing up, who was your favorite basketball player?
 TONY PARKER: Michael is my idol. My dad coming from Chicago, I would have to go with that one.

 Q. Who is your favorite rivalry? Who would you put here on this shirt? 
 TONY PARKER: I think I'm too young yet. I think I need a couple more years so I can decide.

 Q. I will tell you somebody who is here who said you were their favorite rivalry. He is a legend. He is sitting at that table over there. Derrick Fisher said you would be his favorite rivalry. 
 TONY PARKER: When you asked me that question, the first thing that came in my mind is Lakers. Because when I first got drafted, that's all Coach Pop talked about, how we have to beat the Lakers because the Lakers were the main hump for us. 
 So for me, yeah, with Fisher, we had a lot of battles. I like that one. I like the Lakers. Since I have been in the league, I either beat the Lakers or lose to the Lakers, except 2006 we lost to the Mavericks. 
 We won or lost the game to the Lakers. 

 Q. What about the 2009 version of Magic and Michael, who would it be? 
 TONY PARKER: Kobe and LeBron right now. They are going at each other right now. That's fun to watch, too.
