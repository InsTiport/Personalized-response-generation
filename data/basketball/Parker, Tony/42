THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Tony Parker. 

Q.   Tony, you had one basket and three points to start, then 10 in the final part of the game.   What was your mindset in trying to find your offense? 
TONY PARKER:   I was just tired, obviously.   I think all the minutes caught up with me.   It was a tough series, you know, chasing Curry, playing all those minutes.   Tonight I just didn't have it.   It was not there.   Missing some easy stuff. 
But I just kept believing in me.   My teammates, they were behind me.   They would keep telling me, Keep shooting, they'll go in.   Finally open, Manu, great drives, trusting me.   I made two big threes at the end of the game. 
I think all my teammates believing in me and Coach Pop leaving me on the court, had a lot of trust in me. 

Q.   How important was it to go ahead and close this out?
TONY PARKER:   It was huge for this.   With our team, the more rest we get, it gives us a lot of energy for the next series. 
It was very big.   You could see Pop was all over the place.   Everybody knew how important it was to finish tonight and to win on the road.   So it's a big win.   Now we can prepare against Memphis. 

Q.   Defensively how good of a performance was that to keep Curry and especially Klay Thompson under wraps these last four games?
TONY PARKER:   We tried to do the best job we can.   They're great shooters.   It was a team effort to try to slow them down. 
They had two huge games, Game1 and Game2, unbelievable for them.   After that I thought our defense did a good job limiting easy stuff for them, easy transitions for Curry and Klay, not giving pin‑downs, stuff like that. 
Overall with the series, we got them tired. 

Q.   Tony, especially the last couple years when you've been off, it seems the team hasn't been able to succeed.   How was that different tonight?
TONY PARKER:   I think the whole team, we just stayed in there.   Missed a lot of easy shots tonight obviously.   But the whole team kept playing.   Kawhi made some big shots.   Danny.   Manu made a layup.   I think everybody did something positive to try to stay in the game. 
At the end, my teammates, they believed in me and I finally made some shots at the end of the game to win a big game for us. 

Q.   So often they put a bigger guy on you trying to post you up.   Did you do anything recently to better prepare yourself for that or did you rely on skills before?
TONY PARKER:   Me playing defense or offense? 

Q.   Defense?
TONY PARKER:   Defense, I just try to do the best job I can.   Obviously I'm not the strongest guy in the world.   I just try to use my hands, be quick on my feet, try to force them to shoot over me. 
But then my teammates help me two.   Timmy and Tiago, they come and help me.

Q.   Is there still a sense of unfinished business from last year's Western Conference Finals?
TONY PARKER:   Definitely.   We were disappointed last year being up 2‑0, having home court, not being able to go to the finals.   It gives us a lot of fuel for this year. 
I think everybody in the team, we all want to go one more time.   It's been a long time since 2007 we didn't go to the finals.   I think everybody understand that occasionally, opportunities don't come very often.   Last year we missed one, a close one.   We were two games away from the finals.   This year we have another opportunity to go to the finals. 
Thank you.
