<p>	Q. Tony, what's the mood in the locker room?  Are you guys really disappointed after this loss, and do you think maybe you slowed it down a little bit too much?  Did your team slow the tempo down a little too much? </p>
<p>	Q.  This was very similar to the first game, very tight for three quarters and then one team runs away.  Is it like very similar teams and the difference is just going to be those words, aggressiveness and effort and offensive rebounds? </p>
<p>	Q.  It seems like that your team didn't put much effort today, when they took a lead. </p>
<p>	Q.  I'll ask you the same thing I asked Manu:  With all of the things you guys are trying to control tonight, did you expect Ben Wallace to come out and have the type of game that he had against you? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much did his energy right off the bat really hurt you guys in terms of the way the game played out?</p>
