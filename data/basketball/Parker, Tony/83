<p>	Q.  Talk about being up 3-0 and going into the next game?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much of a difference can you see -- you guys have said it, Pop has said it, when you win big games and then maybe come out the next game, and don't have that fire and intensity.  It hasn't been the case, especially in this series?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you seen Timmy getting a little stronger every game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Tony, can you look at Robert Horry, here's a guy who has never been an All-Star and yet he has a chance to play for his 6th ring.  Explain that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Pop said that he thinks that Tim (Duncan) is smarter on the court when Robert (Horry) is on the floor.  Do you see that --</p>
<p>	Q.  Surprised at how often Tim (Duncan) is unable to get posted so deep?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talking about Seattle compared to the Suns?</p>
<p>	Q.  How about yourself?  You got banged around pretty good when you got inside against Seattle.  Doesn't seem like you have been hit as often in this series?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you prefer it this way than big hitting --</p>
<p>	Q.  How important is it for you guys when you are up, trying to stay aggressive, that balance, how do you --</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys have been doing a good job of keeping your focus in this series.  Now you got an opportunity -- I know it is probably the toughest game to win, the closeout game --</p>
<p>	Q.  Off of that tempo, you being a pointguard, you are obviously going to take the brunt of it, but how important has it been for you and Manu (Ginobili), especially when he takes that opening tip and goes in, to really get off to that fast start, you have done it the entire series?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much has this team grown in terms of you guys have said it, Pop would say it, you win a couple of games, you maybe get a little too much confidence and drop a game you shouldn't drop.  That hasn't happened especially in this series. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think you are showing the fact that you guys have more experience at this stage of the playoffs or do you think you are showing -- is it your defense, both of those things, do you guys have an edge --</p>
<p>	Q.  Phoenix has gotten so far this year off being just this fun offensive running team and saying, well, we'll play defense when we get around to it, that kind of thing.  Is it comforting to know that defense is still kind of the most important thing at this stage of the playoffs?</p>
<p>	Q.  Suns are still learning, you think, as a team?</p>
