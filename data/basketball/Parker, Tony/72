 Q.  What's the most difficult thing for a young point guard in this league? 
 TONY PARKER:  To earn the respect and the trust of your teammates and your coaching staff to make sure that you're going to make the right decisions every time. 
 I think that's the toughest thing you have to get through, because for me, as my own experience that was my toughest task:  To earn the trust of Timmy and David (Robinson) and Pop and be able to make good decisions and have the ball in my hands. 

 Q.  Which young point guards do you think have the opportunity to move into that group that you're a part of now? 
 TONY PARKER:  The two obvious ones right now are Chris Paul and Deron Williams.  I think those two point guards are very, very good and they're going to be good for a long time.  And I think they're going to be All-Stars in the next couple of years. 

 Q.  What do you think about a guy like Shawn Livingston? 
 TONY PARKER:  He's good, he's talented, but I'd still take Deron Williams and Chris Paul over him. 

 Q.  Is it a little easier to enjoy this weekend finishing up the first half with those two wins? 
 TONY PARKER:  Definitely.  It was a nice trip here because if we lost that game against Detroit it would be bad.  But it was a great win, especially after that tough loss against Orlando, and then we played Miami, just a tough schedule. 
 And to be able to come back and win a back-to-back, and, you know, with back-to-backs, we have a hard time every time.  So it was a good win.
