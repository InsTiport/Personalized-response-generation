Q.   How is your back?
TONY PARKER:   My back is fine. 

Q.   When coach wants you to take some time off, did you want to argue with him?
TONY PARKER:   I knew I was going to lose that argument with him.   He already scheduled my plane and everything, so there was no way to argue. 

Q.   What are your thoughts on approaching this All‑Star Game?
TONY PARKER:   A great honor to be here.   Just to be with the guys and talk with everybody here.   You have Hakeem talking to us and I always watched him growing up and that's why you love coming to the All‑Star Game, you see Karl Malone and Tim Hardaway and stuff like that.   For me, growing up with those guys, that's what I loved about the All‑Stars too, is to meet those kind of people and share experiences and stuff like that. 

Q.   When you consider the back court in the Western Conference this year, is it a special honor to be among this group and how do you think that group stacks up?
TONY PARKER:   Compared to like before? 

Q.   To any All‑Star back court. 
TONY PARKER:   Oh, wow.   I always say that I think we're in a golden age of point guards.   There's so many great point guards in the league right now and for sure the competition is fierce, it's like very great players. 
And for me it's like, when I'll be older, I'll look at it and be like, wow, in 2012 I was with Steve Nash.   And then you have other great point guards, my first All‑Star and now it's like Lillard and Curry, and I had Jason Kidd, so I played with everybody.   And I played against everybody.   So I'm sure I will look back at it like in five or so years and be like it was great points guards and great players to play with.
