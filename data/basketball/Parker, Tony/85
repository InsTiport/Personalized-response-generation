<p>	Q.  As long as you are playing well you don't want to cut it?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much fun is it to play in a series where all they want to do is run and shoot within six seconds?</p>
<p>	Q.  Because Popovich doesn't seem to be comfortable with scores over 100 points?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is it more like a pick-up game for you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Popovich said you would rather the games, the scores be in the 180s?</p>
<p>	Q.  If you can hold them to 114 a game you guys will be all right?</p>
<p>	Q.  How fast are you from baseline to baseline?</p>
<p>	Q.  The play that you had yesterday, the fast break you intercepted the last -- (inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk a little bit about defending Steve Nash and also how you attack him offensively, just the overall?</p>
<p>	Q.  After further review, Popovich said you guys didn't do as well on the fast break as well as the stats shown.  Did you see that in the film?</p>
<p>	Q.  They play such a different style than anybody else, you see it during the regular season once and you move onto another game.  Is it easier though because you are going to see them the next week or so, is it easier to adapt to what they are doing?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you guys like playing that style of basketball, I mean, you guys like to get up and down do you enjoy --</p>
