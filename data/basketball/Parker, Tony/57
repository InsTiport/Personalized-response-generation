 Q. Tony, was energy an issue coming off of everything you guys have come off of? 
 TONY PARKER: No one gives any excuse. We were in pretty good shape, had a great lead. Not going to try to think, you know, we was tired or stuff like that. 
 We had a great chance to win the game, and we just didn't play well enough in the fourth quarter.

 Q. Tony, what were they doing in the second half to keep you from getting to the basket as easily?
 TONY PARKER: They were doing a good job on trapping, the pick-and-rolls and hard hedge. Had to get rid of the ball and basically trust my teammates. That's what happened. In the second half, if they are going to do that, I'm just going to try to move the ball.
