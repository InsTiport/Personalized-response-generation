Oklahoma City   105
  San Antonio   92

Q.   Tony, what's the biggest difference between the two games in San Antonio, the two here?   Why is the script flipped so much? 
TONY PARKER:   It's a great question.   We're just going to have to play better, bottom line.   We didn't play well here, and now all we can control is Game 5. 

Q.   You were aggressive getting to the lane and finishing at the rim, but Pop said he thought you guys were too‑‑ you were driving too much into the paint and trying to challenge Ibaka.   It was successful for you, but as a team what did you guys need to be doing, because it looked like it was working for you. 
TONY PARKER:   Yeah, I felt great personally.   I was going to the basket, but early in the second half, Pop decided to go with our bench to save our energy, and I think to a certain extent, yes, Pop is right, we have to keep moving the ball and try to find the open shooters.   We just have to find the happy middle. 
But he's right.   It's a lot of time we could have passed it and get a good to great shot. 

Q.   When you left San Antonio you talked about you remembered 2012, you didn't want a repeat of that.   Does this all of a sudden feel like 2012 when you came to Oklahoma City and lost those two games?
TONY PARKER:   I think we should not think like that, like I said earlier, yesterday.   Each game is different, each series, each year, and now we have to focus on Game 5.   We worked hard all season long to have home court, so now it's our job to protect home. 

Q.   You mentioned Pop pulling you and not going back to you.   When you see your team pull to within 12, do you guys, A, want to go back in, and do you expect to go back in? 
TONY PARKER:   No, I trust Pop.   Pop did a great job all season long saving our energy and be fresh for the Playoffs, and that's his decision, and I respect it.   My job now is to be ready for Game 5. 

Q.   Can you see a difference in the way the Thunder are defending you from Game 1 and 2 to Game 3 and 4?
TONY PARKER:   No, I feel great tonight.   I feel great, like Chris said.   I got to the basket, got the shots I wanted.   I was above 50 percent.   I just didn't play a lot.   I only played like five minutes in the second half.   But like I said, I trust Pop, I trust his judgment, and I'll be ready for Game 5.

Q.   Can you talk about Russell Westbrook's game tonight specifically and then the combination of him and Kevin who combined for 71 points?
TONY PARKER:   They played great.   You have to give them credit.   They had a great game, and we're going to have to do a better job to slow them down.   If they're going to score that many points, it's going to be hard for us to win. 

Q.   They won seven straight with Ibaka against you guys, as you know.   Is this the most unique match‑up that you guys have had in quite some time for you guys when they're‑‑
TONY PARKER:   It's a great challenge.   It's a great challenge, and they're playing well against us.   We just have to play better, and there's no excuse.   We're a no‑excuse team.   We just have to go out there and play better.   I don't know how to explain it.   It's the Western Conference Finals, we're playing a great team, and going back home, we just have to find a way to win. 

Q.   They had 12 steals tonight.   Were they more aggressive in the passing lanes or were you a little careless with the basketball?
TONY PARKER:   Maybe a little bit of both, but I thought our energy was good.   I thought we played a lot better than Game 3.   Our energy was better.   They just made great plays.
