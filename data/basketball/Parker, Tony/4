TONY PARKER:   Ball in my hands and I tried to give it up as soon as I can.   But we just didn't make shots.   We had the shots.   I'd be willing to trust my teammates and if they're going to do that strategy, once we make shots then maybe it'll come back to me.   Right now that was their strategy but we had great looks and we shot 36 percent and 53 from the line.   It's going to be hard.   Don't get me wrong, I give a lot of credit to their defense.   They played great defense tonight, and we just couldn't make them.  
   
 Q.   Defensively they were very strong.   Was it their aggressiveness or were they doing something that confused you guys?   
TONY PARKER:   No, they're just hard‑hedging.   I don't know how to explain it, but it's just very, very aggressive on the pick‑and‑roll for me to give it up, and then Boris and then Timmy, they did a quarterback stand.   They become the point guard, and they find the players.   Timmy and Boris make great passes, we had great looks, just couldn't hit them.   
   
 Q.   You've played in a lot of playoff series against some great point guards.   What are some of the challenges of playing against Chris Paul?  
TONY PARKER:   I've been playing against Chris for a long time.   We played in a playoff against each other before, and so he's just‑‑ he does a little bit of everything, and tonight he got it going.   His outside shots were going, and we tried to take away lobs and stuff like that, and so Chris was a little bit open, and he made the shots.   We'll see what we do in Game 2.   
   
 Q.   In some ways is this kind of emblematic of how your season has been, trying to dig yourself out from a hole here?   
TONY PARKER:   Yeah, yeah, a little bit.   For me personally it was definitely a season with ups and downs and a lot of different injuries, and to start with twisting my ankle, I was like, come on.   I was like, couldn't believe it, had to re‑tape.   But, hey, it's like that.   We've been in a lot of different situations since I've been with the Spurs, and we just have to stay together and keep pushing and try to come back.   Just another great challenge for us.   
   
 Q.   Is your thigh okay?  
TONY PARKER:   Yeah, same thing.   It'll be sore tomorrow, but hey, nobody cares.   Wednesday we have to come and play.   
   
 Q.   You have a few days, though.   
TONY PARKER:   Yeah, definitely.   That definitely helps because it will be sore tomorrow.   Hopefully by Wednesday, hopefully I'll be fine.
