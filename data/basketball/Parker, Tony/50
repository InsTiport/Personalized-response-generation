		  TONY PARKER:   I was very confident before the competition, finishing last the first two times I did it.   I was very confident.   No, but I was very happy for Kiara.   She was my motivation today, and I'm very happy that I can help her get a scholarship. 

Q.   What was the difference this time?
TONY PARKER:   I don't know.   I think obviously Kiara is motivation, and I was calmer.   The first time I did it, it was the first time they did the event and I was with Jason Kidd and Gary Payton and I was nervous, because coming from Europe and from France and everything was big, the Allâ€‘Star Game.   And then in 2009 I was just bad.   I was just bad. 
This year I was a lot better.   And I have to say, Cheryl Miller called it the right before the competition.   She said, "Third time's a charm.   You need to win this one."

Q.   Did you practice?   You seemed to pay attention to a lot of detail. 
TONY PARKER:   I didn't practice that much because in 2009 I did the practice and I had the record, like I beat D Will's record.   In practice I was just messing around, and I was practicing too much.   I told my brother this time I'm just going to practice a couple of passes and that's it.

Q.   Was it the bounce pass portion? 
TONY PARKER:   For me the bounce pass is key.   You can make the bounce pass, you're good.   And the jump shot, too, because you stay for like three hours in the locker room and you're cold, and you have to take a jump shot like that, it's tough.
