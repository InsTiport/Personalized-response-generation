  Q. Why was it so difficult to make a run against them tonight?   
 TONY PARKER: Good question. Good question.   
 The Lakers played a great game. Have to give them credit. They just dominated us tonight and looks like they were making every shot. And we just didn't get rid of them. I think we only scored 71 points. You are not going to win a game like that.  
  
  Q. Tony, obviously the Lakers have a reputation for being a very good offensive team. Have you been surprised at all by the defensive job they've done so far in this series?   
 TONY PARKER: They did a great job. They did a great job. You have to give them credit. They have done a good job of keeping me out of the paint. They are doing a great job on Manu.   
 Overall they are playing great defense. So we need to play better. That's the bottom line. We just have to play better and hopefully playing at home will help us.   
  
  Q. How much of a spark do you think just seeing the way Ronny Turiaf was out there? His numbers won't show up on the stat sheet, but just getting down and dirty with you guys and being a pest --  
 TONY PARKER: I think it was the whole team, the whole team played great.
