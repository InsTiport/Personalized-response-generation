<p>	Q.  Talk about how you guys moved the ball tonight?  You whipped it around a lot making the extra pass?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach came in and he said you guys had them rattled or maybe they rattle themselves how?</p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of talk about how Joe Johnson was coming back he was going to play you.  Do you attack him any different than you do Nash?</p>
<p>	Q.  Late in the game you missed a shot at one end I think -- Pop came over had a few words put his arm around you what did he tell you?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about you guys playing your game but in effect you are also playing a little bit of their game.  The fact that everybody talked about them being so fast, has that made you and Manu maybe a little bit more --</p>
<p>	Q.  You have to be on Pop's Page?</p>
<p>	Q.  Game 4 you try and close this thing out.  Talk a little bit about how what has to happen for you guys to close the series out?</p>
<p>	Q.  You knew they were going to throw Joe Johnson at you tonight.  They were thinking that might be a factor.  Did you make a conscious effort of attacking him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Phoenix hasn't done quite the job that Seattle and Denver did.  Do you expect that bubble to burst?</p>
