<p>	Q.You had some easy layups, a couple of dunks, no fear last night, no intimidating presence on the Pistons' behalf?</p>
<p>	Q.  So I'm wrong thinking that their interior presence was lacking last night?</p>
<p>	Q.  Your matchup with Chauncey is pretty key in the series, after one game, how do you feel about that matchup? </p>
<p>	Q.  Him (Billups) scoring 25, is that something you guys can live with, considering you held them to 69? </p>



<p>	Q.  His international background, does he share any of that with you guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  They say coaches grate on players, sooner or later they clean you out, how is it that he's avoided that for so many years?</p>
