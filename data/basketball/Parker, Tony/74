<p>	Q.  The emotions, can you talk about what this means to you?</p>
<p>	Q.  And what did this team -- could I just follow-up and say, what did this team show for you tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  What was the emotion in the third quarter there when you guys were down and all of a sudden something just clicked and you guys went off on a run? </p>
<p>	Q.  On top of that, what was it in the fourth quarter that allowed you to keep the momentum, as opposed to Game 6 where the wheels came off?</p>
<p>	Q.  Why are you wearing the French flag, first of all, and second of all, don't you think that Ginobili could have been a good co-MVP throughout this series with Duncan and how ironic is it that last game's weakness, the three-point shots became the strength in the final?</p>
<p>	Q.  Waiting a long time to ask one. </p>
