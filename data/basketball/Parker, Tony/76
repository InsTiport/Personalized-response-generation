<p>	Q. Yesterday you kind of brought up that it was on your mind what happened in the Laker series last year, the 2-0 deficit, is it more on your guys' minds that they have tied it 2-2? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel like this series has gotten more physical since it got to Detroit?</p>
<p>	Q.  In a series losing by 30 points, does that have any effect for the next game on your confidence? </p>
<p>	Q.  The number of turnovers you had again tonight as a team, is that something the Pistons are doing, or is that something that you guys are doing yourselves? </p>
<p>	Q.  What message did Pop send you guys after the first half? </p>
<p>	Q.  It seemed like as the game wore on, it was harder for you guys to get into the lane.  Can you talk about how difficult penetration was tonight and what is it like to get in the lane and have those guys just collapse on you. </p>
