WAKE FOREST - 80 UCLA - 77   
COACH ALFORD: I thought our guys competed.  This was a team that was plus 12 on the backboard.  We beat them 8.  We hold them to 40% shooting.   
We've got to get back, we've got to watch the tape as coaches because we've got to figure out the new rules because we're doing a bad job of teaching the new rules of emphasis.   
42 free throws to 14.  I've been doing this 25 years.  I've been on the short end of a lot of things.  I've never had an experience where I've had a team get out-shot 42-14 at the free-throw line.  That was the difference in the game.   
I thought we competed hard.  We did the things we wanted to do.  We shot the ball pretty well, 46%.  Didn't turn the ball over.  But you lose 30-8 at the free-throw line, it's going to be a long night.   
 Q.  Tony, what were your impressions on the fouls as well?  
TONY PARKER: It really wasn't an impression on the fouls.  It's just we've got to come out and play harder.  The fouls, we lost that game because there were too many 50-50 balls we didn't get.   
Toughness is what it comes down to.  It's nothing coaches can change.  It's something we've got to soul search.  We've got to go home and soul search.  We played like we were supposed to be here.  They played like they were blessed to be here, like they really wanted it.  We acted like it was a privilege tonight from starters to scholarship guys to walk-ons.  We didn't come out with the enthusiasm as if we're in Hawaii.  We came out with a soft mentality, and we got beat.  We'll continue to get beaten until we toughen up and we get together and play together on both ends of the floor.   
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Alford.   
No questions for coach.  Thank you for your time.
