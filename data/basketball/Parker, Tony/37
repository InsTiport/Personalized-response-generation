Q.   Did you sleep good last night?
TONY PARKER:   Yeah, I slept good. 

Q.   Do you always sleep better after a win?
TONY PARKER:   Definitely, definitely, always.

Q.   Tim was just talking about how it's been a while to have this chance, be this close to getting to The Finals.   How important is it to close it out and not give Memphis any life?
TONY PARKER:   Yeah, we want to finish as soon as we can for a lot of different reasons.   I think that we should give them no hope, and it's always sweet to win on the road.   I'm pretty sure the whole team understands that we have to keep taking nothing for granted and keep playing our game and try to finish tomorrow. 

Q.   You talked more than anybody about how much that rest was useful for you between the games.   What would it mean to you to close this one out tomorrow night and get even more rest?
TONY PARKER:   It would be huge.   It would be a lot of rest.   I think for our team, that's good. 

Q.   Did you notice that last night, the extra rest?   Did you feel it?
TONY PARKER:   I felt like we were really fresh in the second half, especially in overtime.   I felt like our execution was really good and our defense was good, and I think the three days showed a lot in the second half and overtime.

Q.   Down the stretch the ball was in your hands, Tim's, Manu's a lot.   What does it mean to you when you get in those situations and you're with those guys that you've been with for so long?
TONY PARKER:   We feel comfortable.   Obviously we've played a lot of years together and we don't panic, we know what we want to do, and we made a lot of great plays at the end of the game last night.
