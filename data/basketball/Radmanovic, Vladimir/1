 Q. Kobe was 9 for 26 last night. Do you think he needs to do anything different or just play his game?
 VLADIMIR RADMANOVIC: I personally believe we have to move the ball better this game. They're really good defenders when it comes to one-on-one defense. They always have two guys, offensive players on the basket, and our first option was struggling to be there as many times as we thought. Everything we have in our offense, we have to use it as much as possible so they don't play as aggressive and they played in the first game.

 Q. I assume you don't think that will repeat itself I assume?
 VLADIMIR RADMANOVIC: I hope not.

 Q. Talk about the second half of the game. 
 VLADIMIR RADMANOVIC: I can't really tell you what happened. I mean, obviously we had momentum for that six minutes. Execution was the way it was supposed to be, and unfortunately we can't carry it on in the third quarter. They came out really aggressive, jumped on us from the beginning of the third quarter I think in the first minute, and then after that it was -- same game as it was at the start of the game. I don't know. I mean, both teams are going to make runs. You can't just panic when it happens. I don't think we were calm during the period of those runs that they made.
