THE MODERATOR:   We're joined by Fresno State.   Coach, some remarks on tonight's game.   
COACH PEBLEY:   Yeah, I mean, it was a great way for us to start the game.   I think it helped a lot that we were able to turn 'em over and hit some early shots.   We knew that was going to be important.   Way to start both halves.   
I don't think we did as good of a job to open the second half, just knocking down some shots that we created for ourselves.   
Boise has gone through and persevered through a lot all season.   It's so impressive to see how invested their team is through all the injuries they've gone through.   Just wanted to wish them the best of luck as they get their team healed up in the off‑season.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions for the student‑athletes.   
   
 Q.   Rosie, 29 turnovers you forced on Boise State.   What does it mean to get an opening win like this in the tournament?   
ROSIE MOULT:   Obviously it's a good confidence booster for our team.   Our main objective today was to start out hard, be aggressive with our press.   I think them getting 29 turnovers was a result of our tough press.   
   
 Q.   Ki‑Ki, another high‑scoring game today.   What were they giving you?   
KI‑KI MOORE:   I mean, we kind of just take what the defense gives us.   A lot of our teammates was driving and kicking.   So them driving and kicking opened me up a lot tonight.   
   
 Q.   Talking about the defense, 29 turnovers.   It seems like they gave you a lot.   Can you talk more about what really led to that 31‑point lead.   
KI‑KI MOORE:   I would just say our pressure and our pace.   We wanted to play pretty fast tonight to get them up and down with us.   
I think they got tired pretty fast.   By us playing and pressuring them a lot, I think it resulted in a lot of turnovers.   
   
 Q.   Rosie, this was a game where a lot of reserves got some playing time.   What did you really see from Robin and Jacinta today?   
ROSIE MOULT:   Robin comes in and plays her role really well.   She knocks down her role.   Jacinta was crashing the boards, which was important for us.  
   
 Q.   You have either Wyoming or Colorado State up next.   What are you going to focus on heading into tomorrow's game?   
ROSIE MOULT:   The main focus will be on ourselves again.   Doing things like rebounding, boxing out, being good on defense will lead to good offense.   
   
 Q.   Rosie, could you have imagined getting off to a better start than you did today?  
ROSIE MOULT:   Obviously we got off to a really good start.   We thought we would start off well because we were aggressive.   But to get the lead in the beginning was really good.   
KI‑KI MOORE:   I think our team was prepared for this game.   We came in with a chip on our shoulder knowing what we had to do and I believe we got it done.  
   
 Q.   How did you stay focused at halftime with such a big lead and keep the intensity?  
KI‑KI MOORE:   I mean, just coming in every half, you just have to know that the team's never going to give up.   We knew they were going to come back and fight back.   They fought till the end.   I think we kept our intensity and our focus as well.   
ROSIE MOULT:   That's the same.   Obviously you have to focus.   Everyone playing in this tournament, if you lose, you're out.   Everyone's going to get after it.   We had to make sure we kept our intensity high, crashing the boards.   
   
 Q.   Can the two of you talk about the ball movement, the crisp passing, knowing each other so well, the assists.   
ROSIE MOULT:   I think offensively played really well tonight.   We've got great attackers on our team.   When the defense tries to stop them, they're kicking out.   When they're pressuring on the outside, they can get to the basket.   I think it worked really well tonight.   
KI‑KI MOORE:   I think we're at our best when we rotate the ball, everyone gets a touch, and play inside out, so everything opens up, our tags, drives.   Then also just our three‑point shooting.   
   
 Q.   Coach, 26‑point lead down to 14 in the second.   Were you worried about game slippage there and how you deal with that in the future?  
COACH PEBLEY:   A little bit.   We had a pretty good idea how they were going to get back into the game at that point.   I just felt like where our offense was aggressive, we needed to manage the clock a little bit better.   We were able to find and get quick shots, but not much time was coming off the clock, which gave them even more possessions in that second half.   
So, you know, as you saw probably the last four and a half minutes we slowed things down a little bit, were a little bit more deliberate.   I think that helped us really just try and get to their fatigue a little bit.   
But, you know, concerned?   You're always concerned as a coach.   I think even with a 26‑point lead, we're only them hitting two threes away from this being a game.   
But we've got great leaders, great defenders on the floor that were pretty self‑motivated.  
   
 Q.   Was that the best you could play defense the first 10 minutes?   
COACH PEBLEY:   I've seen us play consistent defense like that.   I've also seen us not play great defense.   It's really, again, I think what these young women commit themselves to.   
We've got a lot of different defensive schemes, different attacks.   It doesn't matter what we do, it's about them executing.   You know, they do a great job with it.   
We're going to play consistently great defense in this next game.   
   
 Q.   I know you didn't show it, were there any butterflies to start the tournament?   
KI‑KI MOORE:   Not with me.   I mean, I feel like it's just excitement, just to come out here, play the same teams we've played already, to know if you lose it's like go home.   
So I just feel like it's excitement, play everyone, have everyone in the same place at the same time.   
ROSIE MOULT:   Yeah, there are a little bit of butterflies.   To go into the tournament you have to win three.   We finished off the conference really well, so I think there was more confidence going into it.   
THE MODERATOR:   We'll continue with questions for coach.   
   
 Q.   Ki‑Ki talked about having a chip on her shoulder.   Were you guys happy with the statement you made?   
COACH PEBLEY:   We didn't talk about a statement.   We just talked about winning, survive and advance (laughter).   
We had a healthy amount of respect for Boise State.   I definitely have a lot of respect for Gordy.   He's one of those coaches that I've competed against, coached against for a long time, from back to our WAC days.   
As a young coach, I felt whenever I played against his teams, I really looked at film, evaluated the decisions I made, I was going to get better as a coach.   He's a very, very good coach.   
Our focus was really about how do we get past Boise State first, not trying to send a message to anybody else.   
   
 Q.   How do you get better for the next game?  
COACH PEBLEY:   Rest.   I think that's the number one thing.   You don't change anything.   My philosophy, you don't change anything at this time of year.   They're playing instinctually.   They worked really hard to learn the system, incredibly hard at doing that.   
It's really about recovery, rest, making sure they're prepared for tomorrow.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you very much, coach.   
COACH PEBLEY:   Thank you.
