Indiana   68
  Penn State - 63

THE MODERATOR:   We're joined by head coach Coquese Washington, Candice Agee and Sierra Moore.   Questions for the student‑athletes.

Q.   Candice, what can you say about how you performed in the forward today?   You were getting a lot of shots down.   How did it feel to be getting the ball so much?
CANDICE AGEE:   I think that it was something that we know to do and something that we've found that is we get better shots off in the paint.   So not that it was a surprise to me.   Something that we work on, something that we try to focus on doing is getting the ball inside and out.

Q.   Sierra, what can you say then today what your fight was that second half rally, what can you say and what you guys had in your hearts through the second half to try to battle back?
SIERRA MOORE:   I mean, we're a very competitive team.   So we always come out fighting, and we're going to fight to the end, whether win or lose.   And I think that's what we had and we just came up short. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.   Questions for Coach. 

Q.   Coach, what can you say about the growth we've had this year with the team.   And maybe the battle that the team had today in this game?
COACH WASHINGTON:   There's certainly a lot of learning, a lot of lessons that we'll take away from this season, this game, the Big Ten Conference play. 
We've got the majority of the team coming back next year.   So a lot of these lessons and the growth we saw over the course of the season is something we'll build.

Q.   What can you say about Kaliyah Mitchell, having a double‑double today.   She did pretty will.   What can you say about her efforts today, as well as Candice Agee's?
COACH WASHINGTON:   We had some good efforts out there.   The thing is Indiana has a very balanced team inside/outside.   And when you've got a balanced attack like that, it makes it, it challenges your defense and the way that they balance that attack, driving and getting into the paint as well as their ability to shoot from the outside, that was tough for us to defend today. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, Coach.
