 Q. What's it like to be such a young player to be on such a good team as you are right now? 
 DeJUAN BLAIR: It's been wonderful playing with the best. I've learned a lot. 

 Q. How about the first half, almost a record-setting half for the Spurs. 
 DeJUAN BLAIR: It's been good, the first half, totally. So now we have got to see if we can do it again.

 Q. Are you starting to size up the West? Lakers are down, Dallas, so many good teams, where you might fit in and who you might play?
 DeJUAN BLAIR: No, I'm not looking at the playoffs right now. We just are looking at getting better. 

 Q. How about in college, have you been following them much? 
 DeJUAN BLAIR: I've been watching a couple of games and seen they were doing good. Hat goes off to them. They are having a heck of a season and they just have to keep it up. March Madness, anybody can go down, though.
