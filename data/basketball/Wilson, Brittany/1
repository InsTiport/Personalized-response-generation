THE MODERATOR:   Welcome Colorado, Coach Linda Lappe, Arielle Roberson and Brittany Wilson.   Coach, we'll have you open and then questions. 
COACH LAPPE:   You've got to give Stanford a lot of credit.   They're a good basketball team.   They've only lost a couple games for a reason.   You know, they struggled in the first half.   We got them out of some of the things that they were trying to do, and then really just erupted in the second half.   Free throws were probably the biggest difference in the game.   We put them to the free‑throw line way too much, and they were just a little bit too much for us today.
I thought we played with them for a lot of the game.   We just had trouble scoring there for a segment and defending in the same segment, and that allowed them to get a lead on us, and we were never able to really recover from that.

Q.   How much of what happened after the half could you sort of you knew was coming?   You knew they'd make adjustments and make a run at you guys and then you'd have to adjust to that?   Did you kind of know that was coming and it was up to you to adjust that? 
COACH LAPPE:   Yeah, playing Stanford is not a sprint, a marathon.   There are a lot of teams that have been ahead of them at the half this year, and really ahead of them middle of the way in the second half.   I thought we lost our focus to start the second half.   We talked about that at halftime making sure that we were going to put two halves together and play well.   You have to play well for 40 minutes to beat Stanford.   When you start making mental errors, they really take advantage of that, and you could see that was knocking down some open shots, and a few fouls with times that we just weren't in the right position. 
So, yeah, we knew they were going to make a run there.   They're a really good team.   So we didn't withstand it very well, and we weren't scoring at the rate that they were scoring.

Q.   You held them to 21 field goals, which is their season low, and in the first half Chiney only had five points.   What was the plan on her and how were you able to limit her touches in the first half? 
COACH LAPPE:   Well, we wanted to help off of Mikaela Ruef, and then just not let her get to a body.   We essentially didn't guard her with any one player.   What that allowed us to do is she had a hard time finding a body to post on.   She's very physical.   She's very strong.   When you give her a body to post on it, they feed her well and then she makes a lot of great moves. 
So I thought our ability to pressure their guards and keep the ball out of her hands was pretty effective.   Second half they started getting by us with their guards, and now they were exchanging our help side and different things like that.   But in the first half, we just were steady.   I think we made one defensive error in the first half because of our positioning.   Second half we made quite a few more than that.

Q.   Can you talk about the difference between the first half for you and the second half?   Did you feel like in the second half you were still getting good looks and they just weren't falling? 
BRITTANY WILSON:   Yeah, I essentially felt like I got the same looks.   My legs just were short, a couple of them were in and out.   My shots just were starting to fall short, but I essentially feel like I got the same shots I did in the first half.   My legs just didn't carry me through this time.

Q.   Brittany, how would you describe your senior season?   It's been obviously some highs early on and some lows.   Now it seems like you guys were playing pretty well. 
BRITTANY WILSON:   I would just say it's been a war.   You know, win every battle.   But I wouldn't trade them for anything in the world.   I'm proud of the fact that we gave everything.   When our backs were against the wall, we fight.   That is one thing I can always say about this team.   Doesn't matter if we have three, if we have six, we're coming to fight.   I think that we showed that up until the buzzer went off.   I think that's all you can ask for.

Q.   Arielle, how much does this experience going against an All‑American like that help you going forward? 
ARIELLE ROBERSON:   I mean, I think the whole season helped me progress, but especially going against Chiney.   You don't go against that every game, especially preseason, you don't really see that.   And throughout conferences there are multiple post players.   I think she's made me tougher.   She's given me a lot of things to work on that I know my weaknesses.   It's just a great honor to go against her and show what I've got.
