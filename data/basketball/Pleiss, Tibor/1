  Q. What are you feelings and what do you think you'll bring to the Nets?   
 TIBOR PLEISS: I was so excited to be here, and I say thank you and I must say thank you to my parents and my coaches, all the staff, my national coach. It's nice to be here. It's a nice feeling.   
  
  Q. Can you describe your basketball game?   
 TIBOR PLEISS: I am a good defender and I like to shoot the ball, this is what I can do. I think I must fight for my dream. This was one of my dreams to be in the Draft, and I think, yeah, I must work next year for my next dream for the NBA. And at the moment, I play for the German team, but my dream is the NBA.   
  
  Q. Do you follow the NBA, and what do you know about the Nets?   
 TIBOR PLEISS: The Nets, I don't follow the NBAs -- this was a dream. If you ask me for ten players in the NBA, I could maybe say the best players. But the NBA was the best league of the world, and I don't know, this is a dream, it's a dream. I like the sports, the basketball, and I will do everything to be here and to play basketball.   
  
  Q. What are your major strengths on the court? What do you bring to the Nets, your assets? How do you classify your strengths or assets, rebounding, scoring, blocked shots?   
 TIBOR PLEISS: Yeah, blocked shots. I give the best defense that I can and to play good basketball, I think that's my goal.
