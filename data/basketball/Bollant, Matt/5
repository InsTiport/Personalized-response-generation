COACH BOLLANT:   I thought we showed a lot of fight, and the stats showed that.   We had 16 steals and 17 offensive rebounds, forced 24 turnovers, which showed a lot of fight.   I thought the difference of the game was the end of the first half.   It was 30‑29 with two minutes left in the half, and to get outscored 11‑0 at the end of the half was really disappointing.   That foul trouble with Ivory getting three and Jacqui hurt us that that first half and our bench didn't give us the lift we needed there as we went into the half.   
We battled, got down the second half, came back, cut it to nine.   I thought it was a big charge call driving to the rim.   It would have been great to keep a little more pressure on them, but the charge call kind of changed the momentum of that and didn't get it done.   But obviously the shooting percentages, if you're looking at that, jumps out at you, as well.   Credit Iowa for making a lot of shots, and Doolittle played a really good game, but the shooting percentages really hurt us.   
   
 Q.   Doolittle obviously had a big game.   What was it defensively you guys were lacking or what were they doing offensively to lead to that?   
AMBER MOORE:   I think we weren't getting the trap as hard as we would like in the short corner.   That's where they hurt us the most, and getting that back side over to take away that pass.   
   
 Q.   Amber, for a senior, how tough is that last walk off the court, and what are the emotions?   
AMBER MOORE:   It's tough just knowing that this is my last game in college, and just being to play with my teammates and knowing I can't play anymore.   It's emotional, but I think as a team we fought, and that's all you've got.   
   
 Q.   The same question I asked the players.   What about your defense or what were they doing offensively that led to Doolittle having such a big game today?  
COACH BOLLANT:   Yeah, I think part of it, throwing the ball over the top, I think our lack of size hurt us and Grant just not being physically as strong, when she got touches she was able to finish, and I think they threw it over the top a few times and just our inability and lack of size to be really able to contest her, and then in the first half she got out and ran, and I remember I thought that was a big bucket.   She had an and‑one in the first half that I thought showed her athleticism.   
She's gotten a ton better.   Give her a lot of credit for really working on her game.   She plays much more aggressive than she used to, and we didn't limit her touches, but her lack of size limited her ability to finish.   
   
 Q.   When Logic was on the bench with fouls, it's kind of obvious but how much of a momentum‑‑  
COACH BOLLANT:   Yeah, I felt like that was the difference in the game.   We were down 30‑29, up 28‑27, and Logic on the bench, and for them to go on an 11‑0 run to end the half was just‑‑ that really hurt us.   We got in foul trouble, as well, so we had a couple of our best players on the bench, but with Logic on the bench, credit their bench players for stepping up and making plays to help them finish the half really well.
