Q. Where are you from?  How long have you been playing NBA 2K?
JUAN GONZALEZ: I'm from Miami.
Q. How long have you been playing NBA 2K?
JUAN GONZALEZ: I've been playing 2K since 2K 12.
Q. What's a typical day for you, how long do you play?
JUAN GONZALEZ: Typical day for me?  I'm not going to lie to you, this year has been probably my -- I haven't played 2K as much, hours-wise, this year, but I'd say a good five, six hours a day.  That's what I would say.
Q. Do you think the NBA 2K League appeals more to NBA fans or gaming fans?
JUAN GONZALEZ: I think it's more the gaming fans, honestly.
Q. What's your team in 2K?
JUAN GONZALEZ: The Heat.
Q. What's another game you love besides 2K?
JUAN GONZALEZ: Madden.  Big Madden fan.
Q. Are you as good at Madden as you are at 2K?
JUAN GONZALEZ: I would say so.  Yeah, I would say so.
Q. What went through your head when you heard your name being called?
JUAN GONZALEZ: It didn't feel real.  I was shocked, and the fact that I got to stay home and represent my hometown team was an honor.
Q. Can you just talk about this whole experience from combine to the draft to tonight, how it felt?
JUAN GONZALEZ: Well, the combine, it felt like it tested everybody, mentally, skill-wise.  After the interview process, for me, I got 250 emailed in the second wave, but my email was a little delayed, so I was nervous.  It was one of those, I didn't think I was going to make it.  And then once I got the phone call, the 102 phone call, it was -- I got it instantly, I cried.  It was tears of joy because for me to come this far with 2K, it still doesn't even feel real to me.  And this whole week -- these last couple days have been -- they've been emotional.  Like today is -- it doesn't even feel real.
