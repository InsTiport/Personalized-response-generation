<p>	Q.  Talk about when it got tight down the stretch how you guys responded, especially after they are up 46-41 you guys really hung in.  Talk about playing as a team?</p>

<p>	Q.  Talk about the work on Wright and the first half as opposed to the second half, what you did differently in the second half?</p>
<p>	Q.  About the eight-minute mark you got three or four buckets really quick there.  At that point was the team running more, playing to get you the ball or did you feel a sense that you wanted to get in to make a difference at that point in the ballgame?</p>
<p>	Q.  How frustrated were you the first half picking up the fouls, seeing Antoine go off; you weren't able to respond?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you all played A&amp;M you were the only player for your team to score in double figures.  Tonight there was five of you.  Talk about the difference as far as that goes.</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned A&amp;M kind of bouncing back last time you played them.  You get a chance to play Kansas now.  You played them tough last time; what do you expect tomorrow?</p>

<p>	Q.  Jeremiah, you said yesterday somebody asked you whether you were looking forward to playing in the NIT or not.  You said you wanted to play in the NCAA tournament and win this thing.  Now that you won this do you think the momentum will help you possibly achieve that goal?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the difference, the way you all played Antoine defensively in the second half?</p>
<p>	Q.  Second half you seemed to come out in attack mode as far as offense.</p>
<p>	Q.  The charge when Lance was called for charging, the crowd really picked up on that.  Seems like you guys picked up on it too.  Did that change the emotions?</p>
<p>	Q.  Also looked like you got some energy with Jeremiah Massey, went on that run at the eight-minute mark.  Does he have a sense for a critical point in the game where he wants to demand the ball and put in some buckets and change the momentum?</p>
<p>	Q.  How hardened or tougher are you guys now going into the games like Oklahoma at home and at Colorado to come down the stretch when it gets tough, is this team -- they're receptive to that and kind of know what to do maybe a little bit more?</p>
