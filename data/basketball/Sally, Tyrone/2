<p>	Q.  Providence came out and trapped you, trapped the wing aggressively.  How did you combat that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you tell us what concerns you had about getting your team here when you were having your trials.  Talk about the mental toughness they had to overcome. </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you take us through the day?</p>
<p>	Q.  Part of the dialogue has been about West Virginia needing another win to solidify its place.  I was wondering, were you of the same thinking, and how do you feel now about it? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about preparation for Providence.  You don't have a lot of time to prepare for the Eagles.  Your thoughts? </p>
<p>	Q.  For the players, what was your reaction to everything you guys went through just to get here? </p>

<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the challenge of playing Boston College. </p>

<p>	Q.  Kevin, you got in a early flow.  What did that feel like? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you have more room to shoot than you expected or have in the past? </p>
<p>	Q.  You read a lot that this team doesn't have talent to do what they've done.  Can you talk about that. </p>
<p>	Q.  You were in the first two Boston College games ahead in the first half.  What happened in the second half? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did they do anything differently against you to defend the three than any other team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Who do you credit -- Gomes had two points in the first 18 minutes. </p>
<p>	Q.  With everything it took to get here, how nice was that start, you didn't miss a beat? </p>
<p>	Q.  For Tyrone and Kevin, looked like a lot of tournaments, a lot was let go.  It was a physical game.  Did you adjust anything? </p>

<p>	Q.  You just said you already had a chip on your shoulder coming into this, Tyrone.  What did that stem from?  How does that motivate you guys?  Can you elaborate on that? </p>
<p>	Q.  You think you have an NCAA tournament berth now?  Was this a game you thought would get you over the hump? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, can you tell us about the challenge that you and your staff will face, having played this game, and then the typical tournament practice, prepare, all of the different things that you and your staff and your players have got to do and then come back and play in less than 24 hours?</p>
