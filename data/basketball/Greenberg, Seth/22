<p>	Q.  Seth, I thought your guards did a much better job this time against their guards both offensively and defensively. </p>
<p>	Q.  It's far from over, but can you describe what this first BIG EAST experience was like?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think the magnitude of your first loss to Rutgers had an impact on the rest of the games?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you feel?  Will you be okay for tomorrow? </p>
<p>	Q.  What help have you got in terms of forcing turnovers? </p>
<p>	Q.  Two days ago you said Herve Lamizana was a great, great player.  You completely made him a nonfactor today. </p>
<p>	Q.  Seven of the last eight games you haven't led at half time.  You guys are rarely ahead at half time. </p>
<p>	Q.  What makes you a good second-half team?  Is it conditioning?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was surviving that last minute like describing a wild New York cab ride? </p>

<p>	Q.  Can you talk about playing Pittsburgh? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said you were kind of sick coming into this game.  How tough is it going to be to bang against Pitt, a physical team? </p>
<p>	Q.  What do you remember from them last time? </p>

<p>	Q.  What does winning this tournament game mean to you even though you might not have had the individual game you wanted? </p>
<p>	Q.  How different are you from the first time you played Pitt? </p>
<p>	Q.  Bryant, can you describe for us how you felt walking out for the warm-ups?  What percentage did you put yourself in? </p>


<p>	Q.  Was it a flu? </p>
