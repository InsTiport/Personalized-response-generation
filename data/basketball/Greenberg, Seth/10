THE MODERATOR:   Coach will make an opening statement and then we'll have questions for the players, please.   
SETH GREENBERG:   I thought we played 30 really competitive minutes of basketball.   I thought we had that one little four or five‑minute stretch where we got soft.   We weren't as‑‑ we didn't compete as hard as we needed to offensively, and we got soft defensively.   We melted on two back‑to‑back ball screens.   We weren't quick enough to close out on the shooter, and then we shot ourselves in the foot.   The out‑of‑bounds, the turnovers were brutal.   But I thought we also did a lot of good things.   We got the ball where we wanted to against the zone.   I thought the first 30 minutes we really did a good job defensively guarding the ball and sticking to what we wanted to do in terms of our game plan.   
We're a work in progress.   That's why you play games like this, to kind of see where you are and where you need to get to.   Where they are is where we're trying to get to.   We have a lot of work ahead of us, but I saw a lot of positive things.   Erick (Green) being able to play and compete after basically practicing two days in the last 12 days was a positive.   I thought that we shared the ball.   We were pretty unselfish.   We need to do a better job of getting to Victor.   Again, we have to put this behind us because the game on Friday is very important.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions for the players, please.   
   
 Q.   For both guys, if you will, does that zone wear on you both physically and mentally as the game goes on?   
JARELL EDDIE:   Definitely mentally.   They take so much space up on the back line and it pushes us out offensively and kind of pushes us away from what we're trying to do offensively.   So definitely mentally.   
ERICK GREEN:   I would say the same thing.   They're very long and I think we didn't get enough penetration.   When we did, we made plays.   They are very active.   I think we did a good job.   I think we did a really good job, but like I say, we have some work to do.   The zones, it was a good zone.   
THE MODERATOR:   Anything else for the players?   Okay, gentlemen.   Thank you.   
   
 Q.   Seth, the Joseph kid, this is my take, it doesn't look like he is playing all out, dunking and spectacular.   You look up and he's got 20 and 10 and some steals, is he one of those guys who you have to kind of know basketball to appreciate him?   
SETH GREENBERG:   He's physically strong, he shoots the ball with range, he's got a good enough first step that he can get by people and take a hit and get to the rim and play through contact.   He rebounded the ball better than I thought he would today.   His first step was a little bit quicker.   But he knows how to get himself open.   I think that's the big thing.   They do a nice job.   I think the thing that makes Jim so good is he puts guys in position to be successful.   
He has a great feel for putting guys in position and getting them the ball where they need it or want it, I should say.   That's kind of what makes him good.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk about Dion Waiters a little.   He comes off the bench and gives them 11 points.   
SETH GREENBERG:   The guy is a beast.   He attacks in transition, he attacks off ball screens.   He's shooting the ball now, which makes it that much more difficult to guard.   He came off that double ball screen turned the corner and blew it right to the front of the rim.   We were supposed to trap him, but with the first screen we never got there.   
To me to have the ability to have a guy like that come off the bench, he can single‑handedly change a game.   He's kind of an Energizer Bunny on the offensive side of the floor.   He's physically strong.   The strength of their back court is their strength.   They are big, thick, tough guys.   
   
 Q.   When Scoop wasn't playing that well too.   
SETH GREENBERG:   Yeah, well, Scoop (Jardine) was a good player.   I think this other guy has a chance to be a great player.   Scoop was a good player who has had a great career.   This guy has a chance to be really special.   If he shoots the ball the way he did today and he's as aggressive coming off screens and he's got good hands in the zone, that guy has a chance to be really special.   He's got kind of an NBA guard's game.   Like Dern getting in the lane and making a play.   
   
 Q.   You had the number one rated three point defense coming into this game.   Syracuse shot 47% from the three tonight.   Did you talk to your guys heading into this about how they might look to do that?   Was that on your radar?   
SETH GREENBERG:   We defended well if the first half.   They made a couple of threes in the zone.   On penetration we overhelped a couple of times.   This is one of the better Syracuse shooting teams I can remember.   You think about Joseph, you think about Triche.   They have guys that can make shots that stretch you out a little bit more and they have guys that can make free‑throws.   This is a better shooting team for sure.   
   
 Q.   You were leading in the whole game until that 12:10 left in the first half.   What did that do to you after that?   
SETH GREENBERG:   I don't know ‑‑   they wore us down.   We played a lot of guys a lot of minutes.   Again, we had opportunities.   We didn't embrace some of the opportunities and they took advantage of others.   I can look back in this game and say we melted.   We didn't guard the ball as well as we needed to down that stretch.   We weren't as tough in terms of buying into defensive transition they attacked us.   To play them, you have to rebound the ball and you have to take them out of transition.   If you can do those two things‑‑ the first half the pace was exactly what we wanted it to be.   The second half during that stretch they got the pace where they wanted it.   That was really the difference.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thanks, Coach.
