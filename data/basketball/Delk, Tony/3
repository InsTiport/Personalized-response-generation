COACH PITINO:  That sounds unbelievable.  UMass game was such a war for us.  We knew this would be as well.  Tony Delk came up like the All American he is.  We did a great job of penetrating the zone, we couldn't make the 8 foot shot.  We untied her (wife, Joanne) and brought her out for this game.  Well, I'm going to tell you something, it's our 20th wedding anniversary this Wednesday.  I haven't celebrated in three weeks, but New York City is going to be painted tonight.  Well, he kept telling me for the last three weeks, you don't have to wait for the touch, I'm ready now, but he's really big. 
 
TONY DELK:  Yes, it was, I thought they played extremely hard.  Without my teammates it would be impossible. They really looked good out there.  Syracuse was a hard team. And I was happy we came up with this victory. 
 
COACH PITINO:  Well, you know what?  A little bit like the Packers.  We've been close all season long, but the whole state owns this team.  And we're so happy for Kentucky.
