 Q.  Could you just describe your style of play and what you'll bring to your new team?  
BRUNO FERNANDO: I think my style of play is just a guy that is going to come and play hard, bring a lot of energy and patience on the floor every second I'm out there.  A guy who is rooting for my teammates, always trying to make sure my teammates are doing okay and making sure everybody on the team is doing what they're supposed to do.   
Like I said, I think basketball-wise a lot of things are going to take care of itself.  I think I work hard enough to make sure that everything else, which includes my skills in basketball, are going to be fine.  Just a guy that's going to come here and rebound and try to do whatever I can to help my team win.
