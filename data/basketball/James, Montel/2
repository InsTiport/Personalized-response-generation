Northern Iowa   63
  Loyola   49

THE MODERATOR:   Coach Porter Moser is here of the Loyola Ramblers.   We're going to ask him to make a statement about the game and probably go right to questions. 
COACH MOSER:   You have to really play well to beat Northern Iowa.   They just do so many things.   They make you have long possessions because they take so many things away defensively.   There's a reason why they have 29 wins or 30.   There's a reason why they're top seven, eight in defense. 
We just never could get any type of pace going because they just grind you out defensively.   You've got to credit their defense.   You just have to play really well and physical to beat that team. 
THE MODERATOR:   I'll take questions for the student‑athletes, Milton Doyle and Montel James.

Q.   For both players, what does Northern Iowa do in defense that makes it so difficult to consistently find good shots against them? 
MILTON DOYLE:   They play very sound, make very few mistakes, play together, talk, just energetic, made you make extra plays. 
MONTEL JAMES:   They just play hard.   That's the bottom line.   They played hard, and they just stuck together on the defense.   they talked everything out.   They were just tough on the ball, tough grind on the post, and that was the break point.

Q.   Montel, they were doubling you most of the game in the post.   How frustrating was that for you offensively? 
MONTEL JAMES:   I kind of saw it coming.   The coaches told me.   But I just wanted to be strong with the ball and make good passes out of it.   Just be effective enough to get the ball where it needs to be. 
THE MODERATOR:   Gentlemen, thank you very much.

Q.   Porter, where does it put the program now at this point going through the season getting the win last night and playing in the semifinals today? 
COACH MOSER:   I'm proud of how far we've taken the program to date.   The move into the league was just harder than people think.   For us, I'm proud of where we've moved it, but I'm not satisfied where we are, and I'm hungry to get what Northern Iowa and Wichita has, the two elite teams in the league.   Obviously, Illinois State getting that championship game. 
Very proud of the effort, the culture of where we're going.   We've taken it a long ways, but by no means satisfied.   Very hungry to be on this stage and be sitting here talking about Sunday's game. 
It should fuel us in the off‑season.   We talked about last year fueling us, and then this year we were picked unanimous tenth in the league.   Milton was out 12 games.   So very proud of the guys.   I think the arrow's definitely going up.   The excitements going up, but unequivocally not satisfied.

Q.   Porter, I saw you pull your three seniors aside out of the locker room.   What were you saying to them right there? 
COACH MOSER:   It was a moment between the seniors and I, and I just‑‑ those three mean a lot to me, mean a lot to the program.   I know they wanted this badly.   It's their last chance to play in an NCAA Tournament, didn't happen. 
So we just had conversation about a couple things, moving in the future here, what could be happening in the next week or two with our team possibly, and also just let them know how much they mean to me and the program. 

Q.   Is Northern Iowa one of the more frustrating teams to play against?   You have to guard‑‑ I don't know, taking chances‑‑
COACH MOSER:   It's a great word.   Frustrating is the word.   We felt last night we were trying to get tempo.   We're not the biggest team, but we want to try to get tempo.   They don't want to let you get tempo.   They take away so much.   It's like going to the dentist.   You're sitting there trying to‑‑ I think we only took 39 shots.   We shot 46 percent.   We only took 39 shots. 
Because they grind out long possessions.   They don't give you anything.   I know your question to the student‑athletes, but my take on what they do is their huddle just orchestrates so much.   They're so versatile, they'll jump out on a ball screen, then they'll lateral, then they'll switch it.   They change it up. 
They don't‑‑ they're always‑‑ they got five guys in sync that don't miss their assignment defensively.   Sometimes you get young teams, you got guys missing their assignments.   It seems like they're always on point defensively, and it's a credit to Jake and his staff and those young guys. 
I think it's an amazing stat with Northern Iowa, someone said it's like minus 16 points allowed from last year to this year.   That's a complete focus in the off‑season.   You achieve what you emphasize.   That's an unbelievable stat.   To have that big a difference in how much they let up last year to this year, that's a program focus and emphasis, and you got to credit them. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you very much and best of luck.
