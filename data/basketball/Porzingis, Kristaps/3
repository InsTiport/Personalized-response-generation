Q. Any prediction for the Rising Stars Challenge?
KRISTAPS PORZINGIS: We're going to get the win.  I think Mario [Hezonja] is going to get (indiscernible), and he's going to get 30 points.
Q. Will it be fun to go up against those guys?
KRISTAPS PORZINGIS: Yeah, yeah, it will be fun to go up against those guys.  Some of them we play during the season.  But it will be fun to go up against them not in a serious way like that, but having fun and still trying to compete.
Q. What has this whole experience been like for you, not just today, but everything about All-Star Weekend?
KRISTAPS PORZINGIS: It's very similar to what I did post-draft, lot of interviews and stuff.  But it's been fun so far.  Engaging with the fans and a lot of social media stuff, and now the thought is to play the game.  I'm excited for the game.
Q. Is there anything special you have in store?
KRISTAPS PORZINGIS: I can't tell you all the secrets.  We already talked about things we want to do during the game, so hopefully we can put on a good show.
Q. Did you make any friends here so far?
KRISTAPS PORZINGIS: Yeah, of course.  I knew a couple of these guys and a few of these guys, but now I've met some more.  So we've got a connection quick and hopefully we can show that on the court, too.
Q. Everything has been so serious (indiscernible)?
KRISTAPS PORZINGIS: Yeah, it's fun to kind of relax a little, but at the same time, you want to stay focused.  You don't want to look bad out there.  You want to have a good game, and you want to have a win.  But it's good to be a little more relaxed and not take it so seriously.
Q. Are you going to stick around for the weekend or are you leaving tomorrow?
KRISTAPS PORZINGIS: I'm going to leave Saturday morning.
Q. To New York or are you going somewhere warmer?
KRISTAPS PORZINGIS: I'm going somewhere with my family.
Q. Warm?
KRISTAPS PORZINGIS: Warm (laughing).
Q. Did you need a break after this?
KRISTAPS PORZINGIS: Right now, yeah, I decided (indiscernible) for my team, and they want me to rest a little bit for the second part of the season, and I just want to have a fresh mind especially after this streak that we had in the end.  We'll just make a little bit fresh mind, fresh body and come back into the game.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
KRISTAPS PORZINGIS: It's always fun to play with your National Team because you know all the guys speak the same language.  It makes it easy.  And playing on national TV at the same time, I'm thinking about getting stronger, and when you're playing, it's hard (indiscernible).  I've got to make a decision of what I want to do.
Q. (Inaudible)?
KRISTAPS PORZINGIS: I think once the season's over, I'll try to focus on the season and put my mind to it, talk to my team, talk to my brothers and hear from them and then make a decision.
