 Q.  Can you give us a brief statement about playing in the game this evening?  
KRISTAPS PORZINGIS: It was a high-scoring game, as you all saw.   
Not great defense, but it's about having fun, I guess.  And I think we had fun out there.  In the second half we got more competitive, as both teams wanted to get the win, and we fell a little short.   
It never feels good to lose, so I'm not too happy about the loss.   
 Q.  Did you imagine in your wildest dreams that you'll be a part, an essential part of this league so quickly?  
KRISTAPS PORZINGIS: Well, that was my dream growing up, wanting to be a part of this league, that was my dream.   
Now that I'm here, some moments when I stop and think about it, it feels kind of surreal.  But now that I'm here, I've just got to be focused on what I'm doing, and I can't be thinking, oh, I already made it and that's it.   
 Q.  Can you also mention what has been the response in Latvia for your success?  
KRISTAPS PORZINGIS: It's hard to say.  I mean, from social media and all over the Internet I get a lot of support.  I know it's a big thing back home, but I haven't really been back home to feel it.  So this off-season we'll see.   
I think it's a big deal back home.  I know there's a lot of support.   
 Q.  The average age of everyone when Kobe Bryant made his debut in this game was under five years old.  I was wondering if you ever thought you'd actually be playing in the same league as Kobe and what your earliest memory of him was?  
KRISTAPS PORZINGIS: When I was five, that's what I was thinking about.  No (laughing).   
But, it's an honor to be now in this league in his last year.  He's such a legend.  He's one of the best to ever play the game, and to be able to play against him his last year, it's an unbelievable honor and a dream come true.
