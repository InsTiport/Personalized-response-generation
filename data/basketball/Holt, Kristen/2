 THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with CSU. At this time, coach, if you could give your general comments on today's game.   
 COACH HOLT: Well, I thought Air Force played a very good game, very scrappy. They took us out of our rhythm. We really couldn't get in one.   
 I thought we did pretty good coming out in the second half, got some buckets, went ahead a few times. But I give them a lot of credit. I thought they made plays when they needed to. Of course, No. 2, she took care of us today. We just didn't play real good defense, I didn't think. Normally we're a pretty hustle, scrappy, anticipating the next pass type of team. We were on our heels today. We looked a little bit shellshocked.   
 But, again, I give Air Force a lot of credit. They played a great game.   
 THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll open it up to questions for the student-athletes.   
  
  Q. What made Alicia so dominant today? What was she able to do tonight?   
 SAM MARTIN: She definitely penetrated really well. She would do a little pull-back, get us on our heels, take it to the hoop. We didn't have our layers of defense. We weren't in sync in our defense. She just got by everyone. As a team we just couldn't guard her today.   
  
  Q. Kim, why were you so out of sync defensively? Was there something particular that Air Force was doing or just an off day?   
 KIM MESTDAGH: I really think they were a lot more aggressive this game than the previous other games. They were making really tough shots. They were just playing really well.   
 We didn't really have an answer for what they did.   
  
  Q. Kim, you accomplished so many good things this season. Does this take away from that some? How do you balance out what happened today versus all the good you've done this season?   
 KIM MESTDAGH: They picked us 8 to finish. We finished 4th. I think that's already a big accomplishment.   
 Of course, getting a little further in the tournament would have been great. I mean, we had a pretty good season. I think we can be proud of that.   
 THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll dismiss the student-athletes and continue with questions for Coach Holt.   
  
  Q. Coach, how much better is Air Force right now than they were a year ago?  
 COACH HOLT: Oh, much improved. You know, they've got a lot of different weapons and ways to score. You know, I think other than our game at home, their game at their place was a tough, tough game. Their crowd was difficult to play against.   
 But, you know, I really think they're improved, very much so, since last year.   
  
  Q. Same thing I asked Kim. There were so many things, you finished way ahead of where you were supposed to, you lose one of your best players partway through the season. How much does this detract from that or does it?   
 COACH HOLT: Well, I mean, you come into a tournament and you're a 4th seed. To lose out like this is extremely disappointing. I think every team that comes to this tournament has aspirations of winning it. Certainly we did.   
 But, like I told the players, this group has been so fun to coach. We have overcome so much adversity. We had five players this year that were either redshirt, medical redshirts, one left the team in the middle of the year, and these kids, we basically played with one post player the whole conference.   
 We live by a motto of 'no excuses.' We played like that all year. I know we grew as a program. It's something certainly we have to build on for next year.   
 But I couldn't ask for a greater bunch of kids. I love coming to work every day.   
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Coach.   
 COACH HOLT: Thank you.
