New Mexico  Â– 62
  Colorado State - 48

 THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Colorado State student-athletes Bonnie Barbee and Kim Mestdagh and coach Kristen Holt. Coach, we can start with you with some general remarks about the game. 
 COACH HOLT: Well, first of all, I'm extremely proud of my team. We've come a long way this year. You know, I'm proud of my seniors, that they really bought into what we wanted to do. They were a huge part of leading this group. 
 These two here to my left have just been great all year. They, too, have bought in. We just had a great group of kids and we fight. 
 I am extremely proud. New Mexico is an extremely good team. They hurt us definitely on the boards. With our turnovers, that pretty much was it. They had a lot of possessions offensively. Our possessions were low. If we're going to win any games, we've got to have our possessions being up in the 60s, I feel. At halftime that was a concern. I was pretty happy with the fact we were only down three, considering we were getting beat pretty good in both areas. 
 Again, they're an extremely good team and I expect them to do well in the next round. 
 THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes. 

 Q. Bonnie, it seemed like you were able to stay in and make up for some of the turnover problems by hitting a lot of threes early. As the game went on, those threes just weren't falling. Were they the same kind of shots you were taking or was it a matter of maybe you started forcing them? 
 BONNIE BARBEE: Uhm, I would have to say as the game goes on, of course your legs are getting a little tired. And, of course, UNM was pressuring us out a little further out. We had to shoot them a little deeper. I don't believe it was just because we were out of rhythm or out of range for our shooters. I just feel as though it was later in the game for us.

 Q. Kim, at what point did you feel this game started getting away from you guys? With five minutes to go, it was still a three-point game. Was there a sense it got out of reach at some point or did that not happen till the buzzer? 
 KIM MESTDAGH: I think with our turnovers and we started fouling, we put them on the free-throw line too much, then the game started slipping away. 
 THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll dismiss the student-athletes. Thank you, ladies. We'll open it up to questions for Coach Holt. 

 Q. They said defensively, Don was saying you were causing a lot of troubles with them early the way you were mixing things up with the man and zone, kept them out of sync. What adjustments did they make down the stretch that maybe got their offense going midway through the second half? 
 COACH HOLT: Well, I think, you know, they did a lot of different things. And I thought what they were doing early on, in the second half they did a lot better. They executed it a lot better. 
 And, again, I think that we just never recovered from the deficit on the boards. It was just so hard for our kids. Each kid, I could hear 'em on the bench saying, We got to box out. Then that kid would go in and do the same thing. 
 You know, I just thought that they -- you know, I'd have to probably look at the film to answer specifically where they were really hurting us. I just felt they were hurting us in a lot of different areas. But we were hanging in there. Like you said, at the end, we just didn't have enough in the tank. We had some key turnovers that really were costly, I thought, at the end. Like Kim said, we just put 'em at the free-throw line. You just can't do that to a team like that. 

 Q. Is this the kind of game where it hurts maybe to not have a true go-to player, somebody you can count on to put up 15, 20 points a game? 
 COACH HOLT: Well, that's hurt us all year (laughter). But at the same time I think if you're scouting us, you don't know who's gonna score for us. I was looking at our starters that we scored three, three, four and four. I mean, that's tough. 
 Some of those players are players that can normally get us more than that. I mean, even if Britney Minor can get her average, which is about eight points a game, there's some difference there. 
 So, yeah, that was tough. But I thought their defense was really good. I'm not going to take it away from them at all. I don't think it was we were able to hit as much as I thought they were just pressuring us and causing us to kind of be out of rhythm at times. 
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach. 
 COACH HOLT: Thank you.
