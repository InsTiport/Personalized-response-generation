 Q.  Talk about being able to survive and advance; you did that today.  What are your thoughts?  
COACH MCKEOWN: You know, we've got a little bittersweet taste because I thought we were in complete control of the game.  Third quarter, you know, really into the fourth quarter, just couldn't make plays when we needed to.  They turned us over, got some easy buckets, and then they made touch-outs, too, and-ones.   
But I loved how we kept our poise to finish it.  At this time of the year that's all that matters.  We get to play tomorrow, and we'll address some of the things we struggled with and get ready to play Iowa.
