  Q.  The other guys who have been so important, it's not just about Dirk and it's about Shaq and Wade, a lot of other guys made big shots to get here.   
 JOSH HOWARD:  When it comes down to it, it's the role players that come off the bench and contributed.  It's going to be a big series, carry it over, and I know we'll be using them in this series.   
  Q.  For people that weren't here yesterday, how do you slow down Dwyane Wade?   
 JOSH HOWARD:  I played against him in college.  For the most part, his game is primarily driving to the basket, you want to take away his strengths.   
 We just got to try to play great ball.  We know he's going to make jumpshots regardless.  It's going to be a great series.   
  Q.  They like to stick you on a player x, whatever, how do you feel about that and what does that do for you?   
 JOSH HOWARD:  I've been playing guard all my life, all my career in the NBA.  It's nothing different, I played against him like I said in college.  I've seen him before.   
  Q.  Offensively, is this stage for to you let people know around the world that you have arrived?   
 JOSH HOWARD:  I've already done that.  No point in trying to prove that right now.  I've already proven myself.  I'm just trying to win a championship.
