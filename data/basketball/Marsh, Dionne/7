<p>	Q.  Mandi, you looked pretty cool on those free throws.  You are obviously used to situations like that.  Could you talk about that?</p>

<p>	Q.  Did you notice they had not fixed the net when you shot the first free throw, it was still all wadded up?</p>

<p>	Q.  Go back to the shot you took that you would like to take back, I am sure? </p>
<p>	Q.  Dionne, would you talk about all the practice that you do during practice for that 40-foot jump shot?</p>
<p>	Q.  Dionne, has it occurred to you that you are a freshman; you are not supposed to be doing all this stuff?</p>

<p>	Q.  I haven't seen your team play this year.  So I am kind of curious, is your constantly taking Dionne out of the game for long stretches a normal thing, or was there something physically wrong with her that you felt you needed to rest her longer?  Were you concerned that it might impact the team's rhythm having her on the bench for the stretches you had her today? </p>
<p>	Q.  Don, when Judy took that three, was that maybe a no-no, no good shot type of thing?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you play more man today than in the other two games?  I really can't remember.  I think you did.  If so, why?</p>
<p>	Q.  Don, three games, three three-point decisions, you said earlier in your opening comment that UNLV is a difficult match-up for your team.  Can you expand on that as to why they give you problems and why these games are so competitive?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chances are that every game you play the rest of the way will be like that.  You are not going to play any teams that you will beat twenty points or more.  Does it make you feel good?</p>
<p>	Q.  Don, this was a very emotional game, a very physical game.  How hard is it for your kids to recover in 26 hours and play whoever wins that second game?</p>
