 THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you would start with a brief statement, please.   
 COACH STRINGER: That was a gutsy win. I mean, two guards, Nikki and Di, who had four fouls, and yet we continued to press, and it takes a great deal out of you, and plus you run the risk of a foul.   
 I kept thinking that there was a song that was written when we went to the Final Four, and it talks about Rutgers from Bruce Springsteen's gritty New Jersey, you know, and I was really proud. We as a coaching staff couldn't be more proud. They were just gutty and gritty, and they played in the image of the Scarlet Knights. When it's championship time, we play, and we don't back down.   
 So I was really proud of all of them; Chelsea Lee, just an incredible desire to fight. At some point I was going to switch up and go into a break because the pressure that we were using was really taxing. And Chelsea said, no, let's stay with the 55 and everybody else concurred, so I was really proud.   
 I thought we settled down, handled their press a lot better in the second half, began to attack on the inside, and was a lot more deliberate with what we did, and so I'm really happy for these young ladies because it was important for them to know that they can win and they can have that fight inside of them. And in particular because all three of these young ladies will be people that will be coming back, it's an excellent building block for our future and the attitude that has to be played as a Scarlet Knight.   
  
  Q. Nikki, where does that rank in the biggest shots you've made in your life?   
 NIKKI SPEED: I'd say it's the biggest. I wasn't even really thinking about it. All I know is all of us kept saying we're not going home. We last year played double overtime, and I remember saying in the huddle, last year we played double overtime, we lost, and the only thing going through our minds was we want to win.   
  
  Q. Di, what was it like for you having your sidekick on the bench in the second half?   
 KHADIJAH RUSHDAN: It was hard, and we all know that Brittany is our go-to player. She makes big shots, but I've got to credit the people that were out there. You've got to work with what you've got, and you know, these two, everybody that was out there, I mean, we stuck in it, and we played with that mentality that Coach Stringer always sees in us.  
  
  Q. Chelsey, when B-Ray fouled out, did you see yourself stepping up into a bigger scoring role?   
 CHELSEY LEE: I just knew that everyone had to step up. We all had to contribute. Losing our best player, like everybody else just got to step up. We can't just die down just because Brittany is gone even though she's our go-to player, we couldn't just lay down and die. I knew we had to keep fighting.
