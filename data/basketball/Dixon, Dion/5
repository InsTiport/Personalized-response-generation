Notre Dame  Â– 89
  Cincinnati - 51

 COACH CRONIN: Well, obviously Notre Dame played tremendous tonight and we obviously were at our worst, they were at their best. We got taken to the wood shed and fortunately for us, it's not the NCAA Tournament, and we learn some lessons that we probably needed to learn before next week. 
 I was concerned with the way our game went last night, I thought it was -- it got probably took the edge off of us, and our team is a different team what we don't have our edge, not that we would have won tonight but I thought that last night winning the way we won was -- it was false hope and it softened us up a little bit and a bad time to get softened up, but you've got to give Notre Dame all the credit. 

 Q. Coach, do you go back and this or do you wipe the slate clean and try it put this behind you? 
 COACH CRONIN: We know what happened. They're tough to defend, and at some point the fact that we wouldn't make a shot started affecting our defense. Their great offense at times I thought demoralized us, but we tried man, zone, we tried pass. We tried everything. We couldn't get the stopped we needed and we couldn't get anything going on the offensive end. Even our free-throws were 8 for 17, so a frustrating night for our guys. 
 For us, I would rather go into the NCAA Tournament this way than winning the Big East tournament, as much as I would love to win the Big East it's better to get home and get rested. I say that because our team is better after a loss. We've struggled a little bit to handle success. That's what I alluded to at last night's game. When we lose our edge, our toughness, we're not the same team, not that we would have won tonight but I think our guys now are going to be back to thinking they got to prove themselves next week so we're better when we have that mind-set. 

 Q. How excited are you guys to be participating in the NCAA Tournament and how excited are you to be able to make improvements and make a deep run, possibly? 
 YANCY GATES: I'm excited about it. First time we've been back, we've been building our program to get back to the NCAA Tournament, over all, get back home and try to get better, learn from it and get ready to play in the tournament. 
 DION DIXON: I'm excited about it, get back, look at the game, get better from it and go get that experience in the NCAA Tournament. 

 Q. Yancy, what were they doing to you defensively today that you didn't have the freedom in there today that you did yesterday. What were they doing? 
 YANCY GATES: Just trying to collapse on me once I took a dribble. The trap didn't come early, tonight they waited until I got, you know, in the middle of my move to bring the other guy. It just makes it tougher when the other guy come in the middle of your move to pass out of it and get a shot off, they played good defense, collapsing in the paint. Really you've got to give them credit, they came ready to play tonight and did what they to do. 

 Q. Did you ever think anybody could carve up your defense the way they did tonight? 
 YANCY GATES: I didn't think we was capable of playing "D" as bad as we did tonight but they made a lot of shots, a lot of shots, especially early, coming out of the press they did a good job getting us to collapse and kicking it out, but they came out ready to play. 
 DION DIXON: They came out ready to play, hit some shots and that took our energy away on defense and that made us less aggressive than we would normally be. 

 Q. You talked about putting this behind you. Is it going to be hard to do that? 
 YANCY GATES: Not really. I think we done a good job this year of putting games like this behind us, but you don't want to put it all the way behind you because you want to remember this feeling the way we came out all lackadaisical and stuff, you get home and try to forget about it but with you really don't. 
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
