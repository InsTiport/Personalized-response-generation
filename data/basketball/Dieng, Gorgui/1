 Q. Thinking back to when you were a kid, picking up a basketball for the first time, do you remember that, when this sport kind of hit you and that was your thing?   
GORGUI DIENG:   I think I started playing at 16.   I played basketball late.   
   
 Q.   How did it happen?   How did you start?   
GORGUI DIENG:   My sister and my brother, they were playing basketball.   And I watched‑‑ basketball court in the soccer field was like (Inaudible) they said that's a good sport.   Because, you know, they don't want‑‑ I didn't know.   One day I guess I started paying attention more to the game and it started getting fun.   
   
 Q.   What time did you beat your brother and sister in a game of basketball?   
GORGUI DIENG:   Yes, I did.   
   
 Q.   At what time?   
GORGUI DIENG:   I think when I was 16.   I was taller than them and stronger.   I beat all of them with the basketball.   
   
 Q.   And growing up like that, starting late, did you ever think that the NBA was actually a possibility for you?   
GORGUI DIENG:   Yes.   When I went to basketball camp, I got a chance to meet Dwight Howard and Chris Bosh.   We were pretty much‑‑ they were a little bit taller than me.   And they were like, wow, I can be just that‑‑ excuse me, I believe in it and I made it.   
   
 Q.   How happy are you now waking up maybe in a different hotel out of home, wherever you are, realizing you're an NBA player, making money playing basketball?   
GORGUI DIENG:   I think it's just luck.   I'm maybe not the best player coming from Senegal, but I'm just lucky to be that guy.
