 Q.   Steph, number one, how are you feeling right now, and could you kind of go back through that fall, and what do you remember about it?   
STEPH CURRY:   I remember everything about it.   I feel pretty good, just not how I envisioned the game going.   I'm disappointed we lost, but all in all, thankful that I came out of that relatively okay and was able to go back in there and try and give my team something.   
I'm really proud of the way we fought all night.   Looking forward to Wednesday.   Just I felt like I was in the air for a long time and trying to brace yourself and‑‑ once I hit the ground, kind of hearing voices from trainers and people just telling me to take my time and not rush yourself getting up, and want to make sure that I passed all the tests that I needed to do so that I could get back on the floor, and that's what happened.  
   
 Q.   How scary were those moments when you're in the air and realize there's no good way to fall?   
STEPH CURRY:   It's a bad feeling because you try to make a play on a ball thinking he was going up for a lay‑up, and once you see that the situation changes, immediately you're in the air, got no control over yourself, and it could have been a lot worse, so just thankful that once I got back to the locker room, I kind of gathered myself, I kind of understood what was going on, and there was a chance I could get back out there once I went through all the tests the doctors wanted me to do, and that's what happened.  
   
 Q.   What exact kind of tests did the doctors have you do during that segment?  
STEPH CURRY:   It was I guess a concussion protocol that all the team doctors and the athletic trainers follow.   I've been through it before I think two times in my career, and I was able‑‑ I felt a lot better than I did those last couple times, so that was just good news on my end.   Rode the bike for a little bit, got my heart rate up and made sure it didn't get worse, and ran up and down the hallway and all the balance tests and stuff like that, and once they said I was all right, went out and played and tried to do what I could to help my team get back in the game.   Came up a little short, but we'll be all right next game.  
   
 Q.   What was the feeling right after you got back in the game with those first couple shots, just because of what you experienced?  
STEPH CURRY:   Yeah, because I was out for, what, probably an hour from the time I hit the ground to the time I got back in the game.   You don't go through your regular routine, and it's a different kind of situation.   You know, it took me a couple minutes just to get back in the rhythm of the game.   I was in the back watching the team make a comeback, in the locker room, so I kind of understood what we were doing differently to get back in the game, so I tried to follow that game plan, but just personally wanted to break a sweat and get back into the rhythm of the game.   
   
 Q.   How tough was it for you to watch while your teammates were out there while you were in the locker room?   
STEPH CURRY:   It was tough because I really‑‑ I didn't know if I was going to come back and play or not.   I focused on that, obviously, but out of the corner of my eye you're looking at the TV and seeing us make a push and make it a somewhat decent game going into halftime, and we still believed that we could win the game.   It was a tough‑‑ like I said, probably a tough hour just to sit and not really know if I was going to come back or not.   
   
 Q.   There are millions of Warriors fans whose hearts probably stopped when you went down.   Are you fine for the rest of this run, and when did you know that you would be fine?   
STEPH CURRY:   Oh, I'll be fine, yeah.   Like I said, they did all the tests.   Nothing got worse and I was able to go out and play 15 or so minutes in the second half.   That's promising for Wednesday.   You know, I didn't know when I was walking off the court because when you have falls like that, you don't really know what's going to happen in the next 15, 20 minutes how you're going to feel, and I was still kind of a little in shock, I guess, just from the feeling of falling because you don't go and have that happen every game.   You've kind of got to just gather yourself and kind of regroup a little bit, and that's the thing, I've got great doctors, great athletic trainers on our side that were keeping me focused on what was going to happen to get me back on the floor, and kind of take it from there.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel totally normal right now, back to your old self, or is there a headache, woozy, stuff like that?  
STEPH CURRY:   It was all minor stuff compared to how it looked.   But I'll get some good rest tonight and be ready to go.   Like I said, since it happened to now, nothing has gotten worse.   I expect that to continue in the hours leading to Wednesday.   
   
 Q.   Was your dad back there, back in the locker room with you?   Were you communicating with him?   Was he communicating with the doctors, and did you try to convince them to put you back in?   
STEPH CURRY:   Well, yeah, I saw my dad once I got back to the locker room.   Obviously I've got family here and they were all just worried about my well being.   I wasn't on my phone or nothing texting my family out in the crowd, so he had to kind of relay information somehow.   
That was comforting to kind of see a familiar face and let him know I was all right because I can imagine what it seemed like from the stands watching the play happen, seeing me walk off.   Yeah, that's just basically it.  
   
 Q.   Were you trying to convince them?   
STEPH CURRY:   I was taking my time to be honest with you because I wanted to make sure I was okay and not put myself in danger for the rest of the series if it wasn't right for me to go back out there.   I listened to all the advice and did all the tests I needed to do and stayed patient with it, and once I got the sign‑off from the athletic trainers and the team doctors‑‑ obviously I wanted to play, but I wanted to make sure the process was gone about the right way so there would be no second‑guessing once I got back on the floor.  
   
 Q.   Do you remember if you blacked out at all?  
STEPH CURRY:   No, no.  
   
 Q.   Was that the worst fall you've ever had in a basketball game?  
STEPH CURRY:   It was the scariest one.   I've had worse symptoms and stuff like that from getting hit in the head but that was the worst one because you're in the air for a long time and not knowing how you're going to hit the floor, know that it's going to happen, it's inevitable, but you're up there just trying to brace yourself.   In the seconds afterwards, it's just a scary feeling, hearing all those voices saying, take your time.   You just want to gather yourself, regroup, and trust the process.
