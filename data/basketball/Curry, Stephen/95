 Q.  Steph, (indiscernible)?  
STEPHEN CURRY: I mean, a good amount of time because it's important.  We're only playing this game in the grand scheme of things for a very short time.  So there are a lot of different opportunities that basketball brings, and if you handle them the right way, a lot of good can come out of it:  Obviously the impact to the community, inspiring the next generation with whatever story you want to tell, and basically trying different opportunities and experiences that I never really thought possible without this game.   
 Q.  Will you play in Rio?  
STEPHEN CURRY: I plan hopefully to be on that team.  Playing in the Olympics, I've never done it before.  I've played in two World Championship teams.   
 Q.  Nature of international competition?  
STEPHEN CURRY: It's different.  This is what we do day to day, this is our livelihood, and this is winning an NBA Championship, I think that's the ultimate accomplishment, but when you're talking opportunity, obviously, to represent your country, you have the opportunity to go fight for a Gold Medal in the Olympics, that's the icing on the cake for sure.  So hopefully we'll get that done.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible)?  
STEPHEN CURRY: Yeah, that's the plan is to be the Steph Curry of Under Armour.  They had a nice template of success during their career, but try to do it our way, which is very genuine and organic to what we're trying to do.  So, you know, it's been a great partnership so far, and we're just really honestly getting started with where we're at as a basketball business and a brand.  Very excited about what's to come.  It's nice to be as hands on as I can be with everything that we're pushing out when it comes to my line and just the overall business of basketball and for Under Armour, so it's very special.  Sky's the limit really, I think.   
 Q.  How nostalgic is it for you to come back and play in this town where you've had some success here?  
STEPHEN CURRY: I always look forward to my one trip to the Air Canada Centre to play the Raptors, and to have the All-Star Game here and be back, my pops is here, and we talked about our experience when I was living here on and off for three years.  So I love the city, love the people here.  It's good for the city to be able to host an All-Star Game and have all these guys come and play.  It's a special time.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible)  
STEPHEN CURRY: I didn't do the dishes, so I went to school and had to tell my team, hey, guys, I can't play tonight, opening night of the middle school game.  Four dirty dish plates in the sink, and I didn't get it done.  So learn priorities and understand basketball is a privilege and it can be taken away.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible) single-game record of 12 three-pointers?  
STEPHEN CURRY: I thought I had it two weeks ago, but it was two short or one short of the record.  But Kobe and Donyell Marshall I think are the two guys that have it.  A lot has to go right.  We have to get up a lot of threes but make a lot of them.  So I may be able to do it.  It will come within the context of the game.  That's the hardest thing to do.  Obviously, once you make five or six, they're probably not going to let you shoot many more, so you have to force them up.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible)?  
STEPHEN CURRY: Having two teammates here especially.  Because basketball is a team game, and to have two other guys represent the full squad and all that we've accomplished is huge.   
For Klay [Thompson] to be here his second time and Draymond [Green] his first, I think it's the first time in like 40 years, they said, that we've had three guys from the Warriors team here.  So we're going to enjoy the experience.   
Had the coaching staff last year and now three of us this year.  So Dub Nation is well represented.   
 Q.  Are you looking out for Drake?  
STEPHEN CURRY: Drake's going to be everywhere this week.  I'll maybe run into him, have some fun.  I know he's got to be proud to be from here and have the All-Star Game here.  I know how hands-on he is with the Raptors as a team and representing the city, so I'm sure I'll run into him at some point.
