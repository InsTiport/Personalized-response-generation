Q. Are you just concerned with, I guess, everyday life and all that comes with that, just going into different spaces and going in different environments?
STEPHEN CURRY: It does cross your mind just because you are -- like you said, you can't control everything. But again, it's about just being as educated as possible on what's going on. The latest research and the patterns of how the virus is working and again, doing your part to keep yourself and those around you as safe as possible. I'd like to just be at home all day for 24 hours and whatever and quarantine myself, maybe, but we all have to do things that we need to do, and there's people that are reliant on the world working as it should be, as best it can, and I think we're all trying to balance that. It's a tough thing for everybody. You know, people that are out there working jobs that they can't necessarily take time off, they have to make hard life decisions, like there's a lot of things that everybody is dealing with in this time. For us to play a game with no fans or have to travel and take certain precautions, we'll do what we need to do and continue to just be aware of what's going on.
Q. Going through several days of the flu can render anyone's body pretty weak. Where are you in your recovery? What are the things you've experienced as you get set to make another comeback to the game?
STEPHEN CURRY: It's just an energy thing in terms of being able to exert the energy necessary to play a basketball game and still not deplete your whole system. That was kind of the discussion before Tuesday's game or yesterday's game was, was I able to get up and down the floor and break a sweat and not feel any side effects or anything like that or feel just exhausted afterwards, and yesterday and today getting some good workouts in were necessary, and ready for tomorrow.
Timing was tough, obviously coming back from 58 games and getting excited about getting in a rhythm and then you only get to play one and then have to miss another one. Yeah, I'm excited to get back out there on the floor.
Q. What are you most curious about, about the environment tomorrow night?
STEPHEN CURRY: Probably just the lead-up to the first like three minutes of the game, because everything about our routines is reliant upon kind of that game-day energy, pulling up to the arena, seeing fans outside of Chase, walking around with the Warrior jerseys and even the energy in the building, you can feel it all the way through the locker room, through the tunnel and stuff like that. Once the game actually starts and you see another team out there, it'll be weird, but I think we'll kind of get into that flow fairly easily, but just that lead-up to it. There's going to be a lot of the guys out there just kind of observing how different the situation and the atmosphere is, trying to play an actual NBA game that counts with no fans in the seats.
Q. There was some talk that the players might want music because they're used to it.
STEPHEN CURRY: For sure, to try to make things as normal as possible. I remember the game in New York a couple years ago, they did kind of an old-school throwback game with no PA announcer but there were fans in the crowd. That was weird where you didn't have defense chants or instrumentals playing or whatever it was. I don't know how they're going to do it. At the end of the day, once we start playing, we probably won't think about too much of that.
Q. Is there anything that you can do to prepare for that sort of atmosphere or talk with your teammates, or is there anything else that you can compare it to?
STEPHEN CURRY: Nothing to compare it to, but the only thing is just try to have a conversation about how you raise your level of intensity from the jump because you won't have that extra like adrenaline rush of playing in front of 18,000 people like that. That's really the only thing. Again, I know once the game starts, it'll be fairly easy to get into that type of flow because the other team is going to be out here trying to beat us and vice versa. That'll take care of itself.
