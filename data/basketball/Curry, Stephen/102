Cavaliers   95
  Warriors - 93

Q.   Steph, did it just feel not great for you shooting‑wise all game long?   Is there an explanation for what happened to you with the field goals? 
STEPHEN CURRY:   No, it didn't feel right, but there is no time to really worry about that.   You've got to keep shooting and try to figure it out. 
I don't expect to shoot like this.   I've got to play better, find better shots and be more in a rhythm throughout the course of the game for us to really assert ourselves as a team.   Klay did a great job of keeping us in it all night when our offense was struggling and we still had a chance to win. 
So just got to play better, move past this game, and keep the confidence.

Q.   Steph, did you feel like towards the end of regulation that you got something clicking?   Also, did Dellavedova do anything that you didn't expect? 
STEPHEN CURRY:   No, he played hard and stuck to the game plan.   Early in the game I thought I was a little hesitant when I had an open shot, kind of pausing for a second and then trying to raise up and shoot it, and you just don't get a rhythm that way. 
I was able to get to the paint a little bit more in the second half.   I didn't finish many of them, but I was able to get in there and either make a play or try to‑‑ especially that last shot down the stretch in overtime‑‑ I mean of regulation. 
But I'll look at the film and try to figure out exactly what adjustments they made, specifically on ball screens, and I'll be ready for Game 3.

Q.   You said your shot didn't feel right.   What, in particular, didn't feel right?   What didn't seem to be working for you?   And is it just tonight or has it been a few games now that your shot has been off? 
STEPHEN CURRY:   No, just tonight.   Shots I normally make I knew as soon as they left my hand that they were off.   That doesn't usually happen.   I mean, mechanically I don't know if there is an explanation for it, just didn't have a rhythm and didn't find one the whole game. 
I'm not going to let one game kind of alter my confidence.   I know as a team we're not going to let one team alter our belief that we're going to win the series.   So nothing we can do about tonight.   We've got to move on and be ready to play a good team that's ready to go home.

Q.   What do you think that Dellavedova did tonight that really hurt your game?   Would this happen again? 
STEPHEN CURRY:   Nothing really just besides playing their game plan and playing defense like every pro is supposed to.   Not giving up on any possession. 
But I doubt this will happen again, with the adjustments I'll make once I'll look at the film.   And like I said, one game is not going to make me stop shooting or alter my confidence at all.

Q.   Steph, you win an overtime game.   You lose now an overtime game.   Do you look at it like you should be up 2‑0 or do you look at it like you almost could be down 0‑2? 
STEPHEN CURRY:   I think both teams are probably thinking we both should be up 2‑0.   Shumpert's shot goes in and then tonight happens and they're up 2.   If you look at little play after Draymond made the huge block, Andre gets the loose ball, I can't get my hands down quick enough to catch the pass, and we maybe get to the free‑throw line to finish off the game. 
Obviously we're going to look at it as a positive.   We haven't played well offensively in two games.   We've made some plays when it counted and when it mattered to keep ourselves in it or, like we did in Game 1, win the game.   But we haven't really clicked. 
You credit their defense.   They've done something that maybe has taken us out of our rhythm, and we have to figure out what that is specifically.   But I think we're still confident.   We still believe that we're going to win the series.

Q.   You were hedging and switching off on LeBron.   What did that do towards the end for the defense for you guys to be more aggressive especially with him out there on the three‑point line? 
STEPHEN CURRY:   That's their bread‑and‑butter play when they need to try to get a mismatch and need a shot.   They free LeBron up on the perimeter.   They set a 1‑3 pick‑and‑roll, and we knew that coming in.   We had a game plan to attack that play.   They hit two.   Dellavedova hit a three, and to start overtime Shumpert hit a three out of that play that we don't want to give up.
That's something we'll have to figure out before Game 3.   But for the most part, our defense shot 33 percent from the field.   Obviously we were under 100, but we kept them under 100, too, so we can take some positives out of that on our defense, but offensively we've just got to be better.

Q.   Steph, are the Cavaliers the best defensive team you've faced all season? 
STEPHEN CURRY:   I mean, they're up there.   That's why they're here.   They don't get to The Finals without some sort of defensive presence.   Having that mentality, that's what's going to help you win.   So they have talent on that end.   They hustle.   They work hard, and they have athleticism that helps them in the situation.   So they're a great defensive team. 
I think they relied on that, obviously, in the playoffs to get them to this level.   We're a great offensive team when we click, and we've got to get to that point.

Q.   Considering the stakes, Steph, is this about as frustrating a game as perhaps you've had in your career? 
STEPHEN CURRY:   Yeah, my first Finals appearance and my first Finals loss, so it's definitely tough.   Dealing with the emotions of it and the highs and lows of this game, you try to leave it on the floor because it's a long series and you know we can come back Game 3 and really take control of the series right back. 
But it's frustrating because we're at home.   We're supposed to win.   Once we got into overtime, we had all the confidence in the world that we were going to get it done, but fell a little bit short. 
Just got to handle it the right way and get ready for Tuesday.

Q.   With all the injuries the Cavaliers have, I saw you guys attacking Delly.   How are you going to utilize that as an advantage because the Cavaliers are really shorthanded? 
STEPHEN CURRY:   We have to use our depth and our versatility in whatever lineup we throw out there.   We've got to keep the pace up.   Every game your legs get a little heavier as you go through the series and the amount of effort that you have to put into it. 
You want to rely on the‑‑ we go ten, we could go 11 deep, and we want to use that to our advantage.   The only way we can do it, though, is if we push the pace, push the tempo, and get stops and turn it into offense.   We did it at times tonight, but not for 48 minutes and overtime.
