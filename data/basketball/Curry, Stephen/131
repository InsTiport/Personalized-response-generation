  Q. What's the craziest dunk this year by Blake Griffin?   
 STEPHEN CURRY: Probably the alley-oop in Toronto.   
  
  Q. If this was Hollywood, who would you want to play you in a movie?   
 STEPHEN CURRY: I don't know, if Jaime Fox got a little lighter he could play me.   
  
  Q. Could he do your game justice?  
 STEPHEN CURRY: No, he would have to get in the gym.   
  
  Q. Twin brothers are starting to play basketball in Moscow, what would you recommend them to play great?   
 STEPHEN CURRY: I mean, you just -- whatever your forte is and whatever they do well, I would say just continue to work on that. There are a lot of things that you can bring to the game over here and improve your own -- whatever they are going to shoot and they are going to continue to work on that, perfect their form. That's what I did, I took my form and just got as many repetitions as I could until my arms got tired and came back the next day and did the same thing. It's a never-ended process of getting better.
