 Q.   What's going to make you a better shooter?  
STEPHEN CURRY:   Fundamentals.   You've got to have good balance.   Obviously your starts.   A lot of people focus on your hands and jump starts, but it starts at your base, at your feet, being square to the basket and having good balance. You've got to have solid follow‑through, each shot is smooth.  
I think the third thing is trying to shoot the same way every single time.   And that comes with a lot of practice.   Everybody has different form.   You can look at every single NBA player, everybody shoots a different way.   But the best shooters shoot the exact same way every time they look at the basket.   You have to rely on your fundamentals in game situations, especially when you go through a shooting slump.   If you stick with the routine, it will turnaround.  
   
 Q.   How has your dad helped you?  
STEPHEN CURRY:   My dad ‑‑ a lot of his genes.   I think that definitely helped.   But in high school he didn't like ‑‑ he wasn't like a drill sergeant, like, hey, you've got to shoot this way, this way, this way.   He was more supportive.   He encouraged my work ethics.   It was nice to have one of the best shooters in the NBA history to help me.
