Q. The Spurs still list Kawhi today as questionable.  Do you still think he's going to be out there for Game 3 tomorrow?
STEPHEN CURRY: Yeah, until we hear otherwise, we prepare as if everybody will play.  I'm assuming they'll do the same with Zaza and we don't know what the lineup is for that night, but you've got to prepare as if everybody will be available.
Q. The Spurs usually defend the three-point line really well.  But last game you got off to a great start from beyond the arc.  What kind of adjustments did you make?
STEPHEN CURRY: I really didn't make many.  We just moved the ball a bit better than we did in the first game, especially early, and that set the tone for getting good looks from the three-point line.  Other than that, you've just got to make them when you have the opportunities to.  Like you said, they do focus on it, so it's not like every possession we're coming down getting an open three.  When you have those opportunities, you've got to go knock them down and keep the momentum going.
Q. Does this arena, because of the crowd and the atmosphere, and maybe the way these teams have played, do you enjoy shooting here more than other arenas around the league?
STEPHEN CURRY: I was asked that question yesterday.  It doesn't matter what gym I'm in, I love to shoot the ball.  I heard Klay say he'd shoot anywhere, he mentioned like the beach or somewhere crazy.  But honestly, shooters love to shoot.  It doesn't really matter where it is, home or road.  The only difference, really is it's either applause or dead silence after you make a shot.  But the art of shooting, the rhythm that you need to get and all that kind of stuff, it doesn't matter where you are.
