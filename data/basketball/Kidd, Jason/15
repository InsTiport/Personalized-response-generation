  Q.  Amare Stoudemire said he reached out to you about micro fracture surgery, what did you tell him?   
 JASON KIDD:  I talked to him over the summer, and the first thing I told him was not to participate in the qualifying for the Olympics, just because it was too soon.  You have to give the knee time to rest.   
 You know, it's like when you have a pothole, you have to fill it and you have to let the cement dry before you drive over it.  So I just told him to relax and be patient with rehab and do the little things.  He did all the hard work.   
  
  Q.  Are you surprised by how quickly he's gotten back to form?   
 JASON KIDD:  Yes, because big guys have had a lot of problems with that surgery because of their weight, but he's done a wonderful job by keeping his weight down.  It's also just his character.  He wants to get back to that level and he's back.   
  
  Q.  How do you handle all the trade rumors?   
 JASON KIDD:  Well, the way that we've performed up to this point is definitely maybe below average in the sense of our record as a team.  So anytime that you're not where you're supposed to be there's going to be rumors or things are going to start flying about guys being traded.  And that's just part of the business.
