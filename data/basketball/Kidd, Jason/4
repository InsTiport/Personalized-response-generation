   JASON KIDD: We're just focusing on Game 6 and executing our game plan. The championship and all those other things will fall into place. But we know we'll have our hands full, and we're not thinking ahead. We're just trying to focus on what we have to do to try to win tomorrow night. 

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 JASON KIDD: I think we've been getting those shots in the games and we couldn't knock them down. In Game 5, we got those same shots we had the kind of confidence that somebody was going to knock them down, and some of us did. If we can get those same shots in Game 6, hopefully we can knock them down. 

 Q. What will you focus on for Game 6? 
 JASON KIDD: I think execute our game plan and hope that we have more points after 48 minutes. That's simple. It's not anything tricky, except we have to play hard and we know we're going to have our hands full, one to win a championship, and two, to win on the road is even harder. We know they're going to come out with their best tomorrow night. And we have to be prepared for that. 

 Q. How have you avoided letting up?
 JASON KIDD: I think it's part of being a veteran ballclub. Understanding that we have to play the game. It's not about if we win we win a championship, it's about doing what we've done all season and having to play hard and find a way to win, and then everything else will fall into place.
