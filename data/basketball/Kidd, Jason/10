  Q. First of all, the adjustments you guys have to make?   
 JASON KIDD: We have to compete. We have 48 minutes. We have to be rebounding the ball, which would help. Offensive rebounds at key parts of the game.   
  
  Q. How expect Dirk's injury to affect his play?   
 JASON KIDD: The injury is -- I think you guys make a little bit more of it.   
 He's a competitor, and I don't think it will be a problem.   
  
  Q. Zone defense versus man to man, do you feel you have to change something? What do you feel will work best for you?   
 JASON KIDD: We have to take away the threes. Mike Miller hit the threes. And also rebound out of that. Man to man we have to make it a little bit tougher on them.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).   
 JASON KIDD: We ran a lot of those plays last night, which we haven't done all series. So we have to get out and play and get in more of a flow game (Indiscernible).  
  
  Q. What are the challenges to guarding LeBron?  
 JASON KIDD: He can score. He's an athlete, he's very explosive. He gets to the basket. Understands the game. You have to tip your hat when he makes shots. You have to make it as tough as possible every time he does shoot it.
