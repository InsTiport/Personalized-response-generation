		  LeBRON JAMES:   It's an unbelievable weekend for the fans to see all the players together in one venue.

Q.   How competitive do you get?
LeBRON JAMES:   The first half is the feelâ€‘out process.   We try to get a feel on what we're going to see.   The second half, everyone's competitive nature kicks in.   At that time both teams want to win. 

Q.   How important is it to not only have your teammates here, but also Erik Spoelstra?
LeBRON JAMES:   It's big.   Two of my teammates, and Coach Spoelstra has done a great job this year. 

Q.   How does the friendship affect the game itself, the friendship with Kevin Durant?
LeBRON JAMES:   It doesn't affect the game at all.   If you saw last night it wasn't friendly at all.   We respect each other. 

Q.   (Inaudible). 
LeBRON JAMES:   It's all good.   I had no idea, but it's all good. 

Q.   (Inaudible). 
LeBRON JAMES:   Just play my game.   My coaches put me in position, my teammates allow me to do what I do, and I just go out and play my game.   And I've been successful. 

Q.   (Inaudible). 
LeBRON JAMES:   He did.   Like I said, guys are playing up on me and I'm driving, I'm backing up and shooting.   If my teammates are open, I'll pass the ball.   I'm trying to be more aggressive.   I try and put pressure on the defense.   It helps our team when I'm aggressive. 

Q.   (Inaudible). 
LeBRON JAMES:   I don't really have a take on it.   He said he would take Kobe over me because he's won five.   That's his own opinion.
