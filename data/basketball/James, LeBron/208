 Q.  (Indiscernible). 
 LEBRON JAMES:  Because as a role model, they look up to me.  I know that.  I'm not going to shy away from the fact that I know kids look up to me.  And the game of basketball is so powerful, so I try to use that to my advantage and try to give back. 

 Q.  Jason Kidd is over there still? 
 LEBRON JAMES:  Yeah, I told him he should have spent 30 minutes in the Western Conference meetings, and 30 minutes in the Eastern Conference meeting.  He's with us right now at halftime, but he might go play for the West. 

 Q.  Are things good enough to go to the Finals without making any moves? 
 LEBRON JAMES:  It's going to be tough because of how the Eastern Conference has gotten better with the addition of how Boston recreated themselves.  Detroit is always going to be better.  Orlando's much better.  They've had some off-season acquisitions. 
 It's going to be tough for us.  It's going to be a challenge.  We have to mentally prepare ourselves to go out there and play the game of basketball the right way. 

 Q.  If you don't make any moves, can you guys get better? 
 LEBRON JAMES:  We'll see.  We're going to let the game do the talking.  It doesn't matter who you have on paper, you've got to go out there and win a seven-game series. 

 Q.  Are there any players that didn't make the All-Star team that you thought should have? 
 LEBRON JAMES:  I thought Hedo Turkoglu in the Eastern Conference played well, to make the All-Star team and he's not a part of it.  He played great basketball for the third best team in the East.  He played great basketball. 

 Q.  Is this easier than your first All-Star Game? 
 LEBRON JAMES:  Most definitely easier to take in.  It was erratic my first year.  I was excited being my first year.  I'm kind of used to it now, but at the same time I'm always excited to get around these great athletes. 

 Q.  It must be a surprise having a lot of big name moves.  What was the most surprising thing? 
 LEBRON JAMES:  This year has been most surprising in-season and off-season we've had in the NBA in a long time.  With the Lakers dealing Pau, and Miami, and Phoenix dealing Shaq and Shawn Marion, and the off-season acquisitions.  You look at Ray Allen, and Kevin Garnett going to Boston, and Rashard Lewis going to Orlando.  There's been so many new faces.  I mean, same faces, new teams.  At times it can be hard to keep up with. 
 So it's been good for the NBA.  And hopefully, you know, it's been good. 

 Q.  Does it put more pressure on everybody to have to try to keep up? 
 LEBRON JAMES:  You know, you always want to get better.  Especially with me.  I'm a competitor, I want to get better.  Hopefully we can continue to get better.  If not, we're going to stick to our guns that we have, and get ready for the second half of the season.
