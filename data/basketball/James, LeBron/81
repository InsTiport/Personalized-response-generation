LeBRON JAMES: Yeah, there's just so much respect.  I will always -- throughout my career, (indiscernible), myself and Pop will always have a connection.  I've faced them three times in The Finals.  I've admired what he's been able to do with that franchise for so long, the constant staple of their franchise being Tim Duncan and himself.  So it's always been a great treat to kind of watch him from afar.   
 Q.  Now that you're here (indiscernible)?  
LeBRON JAMES: Yeah, I mean, it's like a little bit, obviously.  I'm looking at some of other teams here and they have multiple All-Stars.  I looked at the top four teams in both conferences, myself, as far as the Cavs, Toronto, San Antonio and Golden State, and it's unfortunate that we only have one.  But we'll see what happens.   
Our guys just got to use it as motivation.  I'll try to use it as motivation as well.  Winning a championship is a huge piece of it, but it would have been great to see us get two.   
 Q.  You've played a ridiculous amount of basketball in the last few years, and playing in the Olympics, like how --  
LeBRON JAMES: It's just dedication, dedication and hard work.  I give everything to the game.  I dedicate myself to the game every day.  There's nothing that will overpower what the game has done for me, so I give my all to it.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible) Cam Newton after the Super Bowl?  
LeBRON JAMES: I haven't really -- I don't watch sports, talk radio or television, so I really don't see it, and I didn't see it.  It's locker room talk, but I didn't see what happened.   
Right after the game was over, I started watching cartoons with my kids.  As late as it was, we started watching cartoons and I didn't even see the postgame interview.   
All I can say from my experience is it's tough to come after a loss and then have to answer questions about it.  But you go up there, you handle it.  You handle it the best way you can.  You give credit to the opponent.  For me, who has been on both sides of winning and losing, when I lost I said, well, we've got some things to clean up, and hopefully we put ourselves in position to compete next year and go from there.  But I can't comment on Cam's experience because I didn't see it, and I'm not him.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible) kind of looking back?  Maybe relax a little bit more?  
LeBRON JAMES: Well, I mean, at the end of the day, it's just tough to lose in anything that you do.  You've got to be able to just go up there and accept it and take it.  Sometimes you make mistakes.  We all make mistakes.  That's how you learn, that's all.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible) 2016 Olympics?  
LeBRON JAMES: Well, for me, I haven't quite decided if I'm on the fence of going or not.  But I've always loved representing my country.  I've been playing in the Olympic games since 2004.  So, no, I haven't made a decision yet.   
 Q.  Coach Lue being here?  
LeBRON JAMES: I think it's great.  He would have been here anyways.  I heard some rookies say why would Coach Lue accept the fact to come to the All-Star Game?  Well, he would have been here anyways.  Even if Coach Blatt would have been our coach, Coach Lue would still be here.  So I think it's pretty cool that our coaching staff is here representing our organization.  I know he's going to have a great time with it.   
 Q.  Kobe was sitting here and he gave you shoes.  Were they shoes for your kids?  What is the special gift for you or your kids?  
LeBRON JAMES: No, they were to me.  They were dedicated to me, and they're going to go in my trophy case.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible)?  
LeBRON JAMES: No, I don't have too many plans this weekend.  I'm going to enjoy the city.  It's an unbelievable city.  I love being here.  I've always enjoyed being here.  So I'm going to enjoy it, and then get ready for the second half of the season.
