Q.   LeBron, can you talk about playing in The Garden and the record.   I believe you tied with Kobe Bryant all‑time scoring list. 
LeBRON JAMES:   Don't get no better, man, you play in The Garden in front of these fans.   They know the game of basketball and to be able to go out and represent my team and represent this league at the highest level.   It means everything. 
Any time you're in the conversation with a great is very humbling.   It's an honor.   And I just got to keep getting better and better hopefully, and keep understanding how I got here and why I'm here. 

Q.   LeBron, Russell Westbrook apparently the MVP had 41 points.   Wilt Chamberlain's record is 42 and Michael had 40.   What do you think about his performance today?   And you were chatting it up with the guys before the game.   And what does it mean to you to be around Melo and CP3? 
LeBRON JAMES:   I think Westbrook came for it from the start.   He's unbelievable.   He's an unbelievable talent in our league.   His motor, his athleticism, his demeanor about how he approaches the game, it's all great.   And it's great for our league.   And he showed that tonight.   Showcased it on a big stage.   And it's great. 
To answer your second question, anytime I get an opportunity to be with my brothers, D‑Wade and Melo and CP is always great.   We don't take these moments for granted. 

Q.   LeBron, how does that feel when you play in The Garden, and in front of the great friends in the All‑Star Game? 
LeBRON JAMES:   It feels great.   I love it. 

Q.   LeBron, you talked a lot about kind of where you are in your career right now.   As you go against some of these younger guys that are in the game right now, how much do you enjoy that and still showing what you can do at this level? 
LeBRON JAMES:   You definitely enjoy it.   I was one of the young guys at a time.   I was seeing the older guys.   And you try to make your mark.   And now being in the reverse role, you just know that our league is in good hands.   I'm going to try to continue to do what I need to do to represent this league with the utmost respect both on the floor and off the floor.   But our league is definitely in good hands with the young group of talent that we have that's playing great basketball right now. 

Q.   LeBron, now with the extended All‑Star Break, how eager are you to get rested and rejuvenated for the second half? 
LeBRON JAMES:   I'm excited.   I'm excited what our team can accomplish.   We entered the break playing some really, really good basketball; winning 14 of our last 16.   I'm going to take these next couple of days off and get back in the gym on Wednesday a little bit, go hard on Thursday and get ready to play Washington on Friday. 

Q.   If you can give Russell Westbrook one piece of advice that would make him a better basketball player, what would that be? 
LeBRON JAMES:   Be Russell Westbrook.   Stop caring about what everybody else thinks.   So he doesn't have to change. 

Q.   What do you mean by that, "stop caring about what everybody else thinks"? 
LeBRON JAMES:   Just be yourself.   Just be yourself.   That's all.   That's all that matters.   Russell Westbrook is one of the best gifted talents this game has ever seen.   And he goes out every night and proves that and shows it.   I don't need to tell him anything.   He's doing great. 

Q.   LeBron, the way you felt Thursday night coming into the weekend, you were kind of unsure how you were going to approach this one.   When did you decide and know that you were going to attack the way you did? 
LeBRON JAMES:   Just the feel.   I understand that my fans and our fans for this great game voted me in for a reason.   They wanted to see me play.   They wanted to see me do what I've been doing this year.   And that's why they voted me in.   It's my obligation and my responsibility to go out there.   If I'm feeling 80% or 85% or 90, to go out there and give my fans something.   Give my fans what they wanted to see.   And hopefully I did that.   

Q.   LeBron, you've expressed your appreciation and affection for The Garden quite a lot in recent days and recent years, yet it appears you never came close to signing here.   Why is that? 
LeBRON JAMES:   I don't know.   Just didn't work out that way.   I spent my first seven years in Cleveland.   When I became a free agent in 2010, I felt what was best for me was to go to Miami.   And when I became a free agent once again this past summer, I thought what was best was going back home.   My family was feeling very comfortable.   And that's how it go.
