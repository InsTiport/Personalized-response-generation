  Q. It seems like -- I know that this is the toughest series that you guys have had throughout the playoffs. Are you starting to feel a little fatigued within the fourth quarters because of the physical nature of this series?   
 LeBRON JAMES: No. You just try to do anything and everything possible to try to help your team win.  
 At this point everybody is fatigued. There is no -- there is no room for excuses at this point in the season. I mean, everybody is fatigued at this point in the season. There is no way you can hide away from it because of the intensity of the playoffs, the magnitude of the games, the possessions of the games, and the two teams trying to compete to move on to the next level.  
 Fatigue is within everybody who approaches the game.  
  
  Q. Mo said earlier he thinks you guys are giving the Magic too much respect. Do you agree with that? If so, why? And how is that manifesting itself on the court?   
 LeBRON JAMES: I think -- we just got to man up a little bit and take responsibility of who you are guarding. We have done it all year, and guarding the guys in front of us and then rely on help second.   
 That's a very, very good team. A lot of credit to the Orlando Magic because it is a very good team. Take nothing away from them.  
  
  Q. Do you guys feel like -- you personally feel like you have gone back in time two years with the struggles you have had from getting your guys to help you out?   
 LeBRON JAMES: Well, we've had a few games this season where if no one is making shots then we don't look that good of a team. We've had -- we are a very good shooting team, but we've not found a way to find our stroke.   
 I hope -- and I think we will. Guys are going to be confident about every shot that they take. And if they don't, they think about making the next one.  
  
  Q. Mo talked at length about the matchup problems Orlando presents to you guys. You said something about that after the big loss here in March. Are you guys struggling to find an answer to the matchup problems that Hedo and Rashard present to you?  
 LeBRON JAMES: At this point, we are. They create a lot of matchup problems. The way Rashard spaces the floor, our bigs are not used to it. I think our bigs will do a good job of continuing to watch film and find a way to stay out on the perimeter with Rashard.   
 They do -- they got some very big players that can shoot the ball. Also, they can drive, too, if you close out on them a lot. They have done a good job of exploiting that. We run out their shooters, they go around us. If we don't, they stop and shoot the 3. They have done a good job, and their coach has prepared them the right way.  
  
  Q. Can you tell me how Pietrus is guarding you? And is he making it difficult for you when he is in the game?   
 LeBRON JAMES: He is a very active player. But, I mean, coming into this game I was shooting 60 percent from the field. So, you know, I missed a few shots tonight I'm capable of making. He is a very active defender, but I don't believe anybody is an individual that can guard me.  
  
  Q. You shot 24 free throws. The Magic shot 51. Talk about that type of game where there are that many dead balls, stops, that many free throws.   
 LeBRON JAMES: Every time we got it close, there is a whistle blown. I think the refs did a great job tonight. There was a few of them we thought was a little ticky-tack, but, hey, it happens throughout the course of a game.  
 I mean, you look at it and they shoot 51 free throws, and Hedo went 1-11 from the field and but he goes to the line 12 times and makes 11 of them. That's very difficult to guard.  
 When a good shooting team like they are go to the free throw, Dwight goes to the free throw a lot, we can live with that. But we can't allow Hedo to go to the line 12 times and Pietrus come off the bench and go to the line seven times. It is not helping our cause.   
  
  Q. You talked about matchup problems, LeBron. Does that apply when you are on offense, too? I mean, you shot 38 percent and really didn't have --  
 LeBRON JAMES: We are missing some very easy shots, shots that we've always made and continue to make throughout the playoffs and throughout the regular season. I don't think it is the matchup problems on the offensive end.   
  
  Q. They've had success -- more success against you this year than anybody the last couple years really. How confident are you that you can turn it around in this series?   
 LeBRON JAMES: We're very confident. I know I am as an individual. I make sure our team is. We will get ready for Game 4 and play the same intensity basketball that we played tonight. Hopefully a few shots can go in and a few of theirs can go out.   
 So it is a very good team. Like I said, give them a lot of credit.   
  
  Q. Did that elbow Mo took bother you at all in terms of being a cheap shot?   
 LeBRON JAMES: I think it was. It was a little extra. The foul was called and he continued to swing his elbows. I mean -- I mean, you see Mo's face. It wasn't a pretty sight. It is not called for in this game.   
 Is that it? Thanks.
