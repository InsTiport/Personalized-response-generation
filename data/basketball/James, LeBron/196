 Q. LeBron, in years past, you used to humbly say that Kobe Bryant was the best player in the league when you were asked; after your own MVP season and looking like another upcoming MVP season, are you going to finally say that you, LeBron James are the best player NBA? 
 LeBRON JAMES: First, I want to say thanks to the City of Dallas for an unbelievable All-Star Game. The atmosphere was unbelievable, a hundred-plus thousand people were in the thousands and millions watched it on TV. So it was an unbelievable time for myself, you know, and for the rest of the guys, even the guys that was injured, including Kobe. 

 Q. Do you think that you are the best player in the league at this time? 
 LeBRON JAMES: Well, like I said, I mean, I go out and play my game every night for the team to win. You know, whatever it takes for our team to win, I go out and do it. 

 Q. Does it start to show, the experience that you have, playing with Wade and Chris Bosh, from earlier All-Stars and national team play? 
 LeBRON JAMES: And Dwight. We have a lot of experience together. We played a lot of games, especially international. So we are able to have some chemistry more than others when we play in these All-Star Games, being that we all play in the Eastern Conference. 

 Q. I noticed there in the first half, you had that goaltending with Melo, is it fun going against Melo?
 LeBRON JAMES: It's fun going against anyone and he's already the cream of the crop when you talk about the best players in the NBA. He is a competitor, I just try to go out and have fun, and at the same time, especially in this atmosphere, give the fans what they want to see more than just putting the ball in the basket. 

 Q. Dwyane just set you up a little bit, saying that you can dream of you guys playing together; how do you feel about that? 
 LeBRON JAMES: He's a great player and tonight he showcased why he's one of the best players on the planet. You want to play with guys that are great and want to win and want to compete at a high level every night. We'll see. 

 Q. There's all of these reports about trades involving Cleveland and Stoudemire, are you aware of them and are you anxious for Thursday to come so you don't have to hear about this stuff any more?
 LeBRON JAMES: I'm aware of the talk just like everybody else. I've been a part of guys getting traded to our team and getting traded away from our team. I never get caught up into it until I know or hear from our coaching staff or GMs that the deal has actually happened. I hear as much as you guys hear. 

 Q. That said, would you like to play with Amare and did you talk about it this week? 
 LeBRON JAMES: Didn't talk about it at all this week with him. I think Amare has been hearing the trade rumors all season. That's the last thing I wanted to bring up with him about being traded or having -- being a teammate as he is. He's one of the premiere athletes that we have in our game, but you know, we'll see if it happens. But it's all speculation. There's a lot of speculation that goes on. The only deal that has gotten done is between Dallas and Washington that we know for sure. 
 Other than that, everything else is just talk. 

 Q. I just want to go back quickly to your experience, I know you've been here before, when the Cowboys played the Giants; but can you talk about your feelings tonight? I know it's a little different tonight playing in the game but what was the energy level like tonight? 
 LeBRON JAMES: It was unbelievable. To be in front of 108,000, that was actually what it was, that was not a false number. You could look up in the stands, and there was not a seat open; to be part of history is something that you always wish and dream for. I've been part of some historical events, being a part of the 2008 Olympics when we played China it was the largest international game that the Olympics had ever seen, as far as viewers. 
 And you know, being part of another historical event tonight, you know, it's humbling and it's great to be a part of it. 

 Q. And with that being said, I know Dirk said earlier that he had to get about 60 tickets for the game; what did you have to deal with as far as tonight?
 LeBRON JAMES: Oh, I don't deal with that. That's why I've got an assistant that takes care of all of that. I don't have to deal with that. (Laughter).

 Q. You talked about playing in front of this amount of people; did you feel any added pressure at all to perform to a certain level or put on a show for those fans?
 LeBRON JAMES: No. Putting on a show for the fans is something I do, something I live for and something, that's just my game. My game is geared to doing things that a lot of people haven't seen before, every night, and bring excitement to the game. 
 But as far as pressure, I've never been a big believer in pressure at all.

 Q. Did you ever imagine growing up that you would play in front of a 100,000 people in your career? 
 LeBRON JAMES: I mean, growing up, you don't know what a 100,000 is, growing up. You grow up, you say you're playing in front of -- a building at capacity, probably six or seven hundred people if you go to high school basketball games. Growing up, you can't even count to a 100,000. 

 Q. Talk about the type of weekend that you had, especially with the party with Jay-Z, the record breaking crowd and the entire experience. 
 LeBRON JAMES: The experience is great, I had an opportunity to not only play basketball, but also give back in the communities. I had a few community events that I had. One of them was at Oak Cliff Boys & Girls Club, where I donated a playground and refurbished a game room in that Boys & Girls Club and that was great. 
 Me and Jay also had an opportunity to give back to another Boys & Girls Club and we gave away probably like $30,000 worth of gifts ranging from CDs and scholarships for kids. Not only what we do in basketball, but to be in the community and see kids and see what their faces are like when you step into their presence is another fulfillment for myself.
