Miami Heat 115, Los Angeles Lakers 104
Q. Was there anything that you noticed in that first quarter about just the general way the team was playing and the turnovers that surprised you, and how did that play out for the rest of the game?
LeBRON JAMES:   We know that we can't turn the ball over versus this team.  They are very active defensively.  It starts with myself, being the starting point guard of the team, having five first-half turnovers, eight total for the game. Can't do that, obviously, because it gives them more possessions and doesn't allow us to set our defense.  They are really, really good offensively, so you just can't turn the ball over against that team. I take full responsibility for that.
Q. You've had a 40-point triple-double in the Finals before.  Just wondered what you thought of Jimmy's effort tonight and how you need to defend him better or differently in Game 4.
LeBRON JAMES:   I thought Jimmy was phenomenal.  He did everything that they needed him to do tonight and he came through big time in a big-time game.  We'll watch film and see ways we can be better going into Game 4.  But I thought he was great.
Q. Anthony got into foul trouble early and had trouble getting going.  What did you see happening with him?
LeBRON JAMES:   I mean, you just said it, he got into some foul trouble.  You know, they even -- one of the shots he made when he had four fouls, they still tried to slide underneath him and get him a fifth in the third.  I think the foul trouble made him a little passive, because he wanted to be out on the floor but he couldn't be his aggressive self offensively and defensively.  I think the fouls slowed him down a lot tonight.
Q. Despite seemingly Miami controlling the action, holding the lead for most of the start of the game, you guys took a lead around nine minutes to go in the fourth quarter.  From there on, what do you think allowed them to separate from you guys?
LeBRON JAMES:   They continued to make shots, and we had some turnovers.  We didn't make shots.  They came out and executed after we took the lead.  Jimmy, like I said, he had his hand on all those plays pretty much.
Obviously, we have to do a better job of that coming down the stretch.  But I like our fight tonight, even as poorly as I believe we played.
Q. You guys obviously had a chance to take a 3-0 lead.  Are you concerned about giving Miami a breath of fresh air?  And with the possibility of Bam returning in the next game, do you feel like an opportunity missed that way?
LeBRON JAMES:   When you have an opportunity and you don't make the most of it, then you come back the next time.  I mean, it's not like the series was over if we won tonight.  We know for sure that Miami is never going to quit, no matter if we won tonight and they go into a Game 4, 3-0.  I know how resilient that bunch is and how resilient that coaching staff is and their franchise.  I don't ever feel like we let our guard down.  Also, I don't feel like we're concerned.  We're not concerned.  We know we can play a lot better.  We have another opportunity to take a commanding lead on Tuesday.  You relish that opportunity.
Q. When you guys have lost games this postseason, you've responded very well.  What is it about this group that's handled quick adjustments that has bounced back from losses so well in these playoffs?
LeBRON JAMES:   We learn from our mistakes pretty quick.  You know, obviously right now with the games being every other day pretty much, it's the film room.  It's the film room and it's how well we can make adjustments from the film and take it to the floor, and we have done a great job throughout this postseason.  So we are going to definitely have to do that because we're playing against a very, very, very, very good team.  We have to learn from our mistakes and be better on Tuesday.
Q. It's usually pretty fun when you and Jimmy play against each other over the years.  Would you say that you enjoy playing against him?  You respect playing against him?  Where is your level and emotions toward him as you go against him over and over, different teams, different cities?
LeBRON JAMES:   Love it.  Love it.  One of the best competitors we have in our game.  We love that opportunity.  For me personally, I don't know how many more opportunities I'm going to have, so to be able to go against a fierce competitor like that is something I'll look back on when I'm done playing.  I'll miss those moments.
Q. When you walked off the court with about ten seconds left, was that frustration or did you think the game was over?
LeBRON JAMES:   Both.
Q. Would you say tonight's loss was more about effort or execution or a combination of the two?
LeBRON JAMES:   I just think we can be better, obviously.  I don't think we started the game defensively in tune, and then offensively taking care of the ball.  Like I said, we had some careless turnovers.  It starts with me, like I said, and I take full responsibility for that.  I'll be a lot better on Tuesday with that, understanding that they are very good with their hands.  They are very good with the stripping.  You can't allow this team to have extra possessions.  You can't turn the ball over at that high a rate, especially at this point in the season, as well.
I'll be a lot better with the security of the ball and the turnovers and things of that nature.  We as a team will be a lot better defensively with our game plan.
