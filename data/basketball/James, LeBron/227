  Q.  You guys all the last few days have been talking about what a great experience this has been.  After the game, do you feel the same way, that this was a great time for you guys?   
 LEBRON JAMES:  Definitely.  You always have fun on All-Star Weekend.  It's a time you get an opportunity to come together for the fans and their dream is to try to get every one of their favorite players.   
 And here in Las Vegas they accomplished that.  It's been everything and more.   
  
  Q.  As far as the game goes, was it just a matter of you guys getting too far behind?   
 LEBRON JAMES:  Definitely.  This time they didn't miss shots when we got behind.  Last year we were able to get behind and they missed shots and we were able to get back into it.  They definitely play well.   
 They have the All-Star title back.   
  
  Q.  It looked like at the end you and Kobe started doing a little one-on-one to get the fans -- the fans had kind of fallen asleep.  It kind of helped the fans get back to the game.   
 LEBRON JAMES:  Just competing, that's all.  And Kobe Bryant is a guy I definitely love competing against.  And he probably feels the same way about me.  So basically just trying to compete to the last second.  You don't want to go out there and start messing around, that's how injuries may occur.  We definitely wanted to get something to leave home.
