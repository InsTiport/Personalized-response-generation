 Q.  When you got drafted you said you were going to light up Cleveland like Vegas.  How does it feel to actually be in Vegas for the All-Star Game? 
 LEBRON JAMES:  It feels good.  Any time you get the opportunity to come to Vegas -- and the fans voted me in -- and you get the opportunity to go out there and play in front of the fans that love your game, it's a good time.  It's a good thing for the NBA. 

 Q.  With you being the MVP of last year's game, I really haven't seen your picture around in the city much, how do you feel about that (laughter)? 
 LEBRON JAMES:  I really don't understand that.  I don't have an answer for that. 
 Maybe we can go to Kinko's, get some pictures and post them up on the walls. 

 Q.  Is it more special for the players because it's here? 
 LEBRON JAMES:  I'm not sure.  I think it's always special, because it's All-Star Weekend.  I think with Vegas, though, being the brightest city in America, and having the brightest stars coming to this venue, I think that it has a little bit more funk to it. 

 Q.  With the players from your draft class doing so well, have you guys talked about trying to be the best draft class ever? 
 LEBRON JAMES:  Definitely, definitely, of course.  We want to be the best class to ever come into the NBA.  It's good for our draft class. 
 We just keep trying to do bigger and better things. 

 Q.  Yourself, Carmelo and Dwyane have sort of been the cover athletes for that class.  Do you think Chris Bosh belongs there, too? 
 LEBRON JAMES:  He's playing very good basketball.  I think so.  He's leading his team to a lot of victories and playing very inspired basketball in Toronto.  The fans love him, and they should. 
 The guy is a good player.
