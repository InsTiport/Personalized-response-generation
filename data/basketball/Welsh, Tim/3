<p>	Q.  Back to the first five minutes, not only offense couldn't get going with the turnovers, but did you start off with a zone that tried to trap?  They had a lot of open looks. </p>
<p>	Q.  Seemed like any time you guys got a run going second half or started to try to get a run going, obviously things boiled over with you and the officials, it seems like whistles slowed down your momentum?</p>
<p>	Q.  You played West Virginia three times and Boston College twice.  Can you speculate on the match-up. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Ryan's performance tonight. </p>
<p>	Q.  Is it more deflating that it's over or you played so poorly?</p>
