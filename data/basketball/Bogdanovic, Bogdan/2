World Team - 155, U.S. Team - 124
Q. You had said you have been in All-Star Games before over in Europe, you had an idea of the way the game would be played.  Did that help you come out and relaxed and play the way you played?
BOGDAN BOGDANOVIC: As I said before this game, someone asking what's your routine before the game, before the All-Star Game, I answered the same.  I approach every single game the same way.  Try to compete to be the best version of myself that day.  It just happened tonight.  You never know when it's going to happen.
Q. At what point did you kind of realize that you were hot with that real deep, almost half-court shot?
BOGDAN BOGDANOVIC: I don't know.  I just kept shooting, and I felt good.
Q. What was it like scoring against De'Aaron Fox, your teammate that you play against in practice every single day?
BOGDAN BOGDANOVIC: I told him I would score on him, so I should bet as well, but we didn't bet.  So I didn't get some extra money.  But it was fun to play against him.  We're looking forward to -- as you can see, we have great chemistry on the court and off the court, so we are looking forward to transferring that on the court with the Sacramento Kings.
