  BOGDAN BOGDANOVIC:   Hello to everybody.   I'm pretty excited, and I'm glad to be a part of this team.   It's a great honor to be an NBA player, and dreams come true, you know, and everything.   
All my work these past seasons has come true now.   So I'm excited.  
   
 Q.   Are you going to play with the Suns next season, or are you still going to be in Europe?   
BOGDAN BOGDANOVIC:   I don't know yet, but my ambition is to play, of course.  
   
 Q.   Is your game perimeter based?   Are you more of a sharpshooter shooting from the outside, or do you like to drive to the basket or mix it up?   How's your offensive game?   
BOGDAN BOGDANOVIC:   I think for first season I need to improve a lot of stuff.   So I can use just one thing.   I just need to be a basketball professional player.   So I just need to improve in that first.   So that's it.   
   
 Q.   First of all, how much do you know about the Phoenix Suns?   Do you know any of the players in Phoenix?   What do you feel like you're going to bring to the team?   
BOGDAN BOGDANOVIC:   Yeah, of course, I follow them.   Some of my friends, Goran Dragic is there.   So he will help me a lot.   So that's it.   
   
 Q.   What is your game?   What do you think you'll bring to the team?   
BOGDAN BOGDANOVIC:   I don't know yet.   As I say, I must improve a lot of stuff.   Right now, just I believe they will put me on the court, I will show my best.   That's it.   
   
 Q.   Dario Saric, you guys know each other pretty well?   
BOGDAN BOGDANOVIC:   Yeah, I know him well.   We play‑‑ he's another friend.   We play a lot of games for national teams, and we play in the same league, Adriatic League in Serbia and Croatia, the Balkan League.   
   
 Q.   You mentioned Goran Dragic, have you spoken to him yet?   If yes, what have you spoken about?   
BOGDAN BOGDANOVIC:   I didn't speak with him about NBA, but I spoke with him when he was a guest in Belgrade, I think we play against Slovenia, when he was playing for Slovenia.   So just normal speak.   
   
 Q.   Are you prepared to play in the hot American desert?   It's a little different than the Adriatic area?   
BOGDAN BOGDANOVIC:   It's no different.   When you're drafted, there's no difference.   You give your best, of course.
