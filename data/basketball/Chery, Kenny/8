COACH DREW:   I think everyone that watched this game it was a great game to watch.   Typical Maui type game.   I thought the atmosphere was tremendous and you had two teams that really battled all the way to the end.   Really proud of how our team hung in there, and I think we led 1‑0, and finished leading by 1, and everything else was chasing Dayton.  
Really credit them for how hard they competed and how well they executed and played.   They've got a really good team.   Just proud of how we competed and stayed in it.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach and Kenny.  
   
 Q.   Doesn't get any easier tomorrow facing Syracuse, but this one had to show you a little bit about this team's character.   
COACH DREW:   No question.   It's really hard to be down the entire game.   I mean, credit Dayton.   They made plays, made shots, and some of it was tough because scouting report, we wanted certain guys we played them for drives and they knocked down shots.   So credit them for making them.   But some of those nights it's real easy for you to panic, start pressing, taking bad shots on the offensive end and letting an 8‑point deficit become a 15.   
Now that's really hard to come back from.   We didn't do that.   I thought we had great leadership, great poise.   I thought Kenny second half only one turnover.   Really handled the pressure well.   Very pleased how he was able to mature and stay in the fight.   Again, just really pleased with our guys.  
   
 Q.   Kenny, can you just talk about the second half?   You guys made that run at the end of the first half to close 17‑5, I think.   Then they came out and kind of opened it up again to about 10.   Can you just talk about the way the team hung in there and pulled it out at the end?   
KENNY CHERY:   Our game plan was as a team to stay together.   We just wanted to be tough.   Our mental toughness was in question, so as a team, we just wanted to stay together and be tough and try to pull one out and that's what we did at the end of the game today.  
   
 Q.   Dayton was 11 for 20 from three?  
COACH DREW:   Yeah, I saw all of them.  
   
 Q.   What can you do when a team is just draining those?   
COACH DREW:   First you have to give them credit for making shots.   We tried to move up on them.   Changed how we guarded some actions and guarded some things.   But really credit them.   Devin Oliver was 1 for 9 coming into the game for 3.   He was 4 for 4 and looked like none of them hit the rim.  
Jordan's been on fire.   We knew that coming in, probably should have taken away one or two and made it a little more difficult for him.   But, again, those are great players making great plays.  
   
 Q.   Cory, can you just talk about the last putback?   You're right there and nobody's blocking you out and there is the ball.  
CORY JEFFERSON:   Yeah, we do it in practice all the time.   Go where you think the ball's going to go.   I shot one up and it looked like it was about to be a little short, so I went to the other side of the goal, and it happened to be short, I got it, and put it back in.  
   
 Q.   For either of you players, I saw you guys taking in the Syracuse game at the end there before you guys came on.   What kind of stood out to you about them and what will be the challenge facing them?   
CORY JEFFERSON:   We just know they're a great team.   If you know anything about college basketball, you know the name Syracuse.   So we know that's going to be a battle as soon as we step on the court.   We'll have to rebound and do everything else defensively.  
KENNY CHERY:   The same thing.   Syracuse is a great team.   They're well‑coached, so we know first thing we're going to do tomorrow is step on the court and be aggressive.   We can't let down, and it's going to be a great game for you guys to watch.
