<p>	Q.  How different will this team be this year and what will it look like?</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys are now in leadership roles that are very different.  You had this established big 4 and then big 3 last year.  Now they are all gone.  What does that mean to you, especially with four freshmen who I think, are probably going to play a lot but are going to need a lot of guidance.  Talk about how you can provide that. </p>

<p>	Q.  Following that up, people on the outside might say oh, wow, how can Kansas State rebound?  Is it different or refreshing in some ways, you have -- you reidentify yourself this year and especially with you two, and Jessica being an upperclass person this is more a team you can put a stamp on and also just the energy that the 18-year-olds are bringing into the program?</p>

<p>	Q.  Talk about what you have seen so far, is there a player on this team that's going to surprise people?  If you can just each pick one person out and who that person is and why. </p>

<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about what we're going to see from K. State?  Claire returns, I guess you are the leading returning scorer and has a game where she can create her own shot a lot of times and take it to the basket.  We don't know much about these kids, what they can bring.  Give us a run down on that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Along the same lines what I asked earlier, but I think it's fair to say a lot of people aren't expecting a lot from K. State this year, especially people who are not familiar with your freshmen or less familiar with you two.  Is that kind of a challenge that perks you guys up some that for lack of a better way to put it you have something to prove this year? </p>
