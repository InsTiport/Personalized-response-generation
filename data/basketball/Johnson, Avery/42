 Q.  And his status? 
 COACH AVERY JOHNSON:  Game-time decision right now.  Still some soreness there and obviously he wasn't able to work out today.  So we'll see if he can be much improved tomorrow. 
 Q.  Avery, you made a pretty major adjustment after Game 1 in the last series.  Are you thinking something major for Game 2 in this series? 
 COACH AVERY JOHNSON:  Well, we're always considering a lot of different things.  We're still evaluating it, and we'll see what we do come game time. 
 Q.  (Inaudible) how do you adjust your game plan? 
 COACH AVERY JOHNSON:  Well, we play without guys all year.  It's nothing new to us.  We just keep rolling and we'll figure out who we start and how we want to attack.  But no matter whether Howard is there or not.  That was our second worse defensive performance of the season. 
 Q.  What was the first? 
 COACH AVERY JOHNSON:  Another day.  But Dallas our second worst defensive performance of the season. 
 Q.  (Inaudible) guys (inaudible)? 
 COACH AVERY JOHNSON:  What's your question? 
 Q.  We can do that again? 
 COACH AVERY JOHNSON:  Yeah, I hope so.  I think if we hadn't had practice doing it we would be concerned, and we're still concerned because of Josh. 
 But we play without guys before.  We played without four guys in our rotation, and I'm glad we're not there.  But we play without Josh, and if we have to do that we'll just have to do the best we can do. 
 Q.  (Inaudible) defense?  What was so wrong about it? 
 COACH AVERY JOHNSON:  Where do you want me to start? 
 Q.  Wherever you want. 
 COACH AVERY JOHNSON:  All right.  You ask the question or me?  Transition defense.  Transition defense.  Transition defense. 
 Q.  Thank you. 
 COACH AVERY JOHNSON:  Transition defense.  Made or miss, transition defense. 
 Q.  People just not getting back? 
 COACH AVERY JOHNSON:  Transition defense.  Penetration.  Pick-and-roll defense.  We look like a team without a system.  And that's my fault. 
 Q.  Are you concerned that you're going to revert back to old bad habits? 
 COACH AVERY JOHNSON:  Well, I would hope not.  Not in the Western Conference Finals.  We should be sky-high right now. 
 Or maybe we should come down from our last series and really understand that we're playing against a totally different opponent and we gotta adjust to the tempo of the game and adjust to a couple of different situations pretty quickly. 
 Q.  You said you got adjustment, can you make them adjust to you? 
 COACH AVERY JOHNSON:  Yeah, we can.  We scored, what, 118 points, 50% from the field.  Not bad.  But when your defense was the way it was last night, we're not going to get anything done.  So hopefully we can play a much better defense than we did. 
 Q.  Avery, they could be without Raja as well, what does that do -- 
 COACH AVERY JOHNSON:  Nothing for us. 
 Q.  No? 
 COACH AVERY JOHNSON:  Nothing for us.  Whoever they put out on the court we want very good defensively.  We gotta make some improvements there and keep our offense playing at our tempo. 
 Q.  Did you transition defense -- did you have a feeling it might happen? 
 COACH AVERY JOHNSON:  We wanted to try to get adjusted to their pace quickly.  But you know what you can't simulate it in practice.  And it's not like we had time to try it in practice.  And even if we tried it, we couldn't do it.  Because they play at a specific pace. 
 So hopefully now that they've seen it on film, we can make the necessary adjustments. 
 Q.  How do you get the team to (inaudible)? 
 COACH AVERY JOHNSON:  Well, I started to resorting to, I was already sweating like I always do.  So I was starting thinking about making -- just grabbing a uniform and going out there.  But I can't do that.  So I gotta just do my job and -- 
 Q.  But is there something in practice, is there something -- 
 COACH AVERY JOHNSON:  Yeah, we tend to make adjustments around here for lack of a better word.
