<p>	Q.  Sophia, can you talk about the last five minutes.  Looked like you really wanted the ball, especially after being out with foul trouble for a little. </p>
<p>	Q.  After seeing what Kansas State was able to do to Texas in the semis with that comeback, when they started making that run on you, especially in the second half, did you think, "Oh, gee, it's going to happen to us now"? </p>

<p>	Q.  How frustrating was it to be on the bench and how much were you lobbying to get back in? </p>

<p>	Q.  Steffanie, y'all celebrated a week ago.  How does this one feel? </p>
<p>	Q.  Both of you guarded Wecker at one time or another.  You've had success keeping her under average.  What do you have to be conscious of when you guard a player like her? </p>


<p>	Q.  Same question to you about when Kansas State was mounting that comeback in the second half, did you have a little feeling of, "Oh, gee, here they go again"? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked before about Blackmon and Young getting in foul trouble.  The question was asked to them about how much they lobbied.  How difficult was it for you to keep them on the bench for as long as you did? </p>
<p>	Q.  The play where Chelsea scored on the layup when y'all wind up with a five-on-four situation with Megan down.  How important was that?  You hit an offensive lull for a long period?</p>
<p>	Q.  At any time when Kansas State, after they had cut it to three or four, did the players just know to take it straight to Sophia or did you have to instruct them? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about the defensive effort on Wecker.  Can you talk about the perimeter defense on Koehn in the second half. </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned Chelsea playing 40 minutes.  Seems the bench was maybe a little shorter than usual. </p>
<p>	Q.  I was going to ask about LaToya in particular. </p>
<p>	Q.  Winning the conference title with five teams ranked, do you deserve a No. 1 seed?  Talk about how you've turned the program around in the five years you've been there. </p>
<p>	Q.  Was it something you told them or was it just natural when they went back in, it seemed like the ball just went to Sophia every time? </p>
<p>	Q.  You say you don't really care about where you're seeded.  Do you care where you play? </p>
<p>	Q.  Better than the old system. </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm wondering how proud you were of them for making the free-throws down the stretch after the first half, then how many free-throws will you shoot this week? </p>
<p>	Q.  Back to the NCAA tournament.  There were a lot of teams that aren't used to losing that lost this year.  Do you think the parity that seems to be growing in the game will help get neutral sites soon? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there a different kind of satisfaction between winning a regular season and a tournament championship?  You kind of alluded to it yesterday.  Does it feel different?  I'm not saying one is better than the other. </p>
