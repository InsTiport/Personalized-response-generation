<p>	Q.  Any of the players, the surge that you had at the end of the first half to tie the game.  How much energy did that give you for the second half? </p>
<p>	Q.  Emily, you're known more as three-point shooter; did you guys see something on film or during the game that you should be taking the ball inside. </p>
<p>	Q.  Sophia, can you just talk about your performance and what it meant to do this in front of your mom? </p>
<p>	Q.  Sophia, can you talk about and Stephanie, you too, can you talk about the contributions from Abby, particularly in that second half run where you all got ahead and took the lead? </p>


<p>	Q.  To any of the players, I want to know about what you did differently defensively after you got that big deficit down 15 or did you do anything differently?  Seemed like your defense you kicked it up after that. </p>
<p>	Q.  Sophia, I know you guys play for yourselves and all your teammates but you could you sort of put this in the larger context about given the negative publicity that's happened in Baylor in the last couple of years, what this does as far as rehabilitating the image of the school? </p>
<p>	Q.  Johnson was taking the ball to the hole right from the start much more than she normally does, was that because you had Augustus and the other players so well covered? </p>
<p>	Q.  Sophia, talk a little bit about not knowing who you're going to play yet, taking the emotion of this game and going into the final. </p>
<p>	Q.  This is for any of the players, can you comment on playing in front of such a large crowd like this and does it take time to get used to shooting in a facility like this? </p>
<p>	Q.  For any of the players, Kim doesn't usually like to play that much zone, were you all surprised at how much zone defense you played? </p>

<p>	Q.  The way that the tournament ended for you guys last year, was that a motivating factor to make it here this year and be playing in this game? </p>
<p>	Q.  What was the strategy to keep them from getting transition baskets; even when you guys had turnovers and missed shots it still seemed like they didn't score much in transition?</p>
<p>	Q.  In regards to only four players that scored for them tonight, was there some thinking if Seimone is going to get hers, really try to put clamps on everybody else or is that how the game just developed?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk a little bit about Abby's contribution, what she did particularly well tonight and what you might need her to do better tomorrow?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you were a young player did you ever think the day would come when you would look up and see 29,000 people in an arena to watch women's basketball?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about whatever adjustments you made to get Young some, get fouls off Young?</p>
<p>	Q.  You said you challenged your players when they were 15 points behind, what did you say to them? </p>
