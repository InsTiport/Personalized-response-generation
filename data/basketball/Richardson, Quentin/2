SHAWN MARION


SHAWN MARION: I think I have more rebounds than shots.  That's not good.  I think in order for me to help this team I have got to get involved more.  Probably wasn't my night to get the opportunity I wanted but at the same time I have got to get involved. 
QUENTIN RICHARDSON


QUENTIN RICHARDSON:  I think we could still play another quarter.  We have got to come back Tuesday, we have got to step up.  The biggest thing is they decided to stay home. 

Q. Are you frustrated a little bit with what is going on with your shot?

QUENTIN RICHARDSON:  A little bit.  The whole thing is that I am never going to stop shooting so I don't really press myself that hard.  I keep working on my shot, practicing before the game.  I get here early and practice.

Q. It's tough to drive on these guys?

QUENTIN RICHARDSON:  That's why they are a good team.  We have got to figure it out.  Keep chipping away at it. 
STEVEN HUNTER


STEVEN HUNTER:  I am going to try and contain him my best, one-on-one, (talking about Tim Duncan) I thought I did a pretty good job today, I want to try and build on that.  Tim has a lot of moves. I knew they have a big lineup out there.  I knew I had to be ready to play today.  I am going to have to keep playing tough and just try to play well to help this team win.  I am playing defense against them.  Get enough shots at the basket, figuring the defense out a little bit and score a couple of points.  Like I said, he's a good player (Tim Duncan).  I think I am a good defender.  I am going to keep playing him tough and see what happens.
