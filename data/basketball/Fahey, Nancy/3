Penn State - 83, Illinois - 57   
 Q.  Nancy, Brandi and Alex were not going to go down without a fight today, as was the rest of the team, frankly.  
COACH FAHEY: Yeah, they came out, played hard, put a lot of points on the board, so that was a good sign.  Just let someone take off on us on the other side.   
 Q.  Gave kind of a microcosm of the season; a lot of things that seemed positive, we had that seven-point lead with 8:10 to go in the second, and I thought, all right, here we roll.  
COACH FAHEY: Yeah, I thought we did a good job.  They came out in man, we ran our stuff very well, got the lead.  They punched back with the zone, went down by six at half, but we felt pretty good that --   
 Q.  Petra hit that three at the end of the half --  
COACH FAHEY: So I thought that would loosen us up a little bit.   
 Q.  And then of course the Penn State team rolls on, but again, Illinois does not go down without a fight.  What else about this game are you going to remember in the off-season?  
COACH FAHEY: Quite frankly, we finished this season, we didn't even talk about the game.  This is talking about a game that has worked their heart out for the last five months.   
But I think it's something that we're going to be motivated by.  You know, and I think that in our postgame meeting, that's something we were talking about.  We're motivated.  We're not going to let this happen again.   
 Q.  And really the spirit and determination never left this team.  
COACH FAHEY: No, and that's what we're trying to build on.  Teams are built by character and their work ethic and their grit, and that's where we're starting.
