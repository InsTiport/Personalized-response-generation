 Q.  Coach, you had kind of a moment there at the end of the game. Can you talk about how special that was to bring each of those kids off individually and have them be recognized in their last game in an Illini uniform?  
NANCY FAHEY: Well, it's emotional. Most of those kids, I came here when they were sophomores, when I just joined the program. But believe me, it's about more than wins and losses. It's about relationships. It's a moment you're having.   
 Q.  Can you talk about the match-up today with Wisconsin; what was it that caused some struggles for you? I know you had a good presence on the front line from Ali and Kennedi, but of course the size disadvantage has been an issue all season long. What was it today that sort of turned the game, I guess, in your mind?  
NANCY FAHEY: I guess size. We didn't score. I'd have to look at the film to kind of break it down, but I guess I was -- they hit some shots. We kind of tried to open it up and get some easier buckets as the game progressed, and I thought they came out and did a pretty good job of defending us.   
 Q.  Kennedi had another double-double tonight. That's her eighth of her career. She has now set the freshman single-season record for rebounding at Illinois. Can you just talk about her effort throughout the season, what you've seen from her growth throughout the season.  
NANCY FAHEY: I mean, I think our three freshmen did a really good job tonight. That's something to build on. She's been playing undersized all year, so we're looking forward to having a little bit more balance next year.
