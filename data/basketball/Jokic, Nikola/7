 Q.  What was it like yesterday coaching the Special Olympics team? Seemed like you were having a lot of fun.  
NIKOLA JOKIC: It's an amazing thing. It's an amazing thing. I just like to be a coach because you can yell at the refs and you can yell at the players, and they cannot do anything to you. I had a really good time just to see the faces, just to see the smiles, just to see Toni Kukoc. I saw Jameer Nelson. I saw some familiar faces yesterday.   
 Q.  As you move forward in your career --  
NIKOLA JOKIC: I'm not going to be a coach.   
 Q.  But you had fun?  
NIKOLA JOKIC: Yeah, I mean, I like working with kids. Spending time with kids, it's really fun. Just because you don't want to expect from them. They can surprise at any moment. It's a good thing to do.   
 Q.  Who are you excited to play with tomorrow?  
NIKOLA JOKIC: Bunch of them. Bunch of them. A.D., Kawhi, James Harden, LeBron James. There's a lot of talented players.
