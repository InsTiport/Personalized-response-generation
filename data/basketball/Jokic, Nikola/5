Q. Coach has talked about how transition defense is a big point of emphasis in this series.  What needs to change other than just turning the ball over less?
NIKOLA JOKIC:   When we score, we need to get back.  They are attacking us in transition and we know that.  We just need to be, the mindset needs to be get back, get back, get back.  I think that's the first step.
Q. How tough is it for you to get a feel for the game and to play in rhythm when you're in foul trouble like you were in the first half?
NIKOLA JOKIC:   I think I started the game really good.  Then I had three fouls and because of that, I kind of was off.  And then I started the third quarter somehow good.  I think I was aggressive.  But, I mean, we need to do collectively a better job.
Q. Their size is very different than the Clippers' size.  How did that impact the game tonight?
NIKOLA JOKIC:   They are really good shot blockers.  They are attacking us off of the rebound.  We just need to match that.  I think we can, again, do collectively a better job of rebounding the ball a little bit better.  And when someone is going to block the shot, just find open guy and make yourself an open guy.
Q. To piggyback off that question, how big of an impact did Dwight Howard have in his energy and his strength to the Lakers?
NIKOLA JOKIC:   All three bigs.  I think JaVale had a really good energy in the first half, in the first quarter.  AD was really good scoring-wise.  Dwight was really good.  He kind of picked up their energy.
Q. Is there something you feel you need to do different defensively in terms of guarding the paint?
NIKOLA JOKIC:   Yes, I think we can do a little bit different.  Make a little bit of adjustments.  Just try to make it a little bit harder to score.
