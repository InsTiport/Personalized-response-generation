Q. What's your favorite Dirk Nowitzki memory?
NIKOLA JOKIC: Got to be the Finals when he was MVP and kind of destroyed Miami that year.
Q. In the Western Conference, what's the final goal this year?
NIKOLA JOKIC: We're going to play until they tell us to stop.  We are playing really good basketball right now.  We're winning a lot of games.  We're hoping to just continue to play like this.
Q. Congratulations on your first All Star selection.
NIKOLA JOKIC: Thank you.
Q. What does it mean to represent your country?
NIKOLA JOKIC: It means a lot, not just for my country but my hometown, my family.  That's something I put behind me, my legacy.  I'm going to remember this my whole life, and hopefully my kids and my family are going to remember too.
Q. What are your thoughts on the current format of choosing the best players from each conference?
NIKOLA JOKIC: I don't know.  I think the game needs to be like 24 or whatever players.
Q. The best regardless of conference?
NIKOLA JOKIC: Yes, the best 24 players in the league in that moment, yeah.
Q. What's your take on Giannis this year?
NIKOLA JOKIC: I think he's probably MVP this year.  I think him and Harden and Paul George are the three best to kind of consider to win the MVP title.  He's playing extremely well.  He's leading his team in every aspect of the game and every stat point.  He's extremely athletic.  He's a freak of nature.
Q. How do you feel about the Skills Challenge tonight?
NIKOLA JOKIC: I don't know what to expect, to be honest.  They're going too fast for me.  I need to be perfect.  I need to make my three.  I need to make the pass the first time.  That's the only chance.  That's how I get the only chance.
Q. Michael Jordan's birthday is this weekend.  If you were to get M.J. something for his birthday, what would you get him?
NIKOLA JOKIC: Horse.
Q. Not a goat?
NIKOLA JOKIC: Not a goat.
Q. What are your thoughts on Paul George's season?
NIKOLA JOKIC: I think him, Harden and Giannis are probably the best prospects for the MVP title.  How he's playing right now is an extremely high level.
