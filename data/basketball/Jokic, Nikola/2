Q. Coach Malone said it was the rebounding, second-chance points that were the difference tonight?  What did you see from your perspective?
NIKOLA JOKIC:   Yeah, I think the rebounding was the problem.  We gave them a lot of second-chances.  We kind of played good defense, in the end we didn't rebound, we didn't finish the possession.  Too many fouls.  I think they were on the line too many time.
I mean, I think we were good except for those two segments.
Q. How can you do a better job of limiting their second-chance opportunities?  What does the rebounding battle come down to late in the game?
NIKOLA JOKIC:   I mean, we need to box out of course.  I think we just need to focus on who is going to go and who needs to box out.
But on the other hand, there needs to be effort.  All five guys need to rebound.  It's a team effort.
Q. They started Dwight Howard.  How big of an impact do you feel that move had?
NIKOLA JOKIC:   He did his job.  He had a really good first quarter.  He kind of brought energy for them with AD, of course, who scored a lot in the first quarter.
Q. You mentioned too many fouls.  Does that start to get into your head a little bit, wonder how physical you should be not to pick up a foul?
NIKOLA JOKIC:   I mean, yes and no.  I think we had a lot of, kind of cheap fouls.  Like if you're going to make a foul, just make a foul, don't let him chance to shoot it.  I think we can stop the break a little bit.  I think we can be a little bit smarter, not giving them easy points on the line.
Q. Jamal had another really good night.  Do any of the plays stand out to you that you were surprised?
NIKOLA JOKIC:   Yeah, he was playing really good.  His energy on the floor was really, really...  We all felt it.  Maybe the last one, the left handed, I think that was a big one.
Q. You aren't going to make excuses, been here before.  Lived a lot of Playoff life.  Green was talking about the physicality in the fourth quarter, said that LeBron earned those calls but you guys hadn't.  What do you have to do to earn those?  Would you agree with that?
NIKOLA JOKIC:   I did not understand.  Is it physicality or foul calls?  What was the question?
Q. When another player said somebody else has earned those calls and you haven't, do you agree?  What do you have to do to earn 'those calls'?
NIKOLA JOKIC:   I mean, I think first of all, it needs to be a foul.  I mean, I don't know.  If itÂ’s a foul, the ref is going to call it.  If it's not, he's not going to call it.  I'm going to stick with that.
