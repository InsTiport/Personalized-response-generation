  Q. What do you think about game No. 2? Give me your thoughts.   
 MICKAEL PIETRUS: We have to come out -- I think the last time we came out flat. We have to go out with a better energy and effort.   
 Game 2 is right around the corner, so we're going to have a good practice today, make some adjustments and be ready for tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Tell everyone back in Florida everything is going to be all right with the Orlando Magic.   
 MICKAEL PIETRUS: Yeah, we've been through a lot, Boston, Cleveland, so we have to work for it. It's not going to be easy, but we're going to fight for it.  
  
  Q. Shooting in Game 1 cannot happen in Game 2 obviously to win.   
 MICKAEL PIETRUS: We're really going to try to make shots tomorrow. This is what we have been doing all season long. So hopefully we'll go out and do it tomorrow.
