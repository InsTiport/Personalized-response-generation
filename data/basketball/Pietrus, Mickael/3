		   MICKAEL PIETRUS: We have a great team, I believe. It's not about belief anymore. It's about give everything you have and try to make things happen because it's not easy to be in this situation, and when you want to win this championship. I think that every one of us deserves to be in a good position, deserves a ring. 
 So we know that we're going to have to come out hard and make sure that we take care of business. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 MICKAEL PIETRUS: One day at a time. One day at a time. Today is a smile day. One day at a time. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 MICKAEL PIETRUS: I don't think we want to make history. First of all, I think if we make it happen, we're going to be in NBA history anyway. So I think we have to take a day at a time,
 make sure that tomorrow we come out very focused at shootaround and at the game. I think it's going to be a quick showtime for us, but we can see our team character in how we're going to come out. We know that we're in a tough situation, but anything is possible. Adidas. (Laughter). 
 I think we have to be more loose. Maybe the Lakers don't have as much pressure because they've been in this situation so many times and they've won a lot of championships. But at the same time we have to come out like it's a great day. It's a good day anyway, so come out and play our game, play with some energy, play with each other, because we've been doing it for 100 games now. We know what we're capable of doing, winning for the team, and I think tomorrow is going to be our best game.
