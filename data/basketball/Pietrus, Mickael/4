 Q. How good are you feeling about the way you came out last night?
 MICKAEL PIETRUS: I think there's always a good feeling when you win a game, but we still have to make some adjustments defensively. But I don't think that we played great defensively, so make sure tomorrow we correct these errors and get back on the floor with the same energy.

 Q. What do you learn from a game where you shoot lights out and you still barely eke one out?
 MICKAEL PIETRUS: Hopefully we shoot better tomorrow. I think that's how we've been playing throughout these playoffs. We have a great team who can shoot the ball pretty well, and I think that that's our main focus is making sure that we feed the Big Fella. At the same time, make sure that we are able to make shots. 
 I think we played extremely great, and hopefully it will be a good game for us.

 Q. What do you adjust defensively?
 MICKAEL PIETRUS: We watched tape, and we made a lot of mistakes. There are things that we have to correct, and hopefully tomorrow we'll be able to take care of business.

 Q. What sort of mistakes?
 MICKAEL PIETRUS: Basketball mistakes. You know, basketball is not a perfect game. We still have to learn how the person is and what they like to do offensively and how we're going to stop them tomorrow.

 Q. Knowing Kobe as you do, the way he finished the game last night, not necessarily like Kobe likes to finish, what do you expect from him in Game 4?
 MICKAEL PIETRUS: He's going to come out hard tomorrow. That wasn't Kobe last night because he missed a lot of free throws. We have to be prepared for that. 
 I know from watching him in the playoffs when I wasn't in The Finals, I know that he's going to come out here, and we have to be really ready.
