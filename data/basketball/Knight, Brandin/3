<p>	Q.  After the seven turnovers you had in the last game against Miami, how satisfying is your performance tonight? </p>

<p>	Q.  It seemed like every time you did the Knight to Page alley-oop show, it rallied the team.  Can you comment on the times you did it. </p>

<p>	Q.  You guys shut out Darius Rice.  Talk about how you did it.  And also how important that was in winning this game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, can you talk about being in the Big East final and what winning it could mean for your seeding, your school, your program, etc.?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ben, statistically, Brandin had as good a game as a point guard has had in the Big East tournament game.  Can you talk about his ability to control a game.</p>
<p>	Q.  How surprised were you that they didn't take a three-pointer at that crucial stretch, 74-71?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ontario.</p>
<p>	Q.  It will be a tough game whether it's Notre Dame or UCONN.  What will it mean to face UCONN? </p>
