  Q.  It seems like the trade with Golden State has opened things up for you?  Have you made a conscious effort to try to expand your game?   
 DANNY GRANGER:  I definitely have.  I try to step it up a little bit.  When you lose two of your top three scorers -- I definitely try to step it up.   
  
  Q.  You've done really well with the three point shot this year, how has that come about?   
 DANNY GRANGER:  A lot of shooting over the summers.  Over the summer, knowing I was going to play the wing position a lot, I just constantly put up shots, as many as possible, every day.  And it paid off.   
  
  Q.  Is it tough to expand your offensive game when you're relied on so much for your defense?   
 DANNY GRANGER:  It is.  But coach relies on me defensively.   
 I'm glad to have that role, though, and I embrace it as much as possible.
