  Q. How did you improve on your jump shot?  
 DANNY GRANGER: I had surgery on my shoulder in my junior year and I started altering my jump shots to make them more efficient. And my rookie year I changed them, just to fine-tune, and it has been helping me.   
  
  Q. So you changed it twice in two years?   
 DANNY GRANGER: Not dramatically. I don't know if anyone else would be able to really tell other than myself, but I actually did change it.  
  
  Q. What did you change the second time?   
 DANNY GRANGER: A lot of times I was shooting the ball with all my fingertips. Actually, I'm better shooting off my palm I found. I'm much more accurate with it.   
  
  Q. Do you get impatient looking on paper at least you guys are healthy and you are that far away from winning these games?   
 DANNY GRANGER: We have lost some heartbreakers. It gets disappointing at times, but you like to stay optimistic.   
  
  Q. Will that win over Cleveland give you something to look forward to?   
 DANNY GRANGER: It was a freaky win, but it was a great win for us. We needed that one.   
 It is another way to show we can play with top teams.
