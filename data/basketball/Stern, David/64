<p>	Q.  David, one of these things a few years back, you characterized yourself as "Easy Dave" trying to make a deal.  Would you characterize yourself the same way now?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know in these kind of negotiations, there's a lot of posturing, there's a lot of bluffing. </p>
<p>	Q.  None of us in this room would like to see another lockout.  But how much leverage would you compromise by being aggressive in voicing optimism that there will be an agreement reached? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mr. Stern, you've seen what's gone on in the NHL, especially over the last 24 hours, what's your take on that?  And is it something that you guys are keeping an eye on to make sure that stuff like that doesn't happen with your league? </p>
<p>	Q.  Billy, the issues that have been public so far are length of contract and size of raises and the age limit, they all would seem to be things that the union would have to give back.  Obviously, you don't want to do it but what kind of concessions would you be seeking from the owners?</p>


<p>	Q.  Is it just a matter of preserving what you have? </p>
<p>	Q.  For both Billy and David, how strong are the players looking to make a deal considering that they have summer businesses, summer issues that may be important to them, and a lockout would interrupt that?  How much are the owners, who also have hockey franchises or share buildings make that a priority?</p>

<p>	Q.  Last year at the All-Star Game, Jerry West said that he would-- and other general managers have mentioned this, that he would like to see younger NBA first draft picks be able to participate in the Development League.  Is that a minor issue for your sides, or is that the kind of thing that creates problems? </p>
<p>	Q.  Just a quick follow-up.  There's also been talk that there are plans to add four teams to the Development League next year.  Is that accurate? </p>
<p>	Q.  Billy, are you still opposed to players being optioned down to the D League, and if so why? </p>
<p>	Q.  Will this sort of breakdown be like one thing that tips it or one thing that opens up everything or everything falls into place, or the way you picture everything-- will one side be giving something or any one particular area you think is going to break it? </p>

<p>	Q.  On your tour of locker rooms the last couple of months you used the word "repugnant" many times to describe cost-certainty or a harder cap, if you will.  Things seem considerably less repugnant here now.  Should we discern there's been some significant movement in that regard? </p>



<p>	Q.  Billy, how do you address with your players the idea of franchise values when they can say, well, a team lost a few bucks this year but teams are going for 400 million, 375 million?  How can you either share in that money, if at all possible, or address it with your players?</p>

<p>	Q.  Two quick questions.  One, is there a reason why your NBDL teams are not in the larger cities, where they can get more exposure? </p>
<p>	Q.  I don't know.  Any of them. </p>
<p>	Q.  Second question, with all of the talk about the lack of fundamentals for so many of the players in the league, has there been any talk of expanding your training camp, so that the coaches can get in there and really teach the basic of fundamentals before they start playing games? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can any of you three gents state with any absolute certainty that the current luxury tax mechanism will be in place with the next agreement? </p>
<p>	Q.  It's a pretty important issue. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do any of you gentlemen regard the 18- and 20-year-old age limit issue in any way as an economic issue potentially? </p>
<p>	Q.  Excluding the good intentions you've described and your hopefulness, are there any specific issues that you can cite in which you have made progress to lead to the optimism you are talking about?  Understanding you're not going to go where you still differ, what issues have you made progress? </p>

<p>	Q.  If there is a lockout come July 1 or if there's a stoppage of play and it extends into the season, what would be the ramifications for the league and its players if the highest-paid players in the history of the world, given in light of what's gone on in November and fan code of conduct, what would be the ramifications for the players and the league? </p>
<p>	Q.  David and Billy. </p>



<p>	Q.  Would that be a catastrophe for your league? </p>

<p>	Q.  In the wake of the melee, there was some question, David, about your power and discipline.  Is player discipline a part of this negotiation? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there a chance that Ron Artest might be back this season?</p>

<p>	Q.  Are you of the opinion that the fan base cares whether or not an agreement is reached by July 1 or October 1? </p>





<p>	Q.  David had mentioned that your schedule is going to be pretty aggressive over the next, I don't know, if it's two or three months, can you just describe what he means by three times a week?  Who is going to be in those sessions?  And you said you had your own timetable, would that be before the playoffs begin? </p>



<p>	Q.  You mentioned at the beginning, Shaq as an elder statesman.  When he was a rookie there were I think ten players 30 years old playing in this game and this year there are four.  Do you see these younger teams, All-Star teams, being something that will be a constant in the future, or do you think it's just a cyclical thing? </p>
<p>	Q.  For David and Russ, do you feel individual players have an obligation to advance the league's image in a positive light, or is their obligation to their own behavior and is the league's position how it presents itself?  And Russ, if you can work "bouillabaisse" into your answer.  (Laughter)</p>

<p>	Q.  As far as the experiment with the three-point rules and the Development League, I was wondering what your evaluation is on that?  Do you see that as something that comes into play here, or is it going to go away?  No.2, do you see the Development League back to what we talked about with fundamentals?  Do you see an expanded Development League as a way of attacking the issue of fundamentals? </p>


<p>	Q.  Some economic problems clearly factored heavily in driving the hockey situation into the lockout, and with very general statements about how well the NBA is doing, can you be more specific?  Are you economically better than ever?  How many teams lost money last year, blah, blah? </p>
<p>	Q.  Not better than ever? </p>
<p>	Q.  How would you assess the return of basketball to Charlotte with the expansion Bobcats?  And have there been disappointments and/or surprises about that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Given the size and incredible strength of your players, are you satisfied that there's no serious abuse or use of steroids?  And what do you say to constant or occasional rumors of a high percentage of players using marijuana? </p>
<p>	Q.  Does that mean that you're concerned now that they are problems? </p>
