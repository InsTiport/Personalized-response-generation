 Q.   I guess I should ask you, where's Anaheim?  
COMMISSIONER DAVID STERN:   We don't know.   
   
 Q.   Is that still considered a viable market?   
COMMISSIONER DAVID STERN:   I don't want to pre‑judge what would be‑‑ what we would be considering.   I don't want to take away the prerogative of the location from them.   
   
 Q.   Were you encouraged by discussions today, discouraged?  
COMMISSIONER DAVID STERN:   I'm so even keeled.   It's good that we're still talking.   
   
 Q.   Is there a possibility (Inaudible)?  
COMMISSIONER DAVID STERN:   I don't know.   We'll see.   We'll see.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
COMMISSIONER DAVID STERN:   Maybe you should go back and read your polemic because what you said was that‑‑ what we said was that teams who are well managed should have the ability to make a profit and compete, and so there is no guarantee, it's only an opportunity.   And I think that's what he meant.   I think that's what he meant, as well.   
   
 Q.   You would agree there's a big difference between what you said and all 30 teams making a profit.   
COMMISSIONER DAVID STERN:   No, but if you read this, you didn't say that there was a guaranteed profit, it's the opportunity to make a profit.   And now as that opportunity exists, that's what we want.   That's what we're heading for.   And I think that will be achievable, and it should make everybody very happy.  
ADAM SILVER:   And that's better for the players, too, obviously, because they're getting 50 percent of the revenue we could generate, so the idea is to align and center and grow the pie as large as possible.   
COMMISSIONER DAVID STERN:   We're very much aligned with the players on that, as Adam said.   
   
 Q.   Is there a chance for a game in Brazil?  
COMMISSIONER DAVID STERN:   I think there's a possibility.   We're looking into it.   We're looking into it because the fact that the Olympics will be in Brazil in 2016 is a strong‑‑  
ADAM SILVER:   And the World Cup.  
COMMISSIONER DAVID STERN:   And the World Cup in 2014, and the building of facilities and the like.   Remember, we opened up the Palau Sant Jordi in Barcelona before the Olympics in '92.   Not in '92, but two years before, when the Brazilian facility that's going to have basketball is going to be ready to go, it would be my guess that there will be a game.   
   
 Q.   Are you pleased with the progress being made on trying to get a new lease?  
COMMISSIONER DAVID STERN:   Yes, yes.   It just takes‑‑ it's a long process.   We hope to get it completed before the legislative session starts.   And Mardi Gras, boy, some cities shut down, but no one shuts down as well as New Orleans.   It's great.   And then if you do hear from anybody, you can't hear them because the noise in the background drowns out the conversation.   It's nothing that's not good, it's just taking a little time.  
   
 Q.   You've been very supportive of New Orleans.   Do you believe in‑‑  
COMMISSIONER DAVID STERN:   I believe in New Orleans.   I believe in the job the governor is doing, I believe in the job the mayor is doing, and I believe in the support that New Orleans has given to us, and we would like to return that support.
