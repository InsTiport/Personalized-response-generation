  MARK TURGEON:   We took care of business yesterday, I guess.   We played well defensively, weren't great offensively, and Sean Mosley stepped up for us obviously and got it done.   But we know we're taking on a whole 'nother animal now to go on the road and play a Florida State team that's coming off a great win on Saturday.   It'll be another great challenge for us.   We're looking forward to it, and hopefully we'll play well.   
   
 Q.   We were just talking to Brian Gregory on the teleconference, and he told us that Mosley was the toughest guy on the floor, and his will to win is what made the difference yesterday.   Can you address that?   Is that how you saw it, too?  
MARK TURGEON:   Yeah, Sean brings it every day.   Sean has been there.   He's won a league championship, he's played in the NCAA tournament.   He knows what it takes.   You'd have hoped that our young guys would start taking the same approach that Sean does every day for practice and in games, and they still haven't done it.   But no, his will to win yesterday was off the charts.   He defended, he made all the plays for us late, and he continues to try to lead this young team as best he can.   He played like a senior.   He played like a senior that's been there, that's been to the NCAA, and he knows what it takes.   I was really proud of him yesterday.  
   
 Q.   Have there been times this year where he's struggled to find a role in the offense or to find his role in the offense?  
MARK TURGEON:   No, I don't think so.   I think Sean has‑‑ he knows where he fits in.   Sometimes it's hard because Terrell dominates the ball, if that's what you're getting at.   But it's hard for everybody with that.   
But no, I think we run a continuity type offense and everybody has a chance to score on our break or our half court offense.   Sean knows when to pick his moments.   I think early in the year he might have been a little too unselfish at times.   He's gotten a little more aggressive since league play started, and it's helped our offense.   
   
 Q.   Given that you've just played the one game on the road at State and it was a tough loss, have you talked to your players?   Are there any lessons that you want them to take away from that about playing on the road, or do you just assume that's kind of self‑evident at this point?   
MARK TURGEON:   No, we'll touch on the same things that we touched ongoing down there.   I thought we played pretty well at state to be honest with you.   I thought they played great, and we had a stretch that we weren't very good and they took advantage of it, but we kept competing.   So hopefully we'll be a little better this game on the road.   We'll see.   We're playing a very big, strong, athletic team.   But we'll keep emphasizing the same things that we emphasized for us to be successful on the road, and number one is defending and rebounding.   What we didn't do very well at State was defend and rebound at the level you need to to win on the road.   Hopefully we'll be a little bit better defensively tomorrow night.   
   
 Q.   What problems in particular will Florida State cause for you, especially after coming off a performance like they just had?   
MARK TURGEON:   Well, they get after you defensively.   We haven't been great with the basketball.   They're going to pressure us.   We've got to be able to handle their pressure, especially early in the game.   They're hard to score on.   We've got to figure out ways to score.   We really struggled to score yesterday, and we've got to figure out ways to score.   Then you've got to match their physicality and try to rebound with them, which will be a battle for us.   
But they do a lot of things well.   It all came together Saturday for them on all aspects of the game.   They played great, and they've showed signs of that defensively and offensively, rebounding and all that kind of stuff.   They showed signs and they put it all together on Saturday.   We know we're going to play a team with a lot of confidence right now.   It's going to be a great challenge for us.   
   
 Q.   In your preparation when a kid like Dulkys comes off a 30‑point performance, only missed two shots, do you pay a little bit more attention to him than possibly you normally would have?   
MARK TURGEON:   I think we always pay attention to good shooters, great shooters, guys that can score.   He got it going, got it going in transition and got it going.   We'll be aware of all.   I think they have a lot of really good players, Ian Miller and Dulkys and you just go on and on.   I think they've got a lot of really good players.   It's going to be great team defense for us is what it's going to take to be successful.   
But whenever you've got a guy coming off a hot game like that, you want to pay attention early so he can't get going again.   
   
 Q.   You finished a game that ended early Sunday evening, you play Tuesday evening on one of the longer road trips in the league.   How do you handle today?   Where are you practicing, and how intensely?   
MARK TURGEON:   Yeah, this is not a good draw, but I know a lot of teams will have this kind of a thing with one day of rest.   You know, unfortunately, too, they do a lot of things, so it's going to be a tough one for us, especially with a young team.   But we'll get some things done today.   We won't go as hard because I had to play seven guys a lot of minutes yesterday.   We'll go about an hour, but we'll hopefully get a lot of things done in that hour, and then we've got shoot‑around tomorrow and film work.   We'll have two film sessions for sure that will allow us to hopefully get prepared.   
But we can't simulate their speed and their athleticism, which is something we're going to have to get used to as the game goes on down there.   But my assistant has been working on Florida State for four or five days, so he's prepared.   He'll have our team ready to go for tomorrow night.   
   
 Q.   Can I ask you to talk about Nick Faust?   We're looking at some of the freshmen in the league and how they're coming along.   Am I right you had him playing point guard a little bit early in the season?   Is that correct?   And if so, is he more comfortable now playing on the wing?   
MARK TURGEON:   Yeah, we had him playing point guard.   We were just trying to survive.   We were down to seven guys, and Terrell was our only other point.   He did a nice job.   There's no question he's more comfortable.   There's times where I think down the stretch here I'm still going to play him a little bit at point, get him a little more playing time.   I need to rest Pe'Shon a little more as the season goes on.   
But no, he's much more comfortable.   Yesterday was the best game he's played because he did the things that he's capable of doing.   He defended, got some steals, rebounded, drove the ball, made guys around him better.   He played within his abilities, which was great to see, and that's why he played so well.
