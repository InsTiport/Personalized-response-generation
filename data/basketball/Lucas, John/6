<p>	Q.  Can you give us an indication of match-up, especially out on the perimeter? </p>
<p>	Q.  Joey, can you and Tony talk about their two perimeter guys?  Maybe the best back-court in the country, going against those guys tomorrow, especially defensively. </p>

<p>	Q.  Coach Martelli talked about how complicated or at least how many plays, he said he had 40 pages of plays y'all run, how great your communication is.  What does that say about John's ability to pick up the offense and the game plan coming in as cold as he did? </p>
<p>	Q.  John, with every win that your team is getting, do you constantly remind yourself how thankful you are that you're part of this Oklahoma State team? </p>
<p>	Q.  Tony and John, if you could expand a little bit on the previous question about the match-ups.  You guys play best when the opponent is better, it seems, when there's more on line, more at stake.  With Tony's kind of honorable mention, All-American, a little bit of a snub some people think, you were third team, each of you please address that, how this is an opportunity maybe against that back-court that everybody reveres as best in college basketball, this is an opportunity for you guys to show how good you are. </p>

<p>	Q.  Daniel and Joey, can you guys talk about what an opportunity this is.  Chances like this don't come around often for schools, other than like Duke and Kentucky.  Can you talk about what an opportunity this is, the chance to seize it? </p>

<p>	Q.  Tony and John, if someone just watched this team play like last week and didn't know the background, they'd think you guys have been playing together, the whole group, for years.  You came from like different places, you came together.  How long did it take you to come together and was there something about one another that just got you to click right away? </p>

<p>	Q.  Coach, you said the other night that you were picked fifth in the Big-12, you probably felt that was about right pre-season.  Was there a point during the season, any specific point that you thought, maybe something like this is possible?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ivan, since you haven't said anything yet, I'll start with you.  A lot of people who follow you guys have felt that your team quickness has been a major asset, but there's been some comments from the Saint Joseph's people that they feel they have a quickness advantage over you.  What is your response to that? </p>




<p>	Q.  Joey, last night Tony was struggling a little at one point, John had been taken out of the game.  That's when you made that run, helped jump-start your team.  Did you sense that or was that just the way the game had come and the shots were there, maybe you were taking advantage of the match-up? </p>
<p>	Q.  In all of your years of coaching, I'd like you to comment on what Tony said, is that what it boils down to, buckets?  The second part of question is, just sort of the evolution that you've gone through as a coach from when you went to the Final Four at Arkansas, then when you went to the Final Four at Oklahoma State, how have you changed in terms of what's important? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Sutton, do you look at this as a "road game" because of the number of Saint Joseph's fans that will be here in comparison?  I know earlier you were a little I don't want to say miffed, maybe that's not the right word, but concerned you didn't get to go to St. Louis.  What does it mean?</p>
<p>	Q.  You're the champ of the league.  Kansas is in St. Louis. </p>
<p>	Q.  Eddie, how tough is it or tricky is it when you're recruiting two brothers where one may play a more prominent role than the other?  Joey, how much of a transition has it for you getting used to still water after playing in Florida? </p>

<p>	Q.  Coach, Ivan, Daniel, Tony, has John Lucas exceeded your expectations of him coming in this season as a transfer from what you were expecting him to be this season?</p>

<p>	Q.  Ivan, update us on the food poisoning virus, but more importantly I want you to discuss, you have been called undersized all year long.  This time people are saying you have the advantage inside.  Can you talk about that match-up a little bit? </p>

<p>	Q.  Coach, John Lucas' dad last night said one of the things that he wanted for his son, he wanted him to work with a coach who has been through some adversity, he thought that would help him.  From Kentucky, from personal problems, from the crash, do you think that's helped you at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  In a game that is so much talk about guards, can you expand a little bit on what Ivan said about the inside advantage you guys have, then a little bit on Ivan, as well, his career NCAA games, he's averaging in double-double. </p>
<p>	Q.  Following up on the question a while ago about some of the personal hardships you've been through, then looking at the success you've had in bringing in transfers, do you have a soft spot for kids that maybe need a home that are out there in the college basketball world, kind of looking for a place to fit in? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about defending their guards?  Do you think help is the way to go when they penetrate because of their ability to kick ought?  Do you have to defend them further on the 3-point line? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Martelli noted that he's 49 years old, you've been coaching most of his adult life.  What does that mean?  He says at the same time there's nothing that he's going to throw that you've not seen before.  What does it mean to coach for so long, what's the advantage?  What has kept you in this for so long?  How important is it for you to play for a national championship? </p>
<p>	Q.  You could coach many more years, several more years probably, and reach some real big records.  Would winning a championship this year or making it to the title game lead you to retire now?  Have you thought much about it? </p>
<p>	Q.  What are the odds that you would not coach beyond this year if you win the championship? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said it's not that important to you to win a national championship personally.  How important is it for the school?  How precious is this opportunity? </p>
<p>	Q.  Phil was saying when you're a young coach, you know everything.  As you get older, you probably know what you don't know.  Have you noticed anything about any trends about young coaches, what you've seen?  Are they more humble?  Do you think they think they know more than everybody? </p>
<p>	Q.  In all your years in the game, do you remember any team that has accomplished as much without an interior offensive presence the way Saint Joseph's has this year? </p>
<p>	Q.  You were saying the other day how you have been a head coach your entire career.  Do you remember anything about the very first basketball game you coached, or if not the very first, then your earliest recollection of a specific game that you coached?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you were at Central High, '61, I think that's the last time Saint Joseph's was in the Final Four, I believe.  Do you remember Saint Joseph's at all?  Do you remember that Final Four?  Do you remember that national championship at all? </p>
<p>	Q.  '54. </p>
