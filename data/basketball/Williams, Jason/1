  Q.  Gary mentioned this team has a togetherness, if you can talk about the mental aspect of this team.   
 JASON WILLIAMS:  Yeah, we started out I guess a little bit bumpy, not knowing what we were supposed to do or what was expected of us, all kind of things, injuries, being together for the first time.   
 But we come together at the right time and I think we're playing our best basketball of the season.   
  Q.  How do you balance the excitement and enjoyment with the work that has to be done?   
 JASON WILLIAMS:  It goes hand in hand.  You just go out and have fun and play hard and everything else takes care of itself.   
  Q.  Being in a position at having Shaq at 27 and Wade at 35 and then you never know if Antoine is never going to have another one of those 17-point games, how do you avoid getting yourself chasing your tail so that you can get someplace and make stops?   
 JASON WILLIAMS:  You've just all got to be on the screen.  You've just got to always know, like I said, if you get beat, your teammate has your back and not just worry about guarding that guy.   
 I think that's something that, you know, sometimes we allow them other than giving up a 3-pointer, we give up a layup.  You know, you don't want to do that.
