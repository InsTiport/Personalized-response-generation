  Q.  How does it feel to be going back to North Carolina?   
 BRANDAN WRIGHT:  Just being around guys I'm familiar with and I've known the front office guys.  I feel real comfortable in this situation.   
  
  Q.  How do you feel about getting pick in the first round?   
 BRANDAN WRIGHT:  You know, a guy like him picks you, obviously he sees something in you.   
 I just think he has a lot of confidence in my game and what I can do.  I'm definitely going to do my best.   
  
  Q.  How do you see yourself fitting in?   
 BRANDAN WRIGHT:  I think I'll fit in well.   
  
  Q.  Did you feel you would have gone higher?  What did it feel like?   
 BRANDAN WRIGHT:  I felt like I could have gone anywhere from 4 to 10.  Honestly I didn't know where I was going.  Each pick was like, you know, I could go ahead.  It was neat to finally get my name called.  That's why I feel great about the situation.   
  
  Q.  What's the best thing about going to Charlotte?   
 BRANDAN WRIGHT:  One thing is the guys around me that I'm familiar with, starting with the Carolina guys and they will take me under their wing and treat me like their own and just being close to Chapel Hill, it's a quick hop over to Tennessee.   
 It's going to be great.  I'm really looking forward to it.   
  
  Q.  What are your plans for tonight?   
 BRANDAN WRIGHT:  I'll fly to Charlotte tomorrow and do press conferences there, get ready for Summer League and take it from there.
