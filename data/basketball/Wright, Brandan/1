  Q.  How do you feel?   
 BRANDAN WRIGHT:  I feel the same way, man.  Just honored to still be in a good situation and going to a team that really can run and tries to score a lot of points.   
 Golden State really fits my style of play and I'm excited.  I feel great about the situation I'm coming into.  I'm excited to get to play the best type of ball that you can play, spread it out, one-on-one, make a lot of plays and show what you can do.   
  
  Q.  How is it going to feel to go from one side of the country to the other?   
 BRANDAN WRIGHT:  Flying all the way across the country it's going to be an adjustment.  I've never spent a lot of time in California but it's always been a great experience for me.
