Tennessee 64, Missouri 51   
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Tennessee.   
We will start with an opening statement by Coach.   
KELLIE HARPER: I'm really excited that we're advancing in the tournament. We came out, started a little slow. I felt like Missouri was going to be really tough to beat today because of their style of play, how they play. They're well-coached.   
Really proud of our team for hanging in there. Really in the second half getting stops, that was the difference in the game. Our team made some runs and got some momentum. Really proud of them.   
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.   
 Q.  Rennia, talk about how physical that game was.  
RENNIA DAVIS: That was a physical game. We knew coming into this game that Missouri would be a tough team, as Coach Harper mentioned.   
But I was just proud of the team for just sticking with it, not really considering the calls or whatever the case might have been, just stepping up. When we did get foul calls, we hit free throws.   
 Q.  Rae, it was quite a contrast from the first half Tennessee performance to the second half. What changed at halftime for the team?  
RAE BURRELL: I think just we really locked in with our defense. We had good communication. We had good offensive rebounds. We started attacking a little bit more, getting to the free-throw line. Things like that really got our momentum going.   
 Q.  Rennia, how quiet was it in the locker room at halftime? Did everybody just listen and go from there?  
RENNIA DAVIS: The locker room was actually the opposite of quiet at halftime, to say the least. I think the message was well-received. We came out in the second half and played better.   
 Q.  Rae, you have a short turnaround time. You play Kentucky. What do you remember about the game with them?  
RAE BURRELL: Just our defense not really being where it needed to be at that time, stretches in the game. I don't know. It's kind of hard to recall because it was so long ago, yeah.   
 Q.  Howard scored 37 that game, Kentucky was hot from the three-point line.  
RAE BURRELL: Like I said, they had a lot of wide-open shots. A lot of miscommunication on defense. We need to clean up those areas and we'll do a lot better.   
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you.   
We'll continue with questions for Coach Harper.   
 Q.  What did you say in the locker room to your players?  
KELLIE HARPER: At halftime we were just trying to get our players motivated. Again, feel some urgency in the game. Sometimes there's some technical talks, sometimes there's some motivational talks. That one was probably a little bit of both.   
We didn't want to come in there and be satisfied with our first-half performance. We wanted to try to instill a little urgency going out of the locker room.   
 Q.  What do you remember about Kentucky? What makes them difficult to defend?  
KELLIE HARPER: We'll start with Rhyne Howard. Yes, I remember Rhyne Howard. Defensively we were just a step behind everything they were doing. She was coming off screens. She was open. We had breakdowns. It was really a game of runs. They made some runs. We made some runs.   
That was really the first game that we played against a really high-pressure defense. I thought it affected our play offensively. We missed a lot of chippies, some shots that we could have made.   
I've not seen them a lot since, but I know both teams have grown since that. It's been a long time.   
 Q.  The NCAA tournament, do you think now the body of work, getting to the quarterfinals, that your team has done what it needs to do?  
KELLIE HARPER: It's funny because I really have not looked at other scores, looked where other people are standing. Any time people ask me about that, we tied for third in the SEC. We have 20 wins. Now we have a win in the tournament. Hopefully our résumé is looking better and better.   
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
