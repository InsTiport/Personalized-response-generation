 Q.   Do you think that the League's incentive to get guys more interested in entering a contest will grow?  
DOMINIQUE WILKINS:   It's ultimately up to you to give something back to ‑‑ more give it to the fans.   That's what all the contests are about.   When Mike and I did it, we loved to compete.   We loved to win.   It was exciting to us to prepare for the Dunk Contest.  
   
 Q.   It was really about the competition?  
DOMINIQUE WILKINS:   Competition, and all the benefits came with that.   Man, we loved to compete.   The competition was, as they say, a mother, for real.   Guys brought it.   We had so many guys.   Man, we had some guys in there to do some things.
