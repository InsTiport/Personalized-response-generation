 Q. What kind of job do you think you did on LeBron last night as a team?   
TIAGO SPLITTER:   We know he's going to go strong to the basket, so everybody was aware of that.   We just tried to defend like a team.   Of course they have great shooters.   So that's not easy.   You have to guard LeBron and then you have the good shooters open.   It's a hard task.   
   
 Q.   Could you just talk about how you think Kawhi defended him.   Seems like he made him work.   
TIAGO SPLITTER:   Yeah, definitely.   He's our best defender.   So we put our money on him to guard him.   Of course he's impossible to do it by himself.   Everybody is trying to help.   Everybody is trying to dig a little bit there and just to do a great effort and try to contain them.   
They are a very fast team and fast break.   So we have to be aware of that and don't let them play easy.   
   
 Q.   You guys do a good job of taking care of the ball generally.   But last night you only had four turnovers.   Did you do anything differently?   Did you guys focus on taking care of the ball?   
TIAGO SPLITTER:   Of course we focused on taking care of the ball.   We know that they're a team that wants to steal the ball and run for the fast break.   That's one of their best weapons.   We saw Indiana turn over a lot the ball, and they had a difficult time.   So that's why we wanted to try to focus, take care of the ball.   Don't make mistakes, and play our game.   Do what we do.
