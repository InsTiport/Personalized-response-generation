Q.   Pretty hectic schedule for you.   What's it like going place to place to place?
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.:   It's tough.   All‑Star Weekend, you think it's going to be a stroll in the park, but, no, you got to wake up earlier than what you do when you're on the road, wake up and do all these, get all these things out of the way that they got you set up for.

Q.   What is it going to be like for you when you get out there tonight?   Was that one of are goals, to be in this game first year in the NBA?
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.:   I would be lying if I said it wasn't.   It's definitely one of my goals.   There's another one of my goals is get through the 82‑game season, and I just can't wait for that to happen.   And I just can't wait to get going.

Q.   Just to have the opportunity tomorrow to perform with your dad, it's got to be a dream come true. 
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.:   It is a dream come true.   We never talked about doing this before, but the NBA thought it would be a good idea, and I thought it would be a good idea as well.   And why not go against Stephen Curry and Dell Curry in that competition.

Q.   As far as the work you put in and getting to where you are right now, is this something where you come here you say, wow, this is somewhere I want to be and I want to be consistently?
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.:   Yeah, for sure.   Like I said before, it's for the fans.   It's for basketball fans.   It's for people who take the game serious and that want to meet us. 
We're not strangers.   We're not guys that want to bite.   We want to go out there and communicate with you guys and see what you guys are all about.
