THE MODERATOR: If you could start with an opening statement, feelings about the day so far.
BRICE JOHNSON: It's been pretty hectic.  Probably been a nervous wreck for most of the night.  It's surreal right now.  I'm really blessed to be able to have the opportunity to play in the NBA.  I'm just thankful right now.  That's pretty much it.  I don't really know how to feel about it right now yet.
