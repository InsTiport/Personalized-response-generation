 Q.  What do you miss most about Ricky Rubio?  
DONOVAN MITCHELL: He's my guy. What do I miss the most about Ricky? Ricky. Just like him as the person. I miss Ricky as the person. Obviously, basketball speaks for itself. He's just a great teammate, a great unselfish player. He taught me so much, has so much knowledge. I think that's the thing with a guy like him. He's so unselfish and kind. He had a Super Bowl party and invited everybody to his house. That's the type of guy he is. He would have everyone for dinner. I haven't seen him, but I'm happy for him and what he's doing.   
 Q.  Have you spoken to him since he's been on the Suns?  
DONOVAN MITCHELL: He's figuring it out. He's doing a great job over there leading the young guys, taking a lot of pressure off Devin Booker, which I know from myself as a scorer definitely helps.   
 Q.  What's it like to represent the state of Utah?  
DONOVAN MITCHELL: Represent the state of Utah, it's such a blessing to be able to go out there. And Rudy [Gobert]. When I first got drafted here, All-Star was a thought, but it wasn't like, The third year I'll be here. For me to go out and put on just for Utah, it is truly special. We're kind of overlooked in a lot of different things, so for us to be out here and make a name for ourselves is really cool, and hopefully do this for many years to come.   
 Q.  On his first All-Star experience:  
DONOVAN MITCHELL: I'm not Donovan Mitchell from the Utah Jazz right now. I'm Donovan Mitchell the 13-year-old. Like I said, that's Kyle Lowry. I'm going to keep having those moments just because you don't get to do this. There's only 24 of us.   
So to be able to do that, that's truly amazing. I plan on doing this for hopefully many years to come, but I'm really focused on the moment now. When you start to overlook and look past it, that's when you kind of really lose what's in front of you.   
So right now I'm a 12-year-old, 13-year-old kid right happy to be here and enjoying my experience.
