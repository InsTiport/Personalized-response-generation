  Q. What were your overall impressions of the second time around?
 DONOVAN MITCHELL:   I definitely felt more comfortable.  Just understanding the format.  Understanding how the game flow is, shots.  Its a different type of pickup game when youre playing pickup with the best players in the world.  Just trying to find your balance.  For me, it was going out there and being who I am.  Just going out there and having fun, enjoying the moment.  I think I did a pretty job of that.  Hopefully Ill be here for many more years to come.  But definitely more comfortable and locked in.
 Q. Was the ambience different than a typical All-Star weekend?
 DONOVAN MITCHELL:   The biggest thing is that when you walk through the hotel lobby, its just us.  You dont have to take the elevator.  I dont mean its a bad thing.  Its just a different vibe.  Its a little more at peace.  All-Star weekend is meant to be crowded and hectic and fun.  That felt similar to road trip, if that makes sense.  You go test, go to your room, wait to come back down, take the bus. It definitely felt more like the season we are playing.  That was the biggest difference for me.
 Q. Was it important for you to see Mike Conley get on the board?
 DONOVAN MITCHELL:   We were trying, man.  We were in the huddle just trying to find ways to get him a shot.  I was thrilled to see that.  Hes about 65 years old so it definitely took him a while to get used to it and get in the flow.  Im happy for him.  Were so happy to be a part of that together.  Hell never show how excited he is, but I could just tell he was just excited to be there and be a part of it.  It was good to see one go down for him, be out there and be the veteran presence he was.
