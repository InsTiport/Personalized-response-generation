Indiana - 78, Texas-Arlington - 64
JUWAN MORGAN: Really they were just, they wanted it more.  They were fighting harder than we were.  They were running guys on ball screens attacking us in every way you can think of.  I think we responded well at the end just really anchoring down, getting those stops and scoring in transition.  But they were just really attacking us.
Q. Damezi, that 3 you hit (indiscernible), did you sense that you guys were really struggling from the perimeter when you were about to take that and a big boost?
DAMEZI ANDERSON: Yeah, it was just confidence in my shot, then knocked it down.  It boosted us and gave us energy on the defensive end.
Q. Justin, just having a game like this where you're going through adversity even on your home court, how can it help you grow as a team to have this experience?
JUSTIN SMITH: I think having this experience going through this type of game, playing these type of players, it's a good test for us to really kind of see what we're made of.  And having to scrap and fight on our home floor and get a win, a hard-fought win, it's going to come in handy having that experience down the road.
Q. Justin, you guys are a little bit shorthanded because of the injuries.  What do you talk to the young guys about being fresh because they're having to play big minutes basically for the first time in their career, and what do you do?
JUSTIN SMITH: Well, it all starts with getting proper rest and treatment, making sure that you're in the training room every day after practice, before practice, getting your body ready.  Because it is a long season.  We have been going at it since, practically the entire year, whether it be the summer, the preseason.
So just taking care of your body and making sure that you're on top of things and not letting yourself slip and keeping yourself, keeping yourself, like, in the training room and doing things that are necessary.
Q. Juwan, with all the injuries, it becomes next man up, but at some point there's nobody left to come up how do you guys approach that with all the injuries?
JUWAN MORGAN: If it gets to the point where we have to play five people 40 minutes a game then that's what we'll do.  Our bodies are in condition well enough to do it, but if it comes to it then that's what we're going to do, and we'll fight as hard as we can.
Q. Was there any message at halftime when you had the 13 first-half turnovers, and what was causing it?
JUWAN MORGAN: It was just being lazy with the ball, not coming to meet it.  And we knew they were going to be a hard-playing team, really trying to deny all passing lanes and getting into us.  And I think they did that.  The message at halftime was really to just get yourself open, even if you have to post up as if you're trying to get the ball in the post on the block to get open, doing whatever it takes to get open to get the passes.
Q. Down to three and one points and the crowd just starts giving you guys lots of encouragement.  How much, especially with how few players you had left at that point, how big was that for the crowd to kind of rally around you guys and basically try to help you get through when the game was -- looked like, it was looking like they were going to possibly take over?
DAMEZI ANDERSON: Really just us coming together as a team most importantly, and the crowd just gave us a little energy and boost because they show love and support.  And we just want to show them a good time and get the win for them.
Q. Damezi, coming out of the timeout -- you answered this -- but the shot clock was winding down.  You had to go up and hit a 3 from the baseline, talk about that play a little bit.
DAMEZI ANDERSON: I seen the shot clock going down, I knew I had the ball in my hand.  I'm always confident in my shot no matter what situation it is.  I put a lot of shots up to get my shot the way it is today.
So I really, just being confident in my shot and making sure I knock it down and having the confidence to knock it down no matter what the situation in the game is.
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
