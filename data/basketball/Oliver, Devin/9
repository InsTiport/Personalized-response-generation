THE MODERATOR:   Coach, go ahead and make an opening comment.   
COACH MILLER:   Okay, obviously heck of a game.   We knew we had our hands full.   I thought our guys really battled.   For the most part we really did what we wanted to do, you know, with the game plan.   Just disappointing probably about the last eight minutes defensively.   I thought we took our foot off the pedal.   We lost our ball pressure, we had simple breakdowns on blockouts and that's the name of the game when you play against a team that's as good as Baylor.  
They've got great front lines, and they're very hard to score against in the paint, some second shots, some timely threes with us not being totally locked in in that back eight minutes defensively.   Just kind of came to the end for us tonight.   
I'm proud of our guys.   We're playing against high‑level competition.   I think our guys right now are as good as anybody.   To be in that championship game is what we wanted.   It didn't happen, and now obviously you've got to take the good with the bad.   You swallow it, be mature about it, get focused and ready for the third game in three days, and I believe we play Cal.   Once we get done with tomorrow, third game against a quality team we play, we'll know a lot about ourselves, and that's what it's about right now.  
   
 Q.   Did you think that tip in at the end was going in?   
DEVIN OLIVER:   Yeah, I did.   I was right there at the rim.   I don't know how I missed it.  
   
 Q.   Baylor took a couple of timeouts before that final play.   Did you actually go and change the play after they took the timeouts?   
COACH MILLER:   No, we didn't change anything.   We had our set ready to go.   We assumed a switched ball screen.   We put the ball in Vee Sanford's hands, our best guy, just in terms of getting his own shot.   You know, I don't know if it was perfect or not.   I know Vee got to the block, and he got a rainbow which he's capable of making.   He's made it a hundred times.   It is a good look, point blank shot, got a second chance by D‑Mo's effort, and didn't go.   I told those guys, it doesn't have anything to do with the last play.   There are so many things that can happen in the course of a game that can impact winning.   I thought for 30 minutes in that game all guys looked about as good as any team in college basketball looks on television against that type of environment.   For whatever reason back eight minutes, back six minutes, that intensity level that you need against the best when they're trying to come back, we just gave them too many opportunities to slice into us.   I give them credit.   They're a good team now.   They've got good players.   They're a team right now that has a chance to play for a championship in Maui, and I would think that they're going to have a terrific, terrific season.   They've got great talent inside.   Hard to score on and around the basket.   Just looking at our stat line, we're a team that really prides themselves on getting to the foul line.   We were only able to get to the foul line nine times in the entire game.   Probably a lot to do with their length.   The other thing, they outrebounded us by ten.   We're a very good rebounding team.   Today for whatever reason, we weren't able to ante up on the backboard.   At the end of the day, that was our doing.   Our second shot mounted in the back eight minutes.
