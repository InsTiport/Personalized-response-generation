Baylor   80
  West Virginia   70

THE MODERATOR:   We are joined by the Mountaineers from West Virginia, Coach Bob Huggins and his student‑athletes, Jaysean Paige and Devin Williams.   We will go directly to the questions for the student‑athletes. 

Q.   Devin, you guys seemed to attack the zone far better this game than you had the past couple.   What was the difference to you today? 
DEVIN WILLIAMS:   I don't know, really, it was the third time playin' them.   It was a statement game for me and, you know, I was just trying to come out and do what I could. 
Watching film, you know, I was able to see what I did the first game, first and second game, so I was just trying to take advantage of the opportunities that I know was there. 

Q.   Jaysean, tell me about your performance today and how much that can help you going into the Big Dance here, 18 points on the day. 
JAYSEAN PAIGE:   Builds a lot of confidence coming in, hitting a few shots and things I work on every day.   But the win is the most important and we didn't come up with a win. 
THE MODERATOR:   All right, gentlemen, we will let you go back to the locker room.   Questions for Coach? 

Q.   With the seven or eight days that you've got between now and your next ball game, all the preparation and everything involved, do you feel like you've got enough time to get Juwan and Gary rested up and 100%? 
COACH HUGGINS:   Well, we're not going to rest 'em up.   They're going to have to get some cardio.   They're both planning to play. 
They weren't 100% today.   They could have played, but they weren't 100%, and I didn't think it was worth them reinjuring themselves to‑‑ not it wasn't worth it.   It wasn't the right thing to do by them, let me put it that way.   Scratch what I said before.   I didn't mean that.   I meant it wasn't the right thing to do by them.   They're both planning and are very excited about playing next week. 

Q.   What is it about Baylor's match‑up, three times you've played 'em tough, just can't get over the edge? 
COACH HUGGINS:   Well, they're very well coached.   Scott does a good job making adjustments.   We just didn't‑‑ we didn't finish around the rim the way we need to finish around the rim.   We got the ball pretty much where we wanted to get the ball.   We got a 5‑point lead and miss the front end of a one‑and‑one.   They made some key shots and we didn't. 
We talked about it going in, we can't put them at the foul line 34 times.   When we have lost, that's what as happened, people have doubled us from the free‑throw line and they basically doubled us from the free‑throw line again.   You can't win like that. 
I don't think it has anything to do with much of anything else than that, really.   13‑point difference. 

Q.   Coach, the way you guys were able to shoot the ball in the first half must have done wonders for you at halftime.   Did you feel like you would keep that momentum going into the second half?   More the most part you were right there? 
COACH HUGGINS:   I don't know, I must have been watching a different game than you were.   No, I didn't think we had the bounce that we have to have to win.   We're not a great shooting team.   We get a lot done from effort and enthusiasm, and we didn't get to 50/50 balls.   We didn't rebound the ball the way we need to rebound the ball, and we didn't take care of the ball.   I think we had nine, ten turnovers at halftime and coming in we said we have to keep 'em off the free‑throw line, which we didn't do, and we couldn't turn the ball over, we had to get shots. 
I guess my view of the game was better than yours, you maybe should have come in and talked to them, you might have been better, more positive approach. 

Q.   Coach, this is the second straight game against them.   They were able to force more turnovers than your guys.   What is it about their ball handling that seems to break your defense? 
COACH HUGGINS:   We didn't press.   We really didn't press.   We didn't press because we don't have the numbers to press right now.   We kinda backed it off.   So we really weren't‑‑ we were trying to guard 'em and we didn't guard 'em very well, but we were trying to guard 'em better and not turn 'em loose at the basket. 
THE MODERATOR:   Coach thank you.   Good luck next week.
