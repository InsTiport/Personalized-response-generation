 Q.   Shoni, after the game I spoke with one of the Native American fans who was out there who actually is from the Phoenix area and was rooting for the west.   She said the only thing better than having the west win was to have Shoni Schimmel get the M.V.P.  
Could you speak to what your success has meant to the Native American community?   
SHONI SCHIMMEL:   Definitely, being a Native American it's a huge accomplishment to go out there and be in the WNBA, to have the fans look up to me as a role model not just for my siblings but the Native American fans, the Native American people.   It's something I take on my shoulders because I enjoy it.   
I love being Native American and for all these fans to come out and be here, it means a lot for them to sit there and vote me into this game, it means a lot and I'm thankful they all got the chance to be here or watch it on TV.   
      
 Q.   In the early years of the league when the rookies came in it took them several seasons to get adjusted.   You two have come into the league and been able to play like you've been around for a couple of years.   Can you speak to that?   
SHONI SCHIMMEL:   We were just talking about this.   Our rookie class, we were made for this.   We're a solid rookie class and it's not just one, two or three of us, it's our whole class.   
We go out there and we've seen it before, I've watched a lot of WNBA players, I've looked up to them and for her to have her sister in the league as well you go out and there and strive to be the best and play against the best and you gotta go out there and beat the best.   It's been a great rookie year so far but we'll see how the second part of the season goes.
