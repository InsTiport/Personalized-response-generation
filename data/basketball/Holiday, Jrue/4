 Q. You've got the trim going? 
 JRUE HOLIDAY: Yeah, I had to, I have my own barber. Have to.

 Q. So who is here --
 JRUE HOLIDAY: Jamar and James. I think that's it from the sophomore team. 

 Q. Do you like the All-Star, the way it goes? Being teammates with guys who you normally compete with? 
 JRUE HOLIDAY: It's cool. To me it's kind of like the best of the best coming to one place, showcasing, showing off the talent and that they can play as a team. It's great. It's fun playing with them.

 Q. Your plans for the game, are you going?
 JRUE HOLIDAY: I'd prefer to watch it at home; but again, it's an experience that I probably want to go and see. For myself, I'm already here.
