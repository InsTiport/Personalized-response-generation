		  COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   Look, I've probably given you guys too much information.   You guys have ‑‑ take it and run with it.   He is ‑‑ his return is indefinite.   He is definitely not playing tonight. 

Q.   Can't rule him out before Game 4 or‑‑
COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   Every day we'll reevaluate. 

Q.   Okay.   Same starting lineup, Erik? 
COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   Yes. 

Q.   Same inactives? 
COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   Let's see.   Pittman is back.   So Eddie and Chris. 

Q.   Whenever Chris comes back, will there be a period of adjustment?   (Indiscernible)?
COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   We'll gladly cross that bridge when we get there.   I hope we get to that point.   Right now I love you, Chris, but it continues to be our focus on who we have right now. 
It's great having him around.   Probably the biggest confidence‑builder for our basketball team was the mere fact that for the last two years we simply couldn't not only win without Chris, but we couldn't play effectively without Chris.   He was our most important player. 
And we've had to make adjustments on the fly and have had to reinvent ourselves, it seems, like daily to do that.   If we get to that point, I'll gladly take that quote, unquote, challenge to work him back.
