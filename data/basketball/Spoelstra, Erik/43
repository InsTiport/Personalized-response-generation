Q.   Spo, is it strictly a matter of the game will dictate or will you know tonight if you're going to have to go deeper than nine going in? 
    COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   We're open to whatever the game presents.   And we feel very confident in our depth, so if we have to use it, we'll use it. 

Q.   Coach, what do you think with Chris coming off the thigh injury, Chris Anderson, what do you think is the max number of effective minutes he can give you? 
    COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   I think more and more.   He actually looked probably his best yesterday in practice.   So we will see. 
    You know, it was a rough week for him, but he's getting better each day. 

Q.   More tonight? 
    COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   Possibly. 

Q.   Will you start him? 
    COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   No. 

Q.   What do you expect from LeBron tonight?   How many minutes do you think he can go? 
    COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   Not sure.   I'm open to it.   I'll read it.   Obviously we'll be attentive to it, and if we need to go deeper, we will.   Anticipate we might have to. 
    He's been through every situation you can possibly go through.   We had an extra day of rest and we'll manage it. 

Q.   Erik this is the fourth year you've kind of been in this bubble, and I wondered if you noticed the abating of attention, public interest, prodding, all those things that have come with this team the last four years?
    COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   No, I think we've become a little bit more numb to it.   The first year it was uncomfortable for all of us; now we're used to it.   We can make jokes about it that every story line is a "gateâ€‘something" and we keep it interesting for you guys. 
    THE MODERATOR:   Thanks, Coach.
