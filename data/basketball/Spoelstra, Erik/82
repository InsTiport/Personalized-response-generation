Q.   Erik, so much is made about you guys not having lost consecutive games since January 8th and 10th; not having lost consecutive home games since, I guess, The Finals in 2011 against Dallas.   Is that something specific you see in their eyes after a loss?   I know you talked yesterday about the guys and how strong they feel.   Or do you guys do something more efficient, more effective after a loss that you guys come in with that mindset? 
COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   I mean, look, nothing is guaranteed, but our guys take a lot of pride in what we're trying to do and winning and what it takes to win.   When we lose, we all get together and we all own it together, whatever it may be, and we just try to collectively figure it out and come back better.   A lot of times those sessions we don't like each other, but the honesty is what gets to the truth pretty quick. 

Q.   A lot of people think there's a lot of adjustments after any game, especially a loss.   I'm just curious, this late and this deep into the season, is that still the case that there are adjustments or do you feel 100 games in, sort of you are what you are, just do it better? 
COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   Yeah, I mean, that's the most important thing for either team is getting to how you play, where you feel comfortable, where you feel confident.   Can you impose that longer than the other team can? 
Ironically we felt we did impose that longer, just not in the most important time, going down the stretch where we feel most comfortable.   But that's the most important thing.   The adjustments, teams always make adjustments in the playoffs.   That's up to you guys to figure out what those are for either team. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thanks, Coach.
