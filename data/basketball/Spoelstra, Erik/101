 Q.   Erik, can you give us your thoughts on the flagrant foul that the league this afternoon gave to Wade?   
COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   I found out after shoot‑around.   We'll just take it for what it is.   We can't control what the League decides; we just have to move on.   
   
 Q.   Erik, how do you guys do a better job against Hibbert and the pick‑and‑roll and Hibbert overall?   
COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   He's a big target, so we have to be early.   We still have to be disruptive.   We have to do what we do and do it better.   There are some slight adjustments we can make.   But we have to be absolutely committed to our aggressive defense.   Everything has got to be early.   When you're dealing with size like that, if you're not early, the size will get to you.   
So we've got to be better.   Thank you.
