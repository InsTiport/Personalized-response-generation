Q. The Celtics just announced that Gordon Hayward is out.  He was listed as doubtful as anyway.  Is there a Plan A and a Plan B for you or is it, This is how we play the Celtics, no matter what their lineup or rotation is?
ERIK SPOELSTRA:   Well, he's out, so we're prepared for not playing.  That simplifies it quite a bit.
Q. I guess my question was, though, through your scouting and everything else and your walk-throughs, do you sort of have to account for that. And if I can sort of expand, how different does Gordon Hayward make the Celtics?
ERIK SPOELSTRA:   He's not even playing tonight.  I don't even want to get into that. They have enough other things that are on this head coach's mind.  And that's what we're prepared for tonight.  Of course, you had to prepare in the days leading up to this in the event he possibly could play.  He's close, so it's going to happen at some point.
