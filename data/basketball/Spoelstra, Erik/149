   COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA: Ready to go. Nothing new from shoot-around.   
  
  Q. Erik, LeBron talked about this being the biggest game of his career. Obviously, a lot of people would agree with that. But how do you view it in terms of not putting undue pressure on a player and how do you see the whole big-picture aspect and try not to let it weigh him down?   
 COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA: Our guys have been very good about managing all those emotions and compartmentalizing outside distractions, storylines, et cetera. It's about the process for us. And we can't think about big picture, can't think about overwhelming thoughts. It's about playing, and it's each possession. It will be a possession game. And the focus on the details. We've been doing that all year long, working on the process. It doesn't change right now.   
 You could make that statement about every one of these games in The Finals for each guy. But it's really about each possession that you play.   
  
  Q. Does he need to score more or is it just a matter of him having to read things?   
 COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA: He'll be more aggressive. It will happen within the context of what we do. He's a player, so he makes reads during the game as well as I've seen anybody make those type of reads. Whether we need scoring, whether we need him to be aggressive, getting to the rim, whether he's facilitating, setting other people up. Tonight he won't overthink it. He'll play and do what he does best.   
 THE MODERATOR: All right, Coach.
