Q. What was your reaction to the Breonna Taylor news?
ERIK SPOELSTRA:   Like everybody else, very disappointed.  I think all of us don't understand it.  It's not justice.  The 12 million looks like such a ridiculously empty payoff.
I'm really just -- it's all about justice and it was not served.
Q. On that note, how do you talk to your team about this heading into this game when it's something that you know they care so much about, and yet you also have a basketball game to play tonight?
ERIK SPOELSTRA:   These are unprecedented times and there's incredible disappointment and frustration in our locker room, as well there should.  Our guys have been able to manage a lot of this disappointment over the last several months of things that have been happening for obviously way too long.
Q. What do you guys have to do to avoid a lot of points you guys allowed in the paint?
ERIK SPOELSTRA:   We have to do better.  We know that, and we're capable of it.
Q. Because of what happened today with the Breonna Taylor ruling, was there any conversations with any of the guys, of, hey, should we play tonight or anything like that?
ERIK SPOELSTRA:   To my knowledge, we have not had those discussions yet.
