  COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   Same status as this morning.   Same status as this morning.   
   
 Q.   Erik, is there any update on Chris Bosh?   Did he have another workout today, and where is that?   
COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   Yeah, I actually just watched his workout about an hour ago.   It's the same workout as before.   I didn't need to have to watch it.   It hasn't got to that point.   I just wanted to show him some support and see how much he's progressing.   
It's the same thing as before.   It's more rehab oriented.   While Keith is doing some basketball drills, it's more Rey Jaffet, our trainer and physical therapist doing the work.
