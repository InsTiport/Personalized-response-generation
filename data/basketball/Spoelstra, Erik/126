  COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   Everybody is ready to go.   I'll turn in my card in a few minutes. 

Q.   Coach, you guys have played in some tough places this postseason.   What are you expecting from this crowd tonight, Game 7, Miami, big event? 
COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   I'm sure‑‑ I know all of our guys are looking forward to playing this game in front of our home fans.   At this time of year, we have a great building and a great environment. 
It doesn't guarantee anything, but these are the moments that players will remember when they rest their head on their pillows 20 years from now. 

Q.   Your guy, Pacquiao, you're okay with the fact that he's pulling for the Celtics tonight prior to his fight? 
COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   You know what, man, you're making it very tough on me.   I'm going to have to get confirmation from Freddie Roach or something.   I don't know. 
If I don't hear otherwise‑‑ I have to get an absolute confirmation.   Otherwise I might have to root for Bradley tonight.   My brother is in that locker room down there.
