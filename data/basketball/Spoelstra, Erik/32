Q. Everybody obviously talks a lot about Marcus Smart and his defensive impact on the game but as you coach against him over the past several years, how has his offense improved and how has that impacted the way he's able to affect the game for the Celtics?
ERIK SPOELSTRA:   I think everybody probably looks to the three-point shooting and how he's improved that part of the game, but it's all the other areas:  The intangibles, the random, unpredictable play, cutting, offensive rebounding, spacing, passing.  Those are the things that probably the average fan doesn't see that really impact winning and you have to account for that, certainly.
Q. From afar, when you say Jayson Tatum's trajectory over the last few years, was there ever a turning point in your mind when you knew he would be a special player?
ERIK SPOELSTRA:   I don't know, you just knew he was a big-time talent when he came into the league, so with guys like that, it's just a matter of time.  He's in a winning program.  Well-coached.  Been developing the right habits.  He hasn't skipped any steps.  That's probably, you know, the most important thing as a young player, learning how to win, and that's pretty evident.
