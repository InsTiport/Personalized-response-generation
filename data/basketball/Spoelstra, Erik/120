  COACH SPOELSTRA:   Not a whole lot different from this morning.   I'll turn in my card in a few minutes. 

Q.   Does that mean you're not going to give up your starting lineup right now? 
COACH SPOELSTRA:   No. 

Q.   What do you think the key has been when looking at tape of Russell Westbrook, he's really cut down his turnovers over the course of the Playoffs.   He's a high turnover guy during the regular season.   That number has been pretty much cut in half.   Why do you think that is?
COACH SPOELSTRA:   That's the evolution of great players.   And in the moment of great competition, they evolve.   He's such an aggressive, attacking player, I think even when he makes mistakes at times that they live with it because he creates so much on those assaults to the rim.   So our job tonight will be to try to get him out of his comfort level as much as possible while we respect that speed. 

Q.   You had to kind of try to do the same thing are Rajon Rondo in the last series.   What's different about trying to get Russell to turn the ball over and trying to get Rajon to turn the ball over?
COACH SPOELSTRA:   Both of them are equally challenging in a different way.   Rondo is such a brilliant basketball maestro, reads a game, and as soon as you turn your head and make one mistake, he makes you pay for it.   This is a relentless assault that just keeps on coming, and if you're not back ahead of the play, body in front of it, and that has to be multiple bodies in front of it, he'll make you pay.   And that relentlessness is probably part of his greatness.
