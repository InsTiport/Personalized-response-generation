 Q.   Any reaction to what LeBron said about flopping?   If flopping gives you a competitive edge, than so be it.   Use ever weapon in the quiver, basically?   
    COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   I don't have an opinion.   
   
 Q.   Coach, how important is it to sort of go for the throat in the series tonight?   
    COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   We understand how tough it is in this league in the playoffs.   And we've been on both sides of it.   With the experience‑‑ the motivation of being down 2‑1 and the desperation, the urgency that you bring, we've been on that side of it.   
    We've also been on the other side where we know how important it is to continue to try to push forward.   And we know they'll bring a desperate effort tonight in front of their home crowd.   We just have to focus on the task.   
    It will be a very highly competitive basketball game, and we'll have to play well.   It's not only about playing hard, like we did in Game 2; we have to play well.   
   
 Q.   Do you expect to see some personnel adjustments against LeBron, perhaps West, perhaps‑‑ I don't know who else, personnel‑wise?   Will they just try to get to him earlier?   What do you think?   
    COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   We'll see.   We've seen a lot of different coverages during the course of the year.   It was more about a mentality of being committed to not settling, and attacking the paint, attacking the rim, doing it in a variety of different ways.   Post‑ups will be one of the ways.   
    LeBron had a very aggressive mentality down there.   If they do trap or they try to take the ball out of his hands, we've seen that before.   We just need to be poised.   Hopefully that can shake free some of our other guys as well.   
    Thank you.
