  COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   I don't have an update on Bird.   He's getting treatment right now, and Jay's going to take him through some exercises, and then we'll make a decision from there.  
   
 Q.   Erik, what's his progress been over the last few days?   
COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   He's feeling better.   He hasn't done a whole lot, but he's feeling better.   He's making some progress.  
   
 Q.   You said, before the first game he missed, that he still wanted to play as of that afternoon.   Has that been the case throughout that he's been kind of petitioning to be active?   
COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   Yeah, but he understands that these things can be tricky.   So while you may feel like you can tough it out, if you don't have mobility, then you might not be helping us.  
   
 Q.   Erik, was LeBron fresher today after not having to play so many minutes?   Or is it just the postseason is the postseason?   
COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   I don't know.   You'll have to ask him.   I know he's looking forward to playing.   
Hopefully, we can play him extended minutes.   Maybe I won't have to take him out tonight.   
Thank you.
