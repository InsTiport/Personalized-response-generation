  COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   Everybody's ready to go. 

Q.   Everybody? 
COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   Not Chris.   Do I have to start off every presser with that?   Okay.   Nothing has changed from this morning. 

Q.   Coach, you had like three or four transition baskets after made baskets in the first half.   I don't think you had any in the second half. 
COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   Right. 

Q.   Was that on your part or was it just them doing a better job‑‑
COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   No, we want to push.   Any time we have an opportunity if we can get it to one of our attackers‑‑ it's not a primary emphasis, but we've done that when we can during the season.   If it happens where we can get out quick to one of them, we want to push.   That's certainly the pace we want to get. 
We can't sustain that if we're playing off of makes the entire time.   That was the tough part about the other night.   We never got to our consistent defensive consistency.   And so we were playing out of the net the entire night.   And that has never been a successful formula for us.   Even when you try to push the tempo, it's not sustainable.
