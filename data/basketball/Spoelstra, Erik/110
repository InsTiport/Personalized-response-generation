Q.   Talk about the great anticipation tonight.   It's a big night, you could close it out tonight.   Talk about the team's composure and readiness to do so. 
COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   I think our guys have a pretty good perspective on staying in the moment.   Hey, we have a game to play, okay, and what we have to focus in on is trying to win this game.   And that's the perspective we have to have.   The way this series has gone, it's been extremely competitive, decided usually by four or five plays.   We've got to be playmakers tonight.   We're not naÃ¯ve to all the story lines out there, but we're focusing on winning this game. 

Q.   How much more intensity do you think you'll have to turn it up tonight?
COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   Everything we've got.   You know, hopefully it's to the point of everybody getting to about that level where LeBron got the other night, but not quite, okay.   But right up to that point. 

Q.   On that note, now that we're three hours from tip, are you satisfied with the temperature of the arena?   Has it been done the way that you would like it?
COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   I haven't been out there, but I've heard that it's adequate for a basketball game.   It'll be perfect out there.   The players will be hydrated. 

Q.   You talked about how the players have canceled out the noise.   How do you personally deal with compartmentalizing and taking out the noise?   Your family is here, have you spent time with them, as well?
COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   Not much, but they understand.   I have a war room that I can just focus in on at work, at a hotel.   They're having a good time here in South Florida.   I think all of us now have been on this journey for about almost 24 months, and dealing with this world that we live in right now, I think we're all kind of used to it.
