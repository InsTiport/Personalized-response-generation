		  COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   Not a whole lot has changed since this afternoon.   Not that there will be any surprises, but why break the routine.   I'll turn in my card in a little bit. 

Q.   Points in the paint have been a real issue in this series.   When you guys have dominated the paint, you win.   When you lost the paint, you lose the game.   Do you make any arrangement, any difference in yesterday's practice for tonight's game?   Do you work on that? 
COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   That's been our identity all year long.   It's been their identity.   Both teams know the strengths of each other.   These teams are very similar.   Who can impose their identity more consistently, that's the whole deal.   It's a lot easier said than done.   This whole series and tonight's game, these things will come down to who wins the line of scrimmage. 

Q.   Mario looked like he jammed his foot or ankle right at the end of Game 2.   Is that any causing him any issue?
COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   No, he's fine.   He was able to practice and go through shootâ€‘around today.
