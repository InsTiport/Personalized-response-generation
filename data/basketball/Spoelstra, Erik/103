Q.   Is there an update on Mario Chalmers?   And did he take anything extensive treatment‑wise this afternoon? 
COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   Extensive treatment.   He went to shoot‑around.   He's ready to go. 

Q.   Erik, everyone always talks about adjustments in between games, especially at playoff time.   Is there a whole lot more that can be tweaked right now, other than maybe certain situations or just executing better?   Is there anything really fundamental that needs to change one game to the next? 
COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   Always starts with your identity and trying to impose that.   Both teams will be concentrating on that, the disposition, the level of urgency you bring into the game.   But, yes, there are always tweaks you have to continue to make.   Particularly as the series goes on. 
Thank you.
