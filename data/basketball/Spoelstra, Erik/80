 Q.   Erik, the last couple of years when you were here, you had an extra day between Games 2 and 3.   Any change in the preparation, any new challenge with that?   
COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   No.   I think once you start playing, you would rather play every other day.   Our guys would rather not have that extra day to think about it.   So we've been in every situation where you have had the extra days or not.   That doesn't really matter.   It's just about trying to have an incredible sense of urgency now as we change venues here in their comfort zone, can we exceed that level of urgency that they'll have tonight.   
   
 Q.   Erik, Chris said this morning at shoot‑around that he could sense after watching some film that the Spurs wanted him to take those three‑point shots and were backing away and giving that to him.   To have him as most effective, do you need him near the paint like he was in Game 2?   
COACH ERIK SPOELSTRA:   We need him to be very versatile.   He needs to do a lot of things for us.   That's where probably people evaluate him incorrectly, because he does so many things.   
But his comfort levels and his most efficient areas, he did a better job of getting to those areas.   The corner three will still be a part of the game.   But that just depends on the spacing and what happens during the course of the game.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thanks, Coach.
