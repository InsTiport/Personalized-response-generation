  Q.  Corey, Minneapolis is known for Prince and Target, and also for cold winters.  What were your first thoughts and did the weather in January cross your mind?   
 COREY BREWER:  It didn't cross my mind but since you mentioned it, it's going to be real cold.  Guess I'm going to have to get a big jacket.
