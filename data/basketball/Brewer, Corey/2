 Q.   How much do you need Howard to be available to do what you guys do best?  
COREY BREWER:   We need Dwight.   We need him bigâ€‘time.   But we're a team.   If he can't play, we have to all pick it up.  
   
 Q.   Is it a mindset in preparation?   Do you go in preparing for tomorrow as if he's not going to play from a mindset perspective?  
COREY BREWER:   My mind said we're preparing to win.   We hope he plays, but if he doesn't play, we've played without him all year, and we've just got to be ready to go.  
   
 Q.   How does it change the team dynamic if you don't have him?   What changes?   
COREY BREWER:   Nothing really changes.   Clint has been playing well.   We still have TJ and Josh.   We still have big guys, we just have to keep playing our game.
