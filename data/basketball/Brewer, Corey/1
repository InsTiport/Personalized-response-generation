Q. Very short time here.  What did you make of your few months with the Thunder?
COREY BREWER: It was good.  It was good.  You know, it didn't end the way I would have liked it to end, but I had a good time here.  It's a good organization.  I have some great teammates.
Q. You said a lot of stuff about your relationship with Billy coming into it.  Did your relationship with him change at all?  Did it evolve?  Do you think anything differently of him now that you've played for him in the NBA?
COREY BREWER: No, I feel like that's my man.  It's a tough job.  He's done the best he can do.  I feel like he's going to be better next year, have a chance to bring everybody back hopefully, and he's going to be a lot better.
Q. What was it like for you to get this opportunity considering where you came from, the Lakers, where you weren't playing as much and you were kind of wondering what was going to happen next?
COREY BREWER: It was good for me to have a chance to play, to get to show everybody I can still play, just coming in here to try to help the team as best I could.
Q. How do you look at your future?  Do you want to be back here?
COREY BREWER: I would love to come back here, but you never know.  It's the NBA.  For me, I've been around a lot of teams, so I just hope I'm still playing next year.
Q. It was such a fast-forwarded view of what this city, organization, everything was like.  What was it like last night at 4:00 in the morning flying in and seeing the fans at the airport and everything?
COREY BREWER: It's amazing, man.  The fans here are amazing.  Every night we play at Chesapeake, it's crazy, just all the people around town are great.  It's just really good fans here.
