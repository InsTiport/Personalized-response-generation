<p>	Q.  What was the trouble offensively in the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Kind of reflect -- I know it is soon after the game.  Reflect on your careers at this point. </p>
<p>	Q.  What do you think your chances are of getting to the NIT?</p>

<p>	Q.  What was the biggest difference of the last three weeks?  Was it as simple as not winning the close games in the previous month?</p>
<p>	Q.  Alex, you guys pretty much dominated the inside.  You held Blankson to five points.  At any point in the game, did you feel pressure to produce the big plays, as the guards had trouble making shots?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just talk about what happened on the rebounding tonight with the smaller line out-rebounding you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you change your mindset in the second half?</p>

<p>	Q.  Steve, it sounded like you guys had a good couple days of practice.  The start of the game went well.  What changed?  You had a ten-minute scoring drought?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you pinpoint over the past few weeks, anything that has gone differently for you guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you think of your chances with the NIT?</p>
<p>	Q.  Steve, what do you -- same question about Denver.  You had good crowd here.  There wasn't an electricity in the building.  What do you think about Denver as a site?</p>
