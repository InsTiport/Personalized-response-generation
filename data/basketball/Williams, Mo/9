 Q. What are you looking forward to most this weekend?
 MO WILLIAMS: It is fun. I'm looking forward to the D-league dunk contest. James White, we were both on the McDonald's All-American team together. And he lost the dunk contest to David Lee, which in my opinion he should have won. He is just ridiculous. 

 Q. He is the favorite? 
 MO WILLIAMS: He is the only person that has seven different dunks from the free throw line. 

 Q. You are a first-time All-Star. Are you taking it all in? What are your impressions? 
 MO WILLIAMS: I'm having fun, man, enjoying myself. Like you said, taking it in, enjoying it. Enjoying every bit of it.

 Q. Lebron tell you anything about what to expect this week? 
 MO WILLIAMS: He is walking me through it. He is a vet in the All-Star Game, so he is walking me through it. 
 We are having fun doing that too. I'm his tag-along.
