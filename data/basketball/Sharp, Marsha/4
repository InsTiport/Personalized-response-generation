<p>	Q.  Darrice, can you talk about that last defensive play you had there at the end.  Did you feel like you came close to blocking it or maybe made her take tough shot? </p>
<p>	Q.  LaToya, what did you all take from that game from a week ago? </p>
<p>	Q.  LaToya, is there anything you guys tried to do different defensively this time that kept y'all to have that lead? </p>
<p>	Q.  LaToya, how do you get yourself back up after a loss like this?  Leading for the entire second half up until the last few minutes of the game, going to the NCAA tournament. </p>

<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the last four minutes.  Offensively, that's where you were talking about you guys not going. </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm sure you don't like to see Greenwalt in foul trouble.  What were some of the things you were able to do with the combination of Davis, Griffin? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, it seemed like Darrice had absolutely no fear going up offensively against any Baylor inside defender tonight. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about what happened in that first half, the delay, the refs were looking at a replay. </p>
<p>	Q.  What did you think of Baylor's defensive strategy to get the foul on Darrice before the inbound pass, before running time off the clock?  Steffanie said they wanted that foul so they could put the freshmen on. </p>
<p>	Q.  With the respect you have for Baylor, calling them a Top 2, Top 3 team, can you turn it into a positive having an eight-point lead with seven minutes to go? </p>
