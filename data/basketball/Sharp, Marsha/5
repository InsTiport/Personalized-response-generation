<p>	Q.  Alesha, can you talk about that last play, the one you got the free-throws on?  Was that something you saw earlier in the game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Erin, you probably knew how their game finished yesterday with that 3-pointer.  After Alesha did make the two free-throws, were you thinking that was plenty of a time for a team to come back? </p>
<p>	Q.  Erin, you entered the locker room down by six at halftime.  What did you say to motivate yourself? </p>
<p>	Q.  Alesha, can you talk about being able to match or better them from 3-point range? </p>
<p>	Q.  Erin, can you talk about the big 3-pointer from the freshman there at the top of the key? </p>
<p>	Q.  Playing at a neutral site like this, what is it like?  It's not so neutral here against Iowa State.  What was the feeling out there than oh the court? </p>

<p>	Q.  Can I get your thoughts now on playing Baylor? </p>


<p>	Q.  If you could talk about Erin, she played all 40 minutes, didn't have a single turnover, nine assists.  Talk about her role in the game today? </p>
<p>	Q.  They can kill you with their 3-point shooting.  You seemed to respond every time they hit one.  Talk about that and the one at the end. </p>
<p>	Q.  I think with under three minutes to go in the first half, they led 35-26, it wasn't a big run, but how crucial was it after that lead to be down just six at the half? </p>
<p>	Q.  After having seen them yesterday, how nervous were you going out on the court the last play? </p>
<p>	Q.  Katie Robinette had a great first half.  I think she only hit two shots in the second half.  I know she sat out some.  Did you do anything to really try to take the inside from her? </p>
<p>	Q.  You just touched on what I wanted to ask.  Darrice played an awful lot of minutes tonight.  What did you think of Iowa State's strategy to bring her in, bringing O'Neil into the lanes? </p>
<p>	Q.  Going back to Judith, you put her in with four minutes left in the game.  Were you thinking maybe there was a spark there she could give? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about getting another shot at Baylor this year. </p>
<p>	Q.  Last year kind of reverse role, you had swept them during the regular season.  This year they swept you.  Tough to beat a team three times.  I know that's a cliche. </p>
