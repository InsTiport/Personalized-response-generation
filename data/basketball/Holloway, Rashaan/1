ST. BONAVENTURE 73, UMass 60
DEREK KELLOGG: That was kind of a frustrating game for us.  I thought we had a good game plan in place, and they did a very good job of attacking our triangle and two, and kind of one-three-one and 3D defense that worked so well, five, six days ago.  I think they probably took every second of every day from that point to now and prepared for it.  Whether it was UMASS or Saint Joe's, I thought they did a really good job.
And then we had ten turnovers at the half for ten points, and they played a pretty basic two-three I thought we struggled with throughout the contest.  We made a pretty good effort in the end to try to get back in the game but a couple plays that were kind of just some weird basketball plays we didn't kind of get over that hump.
So I thought they outplayed us today.  And we're going to have to, you know, get back at it and get back in the gym pretty quickly here after spring break.
Q. How much did the fact that other guys were making shots make it harder for the triangle in two to be effective?
DeJON JARREAU: It was very harder because we wanted them to -- beat us and they made shots, and we were hoping that if they miss shots, try to take Mobley and Adams out of the game but unfortunately that didn't happen.  They made their plays.
Q. How much did the fact that they were able to build a lead kind of force you guys to rush some things offensively?
DeJON JARREAU: It made us rush because the simple fact we were down 18 going into halftime, coming out of halftime, we were trying to chip away at the lead but we couldn't.   They just kept making shots.
Q. The season as a whole, does it feel like this for you guys that there's some things to build ongoing forward?
RASHAAN HOLLOWAY: Yeah, we've got to learn how to mature on the court, you know, and guys like myself, we need to know how to dominate every game and come out with good energy and just learn how to win games in the second half.
Q. St. Bonaventure, obviously with Mobley and Adams, when you look at the A-10 Conference as a whole and you see these older, experienced veteran guards who are very well some of the better players in the conference, does it elevate you; that you know you have to match their intensity and their skill the next few years?
DeJON JARREAU: Yeah, I know this off-season, I've got to go and work hard so I can get to their level, try to match that.
So if I go and work hard, then I could be able to lead my team next year and we'll be in a better place and not be up here after a loss.
Q. Same question that I asked those guys.  How much did Andoh and Ayeni kind of --
DEREK KELLOGG: Well, I will say that only five days ago, they took a lot of those same shots and they didn't go in.  So it looked like it was more effective.
When they start making that baseline jumper and that elbow jumper, you know, we were kind of willing to give some of those up, but when seven in a row go in, all of a sudden you have to change what were trying to do, and I thought that affected us some.
And then you kind of mentioned it:  We started pressing a little bit offensively.  And that's been kind of a common theme at times when we get, you know, kind of get playing a little faster than we'd like or taking some tough shots.
But ten turnovers at the half, they had seven extra possessions, which led to 12 points.  And then, you know, the constant theme I think when we've kind of not played as well as I would have liked or we've lost, is when teams have shot -- they outscored us by 14 at the free throw line and we end up losing by 13.  That was a little construed there.  But you know, you can put that there.
Q. Was the fact that you guys got behind almost feed into the turnovers that much more because you had to hurry?
DEREK KELLOGG: Yeah, I think so.  You know, they kind of were an old school zone to be honest with you, and we kind of pressed a little bit instead of just getting in the middle of the paint, jump stop, make the next play, the open play and then they were able to run out of that.  Once they got a few easy open basket, I thought that opened up the game for them some.
