Q. Describe your style of play and what you'll bring to your new team?
DEIVIDAS SIRVYDIS: I think I'm a great shooter, so I can be at the perimeter.  I can play with the ball, play some pick-and-rolls.  I'm not a bad passer.  But the thing for me, I think, is shooting.
Q. Can you talk about continuing the line long of great Lithuanian players to play in the league, starting with Sarunas Marciulionis and on and on?
DEIVIDAS SIRVYDIS: I hope so.
Q. Could you tell us which NBA basketball players, if any, you idolized as a kid?
DEIVIDAS SIRVYDIS: Everybody is like Michael Jordan and other legends, but when I was a little kid, I was watching my dad.  He was a pro basketball player, so I was watching him.  I wanted to be like him.
Q. What is it about watching him play when you were younger that kind of brought you on this path toward basketball?
DEIVIDAS SIRVYDIS: I think that the biggest thing that I took from him is shooting.  He was a great shooter, too.  I traveled with him around the world when he played in other countries, so the whole living with him in other countries made me like feel a better basketball player and a better man off the court.
Q. What would you say to the younger kids who want to play in the NBA and follow in your footsteps?
DEIVIDAS SIRVYDIS: The first thing I think, it should be a good coach, a good place to play basketball to improve yourself.  And second thing is family and friends who can stay with you in the tough moments and help you in those tough moments to get through.
