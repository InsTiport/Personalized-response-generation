Q.   Talk about being at .500 at the midpoint of the season. 
KEVIN LOVE:   Yeah, we are back to .500, and we feel good about it, especially at the halfway point.   We got to our win total that we had last year, and it just feels good to continue to get better, and obviously Ricky has been a big part of that.   But we've had other guys step up, Petrovic and Luke Ridnour, so we feel good about how everything is going.

Q.   Now that you've had a chance to see him, what do you think about Jeremy Lin?
KEVIN LOVE:   Jeremy Lin has been great.   He's a success story.   He's worked tremendously hard to get to where he's at, and he's taken full advantage of an opportunity.   It's going to be a feelâ€‘good story for the NBA.   It's good for the New York Knicks and it's great for the NBA, so you've got to be happy for him.

Q.   When you see Ricky, then a guy like Jeremy has all this in two weeks, what do you think of all that attention for a guy like that?
KEVIN LOVE:   Like I said, it's great for the league.   I'm sure in a lot of ways it can be overwhelming, but he's a humble kid, or seems to be very humble, and he seems to be taking everything in stride.   I think if he just continues to do that and keep a level head, then sky is the limit for him.   He's just going to continue to get better, because he's really only 10, 12 games, I don't know how many games, into his career.   So the more time he has out there on the floor, the more experience he has, the better he's going to be.
