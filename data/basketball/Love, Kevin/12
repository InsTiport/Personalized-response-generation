Q. The first quarter the other night, how tough is that to do on the road?
KEVIN LOVE: It's tough to do any game.  We set the tone early.  We're in, obviously, a desperate situation, being down three games.  So we came out, hit big shots.  We used the crowd and got to the free throw line and just played physical.
It's not easy when you put it in those terms, but our game plan was pretty straightforward and we came out and played like our backs were against the wall.
Q. Can you do it again?
KEVIN LOVE: Yeah, I think we can definitely get similar shots and play with that sort of mentality.  But having a record-setting night like that, it doesn't happen every single night, especially in The Finals.
I'm sure they will switch some things up on the defensive end.  They will throw some different schemes at us, but we have to be ready to go tomorrow.
