		   KEVIN LOVE: You get to the hotel room, turn on the TV and take a nap, order some good food, maybe throw on a movie, something like that. That's how you relax and try to take your mind off basketball a little bit. The day ahead or the next day you're going to have to play a good match-up. You have to try to relax a little and be at ease. 

 Q. What about practicing?
 KEVIN LOVE: That's easy. You're out here with a bunch of your buddies for All-Star weekend you're having fun. This is very relaxing, very fun to come out here, kind of mess around with the guys. 

 Q. Have you thought about playing in front of 90,000, close to 100,000?
 KEVIN LOVE: That's wild. I can't wait to see what that looks like. I've been in football stadiums, but I've never played a basketball game in front of upwards of 90,000, up to 100,000 people.
