Q. You had to go to overtime twice to get there, huh?
KEVIN LOVE:   Yeah, I knew it was going to be stiff competition.   I knew it was going to be tough.   I had to go against Mario Chalmers, who's a good friend of mine.   I had a 24‑second playoff with him.   I was fortunate enough that he missed some shots.   Same thing with James Jones.   When Kevin and I tied, then when it came to the last round, I was a little worried about Kevin coming up behind me; I thought 16 was going to be a little bit too low.
Everybody came out in the first round and shot the ball particularly well.   I was just going out there and enjoying myself, having fun with the guys that were sitting courtside.   Jawing with Russell Westbrook, everybody that was participating, everybody, so it was a lot of fun.

Q.   You kind of picked Durant earlier tonight as being your top competition.   You weren't really surprised when he was there with you at the end?
KEVIN LOVE:   I wasn't.   Once I saw that he was added to the competition, I thought, oh, no, he's the type of guy that can get hot.   Like I said, it went extra rounds for me, there were two tiebreakers.   And I'm still in the competition right now because I'm in that competitive mode.   So it's hard to answer some of these questions, but sitting up here with the hardware, it feels good. 

Q.   Can you sort of talk about how this speaks to your versatility on a global stage like that? 
KEVIN LOVE:   You know, I'm a guy that loves to rebound the ball, a guy that loves to play inside, really a physical player.   But for me, coming into the league, I was told not to shoot three‑point shots, so to be where I am now and continue to work on my game, I think this definitely speaks to my versatility.   I think I'll just continue to improve year in and year out.
