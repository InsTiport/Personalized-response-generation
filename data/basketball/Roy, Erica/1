<p>	Q.  A'Quonesia, talk about the tempo of the first half, offensively what you felt you guys were doing right to get so many baskets and shoot so well from the field. </p>
<p>	Q.  I think you started the second half with five turnovers in the first three minutes.  Some defensive changes they made or your lack of execution? </p>
<p>	Q.  Erica, talk about your first half.  Coach talked about hitting those midrange jumpers.  You seemed to be in a zone.  What was different for you tonight offensively? </p>
<p>	Q.  Erica, talk about that first four minutes of the second half, when they went on the 12-0 run. </p>
<p>	Q.  A'Quonesia, talk about the halftime.  It's 42-41, you're shooting 50%, a lot of assists.  Sky high at halftime.  What is your approach?  Just a point down. </p>
<p>	Q.  Erica, if you would answer that, too. </p>

<p>	Q.  Talk about those five turnovers.  Maybe a couple of them weren't the defense.  You don't get the shot, threw it away.  What did you think about those first three and a half minutes? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about at halftime, seemed like the tempo was going your way.  Did you feel like the first half offensively, how would you rate that against a quality opponent?  Do you think that was one of your best offensive first halves against a quality opponent? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about hoping to get to the WNIT.  Now that these freshmen have gone basically through a full season, what have you seen from them?  What can you do with the WNIT? </p>
<p>	Q.  How far has Franklin come just in the last few weeks? </p>
