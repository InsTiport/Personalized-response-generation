 ROGER ROSS: We'll open it up with Coach Kevin Stallings here, Jermaine Beal and A.J. Ogilvy. We'll let Coach Kevin Stallings have an opening statement and then have questions for the student athletes.   
 COACH STALLINGS: We congratulate Murray State, they played a very good game and I thought going down the stretch both teams made a lot of winning plays. They made one more than we did. I think that the things that plagued our team all season long showed up today, unfortunately.   
 But our guys fought hard, they completed hard and that's -- it just wasn't enough today, and we're extremely disappointed. I feel really badly for my players. I feel really badly for Jermaine and, again, that's why this is a great Tournament because things like that happen, and it is what it is.   
 ROGER ROSS: Questions?   
  
  Q. Coach, if you could take me through from the sideline what you saw unfold in that last sequence when Murray State hit the shot?   
 COACH STALLINGS: Well they just -- you know, we were matched up and they didn't really run anything, they just wanted to get it in bounds and try to drive it and do something with it.   
 You know, the kid just made a good shot and off the dribble and I wish we could have been there to contest it a little bit better. But really the game could have been over had we gotten that loose ball. We got them to take a terrible shot when they came down the first time, it was almost an air ball and then the ball glances off the rim, and they said it went out on us.   
 If we secure that loose ball then the game is over with or at least close to it. So our inability to come up with that rebound was now a glaring thing, but they just threw it in and the kid took a couple of hard dribbles and made a nice shot.   
  
  Q. Jermaine, you took only five shots in the game. Was there something they were doing that kept you from getting more involved in the offense, or was that part of what you guys intended to do all along?   
 JERMAINE BEAL: No, I was just playing in the flow of the game. I don't know. I wasn't keepin' track of how many shots I was taking. I was just playing for my teammates and vice versa. I don't know.   
  
  Q. Kevin, if you could talk about the free-throw shooting? You guys were able to get to the foul line some but --  
 COACH STALLINGS: We didn't do a great job of shootin' our foul shots today and particularly in the first half and that's what happens in the Tournament, nerves and you hope that it's not a factor. But it was for us and especially in the first half.   
 Jermaine obviously made two huge ones there with 12 seconds to go, I don't remember if that was -- I think that's how much time was left. We might have had a different outcome had we shot the ball better from the foul line like we normally do.   
  
  Q. Jermaine y'all went with a smaller lineup to make that second half come-back, especially at the offensive end. Can you talk about what that did for y'all?   
 JERMAINE BEAL: Murray State was playing off of some players. So we had to get more scorers on the court and Brad and Lance did a great job of coming in and making plays for us.   
 ROGER ROSS: Thank you, Jermaine and A.J. for your time. We'll open it up for coach.   
  
  Q. Coach, when defending a team like Murray State that has so many options and balanced scoring how difficult is it to key in on somebody?   
 COACH STALLINGS: It's not about keying in on somebody. It's about everybody doing their job, and they're not a team where you think about keying in on somebody. You try to do the best you can with all your assignments, and they only scored 30 points in the second half. It wasn't like our defense was bad in the second half. We defended them just fine. But we didn't defend them well enough. We needed one more stop and we didn't get it.   
 ROGER ROSS: Thank you, Coach, for your time. We appreciate it.
