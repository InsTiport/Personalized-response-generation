 Q.   What's your favorite basketball movie of all time?  
JEREMY EVANS:   Basketball movie?   Probably Sixth Man.  
   
 Q.   Any reason why?  
JEREMY EVANS:   Not really.   I always liked Angels in the Outfield.   That movie kind of took me back a little bit.  
   
 Q.   Can you touch the top of the backboard?  
JEREMY EVANS:   No, I can't.   I'm probably like a foot away.  
   
 Q.   Gordon is convinced you can jump to the moon.   
JEREMY EVANS:   Oh, yeah, I can do that.   I feel like if I had more practice I feel like I could do it.  
   
 Q.   Do you know what your vertical is?  
JEREMY EVANS:   Not really, but with a step it's like 46.
