COACH BUTTS:   Obviously it's a tough loss.   Third time playing that team this year, and they really get the best of us.   They came out and shot the ball really well the first half.   We were able to make some plays inside.   They cooled off in the second half, but so did we.   We didn't have enough punch to get it done.   
We are still well in the tournament, and for us, we have a couple of seniors that are going to be moving on and wish them well.   But outside of that, we just have to go back to the drawing board.   
   
 Q.   What was the difference tonight?   
COACH BUTTS:   Well, they just, again, you know, you're playing a team for the third time, sometimes it's difficult.   But they shot the ball really well, especially in the first half.   I think they shot 57 percent from the field, and 77 overall from the 3, and it proved to be too much for us to come back from in the second half, especially; we didn't shoot the ball especially well in the second half.   But they played a great game and again we just didn't have enough to get it done.   
   
 Q.   Can you assess the finish here?   I know you had a rough ending to the season.   Can you just talk a little bit about this?  
COACH BUTTS:   It is what you said it was.   It was a roughening‑‑ and you know, we didn't do some things well that we needed to do to win games down the stretch, and we didn't get enough production.   
I think we had to have more players step up and make plays for us, offensively and defensively.   At the end of the day, we didn't do enough, and teams were able to rebound with us and they were able to be more physical than us.   We didn't win enough 50/50 plays throughout the season.   
   
 Q.   Davellyn, you had such an unbelievable career here, how do you feel now about your performance and where do you go from here?   
DAVELLYN WHYTE:   I don't think it's really hit me that I'm done here, so I'm kind of letting it settle in.   But like Coach said, it's not over.   So I'm going to keep working out and doing what I have to do and see where it takes me.   
   
 Q.   You had Eva attached to your hip throughout the night.   What kind of problems did she present for you defensively, having an athletic point guard like her guarding you for 40 minutes, seems like it would be a difficult task for any player.   
DAVELLYN WHYTE:   In the first half, it wasn't that difficult.   I mean, I kind of forced her to do what I wanted her to do but in the second half she adjusted and knew what I wanted to do.   She's quick but I'm a little stronger than her, so I just had to use my strength and my smartness and work off her.
