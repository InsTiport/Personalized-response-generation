<p>	Q.  The shot against Nevada, the 3 against Kansas, this one, rank them. </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about Lucas.  Did you feel that was the player to go after in the final seconds there? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the layup you missed at 1:23?  Was there any kind of resolve going back in there? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you drove for the last shot, McFarlin got his hand on it, when did you feel it?  Did anything go through your mind and what when you felt that defensive pressure actually on the ball? </p>
<p>	Q.  Luke, this is one of several screen-and-rolls that you all have executed down the stretch of this season, with you being the screener.  Is that why you came from Australia? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did Tony come over to you on the court and say something to you on the court afterwards? </p>
<p>	Q.  What did he say? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about hitting the shot against Oklahoma State, a place you almost went to school, different circumstances worked out differently? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you both address the fact you're playing for the national championship on Monday? </p>

<p>	Q.  Luke, can you talk about your performance tonight, 19 points, 12 boards, the maturation of your game to the point where you had a dominant game? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said words can't describe how you feel.  Can you describe the last play from your standpoint, start to finish. </p>

<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the lip Marvin gave you early in the game, and Luke's performance, dominant in the middle of the game? </p>

<p>	Q.  Can you talk about how both teams out there probably didn't have an NBA first-round pick, this is all about team. </p>
<p>	Q.  Marvin, do you often call the last play of the game in the huddle?  What was it that you made you think that Will could bring this off? </p>

<p>	Q.  Talk about playing in the championship game on Monday.  Pretty young guy. </p>
<p>	Q.  Last couple years you guys have been a .500 team.  You lost your best player.  You had another injury.  How does a team get from there to here?  What were the things that made this team possible? </p>
<p>	Q.  You have a team that is obviously family.  You're here because you're a team, unselfish play.  You also won these games because you have one guy that will get selfish when you need someone to be selfish.  Talk about how important that contrast is. </p>
<p>	Q.  You have Schenscher, who has had a very big second half.  You have a guy like Jack who has made a lot of clutch plays during the tournament for you.  You sound like Will Bynum taking the last shot is a lock.  Tell us about your thinking of why that was a lock. </p>
<p>	Q.  If you can manage to win on Monday, you would be only the second team to win six single-digit games.  Is your heart strong enough for this? </p>
<p>	Q.  Almost identical to the Kansas game, they throw in a 3, come back.  Talk about your emotions when Lucas hits the 3.  Three out of your last seven games it's come down to the last shot.  You called a different player out of those three, Marvin, Isma'il, this time Bynum. </p>
<p>	Q.  Have you ever contemplated the irony of putting the ball in a transfer's hands, having him beat a team of transfers? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talk about all the close games this team has had this year, you're living on the edge throughout this tournament.  As this thing looks like it's starting to crumble at the end, are you seeing any kind of doubt in the eyes of your guys? </p>
