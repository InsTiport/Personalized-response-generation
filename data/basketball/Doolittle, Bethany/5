MODERATOR:   We're joined by Iowa coach Lisa Bluder and student‑athletes Samantha Logic, Kali Peschel and Bethany Doolittle.   Opening comment from Coach.  
COACH BLUDER:   Good way for us to start the tournament play.   We talked a lot about rebounding and defense and I think we did a good job in both of those categories today.   Outrebounding them.   And I thought defensively we did a really nice job.   We had some really good bench play today.   I thought Kali Peschel came in and did a great job for us.   
Claire Till, I thought she came in and got eight rebounds for us.   Also forced a couple of charges, took a couple of charges.   So that was really nice to see.   We made our free throws down the stretch.   Always good this time of year.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions for the student‑athletes.  
   
 Q.   I understand it's only the quarterfinals, but certain victories mean a little more than others.   Can you talk about the significance of this win against the opponent?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC:   Yeah, obviously Nebraska has taken us out the last three years of the Big Ten Tournament.   So you keep that in the back of your mind.   And just trying to change the tides on that.   We did that during the regular season.   And so we tried to carry that over into the tournament here just so we can keep our tournament run going.   
Obviously, though, that's a really good basketball team out there, and Coach Yori always has them ready to play.  
   
 Q.   Bethany, you get into foul trouble a little bit like you did tonight, is it hard to not want to play tentative and try to kind of keep yourself reserved or is that even something you think about?  
BETHANY DOOLITTLE:   Sometimes that can be difficult but I just try to play through it, be as physical as possible and keep my hands straight up and try to play through it as much as possible.   But it's definitely something that is in the back of your mind when you're out there, just try not to get that third foul or something like that.   But obviously it didn't really work out tonight.  
   
 Q.   Samantha, when Bethany went out with the fourth foul about nine minutes left, you guys only had like a seven‑point lead.   At that point in the game you seemed to kind of take over, made some plays on both ends of the floor, just kind of kept the team together.   Talk about what was going through your mind, what was going on in that stretch there.   
SAMANTHA LOGIC:   I don't think anything too different.   I mean, Kali and Claire came in today and just played so well when Beth had foul trouble.   We have so much confidence in them every single time they come out on the floor.   
They played some huge minutes for us.   At that point maybe you try like look for your shot a little bit more just because the size difference probably with Claire in there a little bit.   But whatever works in our offense.   It works the same whether Beth is in there or not.   It's just a little more significant to get it in the post when she is because she's such a tough matchup.   But defensively try to bring energy every single time.   I think it just happened to be at that time when she was out.  
   
 Q.   Kali, you don't take many 3s but it seems like whenever you do, all throughout the season it comes at some important time and you don't miss many.   How are you so confident in those positions?  
KALI PESCHEL:   I was coming off the bench, I know my role is to get in there play defense and get rebounds and hit that open shot.   It's always going to be usually late in the shot clock when somebody has to put a shot up.   I credit my teammates so much.   They do a great job finding me in those situations and my defenders in the paint doubling onto them.   They do a great job finding me.   It's always nice when the ball goes in the hoop.  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach.   
   
 Q.   Coach, I think they hit something like the nine of their first 11 shots.   What were you able to do after that defensively, specifically the last 10 to 15 minutes of the first half?  
COACH BLUDER:   I mean, both teams came out and shot the ball really well.   So thankfully we were shooting right there with them.   But when teams come out and shoot crazy, you gotta remind your players, too, that it's going to level off.  
I mean, statistics are there for a reason.   It's going to level off sooner or later.   I thought that we did a better job this time defending them than we did last time, especially on that flare screen in their offense.  
Again, I think the boards were huge for us.   They've outrebounded us the last two times.   So it was important for us to get those boards.  
   
 Q.   Just talking about Kali, from your perspective, how big has she been throughout the year, just seems like she has a clutch 3 every week or so.   
COACH BLUDER:   You ask that question and she said‑‑ her answer I thought she'd say, Because I shoot thousands of them all the time.   They shoot thousands of those shots.   We practice those shots over and over and over again.   It doesn't surprise me that she's confident shooting it.   She's put in the work.   And if you put in the work you should be confident and step up and make them like that.  
So I thought she did just a great job.   And obviously it was huge for us in the first half, her hitting those 3s.   
   
 Q.   I kind of stay on the same question.   But just what her play meant during that stretch.   On both ends of the floor.   It wasn't just offensively, when Beth got the fourth foul.   
COACH BLUDER:   Sam Logic is such a good player.   You don't coach that.   It's a mentality that she has.   It's between her ears.   She knows the game so well.   She always is looking ahead.   Her insight is so good.   
And I agree with you.   I think there are times‑‑ and I think this last part of the year she's taken it up another notch.   I believe she has.   She doesn't know that she has.   I think she has.   She's more confident, I feel like, or maybe she's not more confident, maybe she's more at ease in taking her shot.   Before she always wanted to distribute to everybody else.  
And I think in the last part of the season she's been using her offensive skills a little bit more.  
   
 Q.   Seems like the whole team really started to attack the rim and get aggressive after Beth went out with the foul trouble, is that something that you guys talked about before or it was something you had to adapt to the situation?  
COACH BLUDER:   We attacked the rim because they had a lot of foul trouble.   We were just trying to take advantage of that as well.  
   
 Q.   There was a period in the second half when they stripped the ball from you guys like two or three times in a row.   Did you change anything at that point.   Or just tell them to stop doing that?  
COACH BLUDER:   Told them to stop it.   It was really that.   It was really, Calm down.   We're going a little bit too fast.   I thought we had too many forced turnovers in the first half.   Our feet got happy.   We needed to calm down, slow down, I think we were getting too anxious in those situations.   And I felt we gave the ball to Sam in some awkward positions in outlets in that situation, in the second half.   
But Sam got her back to the sidelines so she could see the floor a little bit better after that.   We calmed down, I think, and took care of that.   That's the one thing I'm unhappy with is the turnovers.   For us that's a lot of turnovers.  
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, Coach.
