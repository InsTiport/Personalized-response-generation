<p>	Q.  This is for either of you.  Do you have any explanation for the horse shooting?  It seemed like a lot of the lay-ups were short.  Was there any tiredness or any explanation you have for the shooting?</p>


<p>	Q.  Cut it to four there late in the second half and they got a follow-up 3-pointer.  Was that what kind of took the wind out of the rally there?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you worry that -- you guys lost this game last year.  Do you worry that it will affect your tournament hopes?  And how do you feel in terms of get an at-large bid?</p>
<p>	Q.  Elaine, you have won eight titles in the last ten years.  Any explanation for lack of success in these league tournaments?</p>
<p>	Q.  It seemed like you were getting a lot of good looks.  Did you feel like you were getting the shots that you wanted?</p>
<p>	Q.  Elaine, could you comment on what Marsh has meant to the Lobos, from what you have seen?</p>
