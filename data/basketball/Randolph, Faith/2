Miami   62
  Virginia - 52

COACH BOYLE:   Just a lot of credit to Miami.   They've struggled here towards the end of the season, and they just came in and had a new fight about them, and I thought they came in and just played a really good game. 

Q.   Coach Meier talked about how their plan was kind of to run multiple people at Faith.   How do you think that had an effect on your offense and the way you guys weren't able to get into a flow?
COACH BOYLE:   Yeah, this last month we've really had a flow to us and that's what we talked about.   We just were so disjointed, and we didn't just have a flow offensively, and where we've been really good is if we get stops, we get into a little bit of transition and we can kind of go back and forth between running and pushing the ball in transition, calling a couple quick hitters, running a couple sets, and I just felt like we got back to where we were a month ago, it was just like walk the ball down the floor, miss a shot, just one pass, just a brokenness to us on the offensive end of the floor, and we weren't scoring, and then we spent the whole night in transition defense against a really, really athletic team. 

Q.   Joanne, this was kind of a‑‑ this season in general was sort of an almost season.   You had a young team for the most part, and there are a lot of games where you were close, and you're probably not going to get into the NCAAs this year, but kind of reflect on the season in general, and have you and the team talked about a potential WNIT bid and if you will accept it? 
COACH BOYLE:   Well, we will accept it, but we try and focus on what's at hand.   Midway through the season we kind of gave them a realistic shot in the arm and said this is what we're going to have to do to get there, so we were very real with them.   It wasn't any kind of hidden agenda, so they knew what we had to do, and I was proud of how we approached all those games, in particular those last four games and put ourselves in position to have a great win against Louisville and try to come in here with a clean slate and just continue that great basketball, but we definitely took a step backwards tonight.   This is not the team that we've been these last four weeks. 
So yes, everybody is back and we have great kids coming in and all that, but it's disappointing because like you said, this is an almost team, and as coaches you just want it for them.   You really do.   You want it for them, and just to fall short, it just‑‑ it's just a hard lesson, you know. 

Q.   Joanne, Sarah played 22 minutes.   You took her out after the second foul in the first half.   Was there any reason in the second half that she wasn't effective or that she played those kind of minutes? 
COACH BOYLE:   We were just trying to find a rhythm, you know.   Really as the flow of the game goes, we were just trying to make substitutions accordingly, so I don't think there was a rhyme or reason.   It was just what's‑‑ that's the worst feeling as a coach, be like, well, try this, try that.   We just were not in a flow.   That just hurt us.   I don't think there was any particular reason why she was‑‑ it was just 22 minutes. 

Q.   Faith, rare that you have this off of a day.   Was it something that more they did or you weren't hitting shots, couldn't get into that flow as you talked about with the offense?   What do you think was maybe the reason for some struggles today? 
FAITH RANDOLPH:   I think it just goes back to the flow.   I didn't feel like we had a rhythm at all throughout the game, and I thought we were just constantly trying to figure it out. 

Q.   Mikayla, there's been times when Faith and SI haven't been at their average.   Sometimes you've been able to take over and shoulder the load a little bit.   How frustrating was it today to not be able to have that and maybe kind of fill in when the other two weren't doing as well?
MIKAYLA VENSON:   It was just upsetting knowing that we couldn't really get into a flow.   We were constantly trying to find it.   But Miami was playing good on us, playing good defense, and we were just fighting to find a flow and it never really came to us. 

Q.   Joanne, you were up 40‑39, I think, with about 13 minutes left.   What do you think happened at that point?   I know the next bucket for them was one of those three‑pointers from the wing that they hadn't been hitting and they hit some down the stretch. 
COACH BOYLE:   We went back and forth a little bit between the 2‑3 and our man defense, and we kept helping up on the strong side, where we know our help side comes from the weak side.   So we pulled ourselves off of that strong side guard twice, and they hit both of those threes, and we came out of the 2‑3 because we were not slotting well in it at all, so I think that hurt us a little bit. 
That hurt us, and then we turned the ball over once or twice at the top of the key, they got a quick two or four points I think it was, and then the momentum shifted. 

Q.   Faith, just overall kind of how frustrating is this because you guys have been playing so well here the last two, three weeks, got a big win obviously on Sunday, to not come in here and have the same effort.   Kind of describe the level of frustration right now. 
FAITH RANDOLPH:   Yeah, like it was said, I felt like we've had some ups and downs throughout the season.   Just really want to find that consistency.
