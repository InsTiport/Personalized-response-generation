  JAMES JONES:   We have a very competitive field, and Mario Chalmers, one of my teammates, who's like a brother to me, is in it.   So that will make it difficult because it's one of those things where I want to beat the competition, but at the same time I want Mario to do well.

Q.   Who do you think are the top threeâ€‘point shooters of all time that have participated in this event?
JAMES JONES:   I'd say Larry Bird, I want to say Craig Hodges, and I think Peja Stojakovic.

Q.   What's it like going up against Mario? 
JAMES JONES:   Man, it's going to be fun.   This is a day for NBA fans to get a chance to watch us compete and in a different setting, where we can all smile a little bit and give each other pointers and really just try to compete to win a prize, a trophy, that will solidify you in history as one of the game's great shooters.

Q.   Is the team divided over who they're going for?
JAMES JONES:   I think our team is impartial.   As long as one of our guys turns out victorious, I think we'll all be happy, and that's the way it should be because we're all a family, and that's the only way we know how to play.
