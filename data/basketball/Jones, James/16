  Q. Talk about being a veteran in this event and not having to have the midnight shooting session; being one of the more accurate shooters in the game, do you feel like you want to win?  
 JAMES JONES: As close as you get to it, you start to get that itch; but at the same time, you have to really do what got you here. So for me, I would love to have the opportunity, because I shoot every day. I would love to have the opportunity to go and shoot off the rack every day.  
 But with all of the things we are doing, all of those things, it's kind of tough to squeeze it in. And also, you want to be a fan and a spectator of all of the rest of the events, the Rookie Sophomore Challenge, the celebrity games, stuff like that.  
 It's tough to do what you do, which is go to the gym and stay there for three or four hours.   
  
  Q. What are you expecting tomorrow, Hollywood, STAPLES Center, going to be packed, Saturday night in many ways trumps even some of the games.   
 JAMES JONES: To be here and soak it in and have the opportunity to do what I love doing in front of not just the fans in the STAPLES Center, but the globe, really.   
 So more than anything, I play with a fantastic team and tremendous stars, but for a brief minute or 60 seconds, as long as it takes me to get the ball off the rack, the world's eyes will be on me.  
  
  Q. Your All-Star teammates, have they talked about being there courtside?   
 JAMES JONES: You know, those guys, they love the game and we are like brothers down there. I know they will be cheering me on. I can't really take very much pointers from them since they are not great three-point shooters. I know they are with me in spirit.
