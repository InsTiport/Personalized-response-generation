 THE MODERATOR:   We are now joined by Ole Miss Mimi Reid.  Questions, please.
 Q. Obviously that was a tough one to swallow at the end.  What was the message from the coaching staff in the locker room?
 MIMI REID:   The message was simply we have to grow, we have to be better.  We got more basketball to play, so it's a learning experience.  We're going to take this to whatever postseason we have.  Simply we got to grow.  We got to go back to the film, back to the drawing board, and keep getting better as a team.
 Q. In what areas do you think you guys need to grow?
 MIMI REID:   Rebounding and our toughness.
 Q. Do you think you guys belong in the NCAA tournament?
 MIMI REID:   I couldn't hear your question.  I'm sorry.
 Q. Do you guys think you belong in the NCAA tournament?
 MIMI REID:   Yes, we believe we belong in the NCAA tournament.  We compete with these teams night in and night out.  We continuously show what we bring to the table.  We can compete with any team in the country.
 THE MODERATOR:   Thank you for joining us tonight.
 MIMI REID:   Thank you.
