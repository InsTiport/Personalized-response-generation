<p>	Q.  Kim, what was it from your perspective that was allowing Air Force to do so well in that rebounding battle, particularly in the first half?</p>
<p>	Q.  Either one of you, can you talk about how difficult it is to play a team you've beaten twice already this year and trying to get up for the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  For either of you, the three-point shooting was so strong and high percentage.  I'm just wondering, maybe Kim in particular, how many threes you'll put up in a practice or after practice or in a pre-game?</p>

<p>	Q.  How much if at all are you really gearing toward hoping to meet New Mexico again in that championship game?  Do you think that far?</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you need to improve on for the next game over what you did tonight because you'll have a much better opponent, whoever it is?</p>
