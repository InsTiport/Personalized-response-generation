THE MODERATOR:   We have Coach Chris Mooney, players Cedrick Lindsay and Darien Brothers.   Questions for the players, please.   
COACH MOONEY:   I'm disappointed, obviously, how the game turned out.   Certainly wish the ending hadn't been the way it was for me personally.   I apologize to the Richmond fans and wish Charlotte luck in the next round.  
   
 Q.   How did it feel going in and throughout?  
DARIEN BROTHERS:   I made shots.   I just tried not to let it affect me.   I played pretty well with it.  
   
 Q.   Darien, Cedrick (No Microphone)?  
DARIEN BROTHERS:   It hurts a lot.   The game was there for us to win.   You know, it was a silly foul at the end that caused them to win the game.   So it definitely hurts.  
   
 Q.   Coach, what did you see on the free throw play, and what did the officials describe to you as what happened, why it was a technical?   
COACH MOONEY:   You know, I didn't necessarily see it.   I know they explained to me that Derrick had shoved their player and that's why they called the dead ball technical foul.  
   
 Q.   Cedrick, second half they got you inside a little bit scoringwise.   Got some easy baskets.   Why did that happen in the second half?   Didn't seem to be much of a problem in the first half.  
CEDRICK LINDSAY:   It's a big game, and that is kind of the MO is to throw the ball inside and score.   They came out and did a better job than us in the second half.  
   
 Q.   Darien, can you talk about Charlotte on the rebounding today?   They just really had their way with you guys.   What was different this time than the last game you got against them?   
DARIEN BROTHERS:   They just came out in the second half more aggressive to go after the ball.   We got a little mixed up on defense with our communication, and they continued to pound the ball inside, so they definitely took advantage of that.  
   
 Q.   Have either of you guys spoken to Derrick?   What's he like in the locker room right now?   
DARIEN BROTHERS:   Can't say I have spoken to him yet.   It's a tough play.   I think everybody's hurt, so I don't know.   
CEDRICK LINDSAY:   Same thing.  
   
 Q.   Darien, did you do anything different to shut down the threes in the second half because you didn't have as many as a team than you did in the first half?   
DARIEN BROTHERS:   Not at all.   We could offensively get whatever we wanted, but we tried to get it inside as much as possible, and we did that.   But it definitely we couldn't get wherever we wanted, like I said.   
   
 Q.   Cedrick, can you tell us what you saw on that technical foul there at the end?   
CEDRICK LINDSAY:   I'm not really sure yet.   I was more concentrated on getting us ready to get the inbounds.   I saw the ball go in, and I just saw Clayton called, and I looked at the ref, and he called the technical.   It was like automatic.  
   
 Q.   Cedrick, I can't remember if the foul call was called on you.   I think they called it a shooting foul from half court.   Were you surprised at that call?   
CEDRICK LINDSAY:   Well, I think they called the foul on Greg, and I fouled him when he first got the ball inbounds.   He took a dribble and ran into Greg, and they called the foul on Greg.   We were definitely more surprised.   They called a shooting foul for three shots right after that call.  
   
 Q.   Is it your understanding it was called a technical as opposed to a regular or flagrant one because it was a dead ball?   Is that why it's a technical in that situation?  
COACH MOONEY:   I don't really know.   I don't know what the rule is.   
   
 Q.   Coach, it seemed like the officials had the game in control up to that moment?   When it all happened, it seemed like the entire arena was confused and this was all happening at once, and no one was really quite sure what was happening and why it was, and that was obviously punctuated by your confusion.   
COACH MOONEY:   Yeah, I think so.   At that point in the game we wanted to foul so they couldn't make a game‑time three.   We thought we executed that well, and we wanted to see what was going to happen in the second shot.   I think the game was officiated ‑‑ they're a good offensive rebounding team, a physical team.   But we certainly had opportunities and should have closed out the game.  
   
 Q.   That last foul on Henry that was called a shooting foul, was that what was so frustrating and caused the bench to‑‑ what happened there?   
COACH MOONEY:   The bench meaning me?   Yeah, I was confused by that call.   I thought we had fouled them and the ball was on the ground.  
   
 Q.   Does Richmond have any recourse here?   Is there any action the University takes in protest?   
COACH MOONEY:   I don't think so.   I don't know if that's the case.  
   
 Q.   Coach, can you just kind of put into words your shock value right now?   Because it's not something you see every day on the basketball court.   
COACH MOONEY:   Yeah, I am shocked.   I don't think we played great, but I certainly think we did some good things.   We had three turnovers in the whole game.   I felt, while we didn't rebound well, we defended okay.   It put us in a chance to win the game up three with 4 seconds to go.   
So it's a pretty devastating way to lose the game, and I feel bad for our players and for our fans because I really thought we put ourselves in position to win the game.  
   
 Q.   Chris, can you ever recall being as upset or as angry in your career as you were in those last 4.7 seconds?   And also, was this a game that sort of could have been a nice victory to use as a learning experience?   Because, as you said, you did some good things, but there were some things that seemed uncharacteristic of your play.   
COACH MOONEY:   Yeah, I'll answer the second one first.   I thought it would have been a really nice win.   I thought Charlotte had a great win on this past Saturday where we felt they needed to win and they did.   I thought they came out with a lot of energy.   I thought we played well enough to win.   
It would have been great to advance and be able to play Saint Louis.   I was upset and probably too upset.   So, again, I apologize.   I wish it wouldn't have happened like that.   I can't take it back right now, but I certainly wish I could, and I wish the whole last four and a half seconds would have been a little bit different.  
   
 Q.   Coach, for clarification, they told you what was the technical foul on Derrick?   
COACH MOONEY:   Because it was the push that Derrick‑‑ when Derrick pushed their player, I guess it was a dead ball because the free throw hadn't gone in, so that's why it was ruled a dead‑ball technical.   I don't know enough about‑‑ sometimes now they shoot the technical and resume play with the live foul shot.   I don't know if because it's a dead ball, you don't do that.  
   
 Q.   Chris, as you look ahead, do you think this is a team that wants to keep on playing in a postseason tournament of some sort?   
COACH MOONEY:   Absolutely, yes.  
   
 Q.   Because of the youth of the team or because of other reasons?  
COACH MOONEY:   Yeah, I think partly because of the youth, partly because we have good energy and good basketball left.   But I think we owe it to Darien and Greg to go somewhere and try to advance.  
   
 Q.   Speak to Terry's performance today.   It was a really breakout game for a freshman.   
COACH MOONEY:   Yeah, Terry was great.   The last games he's been terrific.   I think he's going to be a great player.   He's our best rebounder, which doesn't say a whole lot, but he's our best rebounder and a physical player that can do a lot of things.   He's very versatile, and I think he's going to be a great player.  
   
 Q.   I know it's probably difficult to talk to Derrick about what happened, but have you spoken to him?   And if you haven't, will you, and what will you say?   
COACH MOONEY:   I'll definitely talk to him.   I think that it's tough.   Basketball's a hard game.   It's very physical.   There is a lot of positioning and things that happen during the course of the game, and you kind of have to make sure that recognizing the time and score of the game that we can't have anything happen like that.   
He's a great young player for us.   He's a really good kid who has done a lot of good things for us.   It's disappointing.   I'm sure, it's most disappointing for him that this would happen and kind of the game to turn out that way because of what happened.
