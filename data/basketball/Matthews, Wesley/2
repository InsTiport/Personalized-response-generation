   WESLEY MATTHEWS: We are playing together and playing hard and playing tougher, that's the big thing.   
  
  Q. With Brandon injured, has there been improvement?  
 WESLEY MATTHEWS: I think our chemistry has gotten better, because the guys that are injured still remain part of the team. They are not isolating themselves and worrying about themselves. They are doing their rehab and their treatment and they are still with us.  
  
  Q. How do you feel about all of these injuries that the team is having?   
 WESLEY MATTHEWS: It's crazy. It's crazy. But as professionals we have to keep going and we have to play.   
  
  Q. Do you have a chip on your shoulder?  
 WESLEY MATTHEWS: I've always got a chip on my shoulder. I think every successful person, whether they are sports or anything, they have a chip on their shoulder because they want to be great, and not that they are trying to prove anybody wrong or anybody right, but they have got that fire to be great.   
  
  Q. Four games behind Oklahoma City; do you expect to make a run in the second half?  
 WESLEY MATTHEWS: Hope so. We started off a good way going into the break, six in a row, and then we are at home against the Lakers and enjoy the break and get right back at it.
