JOSH HUESTIS: Yeah, I'm really excited.  I've been working really hard this off-season trying to prepare my body for a long season, and you know, to be able to be somebody that can contribute every single day, somebody consistent, and just help the team win.
Q. Did it help playing in Summer League for the first time, to actually get in and get some time there?
JOSH HUESTIS: Absolutely.  Any chance I have to step on the court and play a little bit and work on my game is always welcome, always exciting, so that was great.  Helped me see things in my game that I could continue to work on.
Q. You're known as a versatile defensive guy.  Over the summer, did you focus on any other skill, any other skill sets to kind of bring to the roster going forward?
JOSH HUESTIS: Yeah, obviously defense is my baseline, my staple, but then working on my shot, trying to become a more consistent shooter, being somebody that can knock down an open shot for the team and working on ball handling and driving it to the basket and getting my athleticism involved in the game a bit more.
