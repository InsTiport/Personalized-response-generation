<p>	Q.  What kind of challenges are you facing with the schedule? </p>
<p>	Q.  Almost give you advantage because you will see your opponents have already played by the time they come to you they won't have any film to review?</p>
<p>	Q.  I think everybody knows you stepped into a difficult situation.  What have the first two years been like and where do you think you are at right now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you all address -- of course you don't know what it will be like during the nonconference season, can you address maybe some of your trepidations, concerns about what that might be like and also the possibility that then you can turn it -- sweep through the Big 12 undefeated and force the N.C.A. to take you in their tournament?</p>


<p>	Q.  The second part of that as far as what you can do in the Big 12, allow yourself to dream? </p>
<p>	Q.  Generally if you practice, practice, practice it could be monotonous.  Any plans to break up the monotony?</p>
<p>	Q.  Kind of unprecedented thing you are dealing with.  How did you go about the process of figuring out just what you were going to do at least next three months?</p>
<p>	Q.  When coaches yesterday were asked what they would do under your circumstances, they really didn't have an answer.  They figured it would be a bigger nightmare for the players than the coach?</p>
<p>	Q.  In your creative way to prepare for this, is there any way to play -- I am just wondering, any way to play a game that's outside an intrasquad situation that would be in N.C.A.A. guidelines, stage a game against another --</p>
<p>	Q.  It sounds like this is not going to be a bunker (sic) mentality, your players probably won't have to deal with a lot of press for a long time.  Is that a good thing?  Is that something you are not going to have a media day for scrimmage, are you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Not going to shut the team down?</p>
<p>	Q.  Getting to on-court matters, talk about some of the new guys, how you think they are going to have an impact, especially the guards?</p>








<p>	Q.  A lot of players in the Big 12 were really impressed with you last year.  What were your impressions of your first year in American ball? </p>
