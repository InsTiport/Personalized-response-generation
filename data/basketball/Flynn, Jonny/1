		   JONNY FLYNN: Just to be here and be a part of this is definitely a great feeling. 

 Q. You're not worried about Patrick Ewing being a coach on the other side?
 JONNY FLYNN: Not at all. 

 Q. How do you like this NBA lifestyle?
 JONNY FLYNN: I love it. This is great. It's what you always wanted to be when you was younger. You're at the playground playing outside, you always wanted to be in the NBA. To finally be here and finally be at All-Star weekend is definitely a dream come true.

 Q. You had your teammate Kevin Love on the jump the other day (Inaudible). 
 JONNY FLYNN: He told me that, too, and I said, where do you get that from? How do you come up with that? That's a big number. That just motivates us to come out there and beat them. We're going to really try to go out there and win this game.
