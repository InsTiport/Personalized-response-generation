<p>	Q. Just talk about your thoughts coming into tomorrow's game.  You're up 2-1, you guys can clinch it at home.  You got to be feeling pretty confident, I would think?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there a little sense of urgency, maybe, knowing that if you lose tomorrow that you go back to their house and they're pretty tough there?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are you at all surprised at how well Yolanda is playing?  I mean it looks like she's got this fire in her eyes. </p>
<p>	Q.  The crowd was pretty crazy last night, what do you anticipate for Game 4?</p>
