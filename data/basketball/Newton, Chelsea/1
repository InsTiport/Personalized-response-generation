Q. Just talk about your thoughts coming into tomorrow's game.  You're up 2-1, you guys can clinch it at home.  You got to be feeling pretty confident, I would think?
 
CHELSEA NEWTON:  We're feeling confident but you still have to be careful because of course they have a great team, they didn't win the East for nothing.  They didn't have the best record in the league for nothing either.  They're a great team.  We know they're going to come out tomorrow and probably play their best game of the series.  And we just have to be he ready for that, be prepared.  We're at home, but home doesn't mean anything.  We beat them 1-1 on their court.  They could definitely come here and play their best game and beat us.  So we just have to be aware of that and be ready to play. 
 
Q.  Is there a little sense of urgency, maybe, knowing that if you lose tomorrow that you go back to their house and they're pretty tough there?
 
CHELSEA NEWTON:  Of course.  Every game is extremely important to us.  It's very important to us.  And even if we were up 2-0, 2-1, it didn't matter, every game was important.  We're at home and we need to take advantage of that. 
 
Q.  Are you at all surprised at how well Yolanda is playing?  I mean it looks like she's got this fire in her eyes. 
 
CHELSEA NEWTON:  Oh, not at all I know Yo wants this so bad and she's a great player.  And great players just don't let an opportunity like this slip by.  You could see it in the way she's playing, you could see it in her eyes, that she wants this championship pretty bad. 
 
Q.  The crowd was pretty crazy last night, what do you anticipate for Game 4?
 
CHELSEA NEWTON:  Probably even louder.  Yeah, it was a crazy crowd.  Great fans.  That's why they're the sixth man, the Sixth Man of the Year.  So I'm expecting a big crowd.
