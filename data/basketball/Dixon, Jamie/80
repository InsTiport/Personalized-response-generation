<p>	Q. Rebounding obviously turned in the second half, what were they doing differently or what were you guys not doing after dominating the boards in the first half? </p>
<p>	Q. Jaron, you had a three-pointer that made the score 50-47 and they were up by three.  After that there was a wild possession especially where Chevy got whistled for a travel, if you guys had gotten away with rebounding that ball and bringing it back the other way, did you think things might have been different?  Seemed like you had momentum going at that point?</p>
<p>	Q. How tough was it for you to get in the flow of the game with those two quick whistles that put you on the bench and you didn't get to play much in the first half? </p>
<p>	Q. How did you two feel about your play in the first half as a team, you guys outrebounded them, you were not shooting too well but you're playing strong defense.  How did you look at the game at halftime? </p>
<p>	Q. You said you were going to leave it all on the floor, did you do that and does this loss, do you accept this one any differently than the last two years? </p>
<p>	Q. Julius and Jaron, quick comment on your career at Pitt coming to an end. </p>

<p>	Q. What kind of problem did it cause for you to not have Jaron for as much time as you didn't have him in the first half? </p>
<p>	Q. I think it was about six minutes left when you guys got to the bonus, Carl missed a one-on-one and didn't get to the line again, they had some guys in foul trouble, you were not getting penetration that you wanted because of something they did?</p>
<p>	Q. Carl just tried to put a lot of himself for not getting the ball down to the big guys and maybe putting too much of the offense on his shoulders as the post-season went along, is that something that you saw as well from your advantage point? </p>
<p>	Q. Is that the most difficult team to guard that you guys have faced all year?  Is it seemed like they got to the basket more than most teams do?</p>
<p>	Q. Coach Sutton sensed that you might be getting fatigued the second half; did you sense that? </p>
