<p>	Q.  When you made that run at the end of the first half to take control of the game, what was working for you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Julius, can you talk about hitting a few shots today, the feeling of getting a 14-point game, what you were thinking? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, it looked like you came out at the beginning of the second half on fire as well.  What did you tell the kids in the locker room?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jamie, could you maybe compare and contrast the potential matchup in the semifinals. </p>
<p>	Q.  Jaron, you guys think the inside was there for you all game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Julius, you guys have been so good at going game by game this year.  How do you keep focused on this and not even looking beyond to where you want to go? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jaron, how big was it when you got Matthews out of the game, when he had he fouled out with seven minutes to go? </p>
<p>	Q.  What were you thinking when he tried the pass to himself? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jamie, you tried a lot of lobs inside.  Is that something you can exploit there? </p>
