JAMIE DIXON: We're looking forward to this season. Obviously we don't have a lot of guys returning. Two very good players returning in Desmond Bane and Kevin Samuel. After that, we don't have much. Obviously we're not picked very high. I've seen is 8, 9, 10 out of 10. That's to be expected when you return so few guys.   
I'm excited about our guys. We've had a great summer, best summer I've ever had as far as TCU as far as practice, working out, growth, development, improvement. We're excited about the new guys. Nine new players, which is a lot even in today's game.   
But at the same time the league is wide open. So many teams are bringing in about the same amount of new players. It's just the way of college basketball.   
We are excited about this group. They've worked hard. Great leadership from the two guys today, Desmond Bane, the senior, and Kevin, who is really a third-year sophomore for us.   
I'm excited about what we can become because of those two guys, not only as players but as leaders. So that's where I think our growth will be.   
 Q.  You've talked about movement before. How much do you have to adapt in today's game with so many guys coming and going?  
JAMIE DIXON: I mean, it is what it is. I've embraced it. We're going to have transfers. When you make it easier, the rules, the grad transfers, the waivers, it's got everybody talking about every kid transfers thinking they're going to be eligible right away. That's how guys are being recruited, kids are being moved. AAU guys, you'll be eligible right away.   
It is the environment. There's no surprises by it. You work with it and adapt, as I've done throughout my career in the different spots.   
Good or bad, it is what it is. You just got to find the right guys in the right place. I think we're in a good spot for that because of our location. We're excited about our newcomers that we have. Some are transfers, some are high school guys. We're really excited about them and their growth.   
 Q.  Is there a freshman that stands out so far to you that's taken your system, adapted really well, been a key for you to lean on?  
JAMIE DIXON: Yeah, I mean, we signed three guys early that we were really excited about when we signed them. I think the one guy, if I have to name -- because we have five high school guys coming in, high school freshmen, with three transfers, I guess -- four, actually.   
So the one that's probably been the biggest surprise, I guess you can say, we knew he was going to be good, but is Diante Smith. He's probably more so physical, he's tougher, better feel, a little bit more versatile than maybe I thought. I knew he was very talented, but really understands the game, has a real good demeanor at the same time.   
He's got the ability to be a little bit more physical than I would have anticipated. He's gotten bigger, stronger in the short time he's been there. He got there in June. I think he's probably been the biggest surprise. Nine newcomers. Got a long list to pick from.   
Excited about him. Always was. But he'll be ready to play for us this year.   
 Q.  Francisco, how has his growth been, in bringing in an international guy, his background? Do you feel that suits your system style well?  
JAMIE DIXON: We're excited about him. The interesting thing about him, he's international, Argentina, seems like all the different adjustments he's going to make. He played in the NBA Academy. He's played a lot of international basketball. He went to Australia for the International Academy.   
His English, I was concerned about that, but that's not an issue, given that he's been in Australia the last year and a half. Then he grew up in Italy, too. His dad played on the national team in Argentina with Manu Ginobili. The guy has been around high-level basketball since he was born, has played in it as well.   
He's a true point. So he's a good, heady player. He's getting better. He's got to get stronger, quicker, all those things. But he's working, and we're excited about him.
