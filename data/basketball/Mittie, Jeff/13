KANSAS   83
  TCU - 61

Q.   Playing the team three times in a row especially twice back‑to‑back, do you think that was a disadvantage for y'all or an advantage or how do you think that that played into the scheme of this game? 
COACH MITTIE:   I don't think it favored either team really.   I think the game takes on its own game, and we played them‑‑ obviously you play them within three days‑‑ I think today our issues were we really struggled on and off the dribble.   We really struggled inside, both Gardener and Davis had very, very productive games, and they have an advantage there, and I thought they played very well. 
So we struggled with our discipline defensively.   We got very spread defensively but they also had some players up there level of play.   I thought Hawkins played good again.   I thought Asia Boyd played good again‑‑ not again but Asia, she played very well tonight.   Gardener, who did not play very well on Tuesday night had a monster game tonight.   So they got a lot of production from a lot of people tonight. 

Q.   What would you equate to why you weren't hitting it tonight, do you think maybe stadium had something to do with it or nerves, or what do you think caused the real low shooting percentage?
COACH MITTIE:   I thought our shot selection was poor.   I thought we made strides in the last three weeks over our shot selection and I think tonight, if there's anything, the atmosphere gets you a little   up and you've got to settle into it and we didn't do a very good job of that tonight. 
But we've been a 33 percent shooting team all year.   We shot 32 and a half tonight.   We've been a bad‑‑ we've been a poor, efficient offensive team all year (chuckling) okay.   We have not been a very efficient offensive team all year. 
So it's not like these numbers are abnormal.   That's an average.   We have scored it better against Kansas.   We shot over 40 percent both halves at Kansas, hit ten 3s.   I just didn't like our flow tonight.   I thought we were very one‑on‑one tonight, very much one‑on‑one. 

Q.   Inaudible. 
COACH MITTIE:   If I knew, I would have told them before you.
