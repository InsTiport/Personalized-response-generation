 Q.  What's the biggest thing for you?  
BAM ADEBAYO: We're winning. We're top in the East, and I feel like that's a big part of why I'm here. And my success. I feel like I've made great strides in this league, and it's a good season right now.   
 Q.  What can you tell us about the season Jimmy is having? Can you talk a little about the chemistry?  
BAM ADEBAYO: It started in the summer. It's building habits. Jimmy is one of those guys. He wants to hold people to a higher standard. Our organization wants to hold people to a higher standard. So it just made it all sync together. Everybody doesn't take anything personal when somebody gets on them. It's all love at the end of the day.   
 Q.  Talk about just what Pascal Siakam has done to elevate his game this season.  
BAM ADEBAYO: He's playing incredible basketball right now. That's the enemy right now, so I can't give him too much love. But at the end of the day, he's my brother. He just really locked in this summer. I was with him for about 2 1/2 weeks. We were talking. He was really locked in to what he had to get accomplished.
