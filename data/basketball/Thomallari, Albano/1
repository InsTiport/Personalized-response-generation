Albano Thomallari was selected by Celtics Crossover Gaming with the No. 2 overall pick in the 2018 NBA 2K League Draft. His gamer tag is oFAB.   
 Q.  Can you just talk about the moment you heard your name being called?  
ALBANO THOMALLARI: I was shocked.  I don't usually get nervous, but my hands started sweating.  It was just a crazy, great feeling.   
 Q.  You're moving to Boston.  What do you think?  Where are you coming from, and what do you think about Boston?  
ALBANO THOMALLARI: I'm from St. Louis and I love Boston. Jayson Tatum is from St. Louis, too.  It creates a good little storyline.   
I love Boston.   
 Q.  Do you know where you're going to live in Boston?  Do you have place picked out yet?  
ALBANO THOMALLARI: I don't know that yet.   
 Q.  Let me ask you one more question.  Dimez was the first pick.  Did you think there was a chance you would go No. 1?  
ALBANO THOMALLARI: I think talent-wise I should have been No. 1, but Dimez deserved it and he earned it.   
But I did have that thought.   
 Q.  Do you think you guys might be able to create kind of a little rivalry?  
ALBANO THOMALLARI: Oh, yeah.  We've been going at it since we were kids.  We were both 12, played together, and now we're 1 and 2.  It's a great storyline.   
 Q.  Is it your first time to see so many people in front of you?  Usually you're facing a computer screen.  Is it the first time you're seeing all those people cheer for you?  
ALBANO THOMALLARI: Yeah, that's one of the first times.  It was a great feeling.  I'll never forget it.  It's a great feeling.   
 Q.  Part of being a star in the NBA or any sports league isn't just the games but commercials, TV appearances, being comfortable in crowds.  Tell me about that next part of this next step.  You ready for that?  
ALBANO THOMALLARI: Yeah, I'm ready.  It'll just take some getting used to, but I'm ready and ready for the spotlight.   
 Q.  Dimez said he plays about 16 hours a day.  What do you think you're playing?  
ALBANO THOMALLARI: Probably the same right there with him, 16 hours.   
 Q.  It's amazing.  
ALBANO THOMALLARI: Yeah.   
 Q.  Is it more physical or more mental?  
ALBANO THOMALLARI: Both.  I used to actually be in shape and I gained some weight just non-stop playing, so it's both.
