<p>QUESTION &amp; ANSWER SESSION</p>
<p>	Q.  Over the past 50 years the ACC has developed great rivalries in all sports and especially in the triangle.  What steps will be taken to ensure that these rivalries continue while building new rivalries at the same time? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jim, on May 16 the League decided to pursue three other schools.  At that time did you think you guys were out of the running and describe your emotions the night, I assume Dr. Steger called and said you guys were in.  How did you feel? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mr.  Dee, when we all left Ponte Vedre on May 20 what would you say the percentage was that you'd end up in a conference whether it be this one or the BIG EAST with Virginia Tech? </p>
<p>	Q.  Commissioner, you have said you are very pleased with the outcome of this process in terms of where the presidents ended up.  Procedurally if you had to do this over again and maybe next year you will have to do it over again, are there some things that you would do differently?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you share with us one or two thoughts that you had specifically what you might do differently and could you enlighten us on what it's like to be on a conference call with this many people for this long?</p>

<p>	Q.  Commissioner, just wanted to ask if you could go over a little bit of your plan for the format for the League.  You mentioned using the Big-10 as a model if it's 11.  Can you talk about if you are allowed to have a Championship game eventually with 11, whether you divide into divisions at that point and if you could just discuss some of those scenarios.</p>
<p>	Q.  Dr. Clough, my understanding, correct me if I am wrong, you are on the Board of Directors of the 18 person group that will make the determination whether to change the bylaw that allows 10 or 11  -- can you talk about that, would you be, I mean, what do you think the chances of that happening are and the process?</p>
<p>	Q.  While I understand this is a night of celebration to welcome two new members, there has been a lot of talk about the perception of the ACC the way things have been handled, the way things have gone down throughout this whole process.  Fence mending has been a phrase that has been thrown about and a lot.  What steps would you want to take at this point to repair that reputation and also if someone could identify the members of the Council of Presidents that  are here tonight. </p>
<p>	Q.  Dr. Shalala talked about maybe going to 12 teams at some point; that there was some assurance.  Could you explain what that assurance is and what a timetable would be?</p>

<p>	Q.  Commissioner, if the legislation doesn't change and it stays with 11 and you don't have a Conference Championship, how do you plan to raise the revenues to allow all the 11 schools to get to reep the kind of financial rewards that the nine schools were receiving in the ACC?</p>
<p>	Q.  President Clough, can you tell me did you presidents vote on these two schools as a group or one each and what was the tally? </p>
<p>	Q.  Commissioner, what was the vote tally of these two schools? </p>
<p>	Q.  Commissioner, now that Miami and Virginia Tech are in the League and a lot has been said about renegotiating the television contract for football, how much leverage do you expect to take to the negotiating table with them on board?</p>
<p>	Q.  What again is the entry fee for the schools and has any sort of payment schedule been set up?</p>
<p>	Q.  Dr. Clough, just wondering what might drive the push for 12 team what factor or factors? </p>
<p>	Q.  With the two schools joining the League in 2004 would  each of you describe the process you will be going through retooling your football schedule and how soon do you see your schools having enough games to compete for the Championship? </p>

<p>	Q.  You think maybe by 2004 each of you will be able to play 8 games against ACC schools. </p>

<p>	Q.  Commissioner, can you talk about your level of apprehension this weekend waiting for the Miami vote after it was delayed, the latter part of last week and Paul, can you talk a little bit about the balancing act that you had to go through President Shalala I think said yesterday that the BIG EAST was desperate to keep you and the ACC was desperate to have you.  Talk a little bit about that process through the weekend.</p>



<p>	Q.  Paul, USC travelled down to open your new basketball facility to play there.  Go into a little detail about what that facility means for your basketball program and what it going to bring to the table of the ACC and direct of your basketball program?</p>

<p>	Q.  Commissioner, had you spoken about trying to keep a long the natural rivalries alive.  Speak to the addition of that what are maybe of the biggest headaches as far as scheduling and  -- (inaudible)  ---</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you constitute the BCS League, there's some question whether the BIG EAST is one  ---</p>
<p>	Q.  When it comes to times to decide this is it too simplistic to say that the BCS commissioners to owe the BIG EAST one or is it still a product of the market place and the Bowls and ABC and everything else?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) if we went through 12 we would have a great conference, if we went to nine we would have a great conference.  Now you have got 11, but where does the basic appeal come from to make a  -- (inaudible) the group has been quoted extensively in numerous newspapers talking about the only thing that works is 12.  It's very difficult for me to understand where all these 12 are coming from and how the mega conferences is the only way to go?</p>
<p>	Q.  Commissioner, now with basketball players down in South Florida, now in Virginia can you go -- have you thought about all the locations for the athletics coast tournaments in the future about the spots about   --</p>
<p>	Q.  To try to maintain the rivalries that you have within a 16 games basketball schedule would it be possible to do as they do in the Big-10 have some non-conference ACC teams playing some non-conference games and also if it takes  -- if it took 7 votes to get something done with nine, with 11, how many votes does it take to get something done now?</p>
<p>	Q.  For expansion?</p>
<p>	Q.  Yes.</p>
<p>	Q.  Possible non-conference getting  --</p>



<p>	Q.  So much has been made about football.  We were left with the impression that some of the basketball players felt that they have not been considered enough particularly the importance that basketball has played in this League through the years.  Could you address that?</p>
<p>	Q.  When this all began two months ago there was very little talk of geographic footprint.  Whether it worked out that way by playing or not, there's some talk about it now, did you learn anything by that and if and when you go to 12 will geographic footprint have a much larger role in determining what happens?</p>
