 Q.  Talk about what your bench can do better in Game 2?  
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA: Yeah, we need to perform a lot better as a group and give the team the boost that we have been throughout the Playoffs.  Their bench came in, did a really good job changing the tempo of the game at both ends. We need to do a few different things on offense and then keep them out of transition.   
 Q.  Do you think the incident with you and Iguodala got blown out of proportion, or just a basic basketball play?  
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA: I mean, I was trying to stop the break.  It looked like they were going two for one in transition which is when they're most dangerous.  So, yeah, I was just trying to stop the break.   
 Q.  Would you say you were a little reckless maybe?  Some people say you intended to do it.  Other people say no, he didn't.  How would you explain it?  
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA: Well, I definitely didn't intend to hit him anywhere near that region.  I was trying to, you know, get his arm and then he brought his arm in, and that's why I just grazed his arm.   
 Q.  Do you have any response to what he said about you?  
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA: I don't know what he said. I'm not going to get into a back and forth in the media with that.   
 Q.  Does it bother you that now the second season in a row where you're being questioned about this, about being a dirty player?  
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA: I mean, a little bit, but you just don't pay any attention to it.   
 Q.  What is your role? I know you said energy and that sort of thing, but is it hard to do the things that you've been doing?  
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA: My role is to come in and help run the second unit, try to pick up the defensive intensity, keep the ball moving, and that's it.
