Dayton   84
  Gonzaga   79

THE MODERATOR:   Coach Few, an opening comment, please? 
COACH FEW:   Hey, we knew we were going to be in a dog fight tonight after watching tape on these guys, and we were.   It's been a while.   I can't remember when, at least since I've been the head coach, we've given up 18 offensive rebounds.   That's something we take a lot of pride in.   And they just handed it to us on the glass. 
Those offensive rebounds led to a lot of those kickout threes and the extra possessions that kind of stemmed the tide and put them out in front all the way to the end.   Off free throws, off tough shots and all of that.   They just kept getting extra possessions.

Q.   What did you feel was the difference?   They shoot 10 for 31 in the first half, and they're 17 for 28 in the second half. 
COACH FEW:   I thought they got a lot of great looks again off offensive rebounds.   That's a great time to shoot a three.   They had the right guys stepping up and taking them.   I think we did a good job of limiting the looks from three.   Sibert made one right there near the end of the half, and that was the only three they had in the first half.   We did a good job on price.   In the second half, they got back to attack and got in our gaps a little bit and we had to help, and that leads to kickout threes.   We were battling foul trouble all night long, so we had some kind of strange lineups and scenarios out there.
But Dayton did a great job of just staying with the game, and staying with the game and then took it to us physically there.

Q.   Can you talk about the rebounding and the foul trouble and how that impacted things? 
SAM DOWER, JR.:   Yeah, they definitely rebounded us tonight.   We really focused on that, but tonight they wanted to rebound us I guess.   I got in foul trouble early.   And I was a little tentative on defense, and I got a few stupid fouls early that got me into foul trouble.

Q.   Kevin, it seems like you were just really in a zone there down the stretch.   Were you aware of four fouls?   Did you think about letting somebody else take that foul near the end with 20 seconds or so to go? 
KEVIN PANGOS:   Yeah, early on I knew I had four fouls and I just kind of blanked there.   I guess some of the coaches were telling me, and that was my fault.   I should have known and known the foul situation.   I wasn't‑‑ if I knew I wouldn't have gone for it, but I just kind of blanked, so...
