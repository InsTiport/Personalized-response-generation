<p>	Q. At times this series, it seems like you said your team lost composure in some games, how good did it make you feel the way they played in the fourth quarter today?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about how cool Chauncey was at the end, sinking those free throws. </p>
<p>	Q.  If there's ever a time that Elden Campbell would step up, I guess this is as good as any and he gave you some very key minutes in key situations. </p>
<p>	Q.  What impact did Dwyane have on the game especially in the third quarter? </p>
<p>	Q.  Looking ahead to the next series, when did your friendship with Gregg (Popovich) start? </p>
<p>	Q.  Yeah. </p>
<p>	Q.  Everybody contributed, just talk about how that epitomizes what this team has been about the past two years. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about your thoughts on the Spurs and also reflect on just how up and down the season has been for the Pistons. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just talk, obviously Rasheed had some ups and downs, particularly with fouls, he had foul trouble in this game as well, but when you needed him at the end there, he was right there.  Can you talk about his resiliency. </p>
