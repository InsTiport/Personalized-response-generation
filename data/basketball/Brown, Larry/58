<p>	Q.  The Lakers were in here talking, and they say that they really don't know you well enough to know if you present unique challenges.  How much of an advantage is that for you if they don't really understand or can't prepare for what you guys are going to bring? </p>
<p>	Q.  There's an awful lot of talk about your defense and understandably so.  The Lakers were not playing as good of  defense as they eventually played early in the playoffs, is that in your mind what got them here and how good of a defensive team are they? </p>
<p>	Q.  How come you didn't hire Phil as an assistant when you were head coach, back with the Nets in the '80s?</p>
<p>	Q.  So he made that up?</p>
<p>	Q.  You said in the conference call you would not employ the hack-a-Shaq, what is your philosophy about that?  Some coaches decide yes, some don't, you obviously said no; why? </p>
<p>	Q.  That's why you're wearing black. </p>
<p>	Q.  To follow-up on that, is it more because hack-a-Shaq offends your sensibilities regarding playing the right way, or is it something more strategic where you can't get points  -- you have to get all of your points out of sets and it puts you in team and individual foul trouble? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the transition that Mike James has had to make coming from being a starter from Boston to a backup for you guys, and not being as involved in the offense as he was in Boston and how he's handled that. </p>
