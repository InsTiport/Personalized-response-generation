<p>	Q. Can you make a comment about Mo (Cheeks) getting the Philly job. </p>
<p>	Q.  While you're on the topic of coaches, I don't know if you know, but Brian Hill got rehired by the Magic as the head coach, eight years after he had been released.  Is that strange at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much growth have you seen in Dwyane Wade's game since the Olympics, looking at him live and on tape?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there one part of his game where you've seen growth from last summer, any one part in particular where you've seen growth?</p>
<p>	Q.  What has stuck with Chauncey from what you want to see of him?  What have you seen that's stuck with him that maybe he didn't do before you got here?</p>
<p>	Q.  Elden (Campbell) obviously had a long road getting traded in the middle of the season and coming back to you guys.  Can you talk about what a benefit it is to have him as a fourth big option off the bench in the series. </p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously you go way back with Billy King.  You also know Ed Snider (76ers Chairman) very well.  Do you think it bothers them the type of turnover they've had in Philadelphia since you left and they haven't been able to get that stability?  And does it hurt Billy's reputation to be on his fourth coach in his third year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Miami has been going nine and ten players deep pretty much every game.  You haven't gotten that much out of your bench yet.  How important is it for this series for you to get some real contributions out of your deep guys?</p>
