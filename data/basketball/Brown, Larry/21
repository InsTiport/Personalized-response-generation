<p>	Q. On Game 1 Phil Jackson had a press conference on national TV; Game 2, David Stern blew things up in terms of the CBA, today Phil Jackson gets the job in L.A., are you a little bit that they maybe upstaging the NBA Finals? </p>
<p>	Q.  Along those lines, one thing you've never done is go back to a place where you've been before.  Can you imagine what that would be like?  Is that something that you would ever consider? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've tried a lot of different combinations and tactics to limit Manu Ginobli, how much thought, if any, have you given to possibly using Dupree in limited capacity?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chauncey said the other day, "We have to play quarter by quarter, not even thinking about game by game."  Is that the prevalent attitude right now in the locker room?  Does everybody share that same feeling as Chauncey does?</p>
<p>	Q.  What is the availability status of Carlos Arroyo? </p>
