<p>	Q. The fella (Rasheed Wallace) that just went out, is he becoming milder, gentler and how much of the fact that of y'all are from North Carolina University has to do with it? </p>
<p>	Q.  What's the message you're trying to get across to your guards as far as getting the ball to the big men and how is that message being received? </p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of the fourth quarter last night was Manu, but you go back to the Conference Finals, San Antonio has really been executing well in the fourth quarter to close them out, too.  What sort of things have you seen, did you see last night that San Antonio was doing in the fourth that has been so effective?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you explain what Chauncey Billups has meant to the team? </p>
<p>	Q.  You just drew a correlation between Wade and Ginobili and Tayshaun Prince has had the misfortune of having to guard both of those guys.  Can you talk about maybe what the expectations we should have of Tayshaun in those situations are, and is too much being asked of him in terms of those matchups? </p>
<p>	Q.  Off the subject a little bit, over the last 25 years, there's only been seven franchises who have won NBA championships, which is considerably fewer than baseball, football or hockey.  Why is it?  Why do you think that is? </p>
<p>	Q.  You came out in the Carolina system that used to be like pressure defense --</p>
<p>	Q.  (Laughing) Used to be pressure defense and up-tempo offense.  When you became a pro coach, you were an up-tempo offensive coach.  Your teams still play great defense but you're not up-tempo anymore, how did that change? </p>
<p>	Q.  Even when you get the ball up fast, you're always running into more guys back than you used to --</p>
