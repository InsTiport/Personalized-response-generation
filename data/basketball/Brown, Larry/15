<p>	Q.  Your team has come from behind three series now, just talk about the resiliency and where they get their resiliency from. </p>
<p>	Q.  Pop says the reason why the Spurs have lost two straight here, they have not responded well to the Pistons' physical play, would you agree? </p>
<p>	Q.  Your players have said the last two games they played with a lot more energy and aggressiveness.  As a coach, what did you do to help bring that out in them? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you've said sometimes feel-good stories or the good stories in the league don't get a lot of publicity; Antonio McDyess what should people know about the year he's had and the person he is? </p>
<p>	Q.  Just curious, you talked about your high opinion of Rasheed and now that you've known him and coached him for a couple of years, before that, was your opinion of him any different?  Did you think he was at all flaky or anything like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Given what's happened in the last two games, given your history in San Antonio, the team's history in San Antonio, can you talk about the magnitude of Game 5, just in terms of the opportunity that's before you right now? </p>
