<p>	Q.  Shaquille O'Neal was in here saying that, "We beat ourselves," that it was more about what the Lakers didn't do last night rather than anything you guys did on offense or defense.  Is that a fair assessment? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just talk about your relationship with Chauncey and the process it took him to kind of get to know what you expected out of him in running the offense? </p>
<p>	Q.  Everybody has been talking for years about how preeminent defense is, you once had a Denver team average 114 points.  Is there a difference in how you teach the game and how you see other coaches teaching it now?  What's happened in the game that it's changed so dramatically? </p>
<p>	Q.  Having said all that, were you at all surprised at the number of open shots that you guys seemed to be able to get last night? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk a little about your decision to have Corliss guarding Shaq in the fourth quarter and just what were you hoping to accomplish with that matchup and could you just talk about what Corliss has meant to this team, particularly in Game  1 the other night? </p>
<p>	Q.  Give they have that low-post threat, is that why you opted to go with him, because Memo (Okur) was a little bit bigger, to guard Shaq? </p>
<p>	Q.  Joe Dumars talked about the Pistons having players with an edge.  Can you talk about the edge Rasheed Wallace has had and the impact he's had on the team and how well he meshed with this group?</p>
<p>	Q.  Earlier in the playoffs, when you spoke about so many people dropping off the Olympics, you talked about maybe just going with young players the next wave and you mentioned Dwayne Wade.  Your thoughts on bringing a team to the Olympics on that and a guy like Dwayne, too raw, too young or is that maybe the way this whole thing is going? </p>
