<p>	Q.  We just asked Chauncey sort of the flipside of this question, but if tomorrow turns out to be your last game as a coach, how would you like to be remembered? </p>
<p>	Q.  We always ask the players, you know, how are you going to respond in this kind of moment, how is it different for you in this kind of moment.  What about for coaches in terms of your own emotions going into a game like this, never mind what happens after the season, but just trying to win this particular game.  Does it change the way you go into it tomorrow? </p>
<p>	Q.  In this kind of game, a lot of people have said the home-court advantage is what you play all year for, but when it's a Game 7 at this magnitude, that kind of gets muted somewhat because both teams face the same consequence.  Do you buy that at all? </p>
<p>	Q.  Specifically in terms of tomorrow's game, but also encompassing the last two years, how are you a good fit for this group of players, and also, how is this group of players a good fit for you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you think of a specific reason why this group became champions, as opposed to others that you've played? </p>
<p>	Q.  How does Chauncey compare to guys in other sports like Derek Jeter of the Yankee, Tom Brady of the Patriots in his ability to come up big in bigger games? </p>
<p>	Q.  For all of the years you've coached, is there a way for you to succinctly define yourself as a coach, whether it's X's and O's, strategy, motivation; is there some way you would describe yourself?</p>
<p>	Q.  I can't figure it out. </p>
<p>	Q.  You were talking about Chauncey a second ago, but he's really come from the player he was early in his career to something -- a superstar and that just doesn't happen to a lot of players.  Some become good, but he's become a superstar.  Is there one thing that you can point to that was the difference?</p>
