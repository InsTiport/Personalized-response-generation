<p>	Q. Your players seem loose, how would you describe your emotions right now going into Game 7? </p>
<p>	Q.  You told us after Game 6 that you were feeling sentimental before Game 6, are you feeling similar emotions today, or is it different today than it was before Game 6? </p>
<p>	Q.  Along those same lines, can you reflect a couple of years ago, before you came to Detroit, and what these two years, what distance there has been in the two years, you won a championship, on the verge of trying to defend a championship and two years ago you were still looking for your first championship.  Can you put that into some kind of perspective on nights like this? </p>
<p>	Q.  Other than Shaq, their guys really haven't been in this situation, your team has so much experience in these kind of situations, although not Game 7s, but do you feel your experience gives you an edge going into this? </p>
