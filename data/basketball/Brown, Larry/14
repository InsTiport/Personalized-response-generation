<p>	Q. Do you have any sense or feeling after the four straight just blowout kind of games whether this is the way it's just going to be? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've been asked this other times, but theoretically, tonight could be the last game that you coach in Auburn Hills.  Have you even thought about that or talked about it with your family or anything?</p>
<p>	Q.  How are you feeling, and is your physical condition having any effect on you during The Finals? </p>
<p>	Q.  We've seen the Lakers kind of rise and fall, and they are the only team that managed to make consecutive championships since '98.  What is the challenge of repeating?  How difficult is it for a team such as the Spurs, which has had to go every other year almost, and your team, which is trying to accomplish it?  What is the challenge? </p>
<p>	Q.  In Game 7 of the Miami-Detroit series in the Eastern Conference Finals, Stan Van Gundy said if any of his players needed a motivational talk at this point, they didn't belong in the game, and you talked last year about winning because everybody played like the right kind of basketball.  So at this level of the NBA, The Finals, with all the talent and all the resources that are available, shouldn't that just be a matter of course?  Why doesn't it happen that teams are playing their A Game night in and night out? </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm not talking about motivation, I'm talking about just performance, focus, all of the things you just mentioned.  Is it burnout by this time of the season?</p>
<p>	Q.  Switching gears a little bit, you saw Andrew Bogut in the Olympics, what type of NBA player do you foresee him being and how would you assess his game? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned the good times you have with your team and your kids, I'm just wondering at this point what that pull is on you as you decide what you're going to do. </p>
