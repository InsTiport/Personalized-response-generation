<p>	Q. You've been speaking about the last couple of days, the need to go inside and work inside out, some people think it's opposite of the way the team is built with Ben not being one of the better scorers and Rip and Chauncey being two of the best.  Can you expand on why it's important to go inside? </p>


<p>	Q.  I know you didn't have time to reinvent your team and I know you would not want to do that anyway, but with no practice yesterday and a shoot-around today, did you get enough done that you needed to get done to get to this game? </p>
<p>	Q.  And you're prepared that Dwyane was going to play normal minutes, normal Dwayne? </p>
