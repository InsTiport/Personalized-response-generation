<p>	Q.  Considering the game, how well it went for you guys, coming into this and what you saw on film, do you have to make any adjustments or do you wait to see how they respond to the way you took control of that game?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've been here before, your last trip to the Finals with that opening-game victory on the road, talk about what possibly comes into the preparation for Game 2, if, indeed that even is in the back of your mind or it's a long memory? </p>
<p>	Q.  The Lakers seem to have gotten some mileage out of your comments that ABC picked up in the huddle the other day about defense.  Do you have any thoughts about those mics in the huddle and will you take any steps to make sure they are out of the way?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you ever find yourself looking and seeing the microphone there and maybe calling somebody over to the side to say something or you don't worry about it at all? </p>
<p>	Q.  Just a point of information, did Aaron McKie break his  -- suffer a stress fracture in Game  1 of the Finals last year? </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm sorry.  Aaron McKie in 2001. </p>
<p>	Q.  What do you think was the weakest part of your team's game on Game  1, and what is the most important thing your team has to do, the most important thing your team has to do tonight to win a game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about Elden Campbell and his coverage of Shaq? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said you're expecting a great game from the Lakers.  Are you expecting them to be more physical, and if so, what can you do to counter that?</p>
<p>	Q.  When Phil was in here just briefly, he talked about Kobe Bryant being somewhat winded chasing Richard Hamilton and making some changes, and one of the things he's done in playoffs is put a bigger guy on point guards.  If they were to do that, what would that be  -- would that be an issue or how would you combat that with not a lot of ball handlers? </p>
