<p>	Q. You and Pop are defensive-minded coaches, so coaching somebody like Ben must be a dream.  In our lifetime do you think that a defensive specialist like him will get anywhere close to the adoration, the respect, the attention and even the money that your high-scoring, no-defense stars get? </p>
<p>	Q.  In our lifetime, do you think that defensive specialists like Ben Wallace will get the same kind of attention and respect and honor that the great scorers who don't play any defense get? </p>
<p>	Q.  As someone with some maturity, can you lend some perspective to the debate between Bob Pettit, Tim Duncan, Karl Malone as the greatest power forward ever? </p>
<p>	Q.  So can you rate Pettit, Malone, Duncan, who is the best power forward?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've had a lot of very eventful seasons, but I don't think you've ever had anything to compare to this.  Has this been your hardest season?</p>
<p>	Q.  Let me sneak two more questions in.  One, you've had people jumping on you this year, you've had a lot of criticism.  Doesn't that stuff get you down? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little about your bench the past few games has given you a lot more than it did in the Miami series, especially on the offensive end, can you talk about what the difference might be there?</p>
<p>	Q.  All three of your big guys have had significant stretches regarding Duncan.  Do you let them have a part in deciding who is going to guard him, and do you think the fact that Duncan is seeing three different looks from pretty good defenders is having an effect on him not getting on a real roll? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said regardless of everything, it's 2-2, but how have you dealt with the fact that each game has been a blowout?  How does a coach cope with that? </p>
