<p>	Q. How freeing was it for Rip to be able to spend all of his energy on the offense without having to worry? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about Game 7s. You went to play New Jersey last year in Game 7 and you won that game and this time you're going on the road, a little bit different, but your mindset for Game 7 on Monday night? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you go into Game 7 preparation-wise expecting Dwyane Wade to play or do you set up two different game plans?  What's your thought process? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the experience that your team gained winning the Championship last year, how it factored into you getting to this point in the season. </p>
<p>	Q.  You've been around a long time and doing things the right way, the last couple of weeks things haven't always been the right way with officiating and the things that's going on in your life, if you could change anything during that time, would you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Not change the game, some of the things that happened on the court with some of the players. </p>
<p>	Q.  What did you think about Rip's performance, particularly in the first half, 78 percent shooting from the field and how important was that for him to get off to have such a big game?</p>
