<p>	Q. Can you explain the lack of offense from the big men, especially Rasheed, Antonio, Ben, Elden.  They had 16 points combined for the whole game. </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about how crucial the end of the second quarter was when they went up from 3 to 14 at the end and also the contributions of some of the surrounding players like Butler and Damon Jones and Udonis? </p>
<p>	Q.  Before the game you said you didn't really have a feel for where this team would be tonight.  Are you surprised that this was the effort that came out tonight; that they were not as focused as you would have liked and they didn't have the energy you would have thought for a Game 5? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little about Rasheed, he didn't get to the line at all, he had one basket and I know he was out a lot with fouls, but a lot of people perceive that as he goes, the team does well, and obviously Game 5 was critical, he was really absent for almost everything. </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about Shaquille's impact in the game, particularly early, he got off to such a good start. </p>
<p>	Q.  That 11-0 run to end the half, was it more Rip had the two quick baskets, Wade comes back in the game and then they go on their run, was it more what they did in that last two minutes than what you didn't do defensively or was it coming out of their defense from them getting stops? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've been down 3-2 on a few occasions and now you're back in that situation again.  What do you tell your team on the way back to Detroit, realizing that the road back to the Finals is going to be through Miami?</p>
