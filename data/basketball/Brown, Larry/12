<p>	Q.  However this plays out, how difficult has this season been on you personally, all of the stuff with the brawl and now physical problems, and are you dreading having to make that decision fairly soon down the road? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much of a problem do you think it will be for your players not to think about the last game, slipping away, and just focusing and concentrating and watching them today?</p>
<p>	Q.  You know you've had a lot of trouble playing here, both in this series and in the regular season.  Have you addressed that issue at all and is there anything in your head in terms of how you get your team to play differently than it did in Games 1 and 2 here? </p>
<p>	Q.  You were just talking about how special this was, you used the words, "Last run."  Can you clarify what you mean by that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Pop was talking about some of the long-term deals and they have locked some of their players up, how much do you see win or lose this series, how much do you see this team changing in the future? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there any simple explanation as to why they have been killing you with all the three-pointers all series? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you make any comment about the new labor agreement from your standpoint? </p>
