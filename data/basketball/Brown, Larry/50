<p>	Q.  I think there's a perception that players left to their own devices like to run up and down, run and gun.  Is it hard to get a team to play as sort of patiently as you've gotten this team to play offensively? </p>
<p>	Q.  Last night you talked about how the offense in the first half really disturbed you in the way they were just  -- carrying on to what you were just saying, is that part of what you have to do to keep them under control, not feeling too good about themselves, but being up 2-1 and actually being so close to being up 3-0, it would be easy to sort of lose sight of what it's going to take to finish them off. </p>
<p>	Q.  Describe the difference in coaching a team that's oriented around a superstar, like your Sixers team was, and a group like this.</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the Olympics for a minute, like, how do you assess the level of competition that you're going to get there and how do you prepare for that with the group of players that you have?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are you worried about fielding a young team playing against teams that have been together for years? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the development of your pick-and-roll execution, because earlier in the season it wasn't that great, and now it is, and what do you anticipate the Lakers doing to defend it? </p>
<p>	Q.  The series is far from over, but traditionally, historically, in the NBA, the formula to winning a championship is to have great offensive stars, All-Stars.  Your top scorers have never been All-Stars.  Does it say anything about maybe perhaps the way teams will be built differently or about what's going on that you don't have this, quote, great individual, one-on-one All-Star-type player? </p>
<p>	Q.  You guys have crushed the Lakers the last two games off the offensive glass.  I'd like to ask you if you think, how big that has played a role in you guys winning, and what's the secret to your success on the offensive boards?</p>
