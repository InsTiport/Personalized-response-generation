<p>	Q. With all due respect, Coach, your team led the league in technicals this season and is this one of the biggest problems your team is facing now, is that you're losing your concentration by complaining about the refereeing, it seems almost from the get-go. </p>
<p>	Q.  How important is it to make 3-pointers against this team?  Because they have a very, very good defense inside and you are not making any 3-pointers, not today. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about how a series can dramatically change when it changes venues, and do you expect that in this series? </p>
<p>	Q.  What's been the biggest difference these two games?</p>
<p>	Q.  Were you doubling off of Bruce Bowen and pretty much giving him that shot?</p>
<p>	Q.  They had more than twice as many free throw attempts as you did.  Is that a fair reflection of their aggressiveness at that end, and can you win with those kind of numbers? </p>
