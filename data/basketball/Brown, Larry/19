<p>	Q. Both these teams are really good defensively, do you have a theory or an explanation perhaps about why all three games have kind of blown up in the fourth quarter and haven't been nip and tuck down the stretch? </p>
<p>	Q.  Are you surprised a little bit that not one game so far has come down to like a one-possession game in the last minute? </p>
<p>	Q.  Knowing what McDyess has been through with his knee situation, what goes through your mind when he's mixing it up and being aggressive and physical? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kind of talk about Lindsey and Antonio McDyess coming off the bench and what they have done for you.  That was supposed to be one of the advantages that the Spurs had coming in, that their bench was deeper than your guys. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about what you expect from each of those guys, Antonio and Lindsey when they come into the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Rip seemed to have a more patient game as far as attacking the defense and Bruce, he used his head a little more about how he wanted to go at it, did you talk to him at all about that and is there anything that you liked that he did yesterday that he had not done in the first two games?</p>
<p>	Q.  As a whole, the defense was certainly more aggressive last night, but specifically, what did you guys do differently against Manu Ginobli? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much more of an effort was there to maybe be a little more physical with him? </p>
<p>	Q.  Popovich and a couple of his players talked about how you guys did a much better job at passing and things like that.  Was that a conscious effort on your team's part going into Game 3 to do a better job in the passing lanes? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked a little bit about how anyone who has watched these playoffs can recognize Manu as a special player.  Can you talk a little bit when a guy goes from being a very good player, who whatever he gives you is a plus, to a star, who is expected to do it night in and night out, and when he doesn't, there's a lot of focus on, well, you didn't do this this night, just how difficult that is and what a gap that is and what a player has to handle in being that. </p>
