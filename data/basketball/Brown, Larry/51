<p>	Q.  Did you know, and if so, when did you know that your team would be okay emotionally after what happened Tuesday night?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know you wanted to win the ballgame, but how surprised are you at the way you dominated the Lakers? </p>
<p>	Q.  After Game  1, you said you didn't think your team could defend any better, but in that game, Kobe and Shaq kind of got loose for theirs.  In this game, they didn't.  How surprised are you by that element of your team's defense?</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you expect from the Lakers in Game  4?</p>
<p>	Q.  The Lakers have historically played extremely well on the road, especially in the Finals and you experienced that a few years ago.  Did that surprise you that you were able to dominate so much, because they usually elevate their game so much when they go on the road?</p>
<p>	Q.  How critical was your guard play to this victory? </p>
