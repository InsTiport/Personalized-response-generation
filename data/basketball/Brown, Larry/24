<p>	Q. What adjustments can your team make in guarding Manu in Game 2? </p>
<p>	Q.  Game 1, Chauncey Billups was, no question, the brightest spot, how do you keep that candle lit while illuminating the rest of your team tomorrow night? </p>
<p>	Q.  Just following up on the Chauncey Billups theme, here is a guy who bounced from team to team to team and found a home in Detroit.  Can you talk about the evolution of Chauncey Billups as a player? </p>
<p>	Q.  The Spurs have never given up more than 90 points in an NBA Finals game, why do you think that is? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've talked in the past about how you admire great coaches from other sports, like Scotty Bowman and one of the things Bowman was good at doing was keeping championship teams together for a long period of time.  How do you manage to keep this group of guys on an even keel and producing at a high level?</p>
<p>	Q.  There was a very funny story today in the paper about your ABA days, one time you played here on ten-cent beer night and they doused you guacamole, wonder if you can recount that story as much you can remember? </p>
