<p>	Q. Do you think that Rip is the kind of player that pretty much every series, as smart as he is, can figure out the difference of a defender and break loose at some point, or do you think it's going to be game-to-game and he could struggle tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit, Rasheed, how much is he a benefit to you guys even when he's not scoring or not putting up the stats from maybe an emotional standpoint because obviously he gets a lot of technicals, but is that emotion something that helps you guys and can you talk about how that helps you guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would you say in last year's title run, was he the difference-maker, bringing him in midway through the season, was he the guy that put you guys over the hump? </p>
<p>	Q.  Antonio McDyess the last couple of games has been giving you the kind of production we saw throughout the regular season.  Have you done anything differently to get him some better shots or is it just a matter of making the shots he's been taking all year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is this Spurs team playing at a higher level and a more complete team than the Lakers team you played last year in The Finals, or are they just more difficult for you to guard because of where they are and who they have right now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Last year you had a very deep bench and it seemed like players were able to pressure, the players you had were able to pressure up court this year given the shorter bench.  Can you talk about how your team has caused as many turnovers as it has given the personnel? </p>
<p>	Q.  Yeah. </p>
<p>	Q.  I know that you're always stressing to your guys how important rebounding is, the nights that they actually go out and really do it, what have you found to be the most effective way to get that message to them? </p>
<p>	Q.  The way you're playing Manu now, is that similar to the way you played Kobe last spring, or were you doing more with Kobe? </p>
