Q.  Another report today, Larry, did you want to touch that one at all, out of Ohio?  There was another report today about your connection with the job in Cleveland saying you have to decide by Monday. 

COACH LARRY BROWN:  I'm concerned about the fans (laughter).  No.  Sorry about that.  My son won last week 8-7, though. 

Q.  Is there some relief after this long break to finally be here getting ready to play?  Do you sense that from your players?

COACH LARRY BROWN:  You know, I think everybody is anxious.  This is so unusual, having a break like this.  But last year I remember the first series took a month.  I think we've been through this before.  The hardest thing is after you lose, you've got a lot of time to think about it and reflect about it.  You like to come right back and play again, I think.
