<p>	Q.  Can you explain the move you made putting Hamilton as the main defender on Wade rather than Prince in this game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Two things:  17 assists, no turnovers, have you ever seen that in a game, in the first half?  And can you talk about overall the difference, the other night you lost your poise and you talked about that and tonight obviously wasn't an issue.  Talk about the difference tonight and the other night, and keeping your poise. </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk a little about the job Elden did tonight, not only for your team but his impact on Shaquille O'Neal. </p>
<p>	Q.  With two minutes to go in the first half, and all of your big men in foul trouble, you sent Darvin Ham in to play center, which obviously you overlooked Darko.  Is your confidence in him so low that you could not send him in for two minutes? </p>
<p>	Q.  Now that the series is tied up at two games apiece, talk about the mindset of this team going into a pivotal Game 5 in Miami. </p>
<p>	Q.  Just talk about the start of the fourth quarter.  It seems you really turned up the defense a notch. </p>
