<p>	Q. What type of adjustments do you think Dwyane Wade made in this game from the Game 1, specifically in the 4th quarter?</p>
<p>	Q.  Considering what you know about Wade I'm sure you're not surprised that he responded the way he did?</p>
<p>	Q.  Given all the things that went wrong for you tonight, how do you still feel about the long-term prospects given that you still had a chance to win this game last minute, still have home court advantage.  What type of feelings do you take out of this game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just wanted to know your opinion of the last eight minutes of seeing Zo and Shaq on the court together.  Did that surprise you, and what kind of problems did it pose?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just talk about Zo and the impact that he could possibly have for the remainder of the series given the defensive nature that he's taken on?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about putting Tayshaun on the bench for the whole second quarter there with the two fouls, what the thinking was for saving him and that type of thing?  And do you think it had any effect on his effectiveness in the second half?</p>
<p>	Q.  Given the way you played in Game 1 and Game 2, do you really need to make a lot of changes or what kind of changes would you have to make when going back to Detroit for game 3?</p>
<p>	Q.  What did Miami do defensively to reverse you guys with 45 percent last game, 38 percent tonight?  What did they do defensively and how did their rebounding come into play tonight?</p>
