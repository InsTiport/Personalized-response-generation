<p>	Q. What changed tonight from the first two games? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the job your guys did on Ginobli, holding him to just six or seven field goal attempts. </p>
<p>	Q.  It seemed that there was a stretch there tonight where Chauncey Billups really got his offense going.  How important is it to get Chauncey Billups going and to get your team back in this thing? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about Rip earlier, he maintained his confidence even with Bowen's defense on him, because he was getting good shots.  Any difference tonight, simply knocking down shots or did you do something to get him in a rhythm? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is this another case of your offensive execution, got 47 percent tonight, helping your defense? </p>
