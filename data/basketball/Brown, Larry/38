<p>	Q. Could you please talk about the free throw disparity and what you saw in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>	Q.  When Dwyane Wade left the game with 7:56 and five fouls, you guys were up five.  When he came back you guys were down nine.  Why do you feel you weren't able to capitalize during that period when he was out of the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  The defensive play early, did you think it was soft?  They were just making shots over the top of you.  Were you disappointed with your defense especially early?</p>
<p>	Q.  Considering the experience of your team and the way they normally play, are you surprised that you lost your poise or let those things get to you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Wade had 40 last game, he got 36 this time.  What do you try to do to change things to make it harder for him and why do you think he was able to counter?  It looked like he hit a lot of jump shots tonight. </p>

<p>	Q.  How critical was it that Antonio McDyess picked up that fifth foul?  How big was that?</p>
