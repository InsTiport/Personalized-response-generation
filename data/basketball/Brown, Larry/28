<p>	Q. Would you talk about, this is kind of a different challenge than last year, you have a deep team that are relatively healthy, and last year you faced a team that had some health issues, just talk about the different challenge now in this Final. </p>
<p>	Q.  You had Bruce Bowen briefly in Philadelphia, did you ever think at that point that he would evolve into this dynamic of a defender? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about, speaking of Pop, can you talk about coaching against him, coaching against your best friend and the challenges that that puts in front of you. </p>
<p>	Q.  I want to ask you about Rasheed Wallace.  He has a pretty good outside shot as well, but a lot of people think that he's more effective with the low post.  Can you talk about the latitude he has as far as where he plays and as far as the shots he takes on offense? </p>
<p>	Q.  How do Ben and Rasheed complement each other defensively and offensively?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know you said that you talked to Coach Popovich almost every day, can you tell us what that first conversation was like with him, describe what it was like after you won on Monday night, and also, you guys seem very different, can you describe what your relationship is like and what --</p>
<p>	Q.  You seem different.  What is it about you guys that make you such good friends?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you remember, 1999, the ring ceremony, what your reaction was, when they got their rings for the first time and when Pop handed you his and you gave it back, do you remember your reaction? </p>
