<p>	Q. What's the key to keeping that edge going into this Game 2?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about how after the game about how one of the keys for you guys in the second half was the fact that nobody was in foul trouble so you guys could really maybe take some chances, be a little more aggressive.  Talk about what the game plan was for the first half so that guys were relatively foul-free?</p>
<p>	Q.  Van Gundy has talked about the need for him to make some adjustments, trying to get some better shots.  Against this defense that you guys have, what kind of adjustments do you anticipate he would make?</p>
<p>	Q.  Dwyane Wade came in shooting a very high percentage during the regular season, how much of that was off the transition?</p>
<p>	Q.  As much attention as you guys get for your defense, do you think that the national perspective of your offense is underappreciated?</p>
