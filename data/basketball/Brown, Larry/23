<p>	Q. Did Rasheed get fined for dissing the media yesterday? </p>
<p>	Q.  To his foundation?</p>
<p>	Q.  You don't think they would suspend him since he's a repeat offender; they try to get the message through. </p>
<p>	Q.  In the previous series, you switched Tayshaun off and put Rip Hamilton on Dwyane Wade, is one switch enough to determine if you need to make that switch in the series?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've had a lot of success in the playoffs with the Pistons in the first games of series, and going back a couple of years you've had success late in The Finals, now getting down 0-1, how do you approach it with your team and how do you feel your team approaches this? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned the pregame hoopla, do you find that it detracts from the basketball or are you offended that there has to be all this glitz and glamour and entertainment before the game, and was it a distraction before the game, the 20 minutes that they had to wait?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just talk about what you think you need to do to get your reserves going, and do you think you might even shorten the rotation a little bit after the way they struggled? </p>
<p>	Q.  Not to take credit away from other teams, but in general when you guys lose, is it almost always about what you're not able to do offensively versus any sort of defensive breakdowns? </p>
<p>	Q.  You were just saying that the reserves don't play as well on the road as they do at home, is there ever a situation where you'll leave a starter in in the first half when he gets two fouls?</p>
<p>	Q.  Elden gave you some nice minutes in the Miami series.  Is there any spot for him in this series at all do you think? </p>
<p>	Q.  What would that be? </p>
