<p>	Q.  How did you get your three-point game going tonight when it really has not been there the first five games?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about I guess a little bit more about the uncanny ability of this team to fight off elimination games and win? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about Rasheed and how he came back from the criticism that he took for the play in the previous game, and his contributions down the stretch, at one point he had seven of your last nine points. </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you just talk about the job Rip did for you offensively tonight?  There was a point where it just seemed like he was in a flow all night as far as his shooting was concerned? </p>
<p>	Q.  Your ability to avoid turnovers was again amazing tonight, you only had five and you only had four in Game 4.  Can you talk about what the difference is, why you're controlling the ball so well? </p>
