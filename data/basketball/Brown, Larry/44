<p>	Q.  Could you talk about what your defense did down the stretch after they tied it up?  It looked like you guys just smothered them.</p>
<p>	Q.  Looked like you doubled Shaq more in the second half.  Were you planning to kind of spring that on him later or was that just adjusting to the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  At the beginning of the game, this 1 and 2 match-up almost appeared to be the likeness of a heavyweight fight because of the way things were going back and forth.  Did you kind of get that feeling, as well, knowing that these two teams are fairly close?</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys had success defending Dwyane Wade the last time you played in the regular season and again today.  What is it that you do that makes this team so successful defending Dwyane Wade?</p>
<p>	Q.  Rasheed shot the ball really well.  Was that the plan going in or did it kind of gel as the game went on, to be that aggressive looking for that type of a shot?</p>
