<p>	Q.  Are you even surprised by this? </p>
<p>	Q.  Why? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about your bench production, particularly early in the second quarter when you had Corliss and Okur and Hunter in there and held your own for six or seven minutes.</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about Chauncey and the way he stepped up tonight, of course he's been in this position before a few years ago when you were coach of the Sixers, one game up.</p>
<p>	Q.  Given in 2001 you came in here and won Game  1, do you feel a need to emphasize that they can't be satisfied with just winning this first game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel any similarities or see any other similarities to the experience, Game  1 of 2001 and Game  1 here tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  Tayshaun's length, how does that make him unique as a defender and what kind of problems did he pose tonight for Kobe, did you see?</p>
<p>	Q.  It's obvious, your team can play as an underdog, when you come in as an underdog, do you say anything to the team?  Do you help them get over the belief thing or did you put them on that?</p>
