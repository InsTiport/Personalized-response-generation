 Q.   What's the secret to winning Shooting Stars?  
CAPPIE PONDEXTER:   Making all the shots and knowing who's good at making what shots.   I think I'm one of those‑‑ those are the easier shots for me, the three‑point‑‑ the third shot, which is a long‑distance three is kind of long from NBA range.   I think I'll let Allan or Landry make that and then focus on making a half‑court shot.  
   
 Q.   Have you guys game‑planned at all?  
CAPPIE PONDEXTER:   No, I've just been talking trash to Steve Smith, that's it.   He's been talking a lot, saying he's stretching like two days ago.   
   
 Q.   Do you know Landry pretty well?  
CAPPIE PONDEXTER:   You know, we're cordial.   We're pretty cordial.  
   
 Q.   Does he have a specialty?  
CAPPIE PONDEXTER:   He's just a great shooter, just let him do his do.   Him and Allan, they're pretty good at shooting, so I think I have a pretty solid team around me.  
   
 Q.   Can you guys unseat Atlanta?  
CAPPIE PONDEXTER:   I hope so.   They're the champions.
