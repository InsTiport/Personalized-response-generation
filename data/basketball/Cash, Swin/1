Q. Dominique or Swin or Chris, the order you all went was very different from everyone else with the WNBA star going first.   What was the strategic point there? 
DOMINIQUE WILKINS:   We just wanted to repeat what we did last year.   We did the same thing last year.   We didn't want to change it.   For luck (laughing). 
CHRIS BOSH:   Yup.

Q.   Chris, what was going through your mind when you ran up and jumped on his back at the end of that? 
CHRIS BOSH:   Oh, I hope he don't fall. 
DOMINIQUE WILKINS:   I said I hope I didn't either (laughing). 
CHRIS BOSH:   He was telling me about his back problems, but I forgot all about that after.   He's a strong guy.   So he's all right. 

Q.   Are you looking forward to defending your title again for four years now in Toronto? 
CHRIS BOSH:   Hey, man, let's soak all this in.   About the pop a couple of bottles of champagne in the back back there and mess up the locker room, trash it real nice.   Move on with the rest of our weekend. 
SWIN CASH:   I guess the real question is how many of you thought we would be back up there? 
DOMINIQUE WILKINS:   Honestly speaking.   Nobody, right?   That's what we thought. 
SWIN CASH:   We have a good time.   We really do.   This is fun for us. 

Q.   Swin, you've won four yourself.   You're bringing them along now with three in a row.   What is it about you all as a tandem that's allowed for all of this? 
SWIN CASH:   I think we don't take it so serious.   Over the last three years we've seen a lot of just everybody‑‑ we're so competitive as athletes.   When we come out here, it's really simple.   We have a good time.   We joke around.   We miss the shot, all right.   We'll get the half‑court shot.   We just keep it loose.   It's fun.   And we strategize. 
DOMINIQUE WILKINS:   Chemistry. 
SWIN CASH:   Random calls.   Talking about what we need to do. 

Q.   You're so good at the half‑court shot.   Do you seriously practice that often?   I don't ever see you just chucking it up. 
CHRIS BOSH:   No, I practiced it today right before we started. 
DOMINIQUE WILKINS:   Last half‑court shot I took was last year's competition.   That's how seriously I took it.
SWIN CASH:   Chris looks good.   It's like a jumpshot from half court.   It's ridiculous.   It's great. 
DOMINIQUE WILKINS:   That's pretty funny. 

Q.   Kenny Smith was kind enough, or maybe not kind enough, Dominique, to note that you've been carried all these years by these two.   So there has to be some indication‑‑
DOMINIQUE WILKINS:   I have a message for Kenny:   Look at my track record, I didn't get 26,000 points on dunks alone.   You catch my drift? 
CHRIS BOSH:   I hope I make it to 26,000. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
