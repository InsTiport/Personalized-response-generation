		   SWIN CASH: Getting into the whole sports entertainment world. I love that. But I'm also (indiscernible) political, watching CNN. I'm just really looking at all my options and to have the opportunity to do those things. 

 Q. How far off is that, would you say? 
 SWIN CASH: To be honest with you, right now my mindset is focused on playing through (indiscernible) Olympics. That's a goal of mine. Hopefully I can be there. If that's not the case, then reevaluate then. 

 Q. Are you confident you'll make it this time? 
 SWIN CASH: I'll say it this way: I know that I am doing whatever it is that I need to do to show that I can be on the team. But I also understand that other people's opinion. But I can only control what I can control. I'm happy with everything. I'm perfectly fine with whatever decision they make because I know I'm putting out the best product I can put out. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 SWIN CASH: People are always asking about the UConn connection. It's funny, because I look at RenÃ©e, I look at Maya. Even though I'm looking at the same alma mater, it doesn't mean that necessarily (indiscernible). I think that's a tribute not only to the university, but the rich tradition of not only having great teams but great players. 
 The majority of players after they graduate have been successful. I think our record proves that. 

 Q. Seattle has done well. Talk about what works so well for this team. 
 SWIN CASH: I think it's great chemistry. Third year of the players being together. We have aggressiveness on both ends of the floor. I think adding Jenny Boucek being in charge of basketball development with the players, having those individual workouts with her, has been a breath of fresh air for our team.
