Q.   Are you having a good time?
SWIN CASH:   Yeah, it's good.   It's really just one of those things where you're now an ambassador, not only for basketball, but women's basketball, for the W.   It's a good time for us to come out here and interact with the NBA and the sponsors.

Q.   What have you been working on this last season?
SWIN CASH:   At first I worked on my mind with some rest.   I gave my body a little bit of time off.   And now it's just about getting back to the gym and getting the feel, getting the skills together.   Work a little bit on my shooting.   And just fine tuning things for this upcoming season. 

Q.   What will you be looking for from your team next year?
SWIN CASH:   I know what we'll be looking for, and that's for us to be a consistent team that gets to the playoffs.   And that's very important.   And for me, that's all I know.   And so it's hard whenever you are on a team or have a season like we had last year, that it makes you hungry to get better.
