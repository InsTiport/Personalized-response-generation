COACH DAUGHERTY:   Opening statement was it was a great game, second half especially.   We told the kids at halftime, just to keep playing great defense and we'll start making shots.   That's what happened.   
And the other opening statement is, June is out of surgery and doing well.   
   
 Q.   What did you say to these kids at halftime, and what do you say going up against a team like Stanford?   
COACH DAUGHERTY:   What we told them at halftime was we are playing great defense.   The toughest team is going to win this game, and you know, if you guys just stay with it, the ball will start going in.   Pretty much all that came true.   
What we tell them when we go play Stanford is, it doesn't matter who the best team is.   What matter s is who is the best team on that day.   If we are the best team tomorrow, then we'll win it.   And if we're not, we'll go home.   I mean, we're excited to play them.   You know, we've got a game plan, hopefully it's a better game plan than the one we had last week when we played them, and we'll see if it works.   
The biggest thing with Stanford is you have to make shots.   You've got to out‑score them.   You're not going to stop them.   They are too talented.   Every time June and I have beaten them, it's because we out‑scored them.   So we are going to have make shots tomorrow.   
And we can get shots, but just we are going to have to make them.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk a little bit about the situation withJune?   Was there any question that you would go ahead and coach tonight or did you think about going to the hospital with her?   
COACH DAUGHERTY:   Well, right after shootaround today, she asked the doctor, she was in pain, and she asked the doctor to come look at her.   Our team doctor, Dr.Garcia, game up, examined her, and said that "I think it might be appendicitis.   And I think you need to go to the hospital to check and make sure that's what it is."       
At that point, I went and got a taxi, and I was going with her until she told me not to.   And I just do whatever she says.   She said:   "No, you stay here with the team in case I have to stay at the hospital."   So I did that and she said, win the game, and so we did that.   (Laughter).  
You know, I'm good.   I've been listening to her for 24 years.   You know, it goes on and on.   
   
 Q.   Is there any word on whether she's going to be able to return tomorrow?   
COACH DAUGHERTY:   Well, I hope so, because I want to retire 1‑0.   I'd like to go out undefeated, you know, and then that assures that, no matter whether we beat Stanford or not.   
But they say the procedure is one that you can go home the next day, and knowing my wife, if she can comeback to the hotel, she'll be on the sideline tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Your team got hot; can you talk a little about maybe ‑‑ was the basket open for you?   
LIA GALDEIRA:   Actually, my team, during halftime, like Mike said, whatever June says, he does.   And whatever Mike, June and Brian tells me to do, I do it, and then I give credit to my team.   Works that way.   
   
 Q.   Your first experience in a setting like this, was it fun to be in this kind of a tournament atmosphere?   
LIA GALDEIRA:   It was fun.   I remember watching this when I was a little kid, and now I'm here.   It's fun, cool.   
   
 Q.   What was going on today with June, was that a distraction at all?   Did that affect you guys coming out to start the game maybe?   
MARIAH COOKS:   Motivation, yeah, like, of course, you know, we are here and we are going to be kind of riled up, and our nerves kind of got the best of us the first half I would say, just offensively.   But we used June as motivation just to push us like Lia said.  
   
 Q.   It was still a close game, can you take me through that little burst there; what was working for you at that point?   
MARIAH COOKS:   Just playing with patience, that's what works best for me is just when I'm able to kind of just see where my defender is and make whatever move I need to, so I had to do it for my team.
