<p>	Q.  Similar to Kansas in the fact that you have a very young team, have you been able to judge just where your team is, what they are able to do things of that nature?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coached talked about all the new players.  Do you and David and Aaron, do you all make those guys put on name tags?  What is it been like for you to see all these new faces, try to learn what they do and get integrated with the team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Sean talked about chemistry now and how you measure it differently once the games start.  You started 15 games last year.  Early on, how difficult was it to sit there and watch?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach was talking about your leadership ability with the young guys.  By the very nature of the position that you play, does it come easily to you?</p>

<p>	Q.  Sean, a little earlier today Coach Self was plugging JamesOn as a potential Player of the Year candidate.  Do you see that as a possibility?  Is he that good this quick?</p>
<p>	Q.  With JamesOn being a sophomore, is that a lot of pressure to put on a guy to kind of carry this team and lead this team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Sean, you returned three other players besides JamesOn, any of those guys have stepped forward as leaders also and have they made big strides as players?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you all brought JamesOn in, you knew what the makeup of this year's team was going to be like losing all these guys.  In your considerations for bringing him in did you look at that at all and know this would probably have to be a team that he would have to be a leader on and how he would handle that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously with a young team defense comes last, but given the athleticism it appears you have got -- where do you see this team definitely January, February?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is it easier to win with a younger team now than it was, say, 10 or 15, 20 years ago?</p>
