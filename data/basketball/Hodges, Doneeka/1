<p>	Q.  T, could you talk about the last play and what happened out there ?</p>
<p>	Q.  What was the last play that you wanted to run in that situation?  What do you all talk about coming out of the time-out trying to do, to try and get the last shot. </p>
<p>	Q.  Temeka how bad was your injury?  What was your injury and how bad did that hurt you as far as the rest of the game?  It looked like you were limping from that point on.</p>
<p>	Q.  I don't mean the turnover I just mean if in general, how did it affect you.  Because it seemed look you favored that leg the rest of the game.</p>
<p>	Q.  Seimone, could you talk a little bit about the problems they caused for you out there tonight?</p>

<p>	Q.  For all three of the players, would you all just tell us where you plan to go from here, what do you learn and take out of this game to carry over into next season because at least two of you will be returning for another year. </p>



<p>	Q.  For Temeka, when you're making that last kind of heave at the very end and the buzzer's sounding, what were you thinking, because you guys have come so far to have it end like that?</p>

<p>	Q.  Knowing Tennessee was going to come at Seimone so aggressively was there anything you could do to counter that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is it a case where the ending of the game kind of doesn't match the rest of the game, the two don't kind of seem to go together?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much do you think Tennessee's having been in these positions so many times made a difference in this game at all and your team has not?  </p>
<p>	Q.  What did you tell your team in the locker room after this loss?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you see Seimone as the next star player if she's not already the star player in women's basketball with the graduation of people like Alana Beard and Diana Taurasi and those kind of folks?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned, obviously, the second chance points and the rebounding.  In the first couple of minutes of the game you seemed to be doing a great job of that.  You were up 14-6 in rebound in early going.  Did you start just not doing that as well for the rest of the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think looking at the program and some of the players you have coming in, is this like you think the start of what could be many appearances in games like this?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you surmise the feeling that you have as we speak about your coaching tenure as Head Coach taking over, how you felt, how you feel now, and think about what would happen next year if you're not the Head Coach and Sue Gunter comes back, talk about first how you feel now as Head Coach and if you're not the Head Coach next year, what are your feelings?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you spoke to Sue since end of the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the way this team has excelled in the tournament here at the very end, coming into the tournament not ranked in the top 10, but you've exceeded expectations of a lot of people.  I'm sure you felt like this team could do this, but there are people out there that didn't think that.   </p>
