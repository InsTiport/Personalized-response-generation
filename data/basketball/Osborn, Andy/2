<p>	Q.  You come in losing five in a row.  And no 11th-seed had ever won a first round game here before.  Talk about how you just made some history tonight?</p>

<p>	Q.  Rich, you seemed to get off to a slow start.  You didn't get your first field goal until about six and a half minutes left.  Did you feel tight starting out?</p>
<p>	Q.  What clicked in the second half for you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the defense you guys played on Brad Buckman.  I know he hit 20-something points and 20-something rebounds in Boulder, 57 points today.</p>
<p>	Q.  How big were some of the bench players, particularly Martane Freeman tonight and a lot of guys came up, Ashby came up with more points than he's had how crucial was that to the victory?</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys don't have much time to turn around, get ready for Oklahoma State, get some rest tonight.  What are your plans, coach?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about Oklahoma State a little bit. </p>
<p>	Q.  Rich, the last time you guys played Oklahoma State you played probably one of your best halves of the season.  You were still trailing at half-time.  Can you just talk a little bit about --</p>

<p>	Q.  You used a lot of lineups early, a lot of players, I think 12 players played in the first half.  Was that to get to them with fresh legs and get them a little worn out?</p>
<p>	Q.  Paul Graham brings a lot to your staff obviously, but in this particular game tomorrow against Oklahoma State, what does he bring as far as scouting on Oklahoma State?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the defensive effort on Buckman, what changed from the game in Boulder and why you did so well?</p>
<p>	Q.  Well he scored 27 --</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the defensive efforts you guys put forth against Brad Buckman?</p>
<p>	Q.  Julius tonight had 147 points.  8 rebounds.  He looked more like the player you saw at the beginning of the season.  Do you have any idea what might have been different for him tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is that a positive or negative that you win tonight you go into tomorrow with momentum or that OSU gets to rest?</p>
