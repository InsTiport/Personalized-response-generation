  KEVON LOONEY:   It's a blessing to be drafted by the champs.   I watched them all season.   I watched them in The Finals all year, and to go get drafted by them guys is a blessing.   I can't wait to get out there and play. 

Q.   Kevon, you mentioned playing with the NBA champs.   How excited are you to play with the No.1 defense in the NBA?   I know that when I spoke to you yesterday, you said that the strongest aspect of your game is your defense.   Could you expound on your excitement on playing with the No.1 defense in the NBA last year?
KEVON LOONEY:   I'm really excited to be able to switch defenses with them guys, be able to try to use my length to get to guys in the league, and be able to learn from guys like Iguodala and Draymond Green, great defenders; Klay Thompson and Steph Curry and learn from those guys.   I think I'll really learn from them up there.     

Q.   What was going through your mind as the first round kept going on and you were still sitting there?
KEVON LOONEY:   It was just nerveâ€‘racking.   I got a little stiff and sore; I was sitting there a long time.   It was a long wait.   You never know what's going to happen.   I worked out for a lot of them teams.   I think I did pretty well at the workout, so you never know what's going to happen.   I got one of the best opportunities to learn from one of the best organizations in the league, so I'm happy and excited. 

Q.   You're from Wisconsin, you grew up in the cold, you end up going to UCLA, now you're kind of turning into a California guy.   What's that going to be like?
KEVON LOONEY:   I keep going from good teams to good teams.   I came from Milwaukee and went to LA, now I get to go to Oakland and play with the best team in the league.   I love California and I'm staying in California, so it's a blessing.
