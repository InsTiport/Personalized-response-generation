 CLAUDE FELTON: Opening thoughts from Coach Stallings. 
 COACH STALLINGS: Well, we just were outplayed tonight. They were better on the boards. They were better on defense, they were better on offense. They beat us in every way. We're very disappointed. We thought we were playing well coming into the game, and we did not play well tonight. Had a lot to do with them. 
 So we really don't have anything to hang our head about. We wanted a better performance, we didn't get it. I thought these two guys played very well. But when it comes to tournament time, your veteran players are going to have to step up for you like Guy and Torrance did for their team. And A.J. and Jermaine did not have good nights tonight, and that's going to make it hard on our basketball team when both those guys have a bad night on the same night. 
 So, unfortunately, we just weren't good enough in any way. 
 CLAUDE FELTON: Questions for the student-athletes. 

 Q. Talk about their success inside. You guys had runs but it seemed that they would always come back with a rebound, a slam. They were scoring a lot of points in the paint?
 JEFFREY TAYLOR: We tried to come back a couple of times. But every time, like you said, it seemed they would get a bucket, they'd get an offensive rebound. So they had a lot of sort of back breakers, you could say so. 
 But I think overall we tried to fight back, but it just wasn't our night. 
 CLAUDE FELTON: Brad, if we could get a couple of comments from you? 
 BRAD TINSLEY: Just to go along with Jeff, they're big, and strong and a very quick team. I thought that a lot of our guys, especially me, on the perimeter didn't get there quick enough to cut off their penetration. They got in the lane. As you can see, they got a lot of points in the paint. 
 CLAUDE FELTON: We'll excuse the student-athletes. Questions for Coach Stallings. 

 Q. That run Alabama had early in the second half, they got a lot of baskets in the paint, a lot of dunks. Were they doing anything special or were they just beating you off the dribble with great penetration? 
 COACH STALLINGS: We just failed to get out properly on some of their ball screens and they were able to turn the corner. We went zone, and they beat us on penetration from the side a couple of times. So it really didn't matter what we did. We just didn't guard the ball very well. 
 Their penetration either led to offensive rebound if they missed the shot or it led to drop-offs for dunks and lay-ups. So we just weren't good enough on the defensive end to sustain anything and to get enough stops to really get us back in the game. 

 Q. Do you see much difference in this Alabama team now the way it's playing as to when you played them in Nashville during the regular season? 
 COACH STALLINGS: I think they're playing better. I said that coming into the game. I think they're playing much better than they were then because they're shooting the ball better. They were only 1 of 5 from the three-point line tonight. But they didn't have to shoot three. They drove us and got to the bucket the whole time. So there was no sense for those guys to shoot a bunch of perimeter shots. 
 But, nevertheless, they're playing with more confidence. Playing with what seems like more purpose. But we played them a couple of games after they made the coaching change, and there was, you know, I think they were in a little bit of a state of disarray, maybe.
