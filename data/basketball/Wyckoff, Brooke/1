<p>	Q.  Talk about the euphoria when you got that tie-breaking 3-pointer, it must have just been an ecstatic feeling that you became the hero of this game, and then later on let the team coast into overtime with a victory. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach said that you were not the first option on the 3-pointer, how did you read the play? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you just talk about sitting out the entire year last year and watching the playoffs and what it felt like now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you get a sense of deja vu because 24 hours earlier, Lindsay missed tying the game, from almost the same spot?</p>
