<p>	Q. Allen, did you come in with a pass-first mentality tonight?  It looked like you were really looking to set up the players more so than thinking about scoring. </p>
<p>	Q.  You didn't get a lot of the attention because you had other guys doing that like Shaq and LeBron.  With Shaq now in the East and LeBron coming on, do you think that the balance of power has really shifted towards the East? </p>
<p>	Q.  Just curious, the alley-oop to LeBron James in the first quarter, how did that happen?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is the second time that you're All-Star MVP.  Last time a lot of controversy swirled around you and you've gone through some up and downs.  What's going to be different about this All-Star MVP Allen Iverson compared to the last one? </p>
<p>	Q.  On TV you dedicated the game to the passing of your best friend's mother.  Can you expand a little bit on the best friend and what kind of relationship you had with his mom? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you give us his name?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just talk about LeBron James' play, and a lot of people were calling it as kind of a coming-out party for him and what was it like lining up alongside him in the backcourt?</p>
