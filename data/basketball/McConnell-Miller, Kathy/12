<p>	Q.  You were in the shadow of the Big 12 at Tulsa.  How much were you able to follow the league and what do you expect?</p>
<p>	Q.  Along that same vein, what has it been like for you to go into players' houses with the power of a Big 12 school, you know, behind you and on your bag and on your stuff and everything?</p>
<p>	Q.  Wondering if you can expand on Kara Richards and what you see and expect from her?</p>
<p>	Q.  Of the newcomers you have, with the exception of Bianca, who do you expect to help right away?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about differences in style or between last year and this year?  Last year with the triangle and everything, how much difference is there in adjustment for this season?</p>
<p>	Q.  You played for Debbie Ryan and then coached for a long time with Theresa Grentz, both I think are known for strong defensive philosophies.  Seal Barry was similar type of coach.  Do you have the similar strong defenses philosophies as those coaches, and also if you can kind of talk about when you guys have family reunions with your brothers and sisters do you guys talk about anything but basketball?</p>
<p>	Q.  Were there any words of wisdom or pieces of information that Coach Barry left to you or told you?</p>
