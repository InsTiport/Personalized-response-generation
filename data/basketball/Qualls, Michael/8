California   85
  Arkansas   77

THE MODERATOR:   Coach, can you make some opening comments? 
COACH ANDERSON:   First of all, congratulations to California.   I thought their experience showed and our inexperience showed in a game of this setting.   Playing in a neutral setting, I thought Cobbs did a good job of setting the tone. 
In the second half, they really did a good job of exposing us on the glass.   In my mind, I know we're much better rebounding basketball team, but for some reason we didn't have the energy to finish it up. 
As I told our guys, I'm 0‑1.   I'll take the blame for that.   I didn't get them in the position they needed to be in a game of this magnitude.   But at the same time, I think California had a lot to do with that.   It seemed like they made big play after big plays, after we even made runs at them.   But we'll learn from it.   That's what this trip is all about, getting a chance to learn and really, really hone in on the thing that's we've got to get better at.

Q.   It's the first loss of the season.   How does the team feel after this loss? 
STUDENT‑ATHLETE:   They feel like any team would feel after a loss.   I can't really put it into any more detail than that.   Just got to, you know, forget it and come back and focus on the next game. 
STUDENT‑ATHLETE:   We've got to come out and play harder.   We've got to put it together for two halves.   Coach always says it's the second half, and we've got to learn by experience.

Q.   Guys, I know Coach said he put it on himself about the rebounding, but they were banging the boards really hard in there.   What can you do as a team to get yourselves in better position to get on the boards?
STUDENT‑ATHLETE:   Rebound something by effort.   We can't just rely on two, we've got two or three guys that have rebounds, the whole team needs to be making rebounds. 
STUDENT‑ATHLETE:   Sacrificed‑‑ I'm disappointed.   I feel like I could have gotten more boards.   So I'll put that on my self.   Talked about having quality minutes yeah, man, in a situation like that, we've got to come together.   We can't have one guy kill us and that's what it's about.

Q.   I think you guys were 1 of 12 from the field, is that just their defense or a combination of both? 
STUDENT‑ATHLETE:   I feel like lack of movement on the basketball.   Coach doesn't like one player to have the ball in his hand, constant pounding, because you know we get good ball movement, and we have players catching it in rhythm, and they can knock the shot down.   So, yeah, we're very stagnant.

Q.   This next question is for both of you.   Given that you guys can come back right away and put the mistakes behind you tomorrow, how do you guys plan to do that as far as the quick turn around?   You have the 9:00 a.m. game tomorrow.   Could you care to comment on putting this game behind you, getting up in the morning and coming back to rewrite the wrongs and play better? 
STUDENT‑ATHLETE:   We have to come out and play hard in that game as a team too.   We're just going to try to get it by ourselves at times when times got hard and they made a run.   But we've got to come together as a team and try to get the W. 
THE MODERATOR:   We can open it up for questions for Coach as well.

Q.   Coach, can you talk about why both Michael and Anthlon didn't start today? 
COACH ANDERSON:   It was the team meeting.   They were late for a team meeting.   Even as I talk to those guys, that's part of building your team.   They've got to learn from it.   Knowing that they're a big part of this team, so you can't be late for team meetings.   So we've dealt with that and now we can move forward.

Q.   Could you talk about the pace?   The pace seemed to slow down in the second half?
COACH ANDERSON:   Yeah, well, they did a good job.   They were in control.   I thought they controlled the line.   If you look at the points in the paint, that is the big difference.   If we get those rebounds now, we've got the game going up and down the floor.   In the first half you asked about the 1 for 12, we had some good shots, some good looks.   We missed a bunch of point blank shots.   My two leading rebounders get two rebounds between them.   You're not going to beat many people like that.   Just think, we end up losing the game by eight, so we've just got to do a better job by committee of rebounding the basketball and paying attention to detail.   But let's give California a little credit for that.   I thought in the second half the pace was to their liking.   They did a good job of attacking us, but good teams make adjustments, and that is one of the things we're going to learn.   Their experience showed.

Q.   Coach, it looked like you shortened the bench a little bit today, no Kingsley at all.   Did you think you would get him in there and the size?
COACH ANDERSON:   No, we'll get him in there.   We'll address that.   I think he brings a level of toughness we need to have.   When you look at how it boils down to the energy and the toughness.   I thought California had a little bit more in them today, this day.   Now tomorrow's going to be a different day.   But we'll get them involved.   We played quite a few guys.   But he certainly will get out there, because I think he'll give us a size guy that can rebound the basketball.   He's got some beef on him.

Q.   You played more of the three guard lineup today instead of going with the three fours like you did in previous games.   Was there any reason you did that? 
COACH ANDERSON:   You have to remember now we started off out of the gate, we had guys that didn't start out.   So from that standpoint, that kind of set the tone.   I was disappointed in what took place, but as I said, we'll move forward from it and we'll learn from it.
