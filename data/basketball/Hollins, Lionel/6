Q.   You worked on practice today, same lineup, are you still thinking about maybe I'll switch up minutes a little bit with some of the starters?
LIONEL HOLLINS:   No, we're going to play basketball.   We're going to keep playing.   We just have to do what we've been doing better.   I thought we got better in the second game, and as we came down the stretch we kind of figured out how to attack them better, and we have to start earlier attacking them that way. 

Q.   Have these three days off been a good thing for your team?
LIONEL HOLLINS:   It's always a good thing to have days off.

Q.   Do you see an advantage either way with an older Spurs team needing three days to recover because they all admitted they were tired after that overtime. 
LIONEL HOLLINS:   Well, they'll be tired before the series is over.   That's just part of playing the game of basketball.   When you get to this stage, everybody is tired.   Having a day off gives you rejuvenation for one day, but as soon as you start playing you're right back in the same boat.

Q.   How good of a feeling is it to be back in front of your home crowd tomorrow night?
LIONEL HOLLINS:   Well, it's better than having to play these next two games in San Antonio in front of their crowd, so good feeling.

Q.   Can the crowd help this team?
LIONEL HOLLINS:   No, we've got to go out and play on the court, just like we had to play in San Antonio, just like they had to play.   The crowd is loud and cheers for you, but you've got to execute.   We've lost games at home, they've lost games at home.   You've got to play.
