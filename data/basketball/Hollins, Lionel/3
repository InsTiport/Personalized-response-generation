Q.   So no pressure, just go out and win one game to try to get started in the other direction? 
LIONEL HOLLINS:   That's all we can do.   All we have is tomorrow, nothing else.

Q.   Do you sense that they seem to have fresher legs or not be as run down in the second half as your team was?
A.No, I think in overtime we were just worn down.   Not that they're not, it's just we're more worn down.   We have to play hard.   This is the way we have to play.   This is the way we play all year.   We're always worn down when we get to the end of the game.   We leave it all on the court.

Q.   Do you think you guys looked a bit gassed out there? 
LIONEL HOLLINS:   I just said that. 

Q.   Why do you think that would be? 
LIONEL HOLLINS:   Because that's how we play.   We have no room for making half efforts.   We have to make allâ€‘out effort all game.   That's how we're in the game.   We're not one of the most talented teams in the league or in the Playoffs.   We just go out and we scratch and claw.   That's why fans call us grit and grind, because that's the way we have to play.   We have a lot of guys that just go fight and compete, and you get tired.

Q.   What was the attitude of your team this morning?
LIONEL HOLLINS:   Quiet. 

Q.   What did you think of Zach's performance last night?
LIONEL HOLLINS:   I don't even remember Zach's performance, I just know we lost the game.   I wasn't even thinking about Zach's performance.   Was it good, bad?   We lost.   I mean, he had, what, 14 rebounds, 15 rebounds?   They battled.   They battled.
