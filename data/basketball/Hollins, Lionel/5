  Memphis ‑ 93 OT 
   
 Q.   Defensively how would you assess the start of the game?  
LIONEL HOLLINS:   It was pretty good.   We came out with great energy, we got steals, we were running.   We just couldn't sustain.   We subbed, and tried to get some rest and we didn't get production out of some of the people on the bench and then we couldn't rev it back up when we got back to our starters.  
   
 Q.   There at the end trying to get the play there with Conley, was that the shot you wanted at the end of regulation?  
LIONEL HOLLINS:   No.   I mean, I tried to get him to get into the basket, but Marc was open back at the free‑throw line but he had already committed to the shot, and they crowded the paint, and it was a tough shot.   
   
 Q.   How do you move forward knowing that no team has ever come back from a 3‑0 deficit in the NBA Playoffs?   
LIONEL HOLLINS:   Just like you would in any game.   You just go play, and you've got to go compete and let's see what happens.   We've been up, and we've got to win the fourth game.   I believe our guys will come out and battle.   San Antonio has played extremely well.   They earned the win tonight.   We fought and did a lot of good things, but in the end we didn't do enough good things.   They hurt us when they went small, just played pick‑and‑roll.   They actually hurt us in the pick‑and‑roll all night.   They've done a good job of taking away our strength and going inside to Zach, and we haven't made enough shots yet.   
   
 Q.   Strange game, you guys shoot more three‑pointers than they do but their big three really, really good tonight.   Is it at all surprising that Manu is able to come in and get the rebounds that he does, take them away from some of the bigger guys?  
LIONEL HOLLINS:   Well, he's coming from the outside and he's 6'6" and he jumps over people's backs.   He's a very athletic kid.   Our wings do the same thing.   We come back and jump over‑‑ they've got a little momentum.   Shooting more threes, you've got to make threes.   We made 7 for 20, but free‑throw line, 10 for 18 killed us.   We got beat on the boards.   We had 19 offensive rebounds, but we only got 21 second‑chance points.   We're not efficient with what effort we're getting, and that's where we have to be better is just be more efficient.   We can't gamble defensively.   We can't turn the ball over at crucial times offensively.   I thought we didn't close the quarter.   We came out of time‑out and they had two straight back doors by Ginobili.   Those were huge.   They hurt us.   
   
 Q.   Have you seen a team that has shot free throws well in the regular season and then seemed to struggle in the postseason like this one has, especially late?   
LIONEL HOLLINS:   I've seen all kinds of stuff.   I've seen players that shoot 50 percent during the season don't shoot 50 percent in the Playoffs.   I've seen players that shoot 80 percent don't shoot 80 percent.   Playoff basketball is different than the regular season, and you can't rely on all of that.   You've got to go play the new season at a different level, and if you don't, you'll go home, and we've been fortunate to get to this far, and we've got to play better if we want to continue.
