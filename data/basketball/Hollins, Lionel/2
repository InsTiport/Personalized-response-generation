 Q.   Every time it seemed like you got close, Parker made a play and then there was really nothing y'all to do to stop it.   
LIONEL HOLLINS:   He was outstanding the whole series, and he controlled the series with his penetration.   He made shots, made plays.   One game he has 18 assists, today he has 37 points.   He was huge.   But their team played well.   You've got to give them credit.   They played well from the very first game.   They came out, they had a game plan, they stuck to it through the whole series.   They didn't let us up for air at all.   We had a couple of chances in the two overtime games.   We had a chance tonight, but they earned the win.   They deserved to move on and I wish them the best because Pop did a great job and their team did a great job.   
I'm proud of our team and the way we battled and fought every game, including tonight.   We could have just gave up when they got up on us, but we kept battling and gave ourselves a chance, which is what we've done all year.   
   
 Q.   What did you tell your team after the loss about the season?  
LIONEL HOLLINS:   Same thing I just told you.   We had a great season, and they battled, and they battled tonight, and I was proud of them.   
   
 Q.   Quincy stepped up big tonight, 22 points, 7 of 11 from the field.   How impressed were you with the play of Quincy tonight?  
LIONEL HOLLINS:   I mean, I was impressed with our whole team.   He made buckets tonight and tried to make plays.   I'm impressed with our whole team with the effort that they gave.   
   
 Q.   How difficult was it throughout the series to deal with their defense on Zach?  
LIONEL HOLLINS:   Well, it was their defense not only on Zach but on Marc, on our pick‑and‑roll game.   They did an outstanding job of taking Mike away from the lane, didn't allow him into the lane.   They forced him into some turnovers by playing big on him and he couldn't make the passes that he normally makes.   But they did a nice job.   Tiago Splitter and Tim Duncan did a great job of sealing off Zach and their other people came down and crashed and blocked shots and they also helped on the offensive glass for the most part, and we just never could gain control of the paint.   They controlled the paint.
