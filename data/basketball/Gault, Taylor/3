THE MODERATOR:   Coach Joe Foley is joined by Taylor Gault, Ka'Nesheia Cobbins and Kiera Clark.   
COACH FOLEY:   They had a great game.   I thought both teams played hard.   These three here were unbelievable.   You take these three seniors with Ka'Nesheia with the turned ankle, so much fun to watch.   
   
 Q.   Taylor, can you talk about the start you and Kiera got, how did that lift things, mindset and morale?   
TAYLOR GAULT:   I came out with my set up.   I knew what I could do offensively and defensively.   That's the thought I had was to shoot and drive and do whatever I knew I could do best for my team.   
   
 Q.   Taylor, talk about the defensive effort you were able to do on Courtney Walker.   What did you feel you were able to do there?   
TAYLOR GAULT:   Oh, we were just trying to stop her.   That was our thought, stop her from doing that.   So I think we did pretty good on that.   
   
 Q.   Ka'Nesheia, can you talk about how our ankle feels, and how it felt when you got here and how that was feeling throughout the game?   
KA'NESHEIA COBBINS:   Once my adrenaline got going, it wasn't about my ankle, it was about helping my teammates and converting on offense.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
KA'NESHEIA COBBINS:   No, I wasn't really thinking about myself.   I just knew I had to tough it out because I didn't want to leave these two alone, the rest of my teammates hanging.   We made it this far.   I did whatever it took.   Rehab the pass two days to get ready for this game.   
   
 Q.   Kiera, can you talk a little bit about the fact this could have been your last game and you had the career high points, how exciting that was for you?   
KIERA CLARK:   Very exciting.   We came into the game, like this is all or nothing.   This might be our last game, what did we have to lose.   So we just locked in and had a great game.   
   
 Q.   Kiera, you came into the game about 90 seconds in.   Did you expect to get the call that quickly?   What is the mindset when you're coming into the game to get something going?   
KIERA CLARK:   You're ready.   Coach emphasized these last couple of practices, in order to help my team I'm going to need to shoot and score, and that's what I did.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk about your team was able to take the leave, late in the half, can you talk about what you feel your mindset was after having the lead and losing it?   
KA'NESHEIA COBBINS:   At any point in the game I just know we're going to leave our heart on the court.   And I just know that we're not going to leave that court without a fight.   And so I wasn't too much worried about it all, because I know what our team is made of and the kind of people we are on the court.   
   
 Q.   Taylor, several times they made a run at you guys in the second half and somebody, usually you, seemed to make a three.   Also Dawn had a big three.   How important was it that every time they came at you that you guys came up?   
TAYLOR GAULT:   That we came up?   Oh, my mind is on a different issue, just knowing that shots might not fall, but you can always play defense.   So even if shots don't fall, defense is key.   And anybody can play defense.   But being able to combat with them scoring, us scoring, that's always good.   That's what we do.   
   
 Q.   Kiera, you shot 52 percent in the second half.   Did you guys think a shooting day like that was needed to win?   
KA'NESHEIA COBBINS:   We had good practices, too.   So carrying it on to the game is just a plus.   
   
 Q.   Same one I asked them, did you think you had to play this well offensively to win?   
COACH FOLEY:   The only way we can combat it is score well.   That's the reason Kiera was in the lineup.   She's been scoring well, but we had to have that extra score in the lineup.   I'm a little surprised we stopped them as well as we did, especially 33 and the big kid.   So that helped out a lot.   But I felt like we were going to have to score pretty well to win.   
   
 Q.   Were you trying to take away one or two players from them or go man to man and see where you might match‑up?  
COACH FOLEY:   We concentrated on 33.   We were trying to give help.   We even switched on that first half.   And I think it paid off for us.   
   
 Q.   You've seen quite a few games from Taylor Gault and a lot of games she scored points.   Put this in perspective.   Seemed like she was always in a flow, and always hit a shot when she needed it?  
COACH FOLEY:   Big time.   Big time.   She's done it over and over.   But under this situation and the game we're in today, the pressure, I mean she's got ice in her veins, it's unbelievable what she does.   
   
 Q.   During the second half stretch Clark kind of took over.   How important was it to have two of them?  
COACH FOLEY:   I think they ‑‑ looked to me like they were really emphasizing make sure whoever Gault goes, you've got one or two coming at her all the time.   That opened it up for us a little bit.   You've got to give them credit to get the ball to the open man.   We talked about it the last two days.   I felt Clark would be the one to get the shot, and that's why we focused on it the last two weeks, and she came through for us.  
   
 Q.   You were controlling the first half, out played them.   What was your thoughts at halftime?  
COACH FOLEY:   Looked like maybe they had their heads down a little bit and I was a little worried.   We just talked about, hey, guys, we dominated the first 15 minutes.   We can do that.   We can go back out.   And I felt like we were very well conditioned at that point.   We beat a lot of teams in the last five minutes.   So I just told them, I feel like we'll win the game.   And I think they got their heads up a little bit.   
   
 Q.   What was your confidence level what you could get from Ka'Nesheia today with that ankle?   I don't know she was on the list of starters when we got here.   Was that a late change of heart there?   
COACH FOLEY:   All I was waiting for her was to go through warm ups and tell me, Coach, I'm ready.   I said do you want to go or stay?   She said I'm going.   I was just waiting on her.   I've got all the confidence in the world on every one of our players.   I think everyone is going to give up whatever it takes to do it all, they're going to give all to their team, whatever they can give.   
   
 Q.   Where will No. 700 rank in your career?  
COACH FOLEY:   Tops right now.   Top game.   It's unbelievable, playing against a friend.   Playing in an NCAA tournament.   It was fun.   And to play as well as we did.   We played great, and we deserved it.   And I'm proud of our kids.   
   
 Q.   You said it just now, a lot of people will look at it, but was this an upset?  
COACH FOLEY:   I told the team yesterday we were going to win.   I felt like we were going to score.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, Coach.
