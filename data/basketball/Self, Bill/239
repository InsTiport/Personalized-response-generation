<p>	Q.  With such a young team, what would you identify as your major strengths and weaknesses?</p>
<p>	Q.  So much tradition at your school.  Do you feel like a little bit pressured for everybody to step in so many holes to fill? </p>
<p>	Q.  Would you talk about just what you have seen of your freshmen class so far, if they can possibly live up to the publicity that they made?</p>
<p>	Q.  From the time you have spent so far with the freshmen, have they done some unique things either how high they jump or the way they play and pick up games?  Can you share some stories about stuff you saw that you really couldn't believe and can you beat them out for a starting spot?</p>

<p>	Q.  Can you beat them out?</p>

<p>	Q.  You inherited a lot of good players when you got to Kansas.  Maybe the road is a little rockier than you thought it might be.  Talk about the process of getting this program to the point you want it to be at?</p>
<p>	Q.  Easier or more difficult today to win with a young team and why do you think it might be easier or the same or more difficult to win with a young group?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned that you guys will play 80 games in summer and travel and they are more ready, but with that being said, do you spend a lot of time with some of these guys that have picked up some bad habits in the summer where they can just roll out a ball and go play, teach them some stuff?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach mentioned kind of a refreshing new add to this year, you played those other guys for what, ten years, seems like, has this been kind of a rebirth as it were for you as well? </p>
