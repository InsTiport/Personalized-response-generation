  Q. Do you enjoy having a match-up like that?  
 KENDRICK PERKINS: You've got to. I think it's getting to The Finals. You have to expect the competition to be equal. You've got to love the challenge and the great match-ups. It's difficult, guarding Bynum, guarding Gasol. It's a challenge.  
  
  Q. Do you see a big difference in Bynum?   
 KENDRICK PERKINS: No. I do see a big difference in Gasol. I think he got a lot stronger, got a little more aggressive from two years ago. Last night I think he came out and played with a chip on his shoulder. They played harder than us. He outrebounded -- I think he had more rebounds than me, Sheed and KG together. I don't think that can happen in order for us to win.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible).   
 KENDRICK PERKINS: You know, to be honest, I think that the way that game went last night, if they wouldn't have had Bynum they still would have won the game. Like I said, Gasol was huge. I think he was the biggest factor. Eight offensive rebounds by himself, that was great. And he had like three or four blocked shots. He played excellent, shot a high percentage from the field. He was the key player.
