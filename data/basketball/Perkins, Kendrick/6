  KENDRICK PERKINS:   I think as far as the team goes, we have one of the hardest playoff schedules this year, having to go through the Dallas, the Lakers, the Spurs and now having to face the Heat.   There really wasn't no free rides this year during the Playoffs.   I think we're battle tested, so I think we'll step up to the plate.

Q.   This will be the first time for this team here.   The odds makers are calling you the favorites.   Does that surprise you? 
KENDRICK PERKINS:   Well, I think one thing about us, we stay humble and just continue to work and play hard.   Like coach always says, it's the first time to four.   It's the first team to four wins that actually wins the series, so you can't walk in here and think we've got home court advantage so we're going to win the series.   The home court advantage team lost in The Finals last year. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
KENDRICK PERKINS:   It's always good when you're at home.   I think our fans give us a lot of energy, a lot of confidence, including myself, let alone the other guys on the team.   It gives myself a lot of confidence.   We do have the best fans in the world.
