 Q.   Talk about how you're going to disrupt their rhythm.   
KENDRICK PERKINS:   Just got to make sure we're getting all the loose balls and playing physical and making it a rough game.   We've got to make sure we're making it a half‑court set, half‑court game.   But we've got to make them play against our half‑court defense more and not getting out in transition.   We can't have guys having miscommunication on who's guarding who, and they're knocking down shots.   
   
 Q.   How do you get James going?   He's been so good all year but has struggled in this series.   
KENDRICK PERKINS:   It's hard to get going.   We've just got to make sure we keep encouraging him and tell him that he can play.   He's a great player.   He's one of our‑‑ if not the, he's one of the most important people on our team.   He's got the Sixth Man of the Year.   And he's done that by coming in off the bench and almost averaging 20 points.   We've just got to make sure we keep encouraging him, and I think James will be all right.  
   
 Q.   Do you think having been here before, can you talk about the argument that the Thunder are not experienced enough?   Is that overdone?  
KENDRICK PERKINS:   Yeah, it's overdone.   I feel like we've got to go get it.   It has nothing to do with our age or anything of that nature.   We've got to go get it.   We have no time to be making excuses about we'll get back here in the next few years.   It's here for us right now, and we've got a lot of ground to make up, but it's not out of reach and it's not impossible.   I feel like we just take this one game at a time, concentrate on Game 5, and the sky's the limit.
