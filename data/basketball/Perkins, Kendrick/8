  Q. Talk about making adjustments during the game.   
 KENDRICK PERKINS: I mean, one thing about it is I'm going to roll with whatever Coach does. It's whatever he wants to do, and whatever he's done before is obviously working. One thing about me is I'm never going against the grain. We won the game, so anything else after that don't even matter.   
  
  Q. Russell is saying the same thing, he's saying it's all about the team won. What do you expect to see out of him in Game 3? His first two games have been rather uneventful.   
 KENDRICK PERKINS: Well, yeah, I thought he played a great game yesterday. I thought he shot a great percentage, 7 for 14. I thought he played really well. You know, one thing about Russell is that he always plays with a chip on his shoulder. So one thing I know about him is that him not playing in the fourth quarter probably didn't anger him but probably motivated him. So prepare to see a different Russell Westbrook come Game 3.   
  
  Q. What did you think of KD's dunk last night?   
 KENDRICK PERKINS: It was mad.
