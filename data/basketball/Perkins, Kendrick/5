  KENDRICK PERKINS:   We've got to come out and attack first, we can't come out and just keep taking punches and expect to keep bouncing back.   They came out and were aggressive on both ends, playing more aggressive than we were, so we've got to do a better job.

Q.   When you guys fall back big like you have in the last two games, how big is that challenge to overcome a big deficit in the Playoffs?
KENDRICK PERKINS:   I mean, it's good, but we've got to stop digging holes.   As you can see, it comes back to haunt you, and you end up losing games that really matter.   We've got to do a better job in that aspect of just coming out and getting off to a better start in the first quarter.

Q.   Kevin has been so good in the fourth quarter, what can you guys do to get him going in quarters one, two and three?
KENDRICK PERKINS:   I think we've got to do a better job of getting him the ball, and Kevin has to do a better job of getting open and being more aggressive.   I think he has to ask for the ball more, and we've got to do a better job of getting him open on screens and letting him get to his spots and do what he does.
