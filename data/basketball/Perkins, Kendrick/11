  Q. You've been sitting one T away for a while, but now Rasheed has joined you. Do you have any advice for Rasheed on playing with six Ts?  
     KENDRICK PERKINS: He'll be all right. I think everybody on the team has just got to remind him to keep his focus. But he'll be all right.  
  
  Q. Are you amused by the fact that we're in Game 5 of the NBA Finals and you're the one giving advice on how to control emotions?  
     KENDRICK PERKINS: Yeah, I am. I mean, Sheed is going to be all right. I'm pretty sure it's not the first time he's been in this situation, so he should know how to handle himself.  
  
  Q. When you go into The Finals everyone on the team is kind of saying to you, Perk, no more techs, no more techs. Has anyone started saying that to Sheed?  
     KENDRICK PERKINS: I don't know. I'm going to make sure I tell him that today, though, when I see him. When we get out on the court I'm going to remind him.  
  
  Q. Is there a walk-away move when you don't like the call?  
     KENDRICK PERKINS: He tried that. That doesn't work.
