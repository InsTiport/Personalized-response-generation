 Q. Do you think you're going to play Sunday?
 KENDRICK PERKINS: Yeah, I'm going to play. Last night it felt like it was really swollen, and PJ was playing well anyway, and the most important thing is to get the win, it doesn't really matter who's on the court. The way I was feeling, I felt like I shouldn't have been out there last night. PJ ended up doing a good job.

 Q. How did you hurt it?
 KENDRICK PERKINS: I think I rolled it and I fell on it, and Derek Fisher fell on top of me.

 Q. Was that after Paul fell?
 KENDRICK PERKINS: Yeah, it was Paul. It was the next play down.

 Q. What went through your mind after you saw Paul on the floor?
 KENDRICK PERKINS: I was really mad at myself. You know, I was just trying to help him out and go challenge the shot, and he was probably just in the wrong place at the wrong time. But when he came back I was happy. But man, I was kind of mad at myself for a minute, though.

 Q. Were you and Paul in the locker room at the same time?
 KENDRICK PERKINS: Yeah, we were. But when I came in, he was coming out.

 Q. What went through your mind when you saw him come back on the court? Was it kind of a relief, saying I won't be the villain here?
 KENDRICK PERKINS: Yeah, that too, but it happens like that in a game. You know, I knew he was coming back. He came back. I guess I gave him some energy (laughter). You know, now just trying to get ready for Game 2.

 Q. (Question about physical presence.)
 KENDRICK PERKINS: Like I said, I was just kind of doing my role. I threw my body around a little bit and I kept Pau off the offensive glass which we needed to do, and I think we dominated the glass by like 12 or 14. You know, it probably wasn't my best night offensively, but guys had it going, and like I said, the thing about this team, you just never know. You've got so much talent, it could be anybody's night.

 Q. Does the ankle feel better than it did last night?
 KENDRICK PERKINS: Not really, about the same. You know, there's going to be pain. It's The Finals, so you've got to suck it up.
