Georgia - 56, Auburn - 52
THE MODERATOR: I'm joined by Auburn.
Coach, if you would start us out with an opening statement, please.
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: I thought we played extremely well in the first half.  We forced them into 16 turnovers.  I think the defensive pressure and energy wasn't there in the second half, didn't score like we needed to.
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.
Q. Katie, you had a big game, as usual.  A lot of steals, assists.  Tell us about the game you had today.
KATIE FRERKING: I mean, I was just trying to do everything I could to win.  That's part of it.  You got to play in every area of the game.
Like coach said, we had good pressure, we had good energy.  We just couldn't hit shots at key moments.
Q. Brandy, what was different in the second half?
BRANDY MONTGOMERY: I think we just didn't hit shots mainly in the second half.  Our defense was good.  We were getting turnovers.  We weren't converting on the other end.
That's kind of what the problem was, I think.
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.
We'll continue with questions for coach.
Q. Coach, what did Georgia do differently in the second half that you weren't able to force as many turnovers?
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: I don't know if they did anything differently.  I don't think our rotation was as quick as it was in the first half.  I know they got the ball to the middle a few times.
But I really think, you know, our defensive rotation wasn't as quick as it was in the first half.
Q. Georgia had a ton of offensive rebounds, second-chance points.  How big of a role did that play?
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: It was huge.  It played a big role in the first game we played against them.  They had 15 offensive rebounds in the first game, which gave them 19 points.
We knew we had to box them out.  They do a very good job on second-chance points, getting to the board.  We didn't do a good job of boxing them out.
Q. What kind of case can you make for post-season play?
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: We had a great non-conference.  We played some of the best teams in the country.  Our RPI is extremely high.  Our strength of schedule was very tough.  I mean, we're at least in the 40s in our RPI, even higher in our strength of schedule.
We've done everything we needed to, besides just the last win here with Georgia.  We have the body of work to get into the NCAA tournament.
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Thank you.
