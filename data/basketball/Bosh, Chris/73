  Q. What's it like being back in Dallas at the all star game in your home town?  
 CHRIS BOSH: It's cool. I've been having a good time so far. It's been a little bit of a ghost town because of the snow, but it's starting to pick up. I'm starting to get more requests, more phone calls, more begging.  
  
  Q. Coach said he hasn't seen snow like this in 28 years. Can you confirm that?  
 CHRIS BOSH: Well, I haven't even been living that long so I can't confirm that. From time to time freak accidents do occur, and I guess this All-Star weekend is going to be very unique because the weather is different, and I'm sure more things are going to be different as the weekend goes on. So I think it's going to be pretty good.  
  
  Q. How nice is it to have some home cooking and to catch up?  
 CHRIS BOSH: Honestly everybody thinks my mom is going to be cooking, and none of that is happening. She's too busy partying, everybody sleeps in, and they have a good time while I work.  
  
  Q. How nice is it catching up with some members of the U.S. Olympic team obviously on a non-competitive level?  
 CHRIS BOSH: I mean, it's cool. It's always good to hang out with those guys when we're not on the court because it's different when we're competitive. It's always a good thing.
