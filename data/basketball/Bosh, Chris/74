 Q. Does it bother you when people speculate about your future?
 CHRIS BOSH: No, you can speculate, that's fine. I don't mind. That's part of the business.

 Q. You had to go through that a couple of weeks ago. 
 CHRIS BOSH: Go through it a couple weeks ago? It is happening now. It's always going to happen. I understand that. It doesn't necessarily mean you have to be upset about it or flip out about it. People can have their opinions and they are entitled to their opinions. 
 Is it necessarily true? Nah, it is speculation. Right? That's all it is. Once I realized that, I was fine with it.
