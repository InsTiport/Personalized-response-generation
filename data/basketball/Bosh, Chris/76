Q.  Who did you enjoy playing with the most?
 
CHRIS BOSH:  I enjoyed playing with everybody, no one particular person.  Everybody shot the ball.  The second half we stepped our defense up and we just went out there and played the right way.  
 
Q.  What are you looking forward to for the next half of the season? 
 
CHRIS BOSH:  Well, I'm looking forward to turning our slump around.  We have to hit the ground running the second half.  We don't have much room for error at all as a team, so I'm looking forward to that challenge.  Our team is just stepping up and taking the challenge and hopefully, you know, getting on a roll, and you know, let's see what happens.  Hopefully we'll make the playoffs. 
 
Q.  Now that you're in your second year, how has your game developed and what can we look forward to from you in the future?
 
CHRIS BOSH:  I'm just being more aggressive.  I've stepped up my rebounding, as far as scoring is concerned I have a lot of -- a lot of great coaches that help me with scoring, getting extra shots.  Just working hard and stepping my role up on the team and trying to be more of a leader.  
 
Q.  What was with all of these minutes you played out there, do you get tired at all and are you going to be all right for Tuesday's game?
 
CHRIS BOSH:  I'll be fine.  This altitude got me a little bit but I probably needed a nice work out so it won't be too bad for practice on Monday.
