  Q. (Indiscernible).  
 CHRIS BOSH: I mean, it's tough -- you learn a lot about yourself. You learn about yourself in tough situations. Keep going through them. How you respond, how you react and how to take care of it. I think we've all been in situations where we really -- we weren't shocked when it started happening. We're at a point where we're more mature as players.   
  
  Q. What kind of impact has your high school coach had on your career?   
 CHRIS BOSH: It was a different stage. We talk every now and then. But, I mean, he's one of the guys that was instrumental, along with a bunch of other people, that helped me get to this level. Started out in high school, the coach, and taught me the fundamentals, and everything. There's no telling how much that helped me. He did a great job.   
  
  Q. How has your team changed since you last played Dallas?   
 CHRIS BOSH: That was December. That was about five months ago. It's changed a lot. Just our principles, what we're trying to do, as far as game plan is concerned, what we try to get on offense and defense and our chemistry. The small things, setting screens, getting to the basket, chemistry, working together. Everything has really been a lot better.   
  
  Q. First time in The Finals. You guys have played on the big stage, the playoffs. Is that something that prepares you, otherwise it's a pretty tough moment to adjust to?   
 CHRIS BOSH: Absolutely. We kind of have experience without having experience. We've been under the microscope for 100-plus games now. And almost a year. So I think all that has prepared us for this. This is a lot. If you're not used to it, it can really shock you and kind of get your mind off basketball.   
 At the end of the day, we know what it's about. We know when we get between these lines and they toss the ball up, that's another story.
