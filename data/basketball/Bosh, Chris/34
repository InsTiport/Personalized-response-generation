Q.   How do you make sure you guys stay even keel as you try to close out tomorrow night?
CHRIS BOSH:   Well, for one, you never really know until everything is over.   We want to come out with high intensity.   We know what's at stake, but all in all, we know this is the last home game no matter what happens.   We're a good home team, and just to be able to have this opportunity, you can't let it slip by.

Q.   Does LeBron James ever cease to amaze you?   The guy is cramping up and we're looking at him like what's wrong with him, and he still comes back and hits this crucial three‑pointer that a lot of people are saying is the biggest shot in his career thus far. 
CHRIS BOSH:   Well, you have to go‑‑ people have to realize, he's been through a lot.   He's been through a hell of a lot these past two years, and that makes you stronger.   Just the fact that he can just come out and play and show his strength, his strength of mind, his will to win, I think that's just really important for everybody else to see, not only us but everybody in the stands and watching on TV how much a person can really have some perseverance and really grow as their career goes on.

Q.   Not to bring up bad memories, but we all remember last year how bad that felt for you guys.   Do you think about that? 
CHRIS BOSH:   Every day.   Every day.   We think about that every day.   I'm reminded every time I walk in here.   I think it's a healthy thing for us, and it's helped us in situations like yesterday, because we could have came in relaxed yesterday, but we didn't.   They got off to a good start, but at no time did we think or feel that we're owed anything.   We have to show up.   We have to play together.   We have to play the right way, and we have to earn it.   It shouldn't be any other way.
