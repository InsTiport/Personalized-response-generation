		  CHRIS BOSH:   He's always been great, but I think he's become a better listener, working with guys a lot more, taking our opinions a lot more, and we've just been able to talk to him about the game and about what we can do to make better adjustments for everybody.   I think when coaches do that, it's just a growth thing that helps out the team because the players are more comfortable with what they're doing.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
CHRIS BOSH:   I mean, it's The Finals, so I think we all have something to prove.   But for me it was just another opportunity to win a game.   Our backs were against the wall.   It was a must‑win situation, just like every other situation is for us now.   Coming off the bench was great, and I just wanted to try to get back to my comfort zone and help this team out as much as possible.   I knew I was going to be able to play a lot more minutes, and it's a little bit easier playing heavy minutes coming off‑‑ I mean, starting the game, because you get your minutes right away, and I can get into a groove and really help the team out.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
CHRIS BOSH:   Sure, I mean, it's cool.   I need more.   My teammates need more.   It's all fine and dandy, but I don't think it was that good of a performance.   It was just another night at the office, really, for me, and I expect to do more.   I'm not satisfied with that by any means.   I hope nobody else was satisfied with that for me.   But I just want to continue to move forward and get better as the games go on.
