Q. Have you ever played a game in conditions like that?
    CHRIS BOSH:   Not in my lifetime, no, but as a pro, yeah.   That's like high school.   We had a certain gym that we played in and it felt like that, but it wasn't a playoff game.   It was pick‑up and after a while we could stop.

Q.   (Inaudible).
    CHRIS BOSH:   Well, I mean, it's a mix of both.   I felt we were aggressive enough, going to the basket.   Some were turnovers, but, you know, I felt we were aggressive enough to get to the line and, you know, we didn't get to it as much as they did.   We're going to continue to be aggressive.   You just have to keep attacking. 
    It's nothing really you can do about it.   It's out of your hands.   You take it to the hole.   We've got to take it to finish.   We can't rely on anybody making calls for us, you got to go to finish.   If you get fouled you get fouled, but if you make it, that takes care of everything. 

Q.   (Inaudible).
    CHRIS BOSH:   I mean, they're always meeting you at the rim.   They have very good hands.   But we're going to get to the line.   We're going to get to the line.   That's a big part of our game. 
    They got to the line 22 times last night.   I think we attack a little bit more than they do.   So I feel it's going to even out, and we're going to have our chances to be aggressive and really put some pressure on them. 

Q.   (Inaudible).
    CHRIS BOSH:   He was passing, making his teammates better, hitting guys, hitting open shots and attacking and going to the rim.   When they're playing that high pick‑and‑roll, we're going to have to lock in and make sure we make adjustments in that area.
