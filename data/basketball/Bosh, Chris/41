		  CHRIS BOSH:   It's always going to be with me until the season is over, but it's something that can be overlooked, and I can just concentrate on the game when that time comes. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
CHRIS BOSH:   Well, I knew we were.   Yeah, absolutely.   We had to because we want to win it all.   That's really all that was in my mind.   When I went down, it was kind of‑‑ it was a chance for me, and I knew what the situation was, so I just wanted to make sure I stayed with it mentally so that I can get back out on the court so we can have a chance to win this thing again. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
CHRIS BOSH:   I mean, it's going to happen, but any time you have any player out, you're going to have to make adjustments, and you're going to struggle a little bit.   But we had our backs against the wall a few times, and really just proud of my teammates for not making any excuses.   I mean, everybody could have made any excuse in the world why we couldn't overcome our adversity.   But we did it, we're here, and now we have a chance to capitalize on the situation.
