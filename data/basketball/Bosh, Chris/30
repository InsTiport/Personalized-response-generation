 Q.   Compare winning this to the NBA championship last year?  
CHRIS BOSH:   It was so close.   It's so close.   Winning is winning, but, you know, it was a good time.   We had a great time out there.   This is my first time participating in it.   So to actually win is pretty cool.   
   
 Q.   Do you get tight at all out there?   
DOMINIQUE WILKINS:   You get a little nervous, absolutely.   You get nervous, but being nervous is good sometimes.   It makes you concentrate more.   It was a total team effort, everybody made shots.   
SWIN CASH:   I missed a couple of the first ones.   So then you get mad and you try and rush it a little bit.   But then Nique came through with the halfâ€‘court shot.
