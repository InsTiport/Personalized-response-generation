  CHRIS BOSH:   I'm just satisfied in wins.   I don't really care too much about my offensive output because I know it's going to be there.   I just have to make my shots.   
   
 Q.   Do you try to focus on rebounds?  
CHRIS BOSH:   Always, always.   That's my main focus coming into this series anyway.   I know we're going to score enough points.   We have to stop them from scoring, make it as tough as possible as we can.   I'm a big, so I want to control the boards in some kind of way, have some sort of an impact, and if I do my job, everything else will follow there.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
CHRIS BOSH:   Yeah, it's a mix of both, design and opportunity.   The opportunities have to be there.   You can draw plays that will get you in the paint, but our bread and butter is always our defense.   We play defense and then we get to the open court.   There's a point in time you don't want to play against set defenses.   That's the main thing that we think about.   Playing against set defenses is not really a mixture for success for us, really for any team that wants to win a title.   In order to do that we're going to have to get stops on the defensive end and run into a lot of secondary situations if we don't get the fastâ€‘break points.   But if we keep doing that, focus on defense, that turns into a lot of great things for us.
