  CHRIS BOSH:   It's an honor.   I mean, growing up, I always imagined myself being in the All‑Star, and it's worked out every year.   Year after year, I get to come out here and just have fun and enjoy everything.  
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts about the league possibly going back into the Seattle market?   The team obviously went to Oklahoma City.   Obviously they like basketball there.   
CHRIS BOSH:   Well, I mean, it's tough.   We'll see how it goes.   Seattle is a great city.   I've been to Seattle a few times before they moved, but it's a fantastic city.   I enjoyed my time while I was there.   And I'm sure guys are basketball hungry out there.   I see that the WNBA team is doing well out there, so you never know how they'll go until you get the opportunity there.   
   
 Q.   I don't know how much of a historian you are but next week is the anniversary of Wilt's 100‑point game.   Is that a big deal?   Was it a ball hog?   Was it a star?   Will we ever see it again?  
CHRIS BOSH:   Probably not.   I mean, the game is so different now, and it's tough because there wasn't any film.   People can't really enjoy that moment because you can't watch the game.   I don't think there's many people who remember much about it.   I mean, it's tough to kind of‑‑  
   
 Q.   Is it almost like lore now rather than‑‑ we're so used to seeing things on tape, and now that you can't see it, it's almost like a fairy tale?  
CHRIS BOSH:   Well, almost, but it's in the record books; it's been done.   It's a fact.   So it's something that I think everybody appreciates, but that's one of the trail‑blazing things in the NBA that kind of laid the groundwork for where it is today.
