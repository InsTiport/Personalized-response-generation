  CHRIS BOSH:   Both teams are eager to get this thing started but ever since being in this position we have learned how to take it easy and get as much rest as possible and kind of just really just enjoy this downtime because when it starts, it starts.   Not worried about that too much, we just have to continue to use today as a springboard for tomorrow and continue to prepare.  
   
 Q.   Can you put into words how much fun it is to be here year after year, Chris?   
    CHRIS BOSH:   You know, it's not much fun at all.   It's work.   You know, I think later on we can look at it as fun and everything, but I don't know a lot of guys think it's fun.   I thought it was fun, too, but it's a lot of work, it's a lot of stress, a lot of worry, a lot of waiting.   
    You know, a lot of tired legs and all those other things.   But one day we will be able to look back and really enjoy it, but for now we have to keep our head down and continue to work.   
   
 Q.   Same opponent, now that you're here, does it feel any different this year as compared to last?   
    CHRIS BOSH:   Um, no.   Just being back in the same spots, kind of getting dÃ©jÃ  vu a little bit, coming to the gym.   Of course, it's a little different, 2‑2‑1‑1‑1 series, SanAntonio home court, there are some differences but for the most part we're pretty much the same teams.   They just have a better record this year and, you know, we're both trying to win it again.   
    I thinkthe people are getting what they want to see.   
   
 Q.   They're hell bent on revenge, Chris.   What do you think about a team that seems so determined in that regard?   
    CHRIS BOSH:   We understand how that is, and we understand that we've given them some sort of motivation.   But we have to expect that, and sometimes you can use that momentum against them.   But we have to take a few punches.   Especially on their home court, they're going to be very motivated and we understand that so we have to really not pay attention to all that stuff.   We have to focus on what we need to do and try and win as many games as possible.   
   
 Q.   Chris, you guys have been so good early in a series on the road of finding a way to get one of two, what is it about that even if you get blown away in one to be able to come back?   
    CHRIS BOSH:   You know, it's just confidence in what we do.   We understand that it's a series, win or lose, it doesn't make the series.   
    We always want to continually get better.   We always say that as a series goes on we get better and we get a feel for how we need to play and once we get that, we feel that we have a better chance as a series progresses.   But, you know, it's what we do.   If you want to be a good team, win a championship, you have to win on the road, and if we want to win a championship, we're going to have to win on the road.   Even though it's tough playing here, that's our story and we have to continue to do that.   
   
 Q.   You mentioned the stress and the worry that you feel, does that go away when you start to play the games or does that continue?   
    CHRIS BOSH:   That's the only time I don't worry, during the game.   That's why I appreciate playing the game so much because you can turn your brain off and go out there and read and react to the situations and just go play.   It's the time in between, having, like, eight days in between series, it's tough to deal with, but, you know, it's not easy being in this situation for either team, so it's just something that we deal with and it's just a part of the Finals.
