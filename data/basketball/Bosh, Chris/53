 Q. What adjustments will you have to make for Game 3? 
 CHRIS BOSH: I just have to do what I normally do. It's always worked for me, so it will work now. 

 Q. How does it feel to be back in your hometown? 
 CHRIS BOSH: It's cool. The home-coming, it got kind of old for me after a while. Just the fact that it's the Finals, being back at home has something to do with it. I'm just trying to stay focused and stay concentrated on what we're trying to do, what my job is, so we can capitalize on our opportunity right now. 

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 CHRIS BOSH: We're all sick. It's happened at the worst day. We have had two days to think about it. We had to think about it all day today. We had to think about it all day yesterday. It hurts. It hurts bad. Things like that happen. Things just happen like that. It's not about what happens, it's how you react. 
 So we're going to have to react the same way. It's still a series. We still have the opportunity tomorrow to take back home-court advantage. It's going to be a hostile environment. We have to be on our P's and Q's. 

 Q. Is there any added distraction playing in your hometown? 
 CHRIS BOSH: I mean, it's what you make it. I'm not making it that way. I'm not really worried about anything but Game 3. That's all I'm focused on right now. My family, they know I love them. I'll see them later. So I just have to focus on what I'm supposed to do right now, and they understand that. 

 Q. Chris, what's the mood of the team now? 
 CHRIS BOSH: We're all ready to play today. The basketball gods, they chose not to have this game scheduled. It's okay. I think it's good for us to hurt for another day. I think given the situation, the Finals being back in Dallas, Dallas has to be pumped. They have some momentum. We have to be in a -- that's an uncomfortable situation. We know we have to be at our best tomorrow night.
