Q.   Talk about what the part that you're looking forward to this weekend?   The best part. 
CHRIS BOSH:   My time off.   The little bit that I get.   It is an honor to be here, the game is always special, Saturday night is always special and the festivities and everything.   But I'm more so looking to get some rest as much as I can.

Q.   Last year you won the Shooting Stars Contest with your team.   Do you have anything planned for this time around?
CHRIS BOSH:   Winning it again.   I just ran into Dominique in the hallway on the way here and we decided we might as well win it again.   I love winning it as well.   The competition is awesome. 

Q.   How many times have you been here?
CHRIS BOSH:   Nine.   Nine All‑Stars.   Lucky man.   I'm just very blessed to be in this situation. 
I never would have imagined me being a nine‑time All‑Star.   So I have to thank my family and everybody who supported me throughout this long journey.

Q.   You had to make some sacrifices statistically, yet you're still here every year.   Is that gratifying to recognize that the coaches say, okay, Chris is maybe not going to score as much as he did, but he's still an All‑Star caliber guy, that he deserves to be here?
CHRIS BOSH:   Absolutely.   Just to make it in a different role is what's most important to me.   It's been, it's not been easy, kind of changing my game over the past few years, but it's been worth it.   We have got a few wins, got a couple championships.   I just had the chance to compete on the big stage at the highest levels of basketball and just to continue to be successful in a different capacity is awesome.
