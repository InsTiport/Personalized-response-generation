San Diego State   70
  Nevada - 48

THE MODERATOR:       We're ready to begin with SanDiego State. 
Coach, if we can start with some general comments on today's game. 
COACH TERRY:   I just want to start with congratulating Nevada on the season that they had.   It's been a tough road for them with their injuries, all the adversity they had to face.   Beat us pretty good on Friday. 
So congratulations to them on the season that they had. 
You know, I'm just really proud of the effort tonight.   We talked a lot about we're a blue‑collar team.   We don't have a standout kid and we have to do it by committee.   That's exactly what we did today.   Proud with the effort and proud we could come out with the W tonight. 
THE MODERATOR:   We'll take questions for the student‑athletes. 

Q.   Ariell, down the stretch you kind of had the game in hand.   Seemed like you sort of kept your foot on the jugular, gas pedal going.   Was there a sense of revenge in your mind for the loss less than a week ago?
ARIELL BOSTICK:   Yeah, it was part revenge, part we want to keep going in the tournament. 
We wanted to do it for our seniors.   I definitely wanted to do it for our seniors this year.   We weren't able to succeed last year.   Our determination was for the seniors to go out with that.   We had to keep the gas going until the last second, so I had to keep it going, keep the tempo up. 

Q.   Khristina, talk about the rhythm you had to sort of find with one another coming out in the second half, then you went on a 10‑1 run. 
KHRISTINA HUNTER:   I know halftime we really talked about how mostly we don't come out good second half.   We told ourselves that this is do or die.   There is no game after this.   If we lose, we lose. 
We needed revenge.   We knew we could beat them.   I feel like we got into each other, said we needed to do this for ourselves, show everybody we're about to make it. 

Q.   When you're going against a player like Mungedi, her size in the paint, do you have to change anything offensively in how you operate?
KHRISTINA HUNTER:   Yeah, we have to change a lot.   I know coach was telling us keep our elbows up, pump fake.   Usually it's easy to turn and score.   With her being 6'8", you have to do either a counter move or a pump fake, get her in the air and get your body into her. 
ARIELL BOSTICK:   Pretty much like she said, as a guard, you have to drive past her.   We finally figured it out and went around her, got a couple baskets. 
She scored I think 17, 15 points in the first half, then we held her to I think 5 points in the second half.   So we definitely locked her down, which we wanted to do the whole game.   We succeeded in that. 
Held her off on the boards. 
COACH TERRY:   We didn't lock her down (laughter). 
ARIELL BOSTICK:   We stopped her in the second half. 
COACH TERRY:   No, we slowed her down.   She's a great player. 
KHRISTINA HUNTER:   Stopped her in our hearts. 
COACH TERRY:   She's a great player.   She makes us change a lot of what we do.   They did a good job of taking us out of our offense with the zone they play.   With her ability to block shots, it's tough to score.   That's why we scored, you know, so poorly down there. 
We talked about that we needed transition, we needed to get out and run.   We needed to score early because once they get their defense set, they're a very good defensive team and she's a very good defensive player. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, ladies.   We'll continue with questions for coach. 

Q.   Coming into the game, given you had just lost to this team less than a week ago, had to be frustrating with the injuries they're dealing with.   Did you have to change a game plan to play against the game they played last week or did you have to change your game plan and your strategy?
COACH TERRY:   We just kind of fine‑tuned what we do.   Again, we watched that film.   I watched it at least five times.   The girls watched it on their own, then we broke it down. 
We had to make some adjustments.   They took us out of our postgame, did a good job of defending Erimma and Khristina in the first game.   We saw where we had opportunities to score, where we needed to take advantage of it. 
Again, our focus tonight was to get out and run.   Didn't do a great job of that in the first half, but in the second half, trying to score early, because once they get their defense set, it's hard to score.

Q.   I'm assuming that's what you told them at halftime, play their game, be aggressive?
COACH TERRY:   We gave up too many points, 21 points, she had 15 of those.   We talked a lot about defense.   I was pretty happy with our offensive output at that point. 
But, yes, we talked a lot about pushing the tempo, controlling the tempo, making sure we always had control of that. 

Q.   Coming out of the second half, they scored two straight baskets.   You called time‑out. 
COACH TERRY:   I got on Khristina Hunter pretty good.   I subbed her out.   She wasn't defending like I think she needed to.   I didn't think our effort from all five players was what it takes to win a conference championship.   I used that timeout to get on them pretty good. 
To Khristina's credit, she went down to the end of the bench, pouted for about a minute, then came back and played well. 
We can't take possessions off.   We're not good enough yet.   We need to continue to play hard and get it done that way. 
I didn't think we were playing as hard as we needed to to win. 

Q.   As far as the rebounds are concerned, you out‑rebounded them 33‑24.   On the offensive end, they had three offensive rebounds, Mungedi got none. 
COACH TERRY:   Part of that is misleading.   I'm proud of that because they killed us on the boards Friday. 
Their game plan was obviously to go inside so Mimi was shooting the ball a lot so she didn't have the opportunities to rebound. 
Taking a kid that averages 10 rebounds and holding her to four is a great accomplishment for us.   We have to do that to win.   We have to dominate the boards.   We are about to face a good rebounding team.   I'm glad we came out on the winning end of the rebounds tonight. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you very much, coach. 
COACH TERRY:   Thank you.
