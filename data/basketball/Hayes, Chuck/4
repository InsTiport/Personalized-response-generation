<p>	Q.  Chuck, I want to ask you a little bit about your little brother and your relationship with him and what that has meant to you. </p>
<p>	Q.  Chuck, I have heard somebody say you might be like Tubby's favorite player.  You seem to be real popular with everybody.  What is it about yourself that endears you to the fans?</p>

<p>	Q.  The two of you, I don't know if you guys are prepared for this or not.  What kind of role will you play in defending Bogut down low?</p>
<p>	Q.  People often talk about teams playing their best basketball down this stretch.  Do you feel like you personally are playing your best basketball?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chuck, this region has three coaches who have been to the Final Four.  Coach K obviously gets a lot of attention.  How would you make a case, or might you, for your coach, being among the best coach in the country?  And so what makes him that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chuck, it seems Utah, every word out of their mouth is saying the pressure is all on you.  They seem to say they are playing without pressure, they have nothing to lose.  They think that is the big advantage for them. </p>
<p>	Q.  Chuck, your senior year, Florida robbed you of the chance of cutting down the nets in Atlanta.  Do you anticipate doing that here?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chuck, can you talk about any sense of a buzz about people wanting to see you guys and Duke and how you are avoiding thinking about that?</p>
<p>	Q.  How you are avoiding trying to think about it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Bogut and what you have seen on film of him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chuck, does Kentucky's tournament history give you confidence or is that irrelevant?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chuck, Kelenna seems to be in rare form.  He seems to be in a good mood.  He is usually reserved.  How would you explain that he seems to be very happy?</p>

<p>	Q.  Are you hearing that from fans?  Are they talking to you about it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just media?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think Andrew Bogut has seen a team that can throw two seven footers at him and the six-ten?</p>

<p>	Q.  Tubby, when someone brings up the '98 championship game, what are your memories of that? </p>
<p>	Q.  What do you guys have to do to make sure Bogut doesn't have a monster game?  Obviously if he does have a good game it will hurt you guys.  What do you have to do to make sure that doesn't happen?  When you see him on film what do you see?</p>
<p>	Q.  Again with Bogut, in recent years or maybe further than that, when we talk about great college basketball players the true centers don't come up.  Why in your opinion has the game evolved away from the true big man?</p>
<p>	Q.  On the same line you called him a pro.  How unusual is it to see a big man of his skills even at a college?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just being around the team last week, it seems like everybody has an affection for Chuck Hayes including yourself.  Is it the fact that he is a four-year guy and there aren't that many of those in this era?</p>
<p>	Q.  When did Bogut first come on your radar?  Did you see him play in the Olympics?</p>
<p>	Q.  Tubby, in what ways might coaching in March be different than any other time?</p>
<p>	Q.  Tubby, can you speak to the idea of depth in the tournament and how much or how deep you are willing to go in these games versus the regular season and how much of a factor you think it is in the tournament in general?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, this is the time of year when a lot of us like to look at the brackets and pair how many teams out of a certain conference are getting this far.  Would it be fair to characterize that as a down year for SEC, or why or why not?</p>
<p>	Q.  How is a 20 year old like Bogut a better overall basketball player than a 20 year old American college student?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have any sense that people just assume it will be you guys playing Duke when this comes to Sunday?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just whether you have a sense that people automatically assume that will happen? </p>
<p>	Q.  Tubby, when you are playing a guy as good as Bogut is, is it problematic that you focus so much on him, that you can't follow the other players on this team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, how would you evaluate Azubuike's play in the tournament so far?</p>
