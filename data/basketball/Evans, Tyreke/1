 Q. What are you most focused on when you're trying to get a specific teammate involved? How does your mind-set go when you know you want to get a certain player early in the game? 
 TYREKE EVANS: Just try to find them on court, penetrate their way, and if they don't help, try to take it on. 

 Q. When you play the point guard position, what in your opinion is the most important --
 TYREKE EVANS: Just try to take care of the ball and be the point guard role.

 Q. What do you enjoy most about this weekend?
 TYREKE EVANS: Usually the atmosphere. At one time you see all the guys together for a week, so the All-Star Weekend is for guys to enjoy it. 

 Q. How is your foot?
 TYREKE EVANS: Just the same thing, seeing the doctor on Monday. 

 Q. When do you expect to be back on the court?
 TYREKE EVANS: Hopefully as soon as possible. 

 Q. What are your thoughts on DeMarcus tonight and what he's going to do?

 Q. How do you deal with the mental part of the fact that you might not just be able to get right this year? 
 TYREKE EVANS: You never know. The season is almost over, but just want to make sure that my health is right before I do anything. 

 Q. You probably expected to be playing in the game on Sunday this year after the rookie season you had?
 TYREKE EVANS: Definitely, the rookie season I had, and then to come back with an injury -- I just want to make sure I'm 100% before I make any moves and make sure I come back strong. 

 Q. Michael Jordan had a problem with his foot in his second year in the league, too, and he came back pretty strong. Do you ever think about that? 
 TYREKE EVANS: Hopefully I could. Hopefully I could come back strong.
