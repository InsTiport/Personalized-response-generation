THE MODERATOR:   Coach, a few opening comments and then questions.   
COACH RAY:   Obviously, I was really disappointed the way we started the game.   The situation there where I thought we got a couple offensive rebounds and it gave them a lot of energy.   I just think a team as good as NorthCarolina, you can't give those guys second opportunities to score the basketball.   
Then offensively, I knew it would be a struggle a little bit, but I thought we kind of lost our composure and turned the ball over way too much.   So we've got a lot to build on.   I'm just trying to make sure our guys continue to fight and compete and grow from this and get better.  
   
 Q.   How tough is NorthCarolina?   
COACH RAY:   From the score, they're really tough.   They've got a lot of talent.   They just wear you down with so many talented kids they can put in the game.   They've got so many bodies.   Obviously we're in a disparity as far as bodies, but they're obviously a good basketball team.  
   
 Q.   Wendell, maybe you can comment on about your team and where you're at right now, and playing a tough competitor like NorthCarolina?   
WENDELL LEWIS:   Like Coach said, we got off to a bad start, and then we got two easy offensive rebounds and gave them momentum in the game.   In my eyes I feel like it got to us and we kind of just put our head down.
