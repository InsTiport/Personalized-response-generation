  Norfolk State   50

THE MODERATOR:   Spartans from Norfolk State, Pendarvis Williams and Kyle O'Quinn represent the student body.   We will ask Coach Evans to open up with a statement. 
COACH EVANS:   Hats off to Florida.   They're a very, very good basketball team.   They came out and executed well.   They prevented us from doing things we wanted to do. 
I'm extremely proud of our team.   We have done things that no one has ever done before at your University.   I'm proud of them.   I appreciate their effort.   It wasn't the type of game that we would have liked to have played but, again Florida did a great job. 

Q.   Kyle, obviously it was a rough outing for you tonight.   What was the difference tonight as opposed to Friday? 
KYLE O'QUINN:   The ball didn't go in the hoop as smoothly as it did.   That's always frustrating.   When your season is on the line and your college career is on the line it gets frustrating.   That's what it did tonight. 

Q.   Can you talk about preventing you from doing the things they wanted to do.   How did they do that? 
PENDARVIS WILLIAMS:   Well, they pressured us and got us out of our offense.   We were not as low as we wanted to be, and they pushed us out of our plays and they executed well. 
KYLE O'QUINN:   They played good defense, we played bad offense.   Every time we had a break they would kill us with a three.   One of the best three‑point‑shooting teams in the country and they showed that tonight.   It was tough all around for us tonight. 

Q.   Kyle looked like almost throughout the game your jumpers were hitting front iron.   Were they pushing away the from the basket or did you guys lack legs tonight? 
KYLE O'QUINN:   I don't know the answer, I would go back and fix it but the ball didn't go in the hoop.   Not too much to be said about that. 

Q.   Kyle, when it turned into a 25‑0 run, what were you thinking on the time‑out at that point?   What do you think when it's just completely getting away from you? 
KYLE O'QUINN:   When you look down at the team everybody wants to fight back.   We know this was going to be tough.   You have to have things go our way, and tonight when we made a break nothing goes our way.   When they hit a three, it kills the momentum.   It pushes you back and pushing you back.   When you see the scoreboard it's not going the way you want it, it's tough. 

Q.   Guys, when you left the court, the crowd rose and seemed like they were giving you an ovation.   What were your thoughts on that as you left? 
PENDARVIS WILLIAMS:   Obviously they're glad that we pulled off an upset against Mizzou, but we wanted to compete better than we did tonight.   Things didn't work out that way. 
KYLE O'QUINN:   Obviously if you look at what we came from this is a big step.   For the program, for the seniors, for everybody, our whole university.   So for everybody to witness that step toward we took as a University you got to be proud.   You got to be proud.   You have to be.   We were not satisfied with losing but we knew coming in, you either win a national championship or you lose.   That's the nature of the game.   Put our hats off because they know we did something that's never been done at our University before. 
THE MODERATOR:   Gentlemen, thank you for your participation.   Questions for Coach Evans. 

Q.   Coach, anything you would have done differently in the last day and a quarter in preparation for your kids?   Kind of getting full of the experience, did you sense they lost concentration? 
COACH EVANS:   I think we came in with a good game plan, I think Florida executed.   They were physically with us, they tried to take Kyle away.   They double teamed him and forced others to make shots.   We didn't shots.   They were able to extend us and they made transition baskets. 

Q.   Anthony, this can't be the first time you've faced a team like this, why did their defense work tonight? 
COACH EVANS:   They're a different type of athlete.   Having Walker and those guys get up and pressure you 94 feet is different than some of the other teams we played. 
Maybe fatigue, we don't want to make excuses about it.   They did a great job.   Hats off to them. 

Q.   Anthony, did you get a feeling at some point in this game, this Florida team has been here before and done this before and this has caught up with us because we have not? 
COACH EVANS:   Absolutely.   They have a coach who has won two national championships.   Clearly it was my first time and our team's first time.   Clearly we get back to this point we will know how to handle it, and how to get to the next step. 

Q.   Coach, does this weekend allow your program to go to a whole different place?   Are you prepared budget wise, facility wise, recruiting wise to make a new step? 
COACH EVANS:   I think so, making it to the tournament helps you financially but the exposure we received from Kyle and all the players to everything, the University, I think it will help our profile.   We should be able to recruit a different athlete, different type of player.   I think we will be able to compete and get back here. 
THE MODERATOR:   Anything else for the Coach of the Spartans?   Thank you very much, Anthony.
