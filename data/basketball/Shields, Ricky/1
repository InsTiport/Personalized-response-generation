<p>	Q.  They're such a tough team, the shooters have such range.  Can you talk about late in the game, how you were able to defend that diverse offense that they have. </p>
<p>	Q.  How much of a factor is it when the best three-point shooter in the BIG EAST going down with three minutes to go?</p>
<p>	Q.  Separated his shoulder when he collided with Marquis. </p>
<p>	Q.  You had mentioned several times that to control the game or get a win in a game, the first five minutes of the game...</p>
<p>	Q.  Ricky, can you talk about getting to the second round for the first time in your career. </p>
<p>	Q.  Ricky, given the two field goal percentages, you guys shot decently, was this more like the team that helped beat Saint Mary?</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys executed so well late in the game on both sides of the court.  What is the biggest difference in a game like this, and some of the games during the season when you didn't execute as well as you did tonight?  What's the difference, do you think? </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible). </p>

<p>	Q.  That first Syracuse game, letting that one slip away, did that have any lasting impact on your team? </p>
<p>	Q.  Quincy, you all came out grinning, waving to the crowd.  What was going through your heads?  Were you like, "This is fun"? </p>
<p>	Q.  In the shootaround. </p>
<p>	Q.  They were on the bubble, they really needed this game.  Did you feel that? </p>
