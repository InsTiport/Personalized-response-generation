<p>	Q.  As you go about rebuilding your program, what's the philosophy in terms of going for the type of players that stay three, four years as opposed to maybe a big splash, very high-profile one-year recruit? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you sense something different at the start of the second half, something coming on the floor, warm-ups, the first few minutes when everything seemed to change?</p>
<p>	Q.  Without trying to paint it with too broad of a brush and not taking it away from any of the great strides you guys have made, how do you explain this team's inability to play away from home in contrast to the way they played at home this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you agree with him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ricky, would you address what Coach was just talking about?  Do you have a change of intensity? </p>
<p>	Q.  Gary, to what do you attribute the disparity in field goal percentage for Rutgers in the two halves, 52 as opposed to 27? </p>
<p>	Q.  Gary, you talked about BC working hard.  Do you think you worked hard in the second half?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ricky, does the last three games, even as well as you played against Georgetown, does that take anything away from what you guys have accomplished this year? </p>
<p>	Q.  What does it mean for this team to go to the NIT all things considered? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is it disappointing at all to have gotten this close to a goal that no one thought would be achievable in the first place, but yet to be in this place and not reaching it? </p>
