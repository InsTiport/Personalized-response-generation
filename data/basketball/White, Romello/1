 THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Romello.
 Q. Even though y'all lost tonight, you think y'all proved you are an NCAA tournament team?
 ROMELLO WHITE:   Definitely.  I feel like we came out and played hard.  I felt like we had a great game.  We fought till the end.  I feel like we definitely proved we're an NCAA tournament team.  LSU is a tremendous team.  They got a lot of great pieces.  They're just a well-coached team, yeah.  I give them credit.
 But I definitely feel like we're a NCAA tournament team.
 Q. Drastic difference, looked different than the first game.  What enabled you guys to be successful this evening?
 ROMELLO WHITE:   I feel like it was a couple of toughness plays down the stretch that we just didn't come up with, a couple 50/50 balls.  Just a couple fouls, just a little toughness things that we didn't execute today.  I feel like that's what caused us to lose today.
 THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
