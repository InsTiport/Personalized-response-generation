 Q. How do players deal with trade rumors?
 DAN MAJERLE: That's no fun. In '95 I was starting in an All-Star Game and there was a lot of talk about trade rumors. That's no fun as a player. You grow to know that's part of the business, and that's something that will have to -- you will have to go through at one time or another. 
 Any time a guy like Kareem gets traded, anybody can be traded. It is just part of the business.

 Q. Is this week normal? 
 DAN MAJERLE: Of course. As I said, I'm going to show up and do my job and we will just see how it goes. 
 I think players worry more about the trades and those kinds of things, and I'm sure that's on their mind. 
 Like I said, that's part of the business. Players are really good at just getting into the game and focusing on what they have to do. That's going out on the court and playing hard. That's what most of those guys are really good at doing. 

 Q. How is it going? 
 DAN MAJERLE: I knew coaching would be a challenge. It is something I wanted to experience.
