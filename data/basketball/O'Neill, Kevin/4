  JAY BILAS:   Thanks, Eric.   Our next coach is Kevin O'Neill, having the distinction of coached at every school that's represented in the Maui Invitational this year except for Chaminade.   And he's got his eye on that job in the future.   Kevin has coached at Marquette, Tennessee, Northwestern, head coach at Arizona, and now your fourth year at Southern Cal, Kevin.
    COACH O'NEILL:   Fourth.
    JAY BILAS:   Yesterday‑‑ all these coaches have apparel deals and wear this wonderful, wonderful gear.   And Kevin came yesterday dressed much like he is today except but he didn't wear anything that said USC on it.   He looked like he was going to go grab a metal detector, go out on the beach and look for loose change after practice. 
    UNIDENTIFIED COACH:   He did.
    JAY BILAS:   One of the great tacticians in the game and one of the great guys in the game, Kevin O'Neill.
    COACH O'NEILL:   Roy, are we sure he's a graduate? 
    COACH WILLIAMS:   I won't answer that one.
    COACH O'NEILL:   It's a great honor to be here.   We're excited about our team.   I've told numerous people that we have a team full of rejects, starting at the top, myself.   Bunch of guys that are transfers.   When we took over with sanctions put together transfers and junior college guys. 
    I think we have a good team.   We have a fun group.   I like our team, which is hard to do sometimes as a coach.   But I really like them.   And I think we're going to be a pretty good team when it gets all said and done.   This is a great event for us.   We'll find out a lot about ourselves as we move forward.   Thank you.
