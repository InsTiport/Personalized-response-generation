THE MODERATOR:   We have Coach O'Neill.   Opening comments, Coach?   
COACH O'NEILL:   I thought Illinois played a great game.   Our first two games, we played with great force defensively, rebounding the ball.   Played very well offensively.   Tonight, we didn't do anything.   We got setback on our heels and once they started making shots, their confidence grew and ours went down.   
We played better in the second half, but it's easy to play when you're behind, and it's harder to play when you've got a lead like they had.   It would be easy to say, well, they made a lot of shots.   Well, it's our job to make them miss, and we didn't make them miss.   It's unfortunate.   I'm disappointed in the way we played.   I certainly hope that's not indicative of our team, because I think we have a pretty good team.   But tonight we didn't do anything we needed to do offensively or defensively.   
We shot some quick shot that's just fed into their transition and shot‑making in the first half, and then we just didn't defend the way‑‑ I mean, I've been at SC for four years now, and we've never gotten beaten that bad.   We had a bad team last year, and didn't get beaten that bad.   So what we've got to do is regroup tonight.   We've got to play Texas tomorrow.   Whoever we play the third day, we get two more days.   
The good thing about it is we're playing right off.   Hopefully we can get that taste out of our mouth tomorrow morning or at noon tomorrow, whatever it is.  
   
 Q.   Any idea why you guys came out like you did?   
COACH O'NEILL:   No idea.   We actually went light yesterday.   Had a short shoot-around today, no clue.   I've been in basketball a long time, all kinds of different levels, and I've seen a lot of games like this at different levels.   But they're always disappointing when they happen, and they're always hard to deal with.   So what we have to do is regroup and make sure this doesn't happen to us again.
