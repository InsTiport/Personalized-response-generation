COACH O'NEILL:   I'm really proud of our guys bouncing back.   We had a late game last night and a noon game today.   Both of us were in desperate mode.   We got whacked last night in the first half, and they lost to Chaminade.   
So you have two teams that are pretty good team that's desperate mode.   It was that kind of game.   It was a rock fight, and I thought we did a great job of executing offensively and defensively down the stretch.   We had open looks, missed them.   But I liked our shots.   I like how hard we played.   I like the fact that in overtime we kind of took over the game.   That's why we were able to get the win.   
We're fortunate because Texas is a good team.   When they get Kabongo back, they'll be a really good team.   We've just got to turn around and do a great job of getting ready for Marquette tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   You talked a little about the bounce back, but it seemed like both teams were really struggling to shoot the basketball in the second half.   You guys kind of survived the battle.   Is that a good sign?   
COACH O'NEILL:   It came down that I thought both teams played hard defensively, and made it hard on the opponent.   We made enough to win.   When you're playing in one‑possession games like that, free throws are critical.   We missed some at one stretch, but then in the overtime, we made them and gave ourselves a chance to win the game.   Really proud of our guys and their effort.   
We played four game this is year, eight halves, and we've played seven really good halves.   We just got smacked last night in the first half.   But hopefully that will be a lesson for us moving forward.   
THE MODERATOR:   Jio, you had 11 points and 8 assists.   
JIO FONTAN:   I think for the most part today we just did a better job of going out there and sticking with the game plan.   Our coaching staff does a great job of coming into us with a great strategy on how to stop their offense.   For us, necessarily, where we're going to get our open shots from.   Yesterday wasn't a good start to it.   If I want to take responsibility as a leader, I have to do a better job.   Today I felt like I did a little bit of a better job, and the team did a great job of staying together and playing through adversity.
