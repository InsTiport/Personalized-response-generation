THE MODERATOR:   We're joined by Coach Dixon.   Coach, some comments on tonight's game? 
COACH DIXON:   We don't feel really good about our performance tonight.   Disappointed.   I told our players we have an hour to feel sorry for ourselves and get ready, after that.   After dinner we're getting ready for Kansas State.   We know they're good as well, and we'd played against a very good team tonight who is older, quicker, stronger to the ball to us, and it showed.
So we're going to come back and play better tomorrow, and that is the message we got across to our guys.   They're very good.   They're very well‑coached.   They're big, they're strong, they've got depth, and we hopefully learned a lot from this game and going forward here.   So I give them a lot of credit.   We've got obviously some things to work on.   If you told me we outrebounded by 14, I would have felt pretty good going into it.   I would have felt really good.   The turnovers were extremely costly.   We're a low‑turnover team, but right now we definitely struggled with that tonight, and it got them a lot of transition baskets.   So we know where our problems lie.   We'll address it, and we'll get better.

Q.   Early in the game they had, I think it was three.   You guys had three shot clock violations.   Couldn't seem to get into your offense.   Was it just trying to get used to their size and athleticism, and what they were doing on defense that was causing that?   
STUDENT‑ATHLETE:   I think that's pretty much on me, and I've got to learn from it and take it into tomorrow's game and make sure we're better off, especially early. 

Q.   Something you guys haven't really seen yet this season, how tough is that to adjust to for you the way you played last night against Chaminade and then going up against a team like that.
STUDENT‑ATHLETE:   I played against guys my height or taller, I think it was the guards, pulling, 6'7", 6'8", the point guard was 6'4", and you've got Shepard who is also the other one who is about 6'8".   And they're coming in and rebounding.   So I think that expected it more so the first game.   The first game I would get my man and go for the rebound.   This game I would seal my man, and it was me, my man, and Shepard, and Polee, so it was difficult.   Just the taller, more athletic, and also they were just going after rebounds harder than we were, and they just wanted it more than us as a team.   So I don't think it was any different.   I just think they wanted it more than us.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions for the Coach. 
COACH DIXON:   We played on it.   I don't think it was effective.   We got to get better with our man‑to‑man defense.   They hurt us inside in the zone, and they hurt us up top in the zone.   So question ran it about four or five possessions, and I think they scored every time.   So, you know, they're good and we're not defensively where we need to be.   That's where it went off.   Man or zone.   And we did both.   We did well.   We wanted to control the boards.   I thought we got hurt on the boards in the zone and that did occur, and then obviously they hurt us by interior passing as well against the zone as well.   You can look at different ways, but they beat us soundly both on man and zone. 

Q.   San Diego State's stuck down there in the corner of the country.   Do you have a sense how good they are and how good this team can be? 
COACH DIXON:   I do.   I believe that.   The size, once you play against them you see how big they are.   They've got depth.   They added another guy so they seem to have a lot of guys, a lot of guys that can play and they're very experienced.   You've got transfers from all over the place, and they're old, and they're big.   They're well‑coached and they know what they want to do, and they stuck with it. 
But I think the depth is the thing that really stands out.   You have Pope back in there, and you see Chol making free throws and knocking down jump shots.   It's, again, they've done very well in the transfer market, that's for sure.

Q.   I know Cameron's still out for the year.   But how much is the lineup still a work in progress?   Guys are playing sort of minutes, fluctuating, game‑in, and game‑out, Joel hasn't played much the past couple of games.   Ryan's playing more. 
COACH DIXON:   Ryan was hurt, Derrick was hurt.   So those are things that have factors into a lot of things.   We have had a unique situation.   There is no question we've got to battle through it, and we've got to get better as the year progresses.   That's where we're at.   Nothing is set in stone, as you might expect.   When you have guys out that can't play in certain games and then practice, you're going to have fluctuating minutes for obvious reasons. 
Obviously, Cameron will be back in where in the near future, and we've got to get better.   So we're a team that certainly isn't where we‑‑ who we thought we'd be first off.   And we've got to figure that out.   We lost to a very good team today.   That's clear.   So hopefully we'll learn something from a very good team.

Q.   Jamie, was it their length on defense that was giving you guys problems early in the game?   Is that why you were getting a couple of shots? 
COACH DIXON:   I said to our guys we did exactly what we wanted to do.   Came out, ran a play and executed it the way we wanted to do it.   Got a bucket, got a charge on the first play, and those are two things we emphasize.   The next 39 minutes we seem to go doing things different in how we planned and prepared.   I mean, penetration, we were forcing shots and that's not who we are.   We made bad decisions to pass to the wrong guy.   They're going to help down, and we've got to kick out.   We just didn't handle the adversity well and what they did.   That's my fault for not preparing them and having them ready to handle that.
