<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little, coach, about Oklahoma offense and rebounding?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering if you could describe what's gone into Fife's dramatic improvement in his outside shooting?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've talked in the past about what Jeffries has to do in certain situations.  Just what do you look at as far as his expectations as to what he has to produce for you tomorrow? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you talk briefly about Oklahoma and their rebounding.  Can you expand about what kind of their strengths and weaknesses are?  You hear this is a Michigan State team in their prime.  That is a fair comparison? </p>
<p>	Q.  What is Tom Coverdale's status?  How hard did he go this morning? </p>
<p>	Q.  Probably a kind way to describe Dane Fife is to say he's kind of pesky on the court.  Can you describe what he brings to your team, and also if you were in maybe the other team's shoes, what would it be like to play against him? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said you didn't know how much Coverdale would play.  Do you think Perry is ready for the pressure that Oklahoma will bring and the pressure of a game as big as this? </p>
<p>	Q.  Which player or players would be most likely to check Price? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you expect the focus of Indiana's defense to be against your 3-point shooting? </p>
<p>	Q.  Taking you back to the Pepperdine game your first year.  You remember the press conference when you said you didn't feel your legs when you walked out on the floor.  How do you think your legs will feel tomorrow about 6:00? </p>
<p>	Q.  In your mind, some of the frustrations you overcame with your speech in the past, have you made greater progress in your mind than even as a coach?  How did that come about in terms of getting past some of the problems you had with it? </p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of coaches in the NCAA tournament talk about matchups, how the bracket often is determined by matchups.  Do you agree with that theory?  What kind of a match-up is Oklahoma for your team? </p>
<p>	Q.  Your son Antoine may be the most famous three-year-old in the country.  What is it like having him along?  Does he have any idea what daddy has been doing the last couple weeks? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel like your team is the underdog here, like everybody is making you out to be?  Are y'all using that role, trying to use it to your advantage? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk a little bit about when you took over the head coaching position and how difficult that was to succeed Coach Knight, and what kind of reception did you get from the Knight loyalists?  What kind of reception are you getting from them now? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about what Jared has brought to this team, and if you think that he really needs to have a break-out game for you to win? </p>
<p>	Q.  With all the talk about coaches that are here, that can't win the big one, all that sort of thing, do you have an appreciation for getting here this quickly and realizing that that's a portion that you're not going to have to go through the road? </p>

<p>	Q.  Tom, can you talk about the ankle, how it feels, what you think you might be able to do tomorrow? </p>
<p>	Q.  Dane, there's been a lot of talk about the fan support for this program so far this tournament.  What did it mean today to see all those fans out there for practice? </p>
<p>	Q.  Dane, Coach Treloar has been called the coordinator for the offense and defense.  Can you talk about his influence? </p>
<p>	Q.  Tom, how frustrating is it for you to reach this point and not be 100%? </p>
<p>	Q.  Tom, how effective were you this morning as far as practicing? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jared, can you tell us what your coach has said is the best guess to be guarding you?  What you have to do to be successful against them? </p>
<p>	Q.  Dane, you're known for your style of getting under other people's skin.  Can you describe your style and also address the difference between being a dirty player and an aggressive player? </p>
<p>	Q.  Dane, could you talk about the growth of Coach Davis over the last two years and could any other coach have you here, including Coach Knight? </p>
<p>	Q.  So many people have talked about this Final Four for Indiana being closure, to move beyond a chapter, move beyond Coach Knight.  Knowing your feelings for Coach Knight, do you resent that kind of talk? </p>
<p>	Q.  Tom, you were able to get so many good open looks for 3-pointers against Kent State.  Do you expect to be able to do that against Oklahoma?  What kind of adjustments do you have to make? </p>
<p>	Q.  Dane, I'm wondering if you had seen Jared play when he was in high school and what you thought of him then?  Then once you guys got to play with him, what your impressions of his game became. </p>
<p>	Q.  Dane and Tom both, this goes back to the answer about your aggressive play.  I think both of you play a lot the same way.  I wonder if Tom can't play that way tomorrow, how much does that take away from the team's game and the way you were able to play all season? </p>
<p>	Q.  Dane, could you discuss a little bit about how different it is preparing for a game this big when you have this uncertainty about whether Tom can play or not hanging over you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Dane, I'm wondering if you're stunned, bored, amazed by the news that several former IU luminaries such as Steve Downing say they'll be cheering for Oklahoma on Saturday? </p>
<p>	Q.  Dane, would you talk about the freedom you have to shoot the three now under Davis?  Would you have ever thought about taking that one in transition that kind of put Kent State away? </p>
<p>	Q.  Tom, can you describe what this 24/7 treatment of the ankle involves and what you've been doing? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jared, offensively, trying to go through and taking on what's a very tough defensive team, coach talked about Michigan State, talk about the Oklahoma defense. </p>
