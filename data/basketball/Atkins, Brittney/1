OKLAHOMA STATE   59
  TEXAS TECH - 54

THE MODERATOR:     Coach, if you would give us a comment or two about this afternoon's game. 
COACH LITTELL:   Thank you.   Very proud of our team.   We had lost two times previous to Texas Tech.   And every time this year that we have lost to an opponent, other than Baylor, we found a way to come back and win.   It took three times to do that against a very good and very experienced Tech team.   They have got four seniors, and they just know how to play, and they caused us a great deal of difficulty. 
But I thought our team really competed very well tonight.   Did a lot of good things.   I don't think you've got to look any further than what Brittany Martin did for us tonight.   She did a great job locking up Chynna Brown.   That was the concern going into the game.   Chynna had hurt us two previous games.   Started her all night long, held her to four points, and Brittney had a career‑high seven steals and was very good on the offensive end. 
Tiffany Bias took care of the basketball and did some good things for us tonight.   Hit a big three down near the end of the game and then Toni Young came in and had 18 rebounds and that was very crucial to our efforts tonight. 

Q.   Toni, in the first half, you had 11 rebounds and a real good game rebounding, and it seems like I guess Texas pressed defense and they moved around a lot; was that a big key to this game for you, to be a good rebounder and not focus on the offensive end? 
TONI YOUNG:   Coach said to keep trying to get rebounds and trying to get every rebound that comes off the rim.   In this game, if I couldn't produce some offense, I was going to do something productive and that was rebounding. 

Q.   Brittney, coach mentioned your steals and the one that was really big, you were up one and you had the ball; can you talk about what you saw on that play and what that moment was like? 
BRITTNEY ATKINS:   Chynna Brown, she had been coming off threes and killing us off that, so they tried to mix it up and we had to hedge it.   And Baker, who has been scoring all night, she scored all night on us.   I knew the ball was going to Kendra‑‑ inaudible ‑‑ so I stayed right back. 

Q.   Tiffany, how were you doing mentally taking over for the game in the second half with the pressure being put on by Texas Tech?   How did you adjust mentally? 
TIFFANY BIAS:   I struggled all game, and to be mental as a point guard, you have to keep the ball and get it to the players.   So pretty much have to be patient and slow down and wait until they are open. 

Q.   You guys started with six turnovers early and finished with 17.   Was it just nerves or was their quickness an issue?   
TIFFANY BIAS:   Most of the time, just going too fast and that's just something that happens when they press you like that, and Tech is a good pressing team.   So I think early, I think we just had a little bit of jitters and a lot of deflections and so that caused turnovers, too. 

Q.   Can you talk about what you did that shut down Chynna Brown?   She had one of her worst offensive games of the season. 
TONI YOUNG:   Well, the last two games we've played her, she's beat me off the dribble.   She's got a nice pull‑up, so I kind of just had to focus more on‑‑ I was worried about her driving last game, so she was just pulling up and I kind of just had to focus on‑‑ I guess I was just thinking about, I had to do both today.   I had to just really focus on what she was doing with it or where she's holding the ball, just had to focus more than I did the last two games.

Q.   All three of those players had four fouls with about five or six minutes left.   Can you just talk about juggling, how long to keep them out and just the fact that none of them fouled out and just how they stayed under control down the stretch?
COACH LITTELL:   Well, we weren't going to go very long with tiff and Toni on the bench at the same time, because those two are so instrumental in what we do offensively, as well as defensively. 
So we were just trying to buy some minutes and you know, we decided that if we are going to get beat, we are going to get beat with our best players on the floor.   So we went back with them probably quicker than I would have liked to have had, but I didn't want to relinquish the lead, either. 
So we just told them to be smart, keep them in front of you, don't foul on tough shots, and I believe we did a pretty good job of that the last seven minutes.   We were in pretty serious foul trouble. 

Q.   In the first ten minutes of the first half, the team seemed to struggle with their halfcourt press and you guys only had five points in the first ten minutes and in the next ten minutes, you had better ball movement and more offense, what was the main adjustment? 
COACH LITTELL:   We went to some different stats offensively, and tried to spread the floor a little bit.   They are a team that's about the same size across the board, and basically are playing five guards, and they switch everything.
So that's where they were causing some problems that some of the sets that we normally run weren't working because they were topping out on that, so we went more to just spreading the floor and trying to iso somebody on the elbow or at the box.   I think that was a big difference for us. 

Q.   Kendra has been one of your most improved players.   Talk about her play today, she made some big baskets for you throughout. 
COACH LITTELL:   Well, she did, and made some really nice drives to the basket.   Kendra has got a lot of versatility to her game, and she, without a doubt, is our smartest player as far as basketball IQ goes on the floor, knowing what needs to be done at the right time.   And she didn't win any all‑conference awards, but the last month and a half, Kendra Suttles has been our best basketball player.
