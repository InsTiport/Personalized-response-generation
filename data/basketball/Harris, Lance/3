<p>	Q.  Jeremiah, do you remember game where you have gotten this frustrated and how frustrated did you get throughout this contest?</p>
<p>	Q.  For both players, the fact that Kansas had not been playing maybe their best basketball and you guys have been playing pretty well, did you feel they are vulnerable without Langford?</p>


<p>	Q.  Talk a little bit about when it's 60 to 57 at that point right there, next couple of minutes  --</p>
<p>	Q.  Six minutes.</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel like the inexperience of you guys starting three sophomores and a freshman played a role?</p>
<p>	Q.  Not enough scoring inside the arc, were you disappointed in the few number of field goals that you got from two-point range.  Could you talk about Lance's both ball games, the way he kept you in it with his shooting?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you address the NIT scenario again, just your thoughts right now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just to continue on that, the way your team is playing right now, do you feel like this is the kind of team you would like to take into the post-season?</p>
<p>	Q.  Yeah?</p>
<p>	Q.  How important would it be to a young team to use this as a building block into their junior year?</p>
