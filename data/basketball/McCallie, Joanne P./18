<p>	Q.  Kristin, in your four years at Michigan State, can you recall a bigger or more important rally considering the circumstances tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kelli, you missed a pretty much point blank shot with a couple minutes to go that could have put you all up.  I know you know what I'm talking about.  How big was it for you to, like you say, keep your composure and how much did you want to hit that lay-up there with like 35 seconds to go. </p>
<p>	Q.  Kelli, I think there was a time you guys, it was like the 14 -- 16th time Tennessee had gotten their biggest lead, there was a time-out and Coach looks like she really blasted you guys.  She got in your face and challenged you.  Kind of give us an idea what that time-out was like and do you remember what I'm talking about; was she really getting into you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kristin, will you talk about just your composure, y'all did make -- I think you tied for the biggest comeback in a Final Four game especially since Tennessee has been here and y'all haven't?</p>
<p>	Q.  Kristin, again, you looked like you struggled in the first half; you got in foul trouble.  How tough was it to keep your composure, especially when you come out in the second half and Tennessee is just pouring it on you. </p>

<p>	Q.  Coach, it appeared with about four minutes left in the first half you decided to take Kristin out then and Tennessee made their move and took control of the game, did you begin to think to yourself, "Did I do this too soon" or, "Would I even put her back in, in the first half?"</p>
<p>	Q.  What does it say about the state of women's basketball that in Tuesday's final you're going to have two programs that are not used to being in this particular position? </p>
<p>	Q.  You got two teams that overcame huge deficits now to get to the championship game and pretty much left it all only the floor, do you got anything left for the championship?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the Victoria Lucas-Perry, her flurry there, she got seven points?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about what it means to get a win like this against a program like Tennessee and a coach like Pat Summitt?</p>
<p>	Q.  What happened on the technical foul and what did Pat Summitt say to you at the end of the game?</p>
