<p>	Q.  Kristin and Kelli, I would like you both to answer this:  Getting here, seeing all the lights and all the attention and everything you're getting, talk about your responses to this being here for the first time. </p>

<p>	Q.  Kristin, this is for you, of all the fun things you just were talking about, fun things on the court, you do a lot of different things; what gives you the most satisfaction and why? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kelli, having a team like Michigan State here that's now kind of emerging on the national scene, how do you think overall that improves women's basketball and improves this Final Four to have a team like you guys here? </p>
<p>	Q.  For either of the players or both of you, Tennessee seniors have been here four times to the Final Four.  You guys are making your first appearance.  Do you expect that the experience factor will play any sort of a role tomorrow? </p>

<p>	Q.  Kelli, you have seen some very interesting rebound combinations in this entire NCAA tournament run.  From what you've seen so far in the scouting report what does Tennessee do?  Are they any vastly different from what you played against?</p>
<p>	Q.  Kristin, Tennessee is known for its defense; could you mention a couple factors that you think might be crucial, things that you need to do against their defense? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kristin, can you talk a little bit about how you guys came out?  In the last three halves you guys came out and really set the tempo for the way you want to play and how important that's going to be tomorrow in being able to establish your game. </p>
<p>	Q.  I guess Kelli, you and the men's team are really good friends it sounds like so we have been -- will you be watching tonight and do you have their cell phone numbers and will you track them down later on?</p>
<p>	Q.  With the Tennessee program's rich tradition is there any kind of a factor with them or have you guys played enough teams that you're beyond that? </p>
<p>	Q.  To either Kristin or Kelli, after looking at film and studying Tennessee's tendencies, can you name one or two things that they do, you have to make sure that they don't do against you in tomorrow night's game? </p>

<p>	Q.  What do you think it does for the women's game to have a team like you here, new blood in this sort of environment? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you tell the story about how you ended up recruiting Kristin.  I understand you initially didn't want Kristin Haynie?</p>
<p>	Q.  Okay.  Could you set the record straight for us?</p>
<p>	Q.  I understand that she was offered by Michigan and you weren't so sure?</p>
<p>	Q.  There will be a new champion regardless this week.  I've been asking some of the others, how important is it for a new face like a Michigan State or LSU or Baylor to win this thing?  Or, are we trying to still rush what is an ongoing process in the evolution of women's basketball?</p>
<p>	Q.  What makes you confident that your players aren't going to be overwhelmed or a little awestruck by the experience?</p>
<p>	Q.  Question about Kristin.  What area or two has she improved the most in her four years?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was there a point when you realized that this team, that your team could be on this stage?  Was there a particular game or point in the season or preseason where you thought you would be good enough to get here and to play here?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about first of all your journey in getting to Michigan State in the first place, what attracted you to the job, and then I know that you were in the mix before this became about Michigan State for the Northwestern job as an alum, you know, and I would like to know whatever happened to that. </p>
<p>	Q.  And Northwestern? </p>
<p>	Q.  Wonder if you can tell me what kind of boost Rene has given you off the bench; she started a few games and mostly has come off the bench?</p>
<p>	Q.  Going back to Northwestern, you want to talk about your senior year and the big game you had against them and just Tennessee then and the Tennessee now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there a good insider's edge Al and Temeka can bring to you on your staff or is there such a thing as information overload? </p>
<p>	Q.  Going back to your journey to Michigan State, I wonder if you could talk about your days of coaching at Maine, especially since you pledged it and have you heard from any of those players?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you took over, did you have a set, did you say to yourself, in five years we want to be here, there; what was the process you had in mind when you took over? </p>
