<p>	Q.  For either Kelli or for Kristin.  The trademark of your tournament run has always been strong second halves.  You've had them in every game.  What was Baylor able to neutralize tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kelli, if you would, now that you faced Baylor's post players, just what made them so difficult for you tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  For either of the players, from the podium yesterday or the day before the Baylor players were very complimentary of your team, your teamwork, your sharing the ball and how hard you played.  But each one in a conversation would drop in, I don't think they're as athletic as we are.  Do you think that was a factor tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kelli, all season long especially in the tournament you guys had four double digit scores, today there was two.  How tough was that and how much of a factor do you think that was?</p>
<p>	Q.  Kristin, it might be difficult to have to accept the loss tonight, but at the same time can you and your teammates still realize what you have accomplished this year and what you've done for Michigan State basketball? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kristin, can you talk about how you think Michigan State basketball will be changed now because of this run and other teams right now in women's basketball that are sitting here looking at y'all and Baylor, what kind of confidence that may give them to make it to this stage? </p>

<p>	Q.  If you could just talk about the play of Kristin and Lindsay together and how the brief run that you did make late in the first half, early in the second, what they did to spark that?</p>
<p>	Q.  That Niemann girl, how did she get so open so often? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk a little bit about the play of Steffanie and Sophia and what they did to you.  It seemed like you were throwing a lot of players at them and they just kept running away?</p>
<p>	Q.  Score notwithstanding, did perhaps Baylor have the best combination of rebounding and shooting that y'all faced in the tournament? </p>
<p>	Q.  I think people are learning more about Sophia Young, what were your impressions about her athleticism and everything?</p>
<p>	Q.  Along with the rebounding, did this just largely come down to the fact that they had three players go off and you had two?</p>
<p>	Q.  A little bit along those same lines, the one thing that seemed like you struggled even when you were playing very, very well since the beginning of the Big-10 tournament is rebounding.  Was there a little bit of a thing like, like against an athletic team like this that you were a little concerned that if we don't take care of the fundamentals totally we're really, really going to get hurt in this area tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  All year the talk's been about you guys match-up zone and how effective it's been; what did Baylor do that was able to really penetrate and get the kicks that other teams may not have been able to do during the year? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about what this season did for your program, the run notwithstanding this last game, and at the end it seemed like you guys kind of hovered around; did you watch their celebration or kind of have a moment or something to remember or were you trying to hang around to shake their hand?</p>
