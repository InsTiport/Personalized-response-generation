Q. Gregg Popovich this morning was pretty direct about criticizing Zaza for that play, and basically calling him dirty and has a history of this.  Any response to that?
DRAYMOND GREEN: No, I don't have a response.
Q. Did you see it?
DRAYMOND GREEN: So, Game 2?  No questions?
Q. How different are they without Kawhi tomorrow?
DRAYMOND GREEN: They're definitely a much different team.  You take -- like I said before, you take an MVP candidate off the team, that's tough.  But one thing about this club is they're going to come out, they're going to play hard.  No one's going to get outside of what they do, and they're going to use each other.
So I think Manu said it after Game 6 against Houston, it makes them less predictable.  Obviously, when Kawhi's on the floor, you know it's going to run through him.  So it makes it a lot less predictable.  But I think we come out on edge from the jump, play our game, and we'll be just fine.
Q. As someone who has faced charges of being dirty yourself, is that something that's in the eye of the beholder?  Is it like fans of one team see a play and think it's dirty?
DRAYMOND GREEN: Yeah, I guess so.  I think it's all someone's personal opinion, which, at the end of the day, personal opinions really don't matter.
