Q. Congratulations. What do you think about this team? You play against these guys all the time? 
DRAYMOND GREEN: Thank you. I'm excited about it. I think it's a great group of guys, very talented group of guys that I think we're going to mesh well together. Obviously, we played against each other all year. But to come together for one common goal to represent our country well, I'm excited about that. 

Q. You looking forward to getting back in the gym? Obviously it's a tough ending to an NBA season. 
DRAYMOND GREEN: Yeah, it was tough. But I'm definitely looking forward to getting back to work and preparing for the Olympics. Also, getting ready for next season as well. 

Q. How do you think your skills work on the international level? You haven't played at all with these guys, at least at this level. What kind of stuff can you do to help this team? 
DRAYMOND GREEN: Well, I mean, I just plan on being me, playing my game, bringing whatever I can to this team. I think a lot of International Teams use the kind of stretch four, so I think that suits me well. I'm definitely looking forward to making the transition.
