<p>	Q.  Sheena, talk about the sequence at the end of the game where you had a pretty open look, and you have been making them the last couple of days.  What was going through your mind?  Did you feel you were rushed, or did you feel good about it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Nikki, with RanDee on the bench, you really did a nice job stepping up along with Amy Loftus to keep this team in the game.  Could you talk about the role you played today, and your ability to keep this team in this game, and in the lead for quite a while?</p>
<p>	Q.  As you guys were executing and making plays, could you sense a growing confidence as you guys were playing this game?  You were still in the lead.  Was there a sense among the players on the court that you could keep this thing going to the end and finish it out?  Did you get a sense there was a growing confidence?</p>

<p>	Q.  How tough is this knowing that your kids basically executed everything you wanted them to do?  You did a nice job against the zone, you didn't turn it over that much until late in the game.  You overcame the adversity of RanDee being in foul trouble.  How tough is this for you personally to know that your kids did everything you wanted and you still came up short in a game of such big magnitude?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible question.) </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm not that privy to the Women's NIT as I am to the Men's.  Is your record good enough to permit you to keep playing beyond today?</p>
