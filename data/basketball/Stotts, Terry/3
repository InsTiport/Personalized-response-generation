 Q.  Any comments on Lillard playing through this rib injury?  
TERRY STOTTS: It doesn't surprise me.  I didn't really know much about it until it became public.  Generally when he has something going on, he kind of keeps it to himself, so I would say it's not surprising.   
 Q.  Certainly the training staff evaluated him?  
TERRY STOTTS: Yeah, and you know, like I said, I wasn't much aware of it.  I didn't know how much it was bothering him until yesterday.   
 Q.  I imagine, just him getting that news makes it even more impressive?  
TERRY STOTTS: Yeah, I mean, you know, it's that time of year.  I mean, everybody is -- not everybody, but a lot of people have things that they're going through.  Enes had his shoulder, Rodney had his knee, Mo, everybody has some things they're fighting through.   
 Q.  Is there a message you tell the team going into this next game?  
TERRY STOTTS: Well, pretty much what you're thinking.   
 Q.  Did anything stand out to you when you went back and watched the film?  
TERRY STOTTS: Well, as disappointing as the third quarter was last night, it wasn't the same as the third quarter in Game 2.  The third quarter in Game 2 we had a lot of turnovers.  It was a blitzkrieg.  It was just -- we had our opportunities in the third quarter to have a good offensive quarter, and we didn't take advantage of them.  It was actually a little more encouraging than after Game 2.   
 Q.  What's it been like to have Coach Yim back around?  
TERRY STOTTS: It's good to see him more than anything else.  He's been to the last couple coaches' meetings.  His sister lets him out for an hour or so.  There's a rumor he might even be at the game tomorrow, so that would be great.   
 Q.  I was just curious with Rodney, was his knee bothering him at all last night?  
TERRY STOTTS: Not more than usual.
