Clippers - 102, Trail Blazers - 81
Q. You mentioned coming in, your attention to Damian [Lillard], to get him off the ball and create opportunities there... how would you assess your execution coming out of that stuff? How did that work for you?
TERRY STOTTS: I was pretty pleased with it. I thought we got some good looks, especially early. We struggled to shoot the ball tonight. We were under 40 percent for most of the night. I thought we did a good of changing things up as far as getting different looks and moving people around.
Q. What did you make of their all-bench five-man unit in the second quarter and fourth quarter and how they played?
TERRY STOTTS: I thought their bench was good both in the first half and second half.  They made their run both in the first half with their bench and obviously in the fourth quarter their bench was effective.  You look at the plus-minus it was pretty clear that their bench was effective for them, and they did it in different ways.  I thought Austin Rivers three-point shot with 8:00-something to go was a big momentum play, a 10-point game, and he makes the shot with the shot clock going off.  That kind of turned the tide in the fourth quarter.
Q. Do you think the fourth quarter is when things turned for them?
TERRY STOTTS: Yeah, no question.  It was a six-point game.  I think Jeff Green hit a couple free throws, and we had a good defensive stand in that possession.  If it bounces long and he ran the other way, that was a big momentum play.  Took it to 13, and gave them a lot of energy where it could have been reversed.
