<p>	Q.  Could you try to express the disappointment you have right now not making that game on Monday. </p>

<p>	Q.  Having seen Kansas' transition game live, what were your impressions? </p>
<p>	Q.  Seemed like when you were on offense, you were having to work awfully hard for some pretty contested shots.  Can you talk about Kansas' defense. </p>
<p>	Q.  Dwyane, how long do you take before you make a decision on what you do with your future? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is this going to spoil all that you accomplished so far this year? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could we get a comment from Coach Crean about where the game got away, all the time-outs you tried to get to stem the tide? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you speak to how badly you thought the team looked?  Was this one of your worst performances or was it a situation where you caught Kansas on a perfect night? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you summarize what Coach Crean said to the two of you when you both came out for the last time, kind of stood and talked for a few moments there? </p>

<p>	Q.  People have watched your team before, had to be surprised as well as you are.  The uncontested shots, the layups it seemed Kansas was creating, very uncharacteristic that you guys were giving that up.  Did that shock you, the looks they were getting against you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Offensively you missed some open looks, had some turnovers.  Do you attribute that to Kansas' defensive effort or you guys coming out a little nervous on the opening game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Where did Kansas' performance rank as far as teams you've played this year? </p>
<p>	Q.  Along the lines of the question earlier about experience or your guys being a little nervous, talk about the experience factor.  Your guys hadn't been here, theirs had. </p>
<p>	Q.  What did you say to your team at halftime and also after the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  How frustrating was it, sharp-shooting 3-point team, yet 3-16 tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  When Keith Langford has the kind of game he has as a third scoring option, does that make them even better?</p>
