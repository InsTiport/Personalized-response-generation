COACH JEN HOOVER:   Just really proud of our team and the growth we made this year.   And could stand up here all day and talk about each individual player, and especially starting with these two right beside me.   But, you know, just such a gutsy team, and showed so much character and passion, I can't say enough about them.   It's a hard day for us.   I told them in the locker room I wasn't ready for the speech.   I had a victory speech prepared, ready to go.   
   
 Q.   Coach, you played good, confident basketball for the first half and then Carolina kind of hit you with a barrage.   Was that due to fatigue or did they just make the right adjustments?   
COACH JEN HOOVER:   I think they just played a lot more aggressive and physical.   And the game was allowed to be that way.   I think we got rattled a little bit from it and didn't step up and be strong enough.   
You've got to give them a lot of credit.   We knew they weren't going away.   We know they're an extraordinary basketball team with a lot of talented basketball players on that team.   We knew they were going to keep coming.   We were confident we could handle it and we were going to take the best punches, but we fell short.  
   
 Q.   Did you have to change a little bit how you were playing after the third foul?   Things were going so smoothly earlier.   
DEARICA HAMBY:   Usually I start the first half less aggressive and second half I usually pick it up when I don't have any fouls.   But definitely changed the way I played and rebound and be more aggressive and go for steals and stuff like that.  
   
 Q.   What changed over halftime that they were able to get the jump on you the second half?   
COACH JEN HOOVER:   I don't know exactly what changed.   Again, you're looking at a team with a lot of tradition.   They were ‑‑ obviously I thought we played some of our best basketball in the first half.   And they just came out in the second half and were really aggressive with us, and right off the bat we missed a few shots early in the second half, I know we missed a layup.   I think we were 0 for 4 and they got momentum out of it.   
It was one of the things we talked about, we had to get stops and keep them from running their transition games.   We didn't want to give them points off turnovers.  
Once they started to kind of come that way and saw success, it was something that they fed off of.  
   
 Q.   For any of you, what did the effect of the power outage situation have?   Looked like it maybe helped them, some of Carolina's momentum at the time.   
CHELSEA DOUGLAS:   I don't think it really played any effect.   We were just trying to stay warm.
