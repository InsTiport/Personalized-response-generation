Q. Confidence-wise, what's the morale like right now?
KIHEI CLARK: We're good.  Everybody is locked in, everybody is ready to go.  Have a good practice today and getting ready for tomorrow.
Q. Being a freshman, what's this like?  Sweet 16 for you, how exciting is this?

Q. What's the message from some of the upperclassmen to kind of take in this experience?  It's a bigger stage, obviously, Sweet 16.
KIHEI CLARK: Just being focused and ready to go.  It's just another game, but just coming out and doing my job and making sure I'm locked in.
