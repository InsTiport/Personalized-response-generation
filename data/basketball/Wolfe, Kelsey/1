COACH JOANNE BOYLE:   Just excited to get our first win down here.   It's all about advancing.   I thought the team for the most part we played a pretty well‑rounded game on both ends of the floor.   I was excited about that.   We played team basketball, which is what we've been working towards.   It's nice to get our first win. 

Q.   Kelsey, it was an 11‑point game with about 6 1/2 minutes left.   Maybe BC looked like they were going to come back again on you guys.   You throw up that bank sink, kind of take us through that.   And how big was that maybe a sign that you were going to finish it out? 
KELSEY WOLFE:   I think that was a big sign.   The shot clock was going down.   I think I was 3 feet off the 3‑point line and I just shot it, it went it, banked in.   Bre said on the bench that she called the bank for me, so that's probably why it went in.

Q.   Ataira, could you talk about that stretch, 19 points in about 9 or 10 minutes between the first and second halves. 
ATAIRA FRANKLIN:   I think I started the game 0 for Wednesday, and Coach Cory told me, I think you want it too much, just let the game come to you.   I think I got more into the flow of the game, especially defensively getting tips and steals, and running the transition with my teammates, I think the game started to come to me a little easier.

Q.   How proud are you that you did finish this one out, it wasn't even a squeaker?   They got within about 9 with a minute and a half left.   How proud are you that you closed it out?
COACH JOANNE BOYLE:   Yeah, we talked about it.   And they've had our number a little bit.   It's nice to get down.   Like I said, when you're in a tournament everybody's record is null and you're coming in to advance as much as you can throughout the tournament.   For us to put a pretty complete game together, obviously it's going to build our confidence.   It's nice to play team ball when you get W's.

Q.   Could you talk about playing BC after that previous game where you probably thought you were going to win that one, and blowing the big lead in that game.   Was there any kind of revenge?   Did they have more of your attention after having done that the first time? 
KELSEY WOLFE:   Yeah, I think so, and I know the last season our first tournament was against BC and we lost against them.   We knew we had to come out and really execute down the stretch and just take care of what we could take care of and execute our game plan.

Q.   Coach, in playing that inside/outside game and really getting the shots when you needed it, was that something that was key, that you had to do against this team that really more or less plays from the perimeter and was struggling? 
COACH JOANNE BOYLE:   Yeah, we changed our offense a little bit and I thought it freed up our guards to get better looks.   We got some touches inside.   We finished.   We got to the free throw line. 
I thought overall our offensive flowed better.   We missed some chippies and missed some easy pull‑ups.   But I liked the flow of what we were doing just based on how they were playing us. 

Q.   There were some patterns developing again, Sarah's early fouls.   Did you like the way you handled the rest of that half without her, and her discipline, she comes out on the floor and no fouls the rest of the game? 
COACH JOANNE BOYLE:   Yes, we've been playing a lot of first halves without Sarah I.   And we talked about keeping her in the game.   I thought she was a lot more disciplined.   And she wanted the ball.   And it's always nice ‑‑ I thought we might have to go with our small lineup tonight, completely small, we didn't.   And I thought Syd and Sarah Beth both came in and gave us a few minutes here and there, and that let us rest her.   And we went with our typical four‑guard lineup.   We got a lot of different looks tonight and everybody contributed. 

Q.   No secret that you don't have one of the tallest teams, how important is it that you out‑rebound them 37‑24?
COACH JOANNE BOYLE:   We talked about attention to detail.   And I think in the last game they out‑rebounded us by a few.   And that was a team that was minus 6 on the boards.   That was one of our focal points tonight.   We were going to do everything not to give them second‑chance points, and I thought we did a great job of paying attention to that detail. 

Q.   How does it feel to win?   You guys have lost four in a row, six of seven.   Just what does that do for you confidence‑wise, and kind of look ahead tomorrow against a Georgia Tech team?
ATAIRA FRANKLIN:   I think that right now we understand how essential it is to really lock in and execute in these games.   It's literally do or die for us.   We love playing together and these are the last games we'll get to play together as a team.   I think everyone is eager and excited and hungry to finish out the season strong.
KELSEY WOLFE:   What she said is good. 

Q.   What was the difference midway through the second half when you look at some of your other games?   Was it just attention to detail? 
COACH JOANNE BOYLE:   Yeah, we got some stops.   We got some crucial stops.   Where we've struggled it's either we're not getting stops or we have a lull in offense.   I thought both ends of the floor were pretty complete tonight. 
But when we had to get stops I felt we did, that was big for us.   Even when we weren't scoring every time down the floor.   I thought we did a nice job offensive, but ultimately rebounding and getting crucial stops was important. 

Q.   You talked about leading up to this about how your seniors are going to be accountable for how you finish this thing.   Kelsey gets two huge 3s there to stretch it out.   And Franklin the huge lip going into halftime.   How crucial were these two in taking accountability? 
COACH JOANNE BOYLE:   They were.   And that's the great thing about seniors, you want them to go out in a tournament like this and carry what they need to carry, and they did that tonight.   They've been here before, they're familiar with this.
