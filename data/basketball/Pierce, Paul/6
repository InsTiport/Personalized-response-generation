 Q.   I don't know if you're aware, but this is the 20th anniversary of Magic Johnson returning to the NBA after announcing he was HIV positive.   What does his return mean to the NBA?  
PAUL PIERCE:   Well, you understand Magic at the time was one of the great faces of the NBA, a guy who you always enjoyed him going up and down the court.   He motivated a lot of us young kids at the time to want to be NBA players and want to emulate him and do the things that he did out on the court.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL PIERCE:   You know, they're all pretty special.   The first time you make it, you're excited that you've arrived as an NBA player and that motivates you to keep going.   To make it here my 14th year is a feat.   I'm constantly motivated to want to be one of the best players in the league.   
   
 Q.   We're here in Orlando, a bunch of superheroes like the Incredible Hulk and Spider‑Man, home to those superheroes.   If you were a superhero, what would your power be and what would your name be?   
PAUL PIERCE:   Oh, man, let me think about that and I'll come back to you.   
   
 Q.   Let's say you were an All‑Star MVP.   You're on publications across the country.   What do you want the headlines to read?   It can say absolutely whatever you want.   
PAUL PIERCE:   "Pierce wins MVP."   I don't know, I'm not a writer.
