 Q. Obviously you have been to a bunch of them. What is unique? What do you do to capture the moment? 
 PAUL PIERCE: You cherish each and every one. The All-Star Weekend is a privilege every time. So you can't take it for granted. That's the one thing I don't ever do. That's why I walk around, have fun with the guys. There may be a day when you don't make an All-Star team, then what? 
 It is about the memories. Go back and look at this and say, hey, kids, on All-Star, we got it on videotape and had a lot of fun.

 Q. Are you wearing your ring? 
 PAUL PIERCE: I'm not wearing my ring. It is crazy. I get asked that question.
 I think it feels the same but I think the guys understand you won a championship. It is not something you come down here and put it in everybody's face, like "we did this." As All-Stars, we got to respect one another. So it is really not about that. It is about enjoying the weekend, enjoying making the team and that's about it. 

 Q. There is talk about whether or not you guys need to add a piece. Are you expecting, hoping, you guys get another piece? 
 PAUL PIERCE: That's not something that I'm thinking about truthfully. We got the second-best record in the NBA. I think we are a game behind the best. I like what we have, but that's not really in my hands. 
 I think we have the pieces necessary to win another championship. Teams are always looking to improve. If there is a way to do it, they will do it. If not, I think we are still one of the best teams in the NBA.
