  Q. Is this the kind of year that makes you stronger or does it kind of fracture a team?  
 PAUL PIERCE: (Inaudible) the guys in our locker room, we don't care about that. Nobody talks about it. We understand it's all part of the business. We just try to move on.  
  
  Q. What do you remember most about your first All-Star game?  
 PAUL PIERCE: My first All-Star game I played with Michael Jordan, and that was everything to me because I looked up to Michael Jordan, had posters of him on my wall when I was growing up as a kid. I think the most memorable thing is the people, the celebrities, and I was just looking around.  
  
  Q. Talk a little bit about Zach Randolph, getting ready to start in his first All-Star game?  
 PAUL PIERCE: Zach is a talented guy. It's going to be a great experience for him.
