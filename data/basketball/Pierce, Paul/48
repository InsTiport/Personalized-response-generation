  Q.  Who is your pick in the Slam Dunk Contest?   
 PAUL PIERCE:  I think Josh Smith is going to win.    
  Q.  And in the Three-Point Shootout?   
 PAUL PIERCE:  Is Stojakovich in it?   
  Q.  What's your best All-Star moment?   
 PAUL PIERCE:  Just enjoying all of the festivities going on.  I'll go to the Rookie game, the Dunk contest.  I just love being a part of it.  They are all my NBA brothers.   
  Q.  Is this game an opportunity to bring up the Celtic pride in a tough season like this one?   
 PAUL PIERCE:  Oh, yeah.  You know, when I come to the All-Star Game, I'm not representing myself; I'm representing the franchise, all of the people who have been there.  That's the best part about being here because, you know, even though I'm the only one on the team that made it, it's a chance to represent the franchise that I've been playing with my whole career.   
  Q.  Is there motivation to win the game?   
 PAUL PIERCE:  I think so.  A lot of guys won't say it, but a lot of these guys are competitive.  That's why they are in the game.
