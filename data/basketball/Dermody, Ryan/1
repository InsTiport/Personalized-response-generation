  Wyoming - 40 
  
 THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Wyoming Coach Schroyer and student-athletes. We'll start by taking an opening comment from Coach Schroyer.   
 COACH SCHROYER: I give Air Force a lot of credit. They played really well, made a lot of shots. I've said all along, I think Jeff is one of the best coaches in this league. Those guys really came out. They made shots early. When you get down, you know, six, eight, nine points, ten points against them, it's really hard to come back because of the way they play.   
 But I give them a lot of credit.   
 THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll open it for questions for the student-athletes.   
  
  Q. They were hitting a lot of shots. Was it a matter of them hitting them or were they doing anything differently?   
 RYAN DERMODY: I think the guys on their team did a good job of stepping up and knocking down shots. They hit some late in the shot clock and stuff. But give them credit, they made shots when they needed to and they hit some clutch ones down the stretch.   
  
  Q. Desmar, did you feel like you came out with the energy and intensity in the first half that you thought you needed to win this game?   
 DESMAR JACKSON: In the first half I felt like we came out a little sluggish. Second half we picked it up. We started playing defense more aggressive and things like that.   
 But, you know, the shots were just falling for Air Force. There wasn't nothing we could do about the shots falling, you know.   
  
  Q. How much did you miss JayDee today?   
 COACH SCHROYER: I think anytime you don't have one of your primary ball handlers and starters, I think it obviously dictates a little bit.   
 But we've kind of had to deal with that all year. But, you know, at the end of the day I think that, you know, they made some tough shots. It's not brain surgery. It's pretty simple. When you shoot 12% from the three and 42% from the free-throw line, and miss three front ends and one on ones, you're not going to win.   
 You know, really at the end of the day, it's that simple.   
  
  Q. Ryan, not the way you wanted to go out. Talk about that energy in the first half, what you were thinking coming into this game.   
 RYAN DERMODY: We knew we had to come in and play hard to win. They came out and kind of hit us early, played with more aggression. We had zero offensive rebounds in the first half. That's something we talked about at halftime.   
 Give them credit, they had a lead at halftime. They executed and held onto it down the stretch.   
 THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll dismiss our student-athletes and open it up for questions for coach.   
  
  Q. Without JayDee did you notice guys trying to do too much early without him in there?  
 COACH SCHROYER: Well, I think that we were just kind of a little bit out of sync offensively. Des has played a lot of point throughout the year. He was exclusively at the point this game. We had some open looks. We got to the free-throw line like we wanted to. We were just unable to knock those down.   
 Really, it just kind of snowballed from there. Because when, you know, you run good offense and you get a great look, it doesn't go in, or you get to the free-throw line, you don't capitalize, then you got to go back and defend for 35 more seconds, if they hit a tough shot at the end of the shot clock, those things are tough.   
  
  Q. JayDee was suited up and taped up. Was he cleared to play if you needed him?   
 COACH SCHROYER: He didn't practice the last two days. My trainer said he couldn't cut. You know, he really had a bad strain of his groin. I think I was going to play him in case of an emergency, suit him up.   
 But when a player can't cut and you're trying to play basketball, it's pretty tough.   
  
  Q. Air Force got 15 extra attempts at the basket than your team. What did their defense do to limit those?  
 COACH SCHROYER: I think we turned the ball over. We probably stepped out-of-bounds three times that I can remember off the top of my head. We mishandled the ball a couple times. You know, we didn't get enough shots. We didn't rebound the ball well enough. We turned the ball over. So when you don't get second shots and you have 13 turnovers against Air Force, you're not going to get enough shots to win.   
  
  Q. What happened right there the end with Adam?   
 COACH SCHROYER: Yeah, he broke his nose. Icing on the cake, right (smiling)? How about that, isn't that something? Isn't that just par for the course? So he's getting it set right now, his nose.   
  
  Q. How quick do you try to forget and move onto next year?  
 COACH SCHROYER: As soon as I leave this table. You know, I'm excited about, you know, the future. We got to address a few needs. We will do that.   
 But, you know, I think that we got to get our guys healthy, and we'll do that. And then this group's going to be together for quite a while. I think it's a great experience for them. I think they learned a lot, not only today, but I think this year. You know, guys, we just played so many guys first year of playing. Now is the first time playing in a tournament setting.   
 So I'm excited. I hate to lose. But as soon as I leave this table and get on the bus, get on the plane, we're thinking about next year and getting ready to go.   
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.   
 COACH SCHROYER: Thank you.
