 THE MODERATOR: Questions.

 Q. Carmelo, what did they do to shut you down after the first quarter, or what happened to cause that?
 CARMELO ANTHONY: I missed a couple shots that I was making earlier on in the game in the first two games of this series. Same shots, it was just missing. They continued doing the same thing they've been doing, shifting the defense over.
 I don't really think they did anything different tonight. But I missed some easy shots. Open shots. Some of them was tough. Some of them wasn't. I'm continuing to take them same shots. It's not something that the Lakers did or anybody did on the team. 

 Q. Can you just talk about the inbound pass, what went wrong, and then was it kind of a double whammy, because you obviously got your sixth foul?
 CARMELO ANTHONY: It was kind of deja vu of Game 1. Trevor's so long and so fast and played the passing lane on it. He made a great play. He made a great play. You can't take nothing away from that.
 We're as a team gotta get better down the stretch.

 Q. You just got your sixth foul which made --
 CARMELO ANTHONY: It happened. I got my sixth foul. I didn't want to let him go down there get the layup. But it is what it is. Lakers won the game. They played a great game tonight. We'll be back. We'll be back Monday.

 Q. How long does this take for you to put this behind you and be moving on?
 CARMELO ANTHONY: Oh, I'll be back tomorrow in practice. We get back on the court. Get back working. Think about it tonight, think about what happened, but don't try to think about it too much. Get back on the court tomorrow. Watch some film. See what we did good. See what we did bad and learn from it.

 Q. Tough as it was to lose like that is it even tougher to see you commit three technical fouls off of emotionally charged plays and give up three points like that?
 CARMELO ANTHONY: Technical fouls, for the most part we was winning the game. Rebounding was kind of even. Assists was kind of even. Came down to that fourth quarter. 
 They outscored us by about 14 points. I think Gasol was the key to them winning tonight. Getting him going and him making shots, it made us hard to double-team him and still try to guard Kobe out there.

 Q. How much of a problem was your ankle tonight?
 CARMELO ANTHONY: Oh, my ankle's fine. My ankle's fine. I'm fine.

 Q. Three very competitive, very intense games. You getting the sense that this is going to continue for a very long series?
 CARMELO ANTHONY: Yeah, it's going to continue being intense and competitive. Lakers, they're back to square one. They took back the home court. They came here, won a big game on our court. But I'll tell you this, we'll be ready Monday. We'll be focused in. We will learn from our mistakes from tonight. 
 The shots we made -- I mean that we missed tonight, I'm pretty sure we won't miss all them shots, Chauncey and J.R. and just everybody as a team. We'll be ready Monday.

 Q. There's been so many highs this post-season so far, when you got that sixth foul and had to walk to the bench was that arguably the lowest low and how did you feel? How would you describe your feeling?
 CARMELO ANTHONY: I wasn't really mad about the foul-out or the sixth foul. It was that play. I saw Game 1 as soon as the ball went in the air. It was a recap of Game 1. 
 But, like I said, we don't want to harp on that. Trevor made a great play. We'll get back in the gym tomorrow and get ready for Monday. Our confidence is still high as a team. That's not going anywhere. 
 We still are motivated. We'll still go out there and play hard and we're still going to try to win on our home court Monday.
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
