  Q.  What's the most frustrated that you've gotten when you didn't make an All-Star team?   
 CARMELO ANTHONY:  I used to question myself about what I had to do.  Was I doing too little?  But I'm here.  And I have to just continue doing what I've been doing.   
  
  Q.  What kind of advice as Allen Iverson given you about being in an All-Star Game?   
 CARMELO ANTHONY:  Just that it's a great experience.  It's one of the biggest weekends in the world, so just come out and have fun.   
 I brought my family out here so they could come out and enjoy the experience and we're just having fun.   
  
  Q.  You're here and you're calm, but how can you stay calm, having realized one of your dreams?   
 CARMELO ANTHONY:  I'm always a calm person.  If I sat here and said I wasn't excited about being here, I'd be lying to you.  I'm very excited to be here, to be with the other Western Conference All-Stars.   
  
  Q.  For the folks back home, do you do anything special in this game?   
 CARMELO ANTHONY:  No.  It's a big game for me, it's a big game follow the Western Conference team.  We just want to go out there and win the game.   
  
  Q.  Some people say you could be MVP, because you want to prove to people that you really do belong here.  Is that a goal of yours?   
 CARMELO ANTHONY:  No, I can't go out there with that mentality.
