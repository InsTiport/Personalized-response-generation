Q.   (No microphone.)
CARMELO ANTHONY:   Anything I went through, I don't regret.   I went through it, I did it, I experienced it.   I took the good with the bad, I took the bad with the good and it makes me a better person.

Q.   What advice would you give to the young players?
CARMELO ANTHONY:   We all make mistakes.   Everybody makes mistakes.   It's about how you bounce back from those mistakes.

Q.   How likely is it that this will be your last All‑Star Game as a New York Knick?
CARMELO ANTHONY:   Why do you want to start that? 

Q.   Chris Paul was talking about it earlier. 
CARMELO ANTHONY:   Chris Paul said this was going to be his last game as a New York Knick? 

Q.   No, he was asked about it, he said he would be there to give you advice if you needed it. 
CARMELO ANTHONY:   I always look to my friends for advice, just to talk to.   But I can't sit here and say this is my last game, All‑Star Game as a New York Knick.   I would be shooting myself in the foot if I say that.

Q.   (No microphone.)
CARMELO ANTHONY:   Every year the NBA gets a little bit more better, I mean a lot better.   More intense, more energetic.   You always got to take into consideration how we interact with our fans and a lot of that stuff is very interactive from your own personal website to Twitter to Facebook and all that other media outlets that's out there.   A lot of it is just more interactive. 

Q.   We were talking to Chris and talking about your friendship with him.   Are there other guys that you're close with?
CARMELO ANTHONY:   A lot of these guys are guys that I came into the league with and played in high school and college with and you build that rapport with people. 
And as you get older you start experiencing a lot of things with the other guys.   It is good that I can sit here and talk about that.   That I'm still here.   My experiences and those experiences.
