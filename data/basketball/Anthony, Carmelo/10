Q.   Which of the first‑time All‑Stars this year impressed you most during the game?
CARMELO ANTHONY:   Kyrie did a great job tonight.   Kind of took Paul George a little bit to warm up.   Seemed like he got it going.   For the most part I think everybody played their part and did what they had to do.   They enjoyed it and they had fun, and I think that's the most important thing. 

Q.   Coach Spoelstra said the guys enjoyed it‑‑
CARMELO ANTHONY:   Yeah, we competed today, from the beginning of the game.   We talked about it.   At halftime we talked amongst ourselves, and we said we were going to go after it.   It was a great game, hopefully one of the better All‑Star games.   Everybody competed.   We get guys out there of that caliber, they're going to compete.   Nobody likes to lose.

Q.   You're pretty tight with both Kobe and LeBron.   You seemed to gravitate toward each other in the fourth quarter. 
CARMELO ANTHONY:   It's fun to be a part of it.   It's fun to be out there with them.   It's fun to see, it brings the best out of everybody, as you can see.   It got the game going, kind of got the West team going.   I love that competitive spirit, that competitive nature in Kobe and LeBron, but for everybody.

Q.   You seemed to crank it up a notch a little bit?
CARMELO ANTHONY:   You can see it.   At the end of the day we're all basketball players, we're all competitors.   So LeBron or Kobe, vice versa, the competitive spirit comes out.   That's anybody out there in basketball.
