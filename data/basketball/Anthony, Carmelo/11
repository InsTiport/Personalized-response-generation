 Q.   Can you talk to your fans out in Japan.   
CARMELO ANTHONY:   I want to send a big shoutout to my fans in Japan.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible).   
CARMELO ANTHONY:   We want to win again.   Basketball is basketball at the end of the day.   Maybe some rules are different, but we know how to play the game.   As far as there being a difference, I think a lot of guys in the NBA never really had that experience to go over and play internationally.   So when they get over there for the first time, they don't know what to expect.   They hear this, they hear that.   Once you get there, you get comfortable.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible).   
CARMELO ANTHONY:   We did it.   I don't really know what's going to happen, but we did it, we were very successful.   
   
 Q.   What do you think about the Nets moving to Brooklyn?  
CARMELO ANTHONY:   It's a rivalry.   That's not going nowhere.   That's the new rivalry.
