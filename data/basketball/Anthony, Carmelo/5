 Q.  I'm doing a story for Bleacher Report.  I saw you at the game last night.  Talk about that experience, and your basketball journey and what Coach (Steve) Smith [from Oak Hill Academy] meant to your journey and how he got you here.  
CARMELO ANTHONY: Coach Smith changed my whole perspective.  Kind of going from Baltimore all the way to Virginia, he made the transition easy for me.  If it wasn't for that transition of me leaving Baltimore and going to Oak Hill, I probably wouldn't be sitting here talking to you today.   
 Q.  Your opinion about Thanasis Antetokounmpo?  
CARMELO ANTHONY: You're from Greece?   
 Q.  Yes.  
CARMELO ANTHONY: I like Thanasis, man.  He's a guy who this summer, and even last summer, a guy who played pickup with me and had a lot of fun.  He was actually on our team for another 10-day last week.  Very energetic guy, young, a guy who is willing to learn a lot about the game of basketball.   
 Q.  His brother Giannis?  
CARMELO ANTHONY: I love his brother Giannis.  Big fan of his brother's.   
 Q.  What do you remember from your time in the 2004 Olympics in Athens?  
CARMELO ANTHONY: I try to forget 2004 in Athens.   
 Q.  Will you be in Rio?  
CARMELO ANTHONY: I might.   
 Q.  A last dance for you?  
CARMELO ANTHONY: I might, I'm thinking about it.   
 Q.  Dwyane Wade has said he might play.  Are you guys glad to see Wade back playing all the time?  
CARMELO ANTHONY: D-Wade you're talking about?   
 Q.  Yes.  
CARMELO ANTHONY: Yeah, we all know what D-Wade can do.  He's been in the game for 13 years and has proven himself.  The amount of work and amount of time that he put into the game, it's only right that you have an injury there, injury here that can limit your play on the court.   
But to see him back out there playing the way he's playing right now, you can just tell that he's healthy.  At the end of the day, that's the most important thing.   
 Q.  Has Kristaps Porzingis brought new hope to New York?  
CARMELO ANTHONY: I'm going to shake my head to that.  He brought a new energy I think that we were looking for as a city, as a team, as an organization, and I believe that he'll be here for a long time.   
 Q.  What makes him special?  
CARMELO ANTHONY: He's 7'3", he can shoot and dribble.   
 Q.  Speaks English well enough?  
CARMELO ANTHONY: Speaks multiple languages.  Loves music, so I'm a big fan of that.  Just the way that he plays the game.  I don't really think he understands how good he is and how much better he's going to get.
