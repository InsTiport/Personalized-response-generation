THE MODERATOR:   Take questions for Carmelo.   
   
 Q.   What did you make of the Bill Russell celebration, and where is that in your all‑time list of memories in the NBA and kind of reflecting on that moment?  
CARMELO ANTHONY:   First of all, this was by far one of the most memorable All‑Star Weekends, All‑Star Games honoring Bill Russell, Magic and them guys, getting the whole arena to sing happy birthday to him, and then the game.   All of that played into tonight's game.   
It was a great atmosphere.   It was good for us to be a part of that celebration.   Bill Russell was one of them guys who paved the way for guys like myself and the guys that was out there.   So it was just great to be a part of tonight.   
   
 Q.   You came into this weekend sort of in a down mood.   To perform like tonight, set a 3‑point record, how do you feel now?  
CARMELO ANTHONY:   It was a great feeling.   You are up there in New York, so you‑‑ I've been telling you that it was going to be hard for me to try and enjoy this weekend, but I did.   I found a way.   
The guys that's part of the weekend did a great job of just getting me through it and keeping me positive, and just the whole vibe of the weekend was something that I was looking forward to, being around the guys the whole weekend, just kind of decompressing from my regular season.   And now it's back to the grind.   
   
 Q.   What are your goals going into the second half of the season?  
CARMELO ANTHONY:   The first half of the season we kind of want to put that behind us.   And it is what it is at this point.   And just move forward from that.   
Now it's time to go.   It's time to lock it down.   It's time to make a push.   Everybody has got to really focus in, take it one game at a time but know what's our goal line here.   
   
 Q.   When did you become aware about that 3‑point record?  
CARMELO ANTHONY:   I didn't even know.   One of the kids on the bench, one of the ball boys, was telling me that.   He tapped me on my shoulder and said that I tied the record, and I was like, you know, what record are you talking about?   He was like the 3‑point record.   
So it was a great feeling.   Obviously my teammates knew that, they kept finding me, so all I had to do was just space the court and make the shot.   They made it easy for me.   
   
 Q.   Obviously you're trying to beat him, but what does a guy like Blake Griffin do to energize a crowd in a game like this?  
CARMELO ANTHONY:   Well, he's a guy who is perfect for a game like this.   He is a dunker.   He's a guy who gets the crowd into it.   Guys know he's a crowd pleaser, so they're going to find him, anything near the rim, near the backboard he's going to get.   
So he knows how to wake a crowd up, and he did that tonight.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.   
CARMELO ANTHONY:   Thank you.
