Q.   How much better are you this year than you were this time last year?
NIKOLA VUCEVIC:   I think I'm a lot better.   I'm getting more experience.   I've done a lot better, I've done a lot of work this summer. 

Q.   Was it frustrating for you not getting more minutes?
NIKOLA VUCEVIC:   Yeah, every player wants to play.   They get frustrated and want to get on the court.   It is understandable.   I was confused the first year.   I had a lot of ups and downs.   I didn't take it personal.   But I did want to be on the court. 

Q.   I guess you were happy with the way everything worked out?
NIKOLA VUCEVIC:   I'm very happy in Orlando.   I like the team and the coaches.   It's really a fun place to be.
