 BRIAN AGLER: First of all I thought it was a very -- another very, very competitive game, Atlanta has a relentless spirit to them, compete extremely hard, play fatherless, tried to score on us before we could get our defense set and they did a much better job of rebounding the basketball, limiting us to justify rebounds.   
 So we go to Atlanta tomorrow, I think they're leaving tonight and I'm sure Thursday night's game will be very similar.   
  
  Q. I'm just wondering if you could speak about the amount of turnovers you had as a team.   
 BRIAN AGLER: We turned the ball over again quite a bit, 18 again, I think we had 18 the first night. That's not typical for us. But it's something that Atlanta is forcing. They get out in the passing lanes, they pressure the ball, make you play fast and we got to do a better job of playing more composed.   
 So the brighter side is we can play better.   
  
  Q. Coach, personnel, it looks like they pretty much shut down the perimeter game, and you didn't need it in the end. What were they doing and how do you see yourself adjusting?   
 BRIAN AGLER: Well, you know, first of all, and I appreciate the questions, but it's almost like everybody is disgusted with how we played the last two games. The point is we're up 2-0 and we've made place, we made basketball plays. We have not played perfect, we haven't played our best, granted, but we've made basketball plays.   
 Atlanta is a very, very good team. I think everybody on the outside looking in thinks that because we had 28 wins during the regular season, won the playoff games that we're head and shoulders better than everybody else, which isn't the case. This league is damn good, there are a lot of good teams in this league. We lost to Tulsa, okay? They had the worst record.   
 So I'm just telling ya, these teams are good. Atlanta rolled through the Eastern Conference Playoffs. They are a very, very good team, and they cause you tons of problems and we are a work in progress right now playing against them. So the turnovers are a situation that we have to deal with.   
 I will say this: For us to win this series we're going to have to cut our turnovers down.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about Tanisha's performance tonight? She struggled the first game and played better tonight.   
 BRIAN AGLER: She played better, shot the ball at a high percentage, we put her in pick-and-rolls quite a bit and she made great plays. She played great defense, she was poised out there and, you know, it was good. We needed that secondary ball handler tonight.   
  
  Q. Brian, Angel finished with 21 points, took 23 shots. Could you have asked more from what Swin and Tanisha did on her tonight?  
 BRIAN AGLER: I thought they did a great job. She and Izzy take the high volume of their shots. As a comparison, shot attempts. Lauren Jackson is efficient, 12 shots, ends up with 26 points, gets to the free-throw line, knocks her free-throws down.   
 We're more balanced, the ball gets moved around, people get their opportunities, Atlanta plays through Izzy and Angel and they've been successful doing that. Playing that way, those two are going to take a high volume amount of shots. If they don't make it then their next best offense is to go get the rebound, stick it back in.   
 They've had a lot of success doing that and they're going to keep doin' it; they're not going to stop doin' it. They set a lot of random screens for those two, they put them in open parts of the floor and let them play one-on-one and, you know, I thought as a team we did -- I don't know if we did quite as well on Izzy tonight as I thought we could have.   
 There were a couple of cases I thought she freed up and we didn't stay in place with her, and she also hit some difficult shots going left and right.
