		   COACH BRIAN AGLER: In all honesty, put on a really good show and put out something for them that they can get something out of it. 

 Q. What do you plan to do with Lauren right now? 
 COACH BRIAN AGLER: She's going to shoot today and we're going to see. This will be the first time she's done it since last Saturday. 
 I think she feels a lot better. We'll see how she responds to this. If the symptoms don't come back, we can keep moving forward. She won't be playing tomorrow. It's an exhibition, she won't play. Once you start, you're about five days out. If she can get on the court today, she has no symptoms, we move forward, you're about five days. 

 Q. (Question regarding the Connecticut players.) 
 COACH BRIAN AGLER: Oh, they're going to be fine, there's no question about that. They're good players. They like to play together. They're going to be in good shape.
