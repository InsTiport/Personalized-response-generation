<p>	Q.  Coach, you talked last year.  Do you see a difference a year makes? </p>
<p>	Q.  Tamea, can you lead them to next level; can you make those big baskets at the end of the games? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you break down for us some of those incoming post players, freshmen, what you have seen from them so far? </p>
<p>	Q.  Morenike, what do you think with your position change and also your thoughts on the team as a hole? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you -- would you say that throughout the league that the newcomers that are coming in would have more of a factor and how the conference race goes and maybe previous years if you agree with that?  Would you elaborate? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you give update on Katie Pounds and maybe what your expectations for her are this season? </p>
