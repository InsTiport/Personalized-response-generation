DePaul - 97, Providence - 59
JIM CROWLEY: Obviously all credit to DePaul. Very challenging day for us, but that's what they do. They make it very challenging with how hard they play and how many offensive threats they put on the floor the whole time.
Really they don't get enough credit for their defense. They force you into speeding up, creating extra opportunities, and really make it just an unpleasant day for you.
Q. Last time you were here against DePaul, you were down at least 10 at halftime. What was the difference between that game and today?
JIM CROWLEY: Yeah, we were actually down five with two and a half minutes to go in the third quarter. I didn't think we had the same legs that we had in that game, and we weren't able to contest shots at the level that we did that game. So I think that set us back, especially in that second quarter. They had a couple threes in a row and we just couldn't really get any footing offensively. When they hit a few, they're going to hit a dozen, so we just could never really recover from that.
Q. That second quarter, it just seemed like you guys did a good job hanging in there for a while, but once they got that pressure going, just the challenges to try and stay in it during that run that seemed like it was a turning point in the game?
JIM CROWLEY: Yeah, that's what they do. We certainly turned it over, but we had offensive shots that were turnovers, where we played way faster than were comfortable and beat the press and then tried to take another shot or took a few threes in a row - even at the start of the third quarter we did that - that didn't go in. They know how to turn those into points really well, and they recognize when that's happening, and they did a great job of creating separation we just couldn't catch up to.
Q. You mentioned yesterday you guys are banged up, a little more banged up now after a second game. How are those players?
JIM CROWLEY: Yeah, I think they're all right. Obviously they have some time to recover now, but tough break for both of them. They had had solid sophomore years, so they'll recover and be ready for next year.
Q. Your perspective right now from the beginning of the season to now and looking ahead to the future, just the growth of this team, what you've seen, what you've liked, what you're going to work on for next year?
JIM CROWLEY: Yeah, clearly we're in a decent place with ability, but we have a lot of work to do with some other things, and we're excited for that opportunity. We've got to just realize that one year older doesn't make you one year better. We've got a lot of catching up to do, so we've really got to work hard with that, which we're looking forward to, and excited to see who's on board with that.
