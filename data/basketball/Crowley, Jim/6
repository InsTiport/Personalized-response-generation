Seton Hall - 73, Providence - 60
JIM CROWLEY: A lot of credit to Seton Hall.  You know, we knew they were obviously a very dangerous team, and watching their last game against St. John's and seeing how their guards played, we knew that they would come in very confident and aggressive.  I thought in the first quarter Jackson really hit some tough shots, but in the second quarter they were able to get to the rim and really get their confidence going, and then we were just kind of chasing them the rest of the game.  I was proud of our kids' fight.  We've done that pretty much all year, just when we had those opportunities to overcome some of those things, we didn't come through with that, but again, a lot of that credit goes to Seton Hall with their defense and their offensive execution when they needed to make plays.
Q. Coach, your first year in the BIG EAST Conference, what was the biggest learning point of this season?
JIM CROWLEY: It would be tough to identify a single one.  You know, the word I keep using is it's been educational.  It's been educational within our own program and certainly within the league, as well.  Really feel lucky to be a part of it, certainly fortunate to be at a great place like Providence, and hopefully we'll continue to get better to be a part of representing what is a great league.
Q. 3 for 16 from beyond the arc, very uncharacteristic of your team.  Is that more on the Seton Hall defense or was it just an off-night?
JIM CROWLEY: Well, I thought they did a really good job.  They mixed some things in.  They on occasion would throw in a three two zone, which I thought threw us off a little bit, and they really got in us from the start, so I thought they got some of our shooters a little uncomfortable.  But to go along with that, I thought we had some good looks and didn't knock them down.  Certainly credit to them, but I also thought we had some opportunities with some pretty good looks and didn't make the ones we should have.
Q. Despite what the record book says, I believe that it is a turning point for Providence college basketball.  What are you most looking forward to in year two?
JIM CROWLEY: Making some more of those shots would be great.
You know, just to continue to develop a mentality.  It's really hard when you've not had a lot of success to overcome that doubt that creeps in.  You know, I thought our kids really did a great job of fighting away from losing big.  We've got to continue to -- today kind of summed it up, where we don't make those mistakes to dig a big hole, and if we do fight back, the plays we've got to make to do that.  So hopefully we'll continue to analyze that.  This is the coaches' time.  We've got to make sure we're doing our job to get people better, and our players got to make sure they're doing their job to listen and execute those things that we talk about.
Q. Sarah Beal, 18-5-5.  What can you say about her performance tonight?
JIM CROWLEY: Sarah has done that all year.  Really we've adjusted her role a little bit, got her off the ball some, and she's really had a really solid year with that.  She always plays pretty well at this place I understand.  I've only been with her twice here, and they've both been pretty good.  But she really competed all year for us, and certainly that'll be something I'll miss.
Q. Getting back to Sarah, what mark does she leave on this program?
JIM CROWLEY: It's tough to identify that having just had her for a year.  So I don't feel that it would be fair for me to do a generalized statement like that.  But certainly this year she never backed down, and we need more of that.  She went right at people, whether it be whoever was in the league, and I think that carried over to some of our other players and helped with Yoyo and CC and Maddie having more of an aggressive mindset.
