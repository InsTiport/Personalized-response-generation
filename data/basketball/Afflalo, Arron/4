  Q.  I was just wondering how you feel you might fit into the Pistons; how do you feel the two of you might play together, you and Stuckey?   
 ARRON AFFLALO:  I think the Pistons really value toughness and that defensive mentality and the willingness to compete to win and that's what the team is all about and that's what they saw on me.   
  
  Q.  Do you have a relationship with Tayshaun Prince?   
 ARRON AFFLALO:  I've met him on many occasions and I do know of him but not personally and hopefully put a word in for me and I'll thank him regardless.   
  
  Q.  Coming from a winning program with UCLA and going to a team late in the first round, are you happy to have that opportunity?   
 ARRON AFFLALO:  Again, it's all about winning.  It's all about winning and that's what I play for, that's what I compete to do.  You know, again, I think that's what they appreciate most about me and my ability to play well with a lot of heart and a lot of passion and to play the right way.   
  
  Q.  You obviously left a good program in UCLA.  How hard was it to make this decision to take this next step for your basketball career?   
 ARRON AFFLALO:  It was a very big decision.  I established a lot of great relationships with the UCLA family and left them in pretty good hands the team has a great recruiting class coming in, they will be fine.
