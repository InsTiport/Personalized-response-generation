 Q.   Talk about your position in Orlando.   
ARRON AFFLALO:   I've got a great group of teammates, young guys who are wanting to get better.   And I'm enjoying my position at the moment.   
   
 Q.   You flew in this morning, right?  
ARRON AFFLALO:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   Tired?   You look a little tired.   No offense.   
ARRON AFFLALO:   Yeah, I had a lot of flights.   It's okay, though.   
I'm excited to be here, and today is more just a day of service for me, so I'll get the proper rest.   I don't have any games to play, so I'm just here to support and be a part of this team.   
   
 Q.   Did you come in directly through Orlando?  
ARRON AFFLALO:   No.   I had to make a pit stop first.   
   
 Q.   So you've been here for what, an hour and a half, two hours?  
ARRON AFFLALO:   Yeah.   A couple hours.   
   
 Q.   Have you gotten any sense of any sort of atmosphere, any sort of electricity?   
ARRON AFFLALO:   Yeah, there's a lot of cameras.   There's a lot of cameras.   
My days at UCLA I thought I was in a fishbowl in a sense, but L.A. is such a big market with so many different various forms of entertainment.   
But to have the concentration of media, mainstream media, I've never really truly been exposed to it on a day‑to‑day basis.   So it's fun to see all the media circuits here and how they react to the players.
