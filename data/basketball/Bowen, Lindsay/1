<p>	Q.  I like to ask for both Kelli and for Liz, you faced some pretty good front courts, not only in the tournament but in your conference I was wondering how Blackmon and Young, from what you've seen on film, looking forward to them as a forward tandem, how you feel about them. </p>

<p>	Q.  Lindsay, got a question for you about a moment that you guys shared at the center court last night.  With eight minutes to play you gathered every one together; can you share with us what that was all about because it seemed like you were at a do-or-die time of the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  You gathered everybody together about eight minutes to go, it seemed you were still trying to rally the troops I believe. </p>
<p>	Q.  This is for Kristin.  Kristin, you didn't score your first basket until I think 15 minutes, 15 and a half minutes left there in the second half; how much did you feel personally responsible for the fact that you guys were down double digits and you hadn't scored. </p>
<p>	Q.  Lindsay, what are going to be your keys to the game and how can y'all beat Baylor?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is for any and all of the players.  There's going to be a lot of green in here tomorrow night, your coach referred to that last night; do you think you have ever seen so much green in one place? </p>

<p>	Q.  Question for Liz.  The Baylor players have said all year long they thought, yeah, we can get to this point.  They're still right now kind of saying, wow, pinching themselves that they're really here.  Do you guys feel a little bit the same way? </p>
<p>	Q.  People like to make a lot about the teams that have been to the Final Fours before, especially the Tennessees, UCONNs, the teams like that.  What does it take for a team to know it can beat a Tennessee and to feel confident they can come back against a Tennessee and not act as if it's never been there before? </p>
<p>	Q.  I think y'all have probably played the underdog role pretty well this year and so has Baylor; is there a way for both of you to be underdogs tomorrow or who do you think people will be rooting for? </p>
<p>	Q.  This is for all the players.  We asked Baylor earlier to wrap up their Coach's personality in one word or in one phrase and most of them said "intense" for Kim Mulkey-Robertson.  I wonder if each of you could do the same thing for your Coach. </p>




<p>	Q.  This is for any of the players, two-part question.  First off, we know how tight you guys are with the men's team.  Did you hear from any of the men's players or maybe even Coach Izzo, and second, a lot of the fans kind of think it's fate in this instance that the men won here back in 2000, that they think that you guys can do it again five years later. </p>

<p>	Q.  Both you and Baylor play some tough non-conference games in addition to conference schedule.  How important is that like the game against Connecticut in preparing you for a Final Four? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about rebounding tomorrow and what you need Kelli specifically to do?</p>
<p>	Q.  The BC game and Notre Dame games early, what did that do for your team the way you won and was that when you started to sense where this team had that quality to win games like yesterday?</p>
<p>	Q.  The teams are so similar, from their schedules to where their programs were five years ago to the coach's personalities; who kind of wears the tag "Team of Destiny" tomorrow night?</p>
<p>	Q.  What's your biggest concern about Baylor?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about what kind of problems Emily Niemann presents especially the way she's been able to go inside and outside?</p>
<p>	Q.  It's been kind of striking how Liz is your leading scorer and rebounder.  It's like nobody wants to mention her or talk about her.  They want to talk about the other players.  Have you noticed that and just talk about what you've appreciated about her the last few years, what she's meant to your team and maybe even last night because she had a real good first half where you might have gotten blown out of water; just talk about that. </p>
<p>	Q.  You and Kim have unfortunately made building a program look easy.  Being that you both got here in five years, has something changed in the culture of the women's game that has made these sort of meteoric rises possible a lot faster than people thought? </p>
<p>	Q.  People talk about these two teams being in the Final Four as proof of their being parity and whatever you want to call it.  Are you guys sort of beneficiaries of parity in the sense that there's more good teams out there for you to play during the course of the season and it allows you to get more experience where maybe 10 years ago even the toughest schedule in the country wasn't going to feature as many good teams night in, night out?</p>
<p>	Q.  Sherrie Cole said a couple years ago when Oklahoma made its debut in the Final Four, that the important thing is what the next four or five years brought to her program, especially in terms of recruiting.  I wonder if you could address that and also do you feel like your program is, can and needs to recruit on a national basis or can you be national contenders mostly recruiting in the Michigan and Ohio area? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned a couple times about the balance that you have on your team.  Is it hard in today's environment to get kids to think that way and how did you go about trying to evolve into the team that you have?</p>
<p>	Q.  Tell us your version to recruiting, there's legislation in the pipeline that would change part of that process particularly as regards to AAU.  Can you talk about like what your involvement, what your theory is about AAU, club teams and so forth and what you think that legislation, what effect that would have if it goes through? </p>
<p>	Q.  If a program wants to get serious about being competitive in women's basketball, what advice would you give it? </p>
<p>	Q.  To take a short diversion, today Sue Gunter got voted into the Hall of Fame.  Do you have any recollections or did you ever play against her as a player or a coach?</p>
<p>	Q.  It seemed like after the game you commended everybody on your team and you've talked about the team effort.  Can you kind of go through your starters and what makes each one of them click and how they all put this together. </p>
<p>	Q.  I think that it would probably be fair to say that most of the people in this building were not dressed in green and were expecting to come back tomorrow night to see a LSU-Tennessee game.  What would you say to those people who would say this is a surprising result to see these two teams in the Final Four? </p>
<p>	Q.  You were talking about your days at Maine; what do you remember about Ian McCall and have you had a chance to catch up with him this weekend?</p>
<p>	Q.  I want to just take you back if you would to when were you coaching at Maine before all those standing-room-only crowds in Durham and Burlington and everywhere else and now you're here, how does this feel for a down-east girl coming back doing this?</p>
<p>	Q.  All year long you've talked about one game at a time, no game is bigger than the other.  Can you really do that with the championship game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Going back to recruiting, what did you sell your players on when you were recruiting them and who was your hardest sell?</p>
<p>	Q.  We in the media are quick to try and look or anoint new faces to a game.  You and Kim are fairly similar, I think, in your approaches.  Do you guys bring anything quote unquote new to the game or in a sense are you both kind of old fashioned coaches and you've --</p>
<p>	Q.  What can a coach do just in general, especially in a game or in preparation in terms of giving confidence to a team or maybe the coach has kind of maybe been through this before but the players haven't. </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about the rebounding, but can you talk about how important that whole match up inside is with Blackmon and Young? </p>
<p>	Q.  As the mother of two young children, how difficult has it been to balance your family and basketball, especially during the NCAA post season with all the demands on your time and how have your kids enjoyed this experience? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned your coaching staff a minute ago.  Did Al Brown and Semeka Randall, the fact that they have those Tennessee ties help you at all in preparation or during the course of the game against Tennessee? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, why don't you like recruiting? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think that the text messaging should be disallowed?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think that the text messaging should be disallowed and why?  And also saying, I mean, the younger the players I've spoken to love it.  They absolutely love it. </p>
<p>	Q.  It was asked of the players if they had heard from the other Michigan State men's players.  Did you get any advice from Coach Izzo or has he been in contact with you and how well do the programs relate?</p>
<p>	Q.  I saw in the press guide a picture of you with your mountain climbing expedition. </p>
<p>	Q.  What went in the decision to do that and is this the kind of thing you like to do in the off season, challenges, physical challenges?</p>
