 Q.   (Question regarding Doug Collins).   
ANDRE IGUODALA:   It didn't take us long, but we had to figure out what he was about and what he was trying to do, and we figured out that he's kind of the right guy, and his track record shows that he's been able to come in in different situations and get things turned around in the first couple years.  
   
 Q.   You played Phoenix early in the year.   Talk about Markieff Morris and what your impressions are of the young rookie.   
ANDRE IGUODALA:   I'm still confused with the two because I see both twins and I don't know who's who.   I know one is taller than the other one, but both guys have a lot of talent.   I thought they were power forwards, but they've been able to show that they can step out on the perimeter and play, and hopefully they have long careers.  
   
 Q.   Next week in Philadelphia is the 50th anniversary of Wilt's scoring 100 points.   Is that a great accomplishment?   Will we ever see it again?  
ANDRE IGUODALA:   I don't think we will ever see it again.   The levels on the playing field I think is more even now than it was then.   Not to say that he did it against scrubs; that's a big accomplishment to score 100 points on anyone.   But I think once a guy can shoot 70, you'll start seeing triple teams.   I think it would be tough for a guy to get 80, let alone 100.   That's a great accomplishment.
