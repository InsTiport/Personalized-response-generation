		   TAMIKA CATCHINGS: This is the first time all the players are together. You think about it, the players have been around here around this time, training camp, a couple days here, a couple days there. This is the first time with coach, that he has 11 players that are here, actually having all of us together at once. 

 Q. How does it feel being together? 
 TAMIKA CATCHINGS: It feels good. It's definitely different because for me, you know, the last couple times I played for the USA team (indiscernible). It's kind of I'm like the oldest player out there. I didn't really want to think about it like that, but I think I might be the oldest on the team. 
 But I think we have some great young players that will step in. The younger players have been around for a little bit more. Now we're kind of like the older players, so everybody else kind of follows suit.
