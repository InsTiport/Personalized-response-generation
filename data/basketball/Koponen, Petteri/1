  Q.  I'm curious to know how much you know about the Philadelphia 76ers.   
 PETTERI KOPONEN  :  Well, I know that Allen Iverson was there and he played pretty good there.  Now they traded him to the Denver Nuggets.   
 I'm actually very excited to go to Philadelphia and play there.   
  
  Q.  What basketball players in the NBA did you grow up idolizing?   
 PETTERI KOPONEN:  I can say Steve Nash.  I watched lots of games from him and Jason Kidd.  I watched them and tried to learn something from them.   
 But right now Steve Nash I can say is my idol.   
  
  Q.  Do you know anything about the current 76ers roster, for instance, Iguodala, very good jumper and very athletic; do you know anything about him?   
 PETTERI KOPONEN:  Yes, he's a very good athlete and they have Kyle Korver, a very good shooter.  That's what I know.   
  
  Q.  What is your contract status?  Are you going to be able to play this year?   
 PETTERI KOPONEN:  I have one year left in Finland but there is buy-out option.  So I think I will be able to play next year.
