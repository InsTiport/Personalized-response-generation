THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Harrison and Jarrett Jack.   
   
 Q.   You had a tremendous comeback victory in this overtime win.   Talk about your performance as far as the intensity.   You shifted from the first half where you were lacking intensity, but yet you turned it up big‑time in the second and overtime.   
JARRETT JACK:   I honestly think this guy to my left, way more wise beyond his years.   He carried us for many of the game.   He did a tremendous job of leading the way, being aggressive, attacking the basket.   We kind of followed his lead.   
At this point in the season, nobody is no longer a rookie.   We've put him in so many situations, he's done a good job of hitting the learning curve very fast.   Couldn't be more proud of him.   
HARRISON BARNES:   I think the biggest thing with this team is we're never going to give up.   This team is going to continue to fight, whether shots are falling, shots aren't.   
[] J Jackson was huge in the clutch, able to carry us.   Early in the half when things weren't going well, people never gave up.   
   
 Q.   With Steph a little bit hobbled, was there anything asked of you before the game?   26 shots is nine more than you've ever taken in a game, so...   
HARRISON BARNES:   Yeah, that was a lot of jumpers (laughter).   
The biggest thing that coach told us before the game was to be aggressive.   I didn't try to go out there and necessarily hunt for shots.   A lot came off of dribble‑drive.   Even though I wasn't making them, just continued to be aggressive, put pressure on the defense.   
   
 Q.   Take us through the adjustments you had to make, yesterday maybe not sure if Steph was not going to play.   Did you have to adjust your role over the last 24 hours?   
JARRETT JACK:   No.   People have posed that question before.   Like I said, I didn't need to read a Phil Jackson Zen book or anything like that.   
I don't adjust my mind if I'm coming off the bench or starting.   My role on this team is the same.   I just try to come out, lead vocally, like example.   We have a fight until there's three zeroes left on the clock.   
We just try to do the best job possible.   That's what coaches have instilled in us since day one.   
   
 Q.   David Lee has gone down.   How has that given Harrison opportunities, Draymond Green opportunities.   Jarrett, in your role coming off the bench, talk about the importance of your backup guys.   
JARRETT JACK:   You never want to see anybody go down.   As much as it hurts, you may look at it as a hindrance, it's opportunity.   Like you said, it's opportunities for guys to step in and flourish.   That's allowed us to play a little bit more small ball than we have.   Harrison moving to the four, Draymond playing the five at some points, Carl playing the five for us at some particular points.   
I think everybody has done a good job of stepping in and giving us what D Lee has given us all season.   One of our leaders, captain.   We know there's not one person that can fill what he gave to us, but we try to do is by committee as best we can.   
HARRISON BARNES:   I remember for Game2 in Denver, coach came to me and said, I'm going to start you at the four.   I don't expect you to go out there and be an All‑Star, give us 20 and 10, but be productive.   I believe in you, just play as hard as you can.   
Ever since I heard that, I've been trying to go out there, just contribute.   I know I'm going to make some mistakes.   I do the best I can when I'm playing the four.   Just trying to get the team wins.   
   
 Q.   In terms of the defense the last four and a half minutes of regulation and in overtime you shut them down.   Is there something you can put your finger on as to what happened?   
JARRETT JACK:   I think just effort.   I think the grit.   Everybody just kind of locked down, keyed in on their own individual responsibilities, as well as the team responsibilities as well.   
I think once we do a good job of containing the basketball, limiting them to one shot per possession, I thought Bogut was huge for us on the boards today.   He did a good job.   Hobbled on one ankle.   Fought through it.   I think our smalls did a tremendous job on the glass as well.   
That's the thing, we're able to finish possessions with a defensive rebound.   I think that ignites our offensive break as well.   
   
 Q.   Jarrett, you won a lot of games in the playoffs shooting lights out.   How about when you're shooting 38% and a lot of your guys are hobbling.   
JARRETT JACK:   It shows we don't have to lean on our offense.   We're a team that's not dependent on one particular area to be successful.   
The one thing coach preaches as soon as we got to camp this year was defense.   Playing against a team like the Spurs that executes probably the best in the league, you have to be in tune with philosophies.   Game plan discipline is what we call it.   I think we did a tremendous job of that tonight.   We didn't give them any back‑door cuts, easy baskets, missed rotations.   I think we did a good job of making them shoot over our out‑stretched hand every play.   
   
 Q.   Obviously you'll say every guy on the court has a contribution to the win.   How is it personally for each of you to be able to contribute tonight?  
HARRISON BARNES:   I think the biggest thing for just me personally was the defense that we played in the second half.   In the first half, I thought our coaches gave us a great game plan discipline.   We didn't put forth the effort.   
In the second half and overtime, we were able to correct that.   I just take a lot of pride in that personally, that we were able to give that effort, do what we needed to do, make those little plays that end up in stops, turnovers, steals and breaks for us.   
   
 Q.   Jarrett, when you signed to come to this team, you walked into the locker room, saw what this team had, what did you tell yourself you needed to bring to this team to make it work?  
JARRETT JACK:   Just being a vocal presence.   I mean, I think that was the thing that was probably most necessary here.   I thought we had guys who were tremendously talented.   Just trying to convey coach's message, but not try to come in and overshadow the guys that were here already.   
I thought it was very necessary for Steph to be heard more than anybody else.   I think he's a person who is probably a little mild mannered at heart.   But I told myself, it's necessary for me to say less if it means for him to say more, if that makes sense.  
He's done a tremendous job of being that vocal leader, challenging guys to step up to the plate, and also leading by example.   That was the main thing, trying to I guess nudge guys in certain situations that I thought they were ready for.  
   
 Q.   These are things that don't show up in the box score.   In a game like today, is there anything in particular you wanted to do besides be productive on the court?  
JARRETT JACK:   I mean, no.   I told the young rookies here, in the NBA, college, there's two things that differ:   you have teammates in college, you have coworkers here.   You know what I mean?   That's just the fact of the matter.   We're also a family‑type atmosphere here.   We look at each other as teammates like a brotherhood.   
I think when you genuinely like somebody, you feel like the person to the left and right of you are locked in just as much as you are, you tend to fight that much more for that person.   That's the type of atmosphere we've created thanks to Coach Jackson.   
   
 Q.   Jarrett, what can you say about Steph's performance tonight?   How did he get it done?   Could you have done it without him?  
JARRETT JACK:   Watching him warm up, I said, Man, there's no way this kid is playing.   Watching him run around on one leg, he looked like Isiah Thomas against the Lakers in the finals, man.   The performance he put on down the stretch, making plays, making shots, defensively, I sat back and was honestly in awe, happy he was able to string us along to the victory.   
   
 Q.   Harrison, the sequence when Steph came off the screen, you passed to Landry, threw the ball, almost went out of bounds.   
JARRETT JACK:   I tipped that to him (smiling).   
   
 Q.   After Jarrett saved the ball, just take us through that play.   
HARRISON BARNES:   Which one was that?   I'm sorry, there were a lot of missed shots.   
JARRETT JACK:   You made this one.   I tipped it to you, you hit Ginobili with a move, you made the basket, then made like a little face (smiling).   
HARRISON BARNES:   Yeah, uhm, just the recurring message from coach was try to be aggressive.   I was trying to get to the basket.   Cut me off.   Did a cross over.   I was going to go back to the basket, but he slid a little bit.   Had enough room to get my shot off.   I was able to make it.   
Thank you.
