  HARRISON BARNES: I think it's going to take a while, it's not something that's necessarily going to go away, but being able to play in something like the Olympics it allows you to take your mind off of it, and being in a different atmosphere and talking with these guys about their experience and that type of stuff. Just learning. 

Q. Talk about playing for your country? 
HARRISON BARNES: This is the greatest honor to play for the country and to be in the Olympics. Every NBA player dreams of this. 

Q. Does it mean anything different trying to get a gold medal after coming up short in The Finals? How much, if any more motivation, I mean you already had enough motivation to play for your country on a personal level. Does it mean anything to you? 
HARRISON BARNES: No, it definitely does. Just this whole experience will be great because it allows you to focus on something that wasn't the pain of losing in The Finals, and you want to bring some hardware home with you. 

Q. And Kyrie's on your team? 
HARRISON BARNES: Yeah, yeah, he had some jokes when I first saw him. So we got past all that. It will be fun to play on Team USA. 

Q. Is there any concern for you about Zika at all? 
HARRISON BARNES: We did a lot of research about that. I talked to Dr.Callahan and the team doctor about what time of the year it is, and how prevalent will it be, and for the most part everyone has said that we should be okay.
