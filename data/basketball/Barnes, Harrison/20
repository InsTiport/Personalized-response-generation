Q.   What's the most fun aspect of All‑Star weekend?
HARRISON BARNES:   Well just being around other players.   You compete against these guys all the time, but this is a chance to sit and talk with these guys.   A lot of guys to talk to about their experiences.

Q.   What opponent are you looking forward to playing against?
HARRISON BARNES:   I wouldn't say there's one particular person.   Probably just the guys in my draft class, since we all came in together.

Q.   Do you have any pregame superstitions?
HARRISON BARNES:   No.   Especially not for this game. 

Q.   If you weren't a NBA player, what would you be doing as a career?
HARRISON BARNES:   If I wasn't a NBA player I would be a senior in college right now.   So I would be finishing up my degree. 

Q.   Have you ever thought about going back and working on that ever do it on‑line?
HARRISON BARNES:   Yeah, I'm trying to work on on‑line classes right now.   But there's a certain number of classes that I can do and then I have to go to summer school.   I will have to wait until I'm done with my career.   Hopefully, I'll be a 35 year old guy sitting with these 21 year olds trying to get my degree.

Q.   How important is that to you?
HARRISON BARNES:   I love the University of North Carolina and I think getting a degree is important. 

Q.   Even though you're doing what you want as a pro, is there a part of you that does miss that college experience?
HARRISON BARNES:   There is.   I do say that college is the best time in somebody's life and just going for two years, but college was so fun.
