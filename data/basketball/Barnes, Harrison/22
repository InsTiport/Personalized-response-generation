 Q.   Do you feel deprived not having seen Michael Jordan play?  
HARRISON BARNES:   Yeah, I always wanted to watch him play in person.   It doesn't take away from his greatness.   
   
 Q.   Did you depend on family members to tell you what he was like?  
HARRISON BARNES:   My mom had all the games.   We watched it.   
   
 Q.   He was from North Carolina, too.   He had an imprint down there.   I'm sure you met him?  
HARRISON BARNES:   I have.  
   
 Q.   What was that like?  
HARRISON BARNES:   It was a thrill for me.   It was a great moment for me.   He's down to earth.  
   
 Q.   Do you remember or picture him on the television screen?   You've obviously seen film clips, but not live?  
HARRISON BARNES:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   How does it feel to be a part of that Golden State turnaround?  
HARRISON BARNES:   Obviously it's exciting.
