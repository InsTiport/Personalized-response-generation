 Q. Looking back the other night, it just seemed like the shots weren't going for you a lot of the game. What did you find out looking back at it?
 RASHARD LEWIS: Well, I turned the ball over and didn't make very many free throws. Fisher hit a tough three to send it to overtime, but I still think we had a chance to win it. We didn't close it out when we needed to.

 Q. What about you personally?
 RASHARD LEWIS: The shots felt good. I felt like Turk was playing great for us, Dwight was playing great for us and we had other guys playing great, so there was no need for me to force the issue on the floor. We was winning the ballgame, we were up 10 most of the time, and it just didn't happen for us down the stretch. 

 Q. No team in Finals history has ever come back from 3-1. How confident do you guys feel right now? It could be 3-1 your way. 
 RASHARD LEWIS: Yeah, we're very confident. We still feel like we can win this thing. That's our goal. We're still in this series. We still have games to play, so we're not just going to lay down and hand it to them. Our mindset is to take care of tomorrow and take it one game at a time, try to win tomorrow and make it a Game 6 and then make them play Game 7. 

 Q. Did they defend you any differently?
 RASHARD LEWIS: No, they didn't defend me different at all. Like I said, Turk was playing great, Dwight was playing well, I didn't get many shots in the game. 
 You know, you don't want to force the issue when you're winning the game, and I thought Hedo was doing a great job for us out there.
