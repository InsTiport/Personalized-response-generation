Q.   What more do the point guards need to do? 
RASHARD LEWIS:   Just be defensive minded, I think.   This is a series where they have to focus on playing defense on Tony Parker and their guards.   Let the offense kind of come to you.   But this is a series where we need them to focus in on the defensive end of the court.

Q.   Have you ever been a part of a game like that where it seemed that everything they threw up went in? 
RASHARD LEWIS:   Not being on the other side.   I mean, it was extremely‑‑ they were playing extremely great offense.   75% at halftime is unbelievable, and they pretty much came out with a sense of urgency.   You could tell they wanted it more than we did last night.

Q.   When something like that starts to happen, though, is it difficult to stop when they're just making everything? 
RASHARD LEWIS:   They created a rhythm.   When that water gets turned on, it's hard to cut it off, and we let them turn that water on early in the first quarter instead of setting the tone.   I thought they set the tone early in the game, and we played catch‑up the whole night.   I thought we exhausted ourselves trying to catch up and ran out of gas.

Q.   Bosh went 4‑for‑4.   Did the ball not find him? 
RASHARD LEWIS:   Yeah, the ball did not find him, no.   We just watched film and we do have to give him more shots.   There were positions on the court where he was wide open and the ball just did not get to his hands.   He's one of our main scorers on this team.   We have to give him the ball and get him in a good rhythm to try to win the game.
