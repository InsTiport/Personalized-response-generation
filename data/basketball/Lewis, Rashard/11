 Q. Do you need a better team effort on the boards?
 RASHARD LEWIS: Yeah, most definitely have to be better on the boards as a team. Dwight can't do it by himself because they dominated us on the glass the first game. Going to the second game, that's a big priority is rebounding.

 Q. Two days off, does that help?
 RASHARD LEWIS: That helps. Any kind of rest around this time of year at the end of the year helps a lot. It helps us prepare for this team after losing by 20 points the first game, to get the film and go over the game plan and what we can do better to try to win the game.

 Q. Difficult to not get distracted by the parties, all those things in LA?
 RASHARD LEWIS: No, not difficult at all. When you lose your first game by 20 points, that type of stuff is not even on your mind. Most important thing is just trying to win a ballgame and trying to get yourself prepared to beat a good team like the Los Angeles Lakers, not only a talented team but a smart, veteran team. There's no side distractions at all.
