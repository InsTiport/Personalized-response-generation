<p>	Q.  Could you talk a little bit about the performance of Jarrett Jack in the regional final the other day, how he has stepped it up? </p>
<p>	Q.  You guys came off a 16-15 season last year.  You lose players.  I think you were picked to finish seventh in the ACC.  Could you go over a couple of key factors that emerged this year that took this team to another level? </p>
<p>	Q.  How surprised are you that you were able to win those two games last weekend without Elder, basically?  How was it done?  What is his status now? </p>
<p>	Q.  I just wanted to get your take on how you go through the season in terms of scheduling, playing games, big-time venues such as the Garden, how that helps getting to this time of year? </p>
<p>	Q.  After getting to see John Lucas on film a couple times, what stands out to you about him?  Are you surprised Will has been able to play so many minutes with guys he hasn't played with before?</p>
<p>	Q.  Since the other three coaches in this thing have taken teams to the Final Four before and you haven't, do you feel at any particular disadvantage having to deal with the distractions, commotions that go along outside the court while you are there? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned one of the ways you built this team was experience and depth.  I think one of the things that this change in college basketball that there really is not just one way to win.  Would you talk to that and how college basketball has changed that respect over the last 10 or 15 years? </p>
<p>	Q.  Last time you guys were at the Final Four, you had Lethal Weapon III with a lot of individual stars.  This time around it's collectively your team.  Could you talk about that mentality you have where you don't have much star power, but anybody on that bench can step up and have a big game for you when you need it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Back to the ACC tournament.  Do you think because you guys didn't have to play three games in three days, were fresher maybe, these other three teams did, your situation was a little different there, what was the situation at the end of the year as far as the freshness of the team going into the tournament? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you look at the other three coaches, they may be more prepared about the distractions, do you look at yourself in comparison with them, they're all somewhat legends? </p>
<p>	Q.  You were talking about losing Chris.  Obviously a big loss to your team.  Do you feel that was a big setback on your program or do you feel like you were where you wanted to be after four years? </p>
<p>	Q.  In the NCAA tournament, foul trouble can be critical in the game.  How important is it for the players to get a good feel for the officials quickly, especially when you haven't seen any of the three that may work your game? </p>


<p>	Q.  The two teams you've taken to the Final Four in the past, what have you learned about how to deal with the outside distractions and commotions that go along with that?  How different is the Final Four now than it was that team you took back in '78 in terms of the hoopla? </p>
<p>	Q.  Considering the tragedy that occurred three years ago, does this season and this Final Four trip have special meaning both for yourself and do you think for Oklahoma State in general? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you quickly tell me the first impressions that you had of the Graham twins when a tape went out to you, how they've fit in this year and mesh with your group? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about how you've adapted your style over the years, how you've adapted this year with this team, where the principles that Coach Iba gave you are still evident with this bunch? </p>
<p>	Q.  You have so many transfers in the program this year, have had them over the years.  Why is your program so welcoming to transfers? </p>
<p>	Q.  After you guys won the Big-12 tournament, did you see this kind of run in the team?  It looked like you were really coming together at the right time.  Were you concerned at all about having to play three straight days there just before the NCAA started or what was the mood set about that? </p>
<p>	Q.  You were speaking earlier about the crash.  I know with you guys in the tournament, these stories are being revisited.  How much is that tragedy still a part of your life?  Are there a lot of daily reminders? </p>
<p>	Q.  What qualities do you define mental toughness in a basketball team, something you look at and can see that that team or player is mentally tough? </p>
<p>	Q.  Speaking of John Lucas, what is it about his personality that maybe made it easy for them to be kind of accepted right away as a transfer from another program so quickly? </p>
<p>	Q.  Your team has been described as not having a first-round NBA pick on the team.  What does that say about your team?  Secondly, do you divide up your assistant coaching duties any particular way? </p>



<p>	Q.  Duke and Connecticut have played some of the most dramatic games in the NCAA history, just a few of them.  Have you played enough to be a rivalry?  Can you talk about the connection?  Is there something there between Duke and Connecticut? </p>
<p>	Q.  What are your memories of that first national championship when you beat Duke? </p>
<p>	Q.  Final Four used to be populated by a bunch of big-time, low-post centers.  You don't see that much any more.  You have Okafor, how valuable is a guy like that on defense considering most teams don't have a guy like that? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said Okafor is healthy right now.  Can you update us on last weekend?  Can you expand about getting hit on the head today? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about winning the national championship.  Your memories of going to the first Final Four and the distractions, address that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have to make your game plans differently or coach the games differently, not knowing what's going on? </p>
<p>	Q.  I just wanted to get your take on how getting to this point in the season, how scheduling affects that, playing some of the big games you've played in places like the Garden, the advantage you get from experiences like that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Who bumped into Emeka today?  Who hit him on the head? </p>
<p>	Q.  Your teams have been a fixture in the tournament.  It seems like you've had more Final Four appearances than you really have.  How much do you value and appreciate this Final Four trip? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned the quality of this Final Four field.  When if you were just watching it from the outside, a lot to look forward to.  Can you talk about the makeup of this group? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned earlier that you emulated certain things about the Duke program.  Could you elaborate? </p>


<p>	Q.  I wanted to pick your brain on scheduling, how you factored that into your preparation, getting to a Final Four, having played games at places like the Garden, how that might help you at this time of the year? </p>
<p>	Q.  How is Chris Duhon, what have you had to compensate for his injury on the court? </p>
<p>	Q.  It seems like this year there's been an increasing amount of anti-Duke sentiment out there, both among media and fans.  Is this something that bothers you?  Do you ever take it up with your team? </p>
<p>	Q.  An emotional loss to Maryland in the ACC tournament, a tournament you're used to winning.  Were you a little concerned this was not the way to begin the NCAA tournament or were you confident your players could dismiss that loss? </p>
<p>	Q.  Basically Paul Hewitt was a little self-depreciating when he said, "Which coach doesn't belong," referring to himself. </p>
<p>	Q.  Exactly.  You've had a chance to see him and his teams over the past few years.  What shows you that they belong? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about some of your recollections from '99 when you played UConn in the title game, and also kind of how it is coaching against Jim and how he's been able to use that as a springboard, whereas now his program is considered one of the elites in the country? </p>
<p>	Q.  Doing a story on Jarrett Jack, Chris Duhon, cousins, both in the Final Four.  Did Chris ever seem like he was more geeked up to play against Jarrett?  How much did y'all recruit Jarrett when he was at Mt. Zion? </p>
<p>	Q.  Fired up. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Duhon more, maybe the transformation you've seen in him as a player over the years, maturity as a leader, what it is you've come to admire most about him? </p>
<p>	Q.  Oklahoma State's presence in this Final Four I think has a lot of people revisited the plane crash three years ago.  I'm curious if you remember how you heard about it, and as a coach what kind of emotions it stirred? </p>
