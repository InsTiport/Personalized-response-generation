<p>	Q.  Coach Longstreet mentioned even in high school, you seemed to have this defensive instinct.  When did you realize that was one of the strongest parts of your game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Joey, just how physical do you expect this game to be? </p>
<p>	Q.  John, if you had known this is where you'd be a year ago, year and a half ago, would you have been surprised?  Also, looking back on the year, what are your reflections on the changes that you've made with the transfer? </p>
<p>	Q.  All three, people are fascinating with the football pads practice.  Did you guys look forward to that?  Has that helped develop the toughness at all or was it already there to begin with? </p>


<p>	Q.  Tony, do y'all ever, maybe not to his face, but talk -- joke about how old Coach Sutton is?  He talks about how much he loves the players.  Can you talk about the relationship between coach and the players? </p>
<p>	Q.  Tony and Joey, how long did it take you to get over the Syracuse game last year with that horrible turnaround?  How shattering was it? </p>

<p>	Q.  Joey, can you tell how important through your life has it been to play with your brother?  Was that a big reason?  Has it always been a big reason where you've gone to school?  How tough is it on him? </p>
<p>	Q.  John, Carl Krauser, how hard is it going to be to guard him?  Also defensively, how is he going to be matched up against you? </p>
<p>	Q.  John, as the events were unfolding at Baylor during the off-season, what was your reaction as you were hearing this, watching this?  Were you surprised you were able to fit in and adjust as quickly as you did to a new program? </p>
<p>	Q.  John, can you talk about how your dad worked on your game with you and how that helped?  What areas did he particularly point out? </p>
<p>	Q.  John, first of all, what made you choose Oklahoma State?  If you could describe what your relationship with your dad means to you, how much he's helped you. </p>
<p>	Q.  John, can you talk about the game, like Joey exploded for the first half in the game against Memphis, what you see in his game, how he gives the team a lift like that, when he plays that way? </p>
<p>	Q.  Tony, did you think that you guys would fit together so well when John came in?  Can you talk about not only John, but all the other transfers who came in and helped this team? </p>
<p>	Q.  John, do you have any memory of your dad as a player?  Do you think you're similar to him in any way?  He was a little bigger. </p>
<p>	Q.  John, when you were looking around for schools, did you want to stay in the Big-12 or was there ever any thought about going to Maryland like your dad? </p>
<p>	Q.  John, especially coming from Baylor, what about the opportunity that you have here?  You're obviously two games away from going to the Final Four.  Can you talk about having that opportunity. </p>


<p>	Q.  What has it been like having John Lucas come to your team as a player and also personally knowing what he went through last year? </p>
<p>	Q.  This tournament always generates a lot of upsets.  Does it surprise you any that the Top 4 seeds in this region have held up? </p>
<p>	Q.  The job that Jamie Dixon has done as a first-year head coach.  I think you're tired with Roy Williams for the most NCAA victories without winning a national championship.  Does that burn in you like Roy talks about it burns for him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Kind of in the coaching realm.  A lot of presidents and ADs are getting ready to hire coaches.  A lot of them are going to be looking for the big names.  There are a lot of assistants.  Do you have any thoughts on that, from the time you started coaching till now, about maybe the fragmentation, looking at assistants rather than immediately looking for sort of names?  Do you think that maybe you have to go with experience in certain situations, maybe assistants have to work their way into the ultimate job? </p>
<p>	Q.  Where are you personally, and where is the program now as time passes on years after the plane crash? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much of John's personality has helped him and also the team get to this point?  Obviously, he's a great player, but it often takes more than that being a point guard. </p>
