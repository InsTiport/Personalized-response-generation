<p>	Q.  John, can you talk about the gamut of motions in the last 20 seconds, hitting the big shot, then not getting the stop on the other end? </p>
<p>	Q.  Either player, anything surprise you about Georgia Tech, some of the things they did?  Luke Schenscher seemed to have a big game against you.  Were you surprised? </p>
<p>	Q.  Joey, it seemed like it took you a long time to prevent him from getting the ball.  Was that an emphasis that you had early on or was it not something you concentrated on till later? </p>
<p>	Q.  We know what went on in the Georgia Tech huddle that last time-out.  How about your huddle, what was discussed?  Are you surprised that Bynum ended up being the guy with the last shot? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about how long this is going to stick in your minds?  Can you talk about next season, what this experience will do for you guys coming back? </p>
<p>	Q.  Joey, could you describe in detail what makes Schenscher so tough when he does get the ball and how he gets the ball? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there a feeling that maybe Georgia Tech beat you at your own game with their great lock-down defense, Tony Allen getting only five shots, which is very rare for y'all? </p>


<p>	Q.  Defending Lewis in the first half, what was the difficulty there?  Was it just not getting off screens? </p>
<p>	Q.  To follow-up on containing a penetrator, Lucas is very harsh on himself about that last game-winning play.  Could you add to it from an X and O standpoint, how you think the play happened. </p>
<p>	Q.  We were hearing earlier that Bynum almost transferred to Oklahoma State.  How close was that?  What was that situation?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just talk about what they were doing to get Tony out of his game, how much that hurt you in the first half, him playing only 11 minutes? </p>

<p>	Q.  Can you describe your personal disappointment from your standpoint?  Is this your last game at Oklahoma State? </p>
<p>	Q.  With the way John was struggling defensively tonight, was there any consideration to putting Spoon in?</p>
