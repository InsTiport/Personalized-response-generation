<p>	Q.  It seemed like it was kind of an inability to take care of the ball in the second half, which is probably the thing that led to them...</p>
<p>	Q.  Does fatigue play a factor in that at all? </p>
<p>	Q.  Overall, playing them, they're a team people talk about as No. 1 seed.  What does it tell you about, in general terms, how far your team has come and know in a sense you almost beat yourself?</p>

<p>	Q.  Craig, Pitt really didn't have an answer for you.  What were you finding that was able to make you so successful? </p>
<p>	Q.  Craig, nine times out of ten, when you make such a strong move to the basket, you finish.  Was that just astonishing to have that last one trickle off the rim? </p>
<p>	Q.  Uka, how long does it take to get past what's obviously a disappointing game you could have won and prepare for the next step, which is almost surely going to come Sunday night? </p>
<p>	Q.  Any idea what seed you might be? </p>

<p>	Q.  Coach, did you do anything differently in this game compared to the time you played Pitt earlier in the year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Question for Craig.  What are your impressions of Krauser and his willingness to tangle up anywhere with anybody? </p>
<p>	Q.  For both guys, Uka and Craig, do you feel a sense that there was no pressure coming into this game because you guys had clearly already established yourselves as an NCAA team and whatever came today, you know, win, lose, draw, you guys were still going? </p>
