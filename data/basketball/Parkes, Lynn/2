<p>	Q.  My question, I cover the Rutgers women for the Star Ledger and Vivian Stringer was wondering if any thought had been given to keeping Rutgers out of stores Connecticut given what happened last week between Rutgers and Connecticut in the Big East tournament final between Geno and Cathy, she's just sort of wondering whether another site would have been beneficial for them just to sort of keep that controversy to the side.  I was wondering if you could speak to that. </p>
<p>	Q.  And if I could just have a follow-up.  Do you think that there is any chance that things could sort of, I don't know, keep going in a negative manner because they will be up there for probably about four or five days, or do you think any personal feelings and whether that shouldn't even be a factor now with that team being up in Storrs? </p>
<p>	Q.  First question, could you talk about, it appears from the brackets that Michigan State and North Carolina received the last two No. 1's and that Baylor and Stanford got the first 2's.  No. 2's.  Can you talk about what separated, if you could, and in specifics, what separated the four teams in terms of deciding who got 1s and who got 2s.  Second question is I've had more than one coach talk about a situation tonight where teams, as you try to move as best as possible to neutrality, teams have had in some cases will have to play games against host teams, lower seeded host teams or higher seeded, excuse me, host teams, on their floors.  Can you talk about how much closer you are to neutrality? </p>
<p>	Q.  And if you could speak to the neutrality question. </p>
<p>	Q.  I wanted to know if when you were considering Stanford's situation if you took into account that Susan Borchard was injured and didn't play much of the last time they lost, which was on the road at Oregon. </p>
<p>	Q.  As a follow-up, I would like to ask, it seems to me that to have the No. 1 seed in the country drop down to in affect the sixth team picked in the bracket, is kind of a black eye to the women's game and to the value of the poll.  I'm just wondering what your response is to that. </p>
<p>	Q.  I wanted to check with you on what your thoughts were about placing Oklahoma in the tournament, where you thought the Sooners fell and I think that probably the consensus around the Big-12 was that they were on the bubble and might not get in.  I was wondering if you could talk about that.  When they got in. </p>
<p>	Q.  People around here have been sweating for the last eight or nine days about Purdue and being on the bubble, which is a rare thing for them.  What led to their selection and why the Boilermakers over say a 21 Iowa team? </p>
<p>	Q.  Were they among the last selections? </p>
<p>	Q.  You may have just answered this question, I was wanting to know whether Virginia Tech, because of its seeding, was the last at large team to make the field and I'm guessing by what you just said that that's not something that you could answer? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you tell me then what were some of the factors that led you to put Virginia Tech in the field? </p>
<p>	Q.  You have Old Dominion and Virginia playing in the first round and those teams had played earlier in the season, I seem to remember from the conference call you had previously that you tried to avoid that, was that just unavoidable because of seeding? </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm sorry, tried to make those moves? </p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering, I've been looking at the Maryland Wisconsin Green Bay match up in that it's a little unusual that Wisconsin Green Bay is ranked higher than Maryland.  And in both national polls.  And yet they were seeded lower than Maryland.  I was wondering if you could explain the reasoning behind that. </p>
<p>	Q.  Two quick questions.  First of all, ACC is the conference with the most teams, talk about how dominant they are and how you guys are able to select so many teams from the ACC. </p>
<p>	Q.  My second question refers to the Virginia, Old Dominion game.  Those are two teams from the state of Virginia, yet they're playing halfway across the country in Minnesota.  Can you describe how the decision making process in that bracket went?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you have a team like Baylor that has a very good seed there really wasn't a natural geographic place to put them because you knew that Texas and Texas Tech would be in Dallas, what are some of the things that you put into consideration in trying to decide where to put a team with them to maybe not hurt them too much by being a No. 2 seed that is not going to be able to play close to home? </p>
<p>	Q.  As far as the, I mean that was North Carolina, right, which was a number four, No. 1 seed?</p>
<p>	Q.  As far as the first two rounds going to Seattle, what type of thought process goes into that, knowing that you can't put them in Dallas, nothing else is going to be very close. </p>
<p>	Q.  Pretty much, yeah, because obviously they were a team that kind of did not have an obvious place.  I think going to Knoxville was probably pretty obvious.  Baylor didn't have an option because they could not go to Dallas with the two host teams already being there. </p>
<p>	Q.  You partially answered one of the questions I had.  About Stanford and how they ended up not going to Tempe.  I assume it's because of the Baylor situation.  Secondly, you said Stanford's the No. 2 or was a second seed, are we safe to assume then that UCONN is the third, three seed?  Saying that they would play in the round of 16? </p>
<p>	Q.  Was there any consideration as far as getting Stanford to Tempe or did that go off the board pretty quickly? </p>
<p>	Q.  No, Stanford. </p>
<p>	Q.  Stanford going to Tempe. </p>
<p>	Q.  Two local questions.  What worked against Villanova, which surprised us on the seaboard; and then what went into a Temple six seed? </p>
<p>	Q.  And then Temple landing as a six, they could have been anywhere from a four to a five, so they were a bit surprised by that?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know you just spoke a little bit about Villanova, I was wondering, about the Big East being the best rated conference, if you could talk a little bit about the specifically about the difference between Villanova and Boston College and then looking at Villanova had three Top-30 wins.  Boston College only had one.  And they were even in the conference and split their two games this season. </p>
<p>	Q.  Villanova advanced over Boston College. </p>
<p>	Q.  Also looking at Villanova's schedule that 10 of their 0 games were against teams from the Top-30, is that something that was kind of out weighed by their three losses above 100? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you I guess the one word, Gonzaga.  What happened?  Can you tell me what went on with the thought process of leaving them out? </p>
<p>	Q.  How did the whole pod thing go with splitting up the teams, the four teams, the splitting up the regionals.  How did that present challenges to you guys that were unique and new for this year? </p>
<p>	Q.  On Minnesota.  A lot of people had them picked for maybe a No. 4 seed.  What impressed you the most to get them up to that number three and really quick too if I'm reading the S curve have right, were they the final No. 3 seed? </p>
<p>	Q.  Being with North Carolina like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Okay.</p>
<p>	Q.  Thanks for being on.  You talked a little bit earlier about Purdue versus Iowa, I'm just going to ask flat out from the Iowa side.  What about Iowa that made them come up short in the selection process? </p>
<p>	Q.  Also going to ask, I also cover Iowa State and for them getting a 7th seed, I think the other teams that they tied for, for second place in the Big-12 were fourth or better.  Oklahoma, which was a couple games back was 8th.  Just how did you see Iowa State in the mix of things? </p>
<p>	Q.  I got on late, so I'm sure this is a duplication --</p>
<p>	Q.  -- from the first question.  Could you just help me with the top four seeds?  It's LSU?</p>
<p>	Q.  Anything that you tried to avoid with the Ohio State playing at Maryland?  With the possibility of them meeting in the second round? </p>
<p>	Q.  I wanted to kind of go back to the Villanova case and kind of in comparison to Oklahoma and Purdue.  I guess I'm just curious, I mean you did mention the two losses outside the top 100 for Villanova, but how much did RPI come into play here or in general how much did RPI come into play, because Villanova seems to have an advantage or is equal to Oklahoma and Purdue on many many of the criteria, yet Purdue and Oklahoma get eight and nine seeds and Villanova is left out.  There seems to be a huge discrepancy there. </p>
<p>	Q.  I just looking at some of the other criteria, Villanova has as many Top-50 wins as those two schools, they finished the season better, they have a better non-conference RPI, they have a better non-conference record, yet like I said, huge difference between being an eight seed and being not in the tournament. </p>
<p>	Q.  I have two unrelated questions.  First of which is, I understand why you guys gave LSU to Chattanooga rather than Tennessee.  I was just wondering what criteria you guys used to determine LSU as the top No. 1 seed over Tennessee.  And my second question is did the Chattanooga Lady Mocs receive any at large consideration at all? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you tell what made you, what was the thing that ultimately did not get them in or is that just too broad? </p>
<p>	Q.  With the relative strength of the Big East, the fact that their top seeds are number 3s, is the Big East down this year or is that just the way it broke? </p>
<p>	Q.  Was there any consideration, I notice you broke them up pretty well as far as not being in the same brackets, but Notre Dame was sent out west a couple of times, does that have to do with the way they finished in the Big East or it's just the way that broke too? </p>
<p>	Q.  I have two questions.  First one is, since you don't look at the polls when you do this, what makes a team a Top-25 or a Top-50 team?  In other words, if it's not rankings why is somebody in the Top-25 and somebody else like 30th? </p>
<p>	Q.  Okay.  My other question, which is unrelated, is, you know, how close is it when a school with a record and the season like DePaul had a five and Penn State which had 10 losses, and didn't make its conference tournament final either, a four? </p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering if you could talk about how tough it was maybe to separate after LSU and Tennessee, the next No. 1 seeds and even the No. 2 seeds. </p>
<p>	Q.  You say there's so little that separates them, what can it come down to?  I mean, what minute little thing do y'all talk about that it can come down to?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is the first time in several seasons that the Pac-10 has gotten five teams into the tournament.  Can you talk about what that conference has done to -- it was just a few years ago they only got two in.  What have they don't to really boost their standing, I guess. </p>
