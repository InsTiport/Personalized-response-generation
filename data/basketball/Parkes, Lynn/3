<p>	Q.  If you feel like a team has a better overall season than another bubble team, but finishes behind a team that is in the conference, not as good of a conference record, is it hard to take a team that's got a poor conference record even though it's got the better overall record? </p>
<p>	Q.  There's a few teams this year where you could maybe kind of see that.  It wouldn't be anything where you say, "Gosh, it's hard to pick this team because they were 8-6 in a conference over a team that was 9-5"? </p>
<p>	Q.  A question about location.  In that first round of play, would you guys try to avoid putting two No. 1 seeds in the same site?  I ask because LSU and Tennessee, obviously Knoxville would be the closest place for both of them.  I don't know if you want to spread two top teams out. </p>
<p>	Q.  I meant in the system where you have kind of the eight teams all going to one site in the first round, where two No. 1 seeds could conceivably both go to the same site and play.  Would you try to split them up for, I don't know, attendance purposes and things like that, or would it be possible to have two No. 1 seeds playing the first round in the same site? </p>
<p>	Q.  A philosophical question for you.  I know you say you don't necessarily look at conferences, per se, when you're selecting at-large teams.  I'm wondering in a case where, for instance, a school has won a mid-major conference, is the regular-season winner, but loses in its conference tournament, do you find yourself personally maybe perhaps giving that school preference over a school that comes from what we would think is a major conference that perhaps has a .500 conference record or lower in terms of making the tournament more representative? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kind of a basic question, but how much weight will a conference tournament success have?  I know you look at body of work, but that's obviously going to be the most recent work for almost all of these teams. </p>
<p>	Q.  There's a couple teams that would be on the bubble right now, Purdue and Oklahoma.  Each of them played a non-Division I team during the year.  When you're looking at overall record, how much does that play a factor in the thought process of maybe selecting them or not selecting them to the championship? </p>

<p>	Q.  Where (inaudible) is heavily populated, to use the new lingo, the Philadelphia region, were you able to get (inaudible) over Maryland, Connecticut and North Carolina if you have to stretch it?  (Inaudible) other places spread over the place? </p>
<p>	Q.  Just in terms of how you would put it together geographically.  Looking at the early-round sites, the three on the satisfy board are Maryland, Connecticut and North Carolina.  You have the options there in those three sites, you could fit a whole region somehow within those sites, or a piece of it could end up in Washington, for example.  Would it be an attempt to keep them as close to what their locale is? </p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering how much a conference's overall RPI will play into seating of bubble teams? </p>
<p>	Q.  In evaluating teams that have played against other ranked teams, particularly in the pre-season, are you looking more at the ranking of those teams at the time they played or at the position now at the end of the season? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there more weight given to limiting travel from teams or separating schools from the same conference when you go to regional play? </p>
<p>	Q.  Once you get a regional play, is it weighted more by travel or by trying to separate them at that point? </p>




<p>	Q.  Can you give a quick background on why the tournament format would change from last year?  What went into that? </p>
<p>	Q.  The eight first round sites. </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you get much resistance to the change?  How was that perceived by everybody else? </p>
<p>	Q.  A mid-major that didn't win their conference tournament but had success in the recent past in NCAA tournaments, how difficult would it be for them, even if they have a really good record, to get into this year's tournament without winning the conference tournament?</p>
<p>	Q.  Generally speaking, for a team that's trying to build a resume or looking for an at-large bid, is it better served to play a weaker opponent and win or to play a strong opponent and lose? </p>
<p>	Q.  Does scoring margin factor into that as well, if you lose a game by one or two points versus losing a game by 20?  Is there such a thing as a quality loss at this point of the year as far as the selection committee is concerned? </p>
<p>	Q.  Going back to the eight team versus the second round sites, how about just setting up the bracket?  Does that give you more flexibility, less?  How do you feel that will play in? </p>
<p>	Q.  Texas and Texas Tech, obviously they would be in different regionals, is that correct, Texas Tech would be in Kansas City, Texas in Philadelphia, just as an example? </p>
<p>	Q.  Would you see that at most of these first and second round sites, you'd be mixing two regionals, like a bracket of four and a bracket of four? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much of an impact does it have for a really, really good team to win both the regular season of their conference and the conference tournament? </p>
<p>	Q.  There's just a couple teams, Baylor with the Big-12 this weekend, if they win the conference tournament, they've won the Big-12 regular season.  How does that affect a team like that when you have a Michigan State who has done a similar thing and a Stanford? </p>
<p>	Q.  Really how much of an impact does point margin have for y'all? </p>

<p>	Q.  Where do late-season injuries or playing a tournament on somebody else's home court, losing a championship game, how does that factor into the final decision? </p>
<p>	Q.  Where Gonzaga played the championship game with a slightly injured point guard, they lost to Santa Clara, does that help them or hurt them? </p>
<p>	Q.  Yes. </p>
<p>	Q.  You were talking at the front end of the parity.  I wonder how you anticipate this is going to affect seeding, how much more difficult that process is going to be and where along the bracket you think it's going to be more difficult? </p>
<p>	Q.  I was looking at basically the nitty-gritty reports, when you get down to the elements of that and they're are listed there, do you follow that as far as weight?  Is the first thing you look at in comparing teams the Division I record, the next the RPI?  Do you go through all of those or some of those until you have someone who comes out significantly stronger?  Records against teams ranked 1 through 25, 26 through 50, is that at the time that they are playing them or at the final end RPI rankings? </p>
<p>	Q.  You have the whole bracket put together, you're getting close to signing off, last looks.  Then you look at a particular team, but then you're looking at their line, who they're going to see.  There might be two or three people they already played during the year, quality teams, they beat them.  At that point do you sit there, is it a tough call?  What would take precedence there, trying to help them to replay that all over again?  Down the line if they keep advancing, you can't help it.  But from the standpoint of starting out, would you then look and see if it's possible if all things are equal to flop that team and avoid them doing that? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned how much more of a challenge maybe this year than it's been in the past.  I was wondering if that would apply when you're looking at those top eight teams, trying to separate the 1 seeds from the 2 seeds?  Do you see that being any more challenging than before? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have a definite No. 1 seed, like a Tennessee with a regional in their home state, how much will you look to keep them near their home?  Would that play into it? </p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering in a conference tournament victory, obviously over a team that would be -- that would obviously have another shot at being the No. 1/No. 1, would that increase the other team's chances? </p>
