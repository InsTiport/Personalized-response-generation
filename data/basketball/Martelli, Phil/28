<p>	Q. Any of you guys, could you describe what went on there in the last one minute?</p>

<p>	Q. Delonte or Jameer, how difficult is this team to defend when Pat is shooting and playing as well as he did tonight? </p>

<p>	Q. What was your defensive strategy on Chris Paul and how successful do you think it was? </p>

<p>	Q. Delonte and Jameer, what do you think about guarding Chris and Justin, are they the best guard tandem that you've guarded this year? </p>

<p>	Q. Jameer, it seems like your coach and Billy Packer have buried the hatchet and that's all said and done, but with all of the build-up and everything, is it more special to win a game in front of him in person the first time he sees you? </p>
<p>	Q. Pat, are they really like layups out there? </p>
<p>	Q. All three of you guys, this is your 31st game of the season, how tired are you coming into a game like this?</p>



<p>	Q. Jameer, if there's any time you could be down at halftime and have it work to your advantage after Wake Forest shot 54 percent and you're only down one, did that almost work to your advantage, because they were shooting so great they should have had a double-digit lead shooting that well? </p>
<p>	Q. They are a great rebounding team and yet you guys hurt them on the offensive boards, you got ten rebounds; can you comment on that aspect? </p>
<p>	Q. You made a run in the middle, about 15 left in the game, the second half, kind of about six or seven, talk about what six or seven is like when you have the kind of guards that you have on your team.</p>
<p>	Q. How concerned were you when Dwayne went out of the game and how much did it affect when you talked to the ref and said it was 7-2, did you think that turned things around? </p>
<p>	Q. Given all that's transpired in the last couple of weeks, is it hard not to gloat just a little bit? </p>
<p>	Q. With all of the trash-talking, though, does it give you any way to keep your players motivated?  I know that you're looking for something at this time of year; does it help? </p>
