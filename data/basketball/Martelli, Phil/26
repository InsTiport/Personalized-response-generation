<p>	Q.  Tyrone and Pat, things happened so quickly in the last possession.  If you can detail what happened defensively when Graham lost the ball or seemed like he was going to lose the ball? </p>

<p>	Q.  Pat and Tyrone, on the final shot by Jameer, how did it look to you guys? </p>

<p>	Q.  Pat, when you hit that 3, how uplifting was it for you to hit that shot? </p>
<p>	Q.  Tyrone, how did you get tripped up on Lucas' last shot? </p>
<p>	Q.  Pat, when you came into the game there, you hadn't been shooting particularly well, when he came back into the game about six minutes to go, what was your mentality?  If you got the shot, you were going to take it, if it was open, not worry about how you shot earlier in the game?  Is that the mentality you had? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jameer, 17 points, eight assists, eight rebounds, four steals, but the stat that you're going to remember is 6 out of 18.  Did Bobik being long and tall affect your shooting?  Can you kind of tell me what happened there? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jameer, could you talk about the last shot?  Did you think it was in? </p>
<p>	Q.  How long do you think it will take you to get over this emotionally? </p>


<p>	Q.  Pat, what is it going to be like returning next year without the two guys next to you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jameer, after the final shot, you fell back and were laying on the court for a little bit.  Several of the Oklahoma State players came over and picked you up.  Did they say anything to you at that point? </p>

<p>	Q.  What do you think the difference was defensively with Lucas' first half versus the second half?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is it possible to put Jameer's career into words?  If you can, what are some things you'll remember? </p>
<p>	Q.  The press was so effective in the first half.  I'm wondering why you got away from it had in the second half?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you describe the first two minutes of the second half, what they did that kind of turned the momentum? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talking about shooting, 38%, how much of that was defense and how much of it was shots not falling? </p>
