THE MODERATOR:   We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then lead into questions.
JEROD HAASE:   Not our best today.  We collectively, I think, didn't execute the game plan that we laid out and I think individually, myself included, didn't perform at our best tonight, and I do think the mistakes we made are fixable.  I think there's reason for optimism, but I also know there's a lot of work ahead of us.  We'll have to figure those things out.
Q. Just curious, in terms of in the last three days there's been a lot of success with the tournament.  There's been no COVID cases, anything like that.  Does it give you hope that something like the NCAA tournament will be able to happen with the success that you've seen this tournament have?
JEROD HAASE:   Yeah, I think there's always hope.  I think realistically there's a lot of concerns as well.  I know there's a lot of people working on it, trying to find solutions, trying to give opportunity and a path for everybody to get to that point, but the question is, is there hope?  I would say yes.  And I think this tournament was run very, very well.  I think they handled everything well and pulled it off and I think that does give people hope, including myself.
Q. Ziaire had a great start to the tournament, well, to his college career since he hadn't played before he got here.  Rougher day today.  What do you hope he took away from these three days, this level of competition with no exhibition games like you normally would have in this situation for a freshman?
JEROD HAASE:   Yeah, everything right now is a learning opportunity.  Before this tournament, obviously, we didn't have exhibitions or scrimmages or officials, and this was a learning environment for our team right now and see how we played together.  Obviously, the first game, to be honest with you, a few of the shots went in and everything looked a little bit better.  I thought we competed hard yesterday, although offensively we struggled at times, and those offensive struggles continued today.
Ziaire in particular, he's going to learn.  He's going to learn quickly about the physicality of the college game and just the nuances that we can help him with as well.  I think he will have a ton of success.  I know he's eager and willing to grow and learn and we're going to help him do that.
Q. Simple question, probably not a very simple answer.  As of right now, given where everything is happening back here in the Bay area in Santa Clara County, what's next, what do the next few days look like for you guys?
JEROD HAASE:   Great question.  I don't have an answer yet.  We're going to go back to the hotel right now and feed the guys and continue developing our game plan.  I'm hoping that we have something more concrete -- I don't think anything's really going to be in concrete for awhile now, so maybe in pencil, we'll have something more in pencil coming up, but hopefully we can have that answer to you soon, but not yet.
Q. When you look at Trayce Jackson Davis from Indiana what stands out to you about him the most?
JEROD HAASE:   It's hard to say one thing.  His physicality, his ability to impose his physical will on us certainly stood out.  Obviously they dominated the game from the inside out.  We knew that was their game plan.
For awhile we did a nice job, after the first four, five minutes we executed a little bit better, once we kind of saw it firsthand.  But it put us in a hole that we weren't able to come out of.  But he's just a physical specimen that we weren't able to combat.  I thought James Keefe did a nice job for awhile, but over the course of the game we were not able to stop him.
Q. Can you give us an update on Jaiden's status and then also just Bryce who looked like he had his usual real rough timeout there just physically?
JEROD HAASE:   Yeah, Bryce was an absolute warrior.  I mean he was pretty banged up for the last couple games.  Never in doubt in terms of him wanting to be out there, he fought through it, but obviously it impacted him, he was struggling walking yesterday and today.  But certainly competed like a warrior and very impressed with that.  Jaiden wants to play, he wants to get out there, the time line it's going to be a day-to-day type thing but I am hopeful that he'll be back soon.
