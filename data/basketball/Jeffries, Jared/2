<p>	Q.  Dane and Tom, if you could both answer this.  The way Dixon has been dominating in the tournament, how important is it to try to limit the damage he does and how do you go about trying to do that? </p>


<p>	Q.  Coach Davis, given the Rich history of Indiana basketball, how does it kind of feel to be carving out your own place in that history with these guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering if any of you remember watching the '87 Championship game, what your memories were of that?</p>

<p>	Q.  Dane, I was wondering if you could talk about how Jared's injury back against Louisville maybe helped change this team and helped it survive and get to this point? </p>
<p>	Q.  The stereotypes you grow up dreaming of leading Indiana to NCAA Championships, is that something you did grow up dreaming about, and now that you're one step from it, what does it mean to you and maybe to your hometowns? </p>


<p>	Q.  How is the ankle this morning, Tom?  Was it limiting for you or was it just the inactivity really for a week that was more of a hurdle for you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Dane, how big an underdog do you think the perceptions are?  What do you think people think is going to happen tomorrow?  Would it be that staggering an upset if you guys won? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mike, you haven't practiced a lot on Sunday this year.  It's Easter Sunday before the National Championship game.  Does that change anything?  Do you practice today?  If you don't, do you practice tomorrow morning? </p>

<p>	Q.  Mike, same question I asked the guys earlier.  The way Dixon has been dominating in the tournament, how important is it for you to at least limit the damage he does and how would you like to go about doing that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Tom, do you think anywhere outside of Maryland tomorrow night the rest of the country will be pulling for you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you credited Dave Dickerson with the effort against Duke a little bit.  Can we expect the same phone call today? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mike, when you got the job, you said if this team won the national title, you'd let them put the names on the back of the Jerseys.  Will you still do that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mike, AJ sat out of the game, the hamstring was hurting more than expected.  Is he okay for tomorrow? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mike and Tom, when you're playing the game, the adrenaline flow being the way it is, your ankle being in the shape that it is, is it worse when you leave the game and try to re-enter in, Mike, the Coverdale story was sort of the focus this week leading up to the Final Four.  Did that in any way deflect some of the minutia that you had to deal with in the past coming in for a big event like this? </p>

<p>	Q.  It appeared that maybe starting a game and playing on it, warming up, starting, you'd be okay.  Then when you leave the game for a period of time and Perry comes in, it might be more difficult for you to come back in. </p>

<p>	Q.  Coach, can you talk about how you get players to accept roles and be unselfish when a lot of other teams seem to have trouble accomplishing that?  How critical is that to your success to have people accept roles? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jared was quoted last week at the south regional that you look at this basketball team, two or three of them can't dunk, they don't look that athletic.  There sort of is that perception out there.  Are you a lot more athletic than people realize? </p>


<p>	Q.  Mike, you had talked about in your first year at Indiana the criticism you took personally, that was the thing you had to learn to overcome.  If you guys win tomorrow night, obviously you're going to get a lot of praise.  How will you then personally handle that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mike and Jared, I was wondering if you could talk about the challenge of playing against Baxter and Wilcox.  Are you going to need perhaps an even better game out of Jeff Newton tomorrow night? </p>

<p>	Q.  You guys have all made an issue of us versus them, versus the media, versus the opponent, versus the world.  Has that been good for you?  Has that made you tighter in your locker room?  Has it helped you? </p>
<p>	Q.  After you beat North Western to win a share of the Big-10, you talked about how it was going to be great going back to Assembly Hall and seeing the 2002 up there on the banner for a Big-10 Championship.  Have you thought at all about what it would be like to walk into Assembly Hall and see a sixth NCAA Championship banner up there? </p>

<p>	Q.  Dane, you shaved your head pre-season.  Didn't we hear that Coach Treloar would shave his head if you went to the Final Four? </p>
<p>	Q.  You guys talk a lot about Indiana history and the history of Indiana basketball.  Are you familiar at all with Maryland's history?  Do you know much about past players or coaches at all? </p>

<p>	Q.  Have any of you heard from any of the Indiana alumni who have been in the Final Four?  I know a lot of former IU players are down here.  Do you plan to talk to any of them? </p>
<p>	Q.  Going back to Mike's feeling that when Indiana was being criticized, that he took it personally.  Did any one of you guys notice that?  If so, did any one of you go and say to him, "It's not you, coach, it's the program, it's the expectations"? </p>

<p>	Q.  When Mike talks about the criticism, particularly in his first year, he took that personally, did you at all recognize that, see that he was taking it personally?  If so, did any one of you go and talk to him and say, "It's not about you, it's the makeup of this program"? </p>
