<p>	Q.  Jared, they were pretty rough inside.  Did they bump you a little off stride with their muscle? </p>
<p>	Q.  How did your ankle hold up, Tom?  How did you feel about your play?  Did it affect it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Tom, you guys have had great shooting performances throughout the tournament.  What was it that Maryland did that prevented you from having another one tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  Tom, Jared, what is kind of the feeling or emotion that you feel you kind of took the team as far as it could go or is it a feeling of coming up short? </p>

<p>	Q.  What do you feel like, despite tonight, what did you do for Indiana basketball this year, this run? </p>

<p>	Q.  Tom, you talked about Maryland making the plays when they really had to at the end.  To finally take the lead, Dixon came down with the big 3-pointer, is that the kind of play you're talking about? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jared, I hate to ask you now, but you're facing a big decision.  Do you have any inclination, what will your process be from here? </p>
<p>	Q.  Tom, can you talk about -- obviously the first part of the game, they were able to get their running game going.  Coach was telling you that you couldn't run with them.  What did you do to slow it down, get it into your pace?  What did you do? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jared, for how physical a game it was, are you surprised you didn't get to the line at all in the second half? </p>

<p>	Q.  Can you comment on what the seniors meant to this year and to this program, Jarrad Odle and Dane Fife? </p>
<p>	Q.  After you came back in the second half and you take the lead, they kind of surged away from you at that point.  Was it a matter of expending so much energy to catch them, there wasn't much left in the tank? </p>
<p>	Q.  Tom mentioned you hadn't faced a defense that could do the things that Maryland's defense did tonight.  Did their intensity on that end catch you by surprise? </p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously Lonny Baxter was a big concern coming in.  He just kept getting a lot of touches.  Can you talk about his play? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there a sense from you that this team went as far as it could possibly go, obviously exceeding some expectations, and can the future still be bright even if you don't have Jeffries back next year? </p>
<p>	Q.  You took a two-point lead, 44-42, late in the game, then Maryland seemed to clamp down defensively.  From your vantage point, what was it that Maryland was doing from that point to take the advantage? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you address the early part of the game when they seemed to get a running game going, how concerned were you?  Did you make any specific changes to slow it down? </p>
<p>	Q.  The free throw disparity was pretty pronounced in the second half.  Were you okay with the way it was called? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said yesterday that you felt you had already claimed the crown, no matter what happened tonight.  Despite the disappointment of the loss, do you feel the program can still claim a crown for being here? </p>
<p>	Q.  What has this season done for your drive as a basketball coach and the things that you like to accomplish specifically as a coach? </p>
<p>	Q.  You limited Dixon to only nine shots, but he still scored a game-high 18 points.  Do you think you did as good a job on him as possible? </p>
<p>	Q.  Dixon did hit the three to put them back ahead, then a two right after that to put them ahead by seven.  What does it say about a player when his best moments are when the game is at its biggest moments? </p>
