Warriors   118
  Clippers - 97

Q.   Mark, what did you do or what happened that Steph got those open looks right off the bat?   Was there something tweaked?   Was there something involved in getting him those shots?
COACH JACKSON:   We made plays, set great screens.   There were times we got them off the basketball.   We got stops, which is huge. 
There's no secret we're at our best when we're pushing the basketball off missed shots, turnovers. 
I thought our energy was spectacular.   39 points in that first quarter was huge. 
But we played with a sense of urgency, and I think our superstar basketball player was special.

Q.   Coach, did you get a sense that something changed in him?   Did he have a different mindset, maybe he wanted to take over this game?
COACH JACKSON:   I'm sure he wanted to take over every game.   The difference is that they trapped him.   They got the ball out of his hands and he made the right plays. 
Tonight with Draymond in the lineup, it makes it much tough ter to do, a price to pay.   He sets great screens, and not only that, he's a live threat at the 3‑point line.   We have to make a conscious of getting back to him. 
32 assists for us is a tremendous sign of taking care of the basketball, being patient, being unselfish, and I thought Steph just made great decisions.

Q.   Is it safe to say we'll see more of that small ball starting lineup going forward? 
COACH JACKSON:   That's going to be our lineup.   So, yes, I think it gives us a great chance.   Draymond did a great job of ‑‑ Blake Griffin playing at an extremely high level, but he made him work. 
And I give a lot of credit to Jermaine O'Neal.   I was thinking about making the switch, and Jermaine came up to me and said, Coach, what do you think about starting somebody else and bringing me off the bench? 
And not enough credit is given to my guys or to a guy like him, who is a total team player, who, when the lights are the brightest and it's the back nine of his career, took a back seat and was thinking how could we figure this out, how can we make an adjustment, and made the suggestion.
And then even the last‑‑ trying to get another guy in the game, he comes in and says, Let me go get Harrison or somebody else so that these guys can get a round of applause. 
Just unselfish true professional that I don't take for granted and I appreciate.

Q.   Mark, I know you aren't coaching the other team, but they've gone through some stuff.   Did you sense maybe this game was affected by the controversy at all, and did you maybe say let's jump on them early to see if they're all there?
COACH JACKSON:   No.   No, I think certainly I believe everybody was affected by what took place.   I don't believe it was just the Clippers.   I don't think there was anything said directly towards the Clippers and their players. 
I think it was insulting to all of us.   So I wouldn't minimize‑‑ we got blown out in Game 2 with no controversy.   We own that. 
At the end of the day we played extremely well today and we won the ballgame.   I think both teams were somewhat bothered by what has taken place the last 24 hours.   But my guys just played with great energy, great effort, and now we go to LA.

Q.   Basically you cut your rotation like six and a half maybe, maybe seven.   Was that obviously a conscious decision and maybe see this going forward in the series?
COACH JACKSON:   It will be a flow thing.   I thought my guys played great.   I thought they had fresh bodies.   And every time I asked them, they felt like they were good.   So it didn't look like they had been worn out where I needed to get other guys in. 
So I think it worked out perfectly this afternoon, and we'll see how it goes going forward.   I've got total confidence in my guys on the bench and what they bring to the table.   But this game was a big‑time victory for the guys.
Look at Hilton.   He's a guy that came in, gave us great minutes.   And there's subtle things.   He comes up to me before we leave the court and said, Thank you for believing in me, thank you for trusting me.   It goes a long way man.   It goes a long way.

Q.   (Off microphone). 
COACH JACKSON:   He was spectacular.   I thought this was some of his best work in a Warrior uniform.   Scoring the basketball, attacking, rebounding the basketball, facilitating, making plays, defending at a high level. 
He said to me at the end of Game 3, We're going to get Game 4.   It was a throwaway line.   I'm sitting there, we just lost a big game.   But he was sincere. 
And he came out with the right mindset, another guy.   I'm at the gym tonight, he's probably going to show up and get shots and work on his game.
But he played outstanding basketball.   Total game‑‑ total top‑to‑bottom big‑time game for him.

Q.   Coach, how do you feel that Draymond did defensively, especially matched up against Blake?
COACH JACKSON:   Oh, he's going against a guy that is playing incredible basketball, has been a handful for us to match up against, making all sorts of shots at the rim, jump shots, post moves.
I thought Draymond did a great job of battling him, making him work.   And against a great player is what you want to do is make them work.   They're going to still be able to score the basketball.   But one thing I know is Draymond's not going to quit.   He's going to fight. 
And he gave us a spark.

Q.   The same way seemed like David Lee was much more active, maybe much more aggressive today. 
COACH JACKSON:   Yes, he was much more aggressive.   I thought it was off of the unselfish play of other guys.   Put them in pick and rolls.   We moved the basketball, great ball movement and man movement.   And he was a live weapon where he was able to use his angles. 
And I thought he played outstanding.   And I thought he did a great job defensively also at times.   Because now he's gotta be that weak‑side guy.
But he had a big night.   And we need him to have big nights against this team, because their bigs have to work.

Q.   You guys have had so much animosity‑‑ we've talked about it a lot in the media ‑‑ between these two teams in the past.   It's a very physical.   Are you surprised there hasn't any been fisticuffs?   I've watched a lot of NBA over the years, and I'm sure a lot of these guys and people here ‑‑ you've played in them where there have been, but you've managed to‑‑ has it been the refs?   Have you talked to these guys:   Let's be cautious?   Because I know there's been some flagrant fouls called, but it's gotten really intense at times. 
COACH JACKSON:   But it's playoff basketball.   At the end of the day obviously both teams have feelings towards each other and we compete at a high level. 
But to the core I believe that both teams respect one another.   We knew going in it's going to be a physical series.   We knew going in it would be a great battle. 
But we've got great respect for them.   And obviously Doc is a tremendous coach.   So it's not going to get to that.   It's not going to get to that.
