 Q.  Have you seen New Orleans play at all last year, any impressions of them? 
 HILTON ARMSTRONG:  Seen a little bit, especially with Chris Paul, he's helped the team out a lot.  He's a great player and I think he can make me a better player. 

 Q.  You showed a lot of emotion when Rudy got drafted.  What was going through your minds in that situation? 
 HILTON ARMSTRONG:  He's a UCONN player.  He's like one of my brothers.  I've been with him for two years and every day, you see him every day, even over the summer we keep in contact. 
 To see him drafted just made me feel good. 

 Q.  Emeka Okafor is a UCONN guy, he's a pretty sharp guy, did he leave an impression?  I'm sure you chatted with him about the importance of scholarship at the college, as well as basketball skills; did that leave an impression on you? 
 HILTON ARMSTRONG:  Yeah, definitely.  He leads by example.  He was always a hard worker off the court also.  At school, he always had a book in his hand and always studying and trying to keep everybody eligible so they could do their best. 

 Q.  Talk about your game and how NBA-ready you are right now and what skills and will it take a while to adjust? 
 HILTON ARMSTRONG:  I can get better in every aspect of my game. 
 Right now, I think I do pretty good with defense, shot-blocking and I have an offensive game that a lot of people don't know about.  I think the New Orleans workout, that really showed, and that's a great upside for me.
