<p>	Q.  Your team never gave up, there was this run in the second half where the Monarchs got up by 10, and you guys came right back at them.  What were the difference makers down the stretch? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the last shot of the game with Kesha.  Was that drawn up for her?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about Coach Whisenant and what he brings to the league and the type of defense that's been able to instill in his players. </p>
<p>	Q.  The beginning of the second half was a real momentum turn --</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously, that had an impact throughout the second half then. </p>
<p>	Q.  Two times you don't made this trip here and two times didn't seal the deal.  So what do you have to tell yourself as far as the future, as far as coaching this team?</p>
