MIKE THIBAULT:  I don't really have much of an opening statement.  It was just a fun weekend for everybody to see the continued growth of our league and the excitement.  I think every year you see more athleticism and more excitement.  I told our team I wanted to get 100; I didn't mean the other team.  But, you know, it was a nice up-and-down game.  My team is going to have three-point shooting practice later on tonight.  You know, I hope everybody was entertained.  I think the players came and gave a great effort.
