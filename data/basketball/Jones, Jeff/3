 Q.   After the slow start, what got you guys back in it there?   
COACH JONES:   Our energy level just went up.   Our start, unfortunately, was reminiscent of some other slow starts we've had this year on the road or on neutral sites.   I think it was compounded by the fact that Stanford came out red‑hot.   Brown hit three threes that were NBA threes, and it wasn't necessarily bad defense.   
What changed was we started attacking and got them out of the rhythm that they were in.   We played with more emotion.   And ultimately, gosh, I'm so proud of these guys.   Been a terrific ride this year.   I thought maybe we could deal another one or two.   Absolutely can't fault the effort at all.   But ultimately, you've got to put the ball in the basket and we didn't do that well enough.   
   
 Q.   You struggled to shoot early, to score early; what's it nerves?   What do you attribute it to?   What were you seeing out there?   
AMBROSE MOSLEY:   I don't know.   We just can't make the shot, or I just didn't make the shot.   Learning experience.   Going to work in the off‑season I guess.   
   
 Q.   Randle picked up his fourth early in the half.   They left him in and he was pretty effective.   
COACH JONES:   Yeah, he was terrific.   I think down the stretch, he really was the difference, the big floater that he hit over Arledge, I'm not sure what that made the margin.   He hit at least one, if not two, big threes.   So he was terrific.   
   
 Q.   Your approach coming out the second half, I think you didn't have a three in the first half.   
TREY FREEMAN:   Try to make the shot.   Coach drew up the play.   He told me what to do.   I just had to produce.   
   
 Q.   They didn't turn the ball over much, they had in the first half, were you trying to turn it over or just a product of your energy level?  
COACH JONES:   I think it was a product or by‑product of our aggressiveness.   We went to the pressure and that was as much to get us going as anything else.   We were able to come up with a couple steals and convert points off turnovers, so that was good, kind of got our crowd into it and gave us a little bit of life.   We are not accustomed to pressing for a long period of time, so we couldn't stay with it for an extended period.   But it served I think a purpose of allowing us to get the back in the game.  
   
 Q.   You won nine more games than you did a year ago and you've got a bunch of guys coming back.   What are your thoughts going forward?   
TREY FREEMAN:   Just one of those times like last year, we're hurt about the loss but it's something to build on.   We tried this year, and this year we fell short.   So hopefully next year we can definitely make the NCAAs.
