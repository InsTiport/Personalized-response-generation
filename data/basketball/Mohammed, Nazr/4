<p>	Q. Tony, you guys played incredible in that Phoenix series, do you think you need to play better to beat this Detroit team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Watching that Game 7 the other night, was there anything that stood out to you like, "man, we have to really step up," any particulars? </p>
<p>	Q.  What do you think about Detroit's defense and the way they played defense? </p>
<p>	Q.  Two great defensive teams, how ugly can some of these games get?</p>
<p>	Q.  It's not going to be pretty though, is it?</p>
<p>	Q.  You won a championship here in San Antonio at the Alamodome on a pretty big stage in the Final Four.  Does this compare to that? </p>
<p>	Q.  The atmosphere?</p>
<p>	Q.  Now, if you talk about the difference in attack with Phoenix's front line, the more athletic front lines up and down through Detroit, even though you have a couple of seven-footers you can shoot from the outside like Rasheed Wallace, it's a more physical group. </p>
<p>	Q.  Is your game more suited to Shawn Marion and defending him or Rasheed Wallace?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you watch Game 7, couple minutes to go, going up against Shaq and getting ready for that --</p>
<p>	Q.  How ugly can some of these games get with two great defensive teams?</p>
