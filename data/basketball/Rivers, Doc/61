THE MODERATOR: Questions.   
 Q.  What do you make of your team's fight tonight?  
DOC RIVERS: It's funny.  Maybe you asked me before the game.  You just love this group.  They just don't give in.  They allow you to coach them.  They allow you to sub them without drama.   
We were just looking for a lineup tonight.  I mean, they were beating us in every facet of the game.  We kept searching, searching.  We kind of stumbled on one that we liked.  We changed a couple things offensively and defensively in the third on the fly.  It worked out for us.   
But I thought it was our spirit more than anything.  Just every single guy.  I loved the end of the game, Shai made a great decision pass, then we made a great shot.  Down the end of the game, I loved it.   
 Q.  Down 31, they throw in some of their down-the-bench guys.  Is it at simple as keep fighting?  
DOC RIVERS: We have to.  It's who we are.  We talked about that.  Every timeout, it's just who we are.  Be us.  We said it, Let's be us.  Don't change.  Keep playing the way we play.   
They hung in there long enough.  We found a way to win the game.   
 Q.  Landry said you mentioned at halftime.  What did you tell them at halftime?  
DOC RIVERS: That we were going to win.  Just hang in there.  Just hang in there long enough.  I was honest with them.  I said, I don't know how.  I said, We're going to figure this out, but just hang in there with each other.   
I thought they did that.   
 Q.  Even in the third when you were down quite a bit, Pat was still clapping.  
DOC RIVERS: He's so important for us.  I think people get lost in some of his antics and stuff.  But his spirit and his soul is so important for our team.  He was encouraging everybody.   
I thought him and Lou in particular in the timeouts, when we were down, they kept going to the young guys.  You could see that.  I thought they was really important for us.   
 Q.  Steph obviously got off to a hot first half.  What went into slowing him down, taking away some of those shots?  
DOC RIVERS: I think foul trouble helped us.  He got in foul trouble.  Let's be honest.  So he wasn't on the floor.  That's the best defense that you can possibly have on him.   
Then I thought, you know, on the other end, we involved him in a lot of plays.  I didn't think we did that in the first game.  I thought he was fresh on offense because he didn't have to do a lot on defense.  I thought we did a better job there.   
 Q.  You were heavy underdogs in this series, not even to win a game.  How do you not get satisfied with just one game?  
DOC RIVERS: That's not enough for us.  We didn't come here for that.  This is special.  I don't care if you're playing - I can't think of a really, really, really bad team, and you're down 30 on the road to anybody, you come back, it's special.   
But that's what was special.  Not winning the game.  You could hear them in the locker room.  They're not talking about that.  They're talking about coming back and winning.   
They have expectations.  This team does.  No one wants to agree with us, and that's fine.  We're fine with that.  But we have our own expectations and we're going to keep them.   
Thank you.
