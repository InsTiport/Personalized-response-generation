  Q. Are you seeing anything differently or the same comparing this Game 2 versus the Game 2 against Cleveland where you're coming off the loss in Game 1 to Cleveland?  
 DOC RIVERS: No, I mean, two different series, obviously. You know, we had 48 hours to watch film and get ready. But at the end of the day for both teams there's not going to be a lot of changes. I've said it throughout the playoffs, this is who we are, and we didn't play accordingly in Game 1. You know, and our guys had to hear it for 48 hours, what they didn't do. But we knew that anyway.   
 So no, there's not going to be -- there's not a big difference between the two in that way, no.   
  
  Q. Did you get a chance to look at any of the tape from the Thunder series or maybe the Phoenix or Utah series to get a feel for what they did and how they slowed the combination of Kobe and Pau?  
 DOC RIVERS: Yeah.  
  
  Q. Do you take something from that and adjust how you operate, or do you just do what you do?  
 DOC RIVERS: We do what we do. We didn't do it. But obviously you watch everybody. You watch every game, you know, throughout. Every once in a while you'll see something offensively or defensively that you think is interesting. But at the end of the day you do your stuff. You can't start changing because that's not who you are and that would affect your team more than anything.   
  
  Q. Dr. Jack Ramsay and Tex Winter just received the Chuck Daly Award. Just in terms of your philosophy, both the tough years and the good years now, are you a coach that believes a system should conform to the players or should you take your players and apply them to your system?  
 DOC RIVERS: Well, I think it's a combination, really. I think systems are important. I think you have to have a system. But when you get players, obviously you try to somehow fit them in that system or tweak your system to fit them, and I don't think it's different for anybody. But I do think systems are important.
