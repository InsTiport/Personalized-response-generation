 Q.   Erik is saying that Chris Bosh is a gameâ€‘time decision.   No surprise.   What are your thoughts about him going into this game?   What challenges does it pose?   
COACH DOC RIVERS:   It just gives them another weapon.   He'll play.   Probably won't start.   It's pretty easy to know when Kevin is coming out of the game, and my guess is they'll probably put him in right when Kevin is coming out, at least early on.   And then after that you never know how we'll sub.   But I would be surprised if he started, the way they're talking.   
We're ready either way, honestly.   We don't care one way or the other.   He's going to play in the game.   And if he doesn't play in the game, he doesn't play in the game.   Either way we have to be ready to play the Miami Heat tonight, not worry about who's on the floor.   
   
 Q.   You sort of answered the question already, but knowing that that's the most likely scenario, that when KG goes out, Chris would come in, does that make you alter anything, or even think about it?   
COACH DOC RIVERS:   No, we can't play Kevin more minutes, you know.   So it is what it is.   Listen, it's who we are.   We can't do anything about that.   So we'll just have to guard (indiscernible) somebody on him, somebody else when he comes in.   
   
 Q.   Doc, bench play was huge for you obviously back home.   What's the key to getting that second unit activated on the road?   
COACH DOC RIVERS:   Well, they have to come in and get stops.   For our second unit to be effective, just like in Game 3 and 4, they came in, they became an energy unit, they became a defensive unit, and that allows them to score and cut and run the floor and make shots.   So we have to do that.   
I've always thought, at least for the second unit, the role players, it's easier to play defense than it is to make shots on the road.   You're not as comfortable offensively.   But defense has nothing to do with that.   It's just being mentally ready.   So I'm hoping we are.
