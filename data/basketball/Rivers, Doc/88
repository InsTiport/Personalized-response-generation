WARRIORS   100
  CLIPPERS - 99

Q.   Super tough game out there, physical game.   Can you talk about it? 
COACH RIVERS:   Yeah, it wasn't a very well‑played game by either team going by the shooting percentages, but I thought both teams played extremely hard.   You know, I honestly thought they played it.   I don't know if it was harder than us.   I thought we played hard, but I did think they won the 50‑50 game in a big way.   We kind of closed the gap with offensive rebounds in the second half a little bit, but I think they had 15 more shots than us at halftime, and we were still up 3 or 4. 
Every big rebound they got, we cut the lead, got it to two, Harrison Barnes gets an offensive rebound.   So they made the big plays. 
I thought, honestly, it was one of those games where neither team shot the free throws well.   Neither team shot the ball well.   It was one of those hustle games.   Give them credit.   I thought they came up with just enough plays to beat us.

Q.   How much did the combination of injuries and fatigue hurt Chris Paul?   What is he dealing with, his hand or thumb? 
COACH RIVERS:   He's dealing with a lot of stuff; but, listen, he's on the floor and Golden State doesn't care, bottom line.   He does have injuries, and there is no doubt about that.   I'm sure they have some too, but, listen, I think once you're on the floor, you're on the floor. 
Chris is playing terrific to me defensively, and that's what we need him to do in this series.   It probably does take a little bit of his offense away, but I'm good with that.

Q.   What was the message you gave your team right after the game?   Also, can you just talk about your experience coaching in a Game 7? 
COACH RIVERS:   Well, I've lost some, and I've won some.   So the experience is you have to come play.   I've won some on the road, I've lost some at home, and you've got to go play.   You've just got to go out there and play the game and be aggressive and try to take the game.   When you're at home, you can't rely on home.   That doesn't work.   It's going to be great to be at home.   We'll be back in our safe haven now, and the fans will give us great energy, but you've still got to perform, and that is the bottom line. 
That's what I told them.   We've just got to trust each other.   I thought the third quarter we stopped trusting.   We were basically an iso basketball team.   No fun to watch, and we're not very good at it.

Q.   These types or these tone of games seem to suit them, Game 1 and again tonight.   Did you think this type again on Sunday? 
COACH RIVERS:   Yeah, I think it will be just like this.   I really do.   We have to be able to handle it.   But they were the tougher team tonight, I thought.   But I thought we wanted to win.   I thought we came out and played well in the first half.   The third quarter did us in and foul trouble hurt us tonight.

Q.   What is your reaction to the ESPN report that Donald Sterling is battling cancer? 
COACH RIVERS:   Didn't know it until just now.   I don't have a reaction to that.   I hope it's not true.
