THE MODERATOR:   Questions.

Q.   (No microphone.)
DOC RIVERS:   We believe we're good anyway.   We know they're good, too.   We have humility.   We understand they're a great team.   We believe we are, too. 
Neither team really shot the ball well.   It really came down to mental toughness, having the ability to hang in there, and we did that. 
You know, we kind of stumbled on a couple things that we liked offensively and reran it, ran it into the ground.   I was really happy with that aspect because we tend to get too smart sometimes.   Tonight I just thought we settled on one thing, and it was working.   We didn't try to trick it up.   We didn't try to do anything.   We basically in the fourth quarter ran it for almost six straight minutes and got production out of it. 
So offensively I was really happy with that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
DOC RIVERS:   Yeah, it's one of those games.   Sometimes you can't win.   You're in the way of yourselves.   I thought we had a little bit of that going on.   They were just bad, too, at times.   One of those nights. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
DOC RIVERS:   Yeah, I don't know if this is it yet.   But we won the game.   These two teams, it's one game, it's a bigger game during the game than one game.   You can tell by I don't know what all that stuff was. 
But after the game, we put it in its proper place:   it's just one game.   It's nice winning games when you don't play great.   It wasn't like we weren't trying to play great.   We had great shots.   First half we had shots I would take all day.   They just didn't go in.   Honestly, they had some, too, that didn't go in. 
Maybe both teams were pressing or whatever.   I don't know what it was. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
DOC RIVERS:   It's tough, you know.   Yeah, we tried as much as we could.   I thought we were pretty effective with it.   You know, and other guys on their team had to try to beat us.   That was the thought. 

Q.   (No microphone.) 
DOC RIVERS:   It was great.   Him and then Jamal as well. 
But, you know, we just got to keep doing it through the team context ‑   I thought we did that ‑   instead of everybody wanting to win the game.   Like I thought in the first half, everybody wanted to win the game.   They thought all night like how I was going to beat them tomorrow.   Then all of a sudden we start, how we were going to beat them. 
I thought once that changed, we were better. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
DOC RIVERS:   Jamal is just good.   He's a professional scorer.   What I love about him, first of all, I wasn't that good, but he can miss five in a row and it doesn't faze him.   He knows what he can do.   Once he gets one to go in, the rim seems to open up for him and get bigger. 
We needed every point he had tonight. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
DOC RIVERS:   Yeah, that is.   You know, it's funny.   We went small.   I thought that was very effective for us tonight.   So at one point he almost had the rebound. 
What I like with Jamal and Reggie, our bench was huge tonight.   I thought Jordan, Reggie, Baby, you look at their numbers, it doesn't say a lot ‑ well maybe it does because of Jamal ‑ but they couldn't make a shot in the one stretch, and didn't lose the lead.   They got stops every time down.   They allowed our starters to get some rest. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
DOC RIVERS:   Every night, yeah.   Every night. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
DOC RIVERS:   Well, I just think it's a byproduct of the season and a lot of games.   It happens.   We've had stretches where we were the most dominant offensive team, then we've had stretches where we were awful. 
It just happens.   You play so many games, you get out of the gym, you kind of had slippage and lose your way a little bit. 
That team's not going to take a lot to fix.   I can tell you that.   We need to get in the gym.   I said this before the game as well.   We just don't have time right now.   We have to keep playing games. 
There's a stretch where you might grab your team again, get them going again.   It's just a byproduct of the regular season. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
DOC RIVERS:   I couldn't tell you who we've beaten, honestly.   Honestly, I don't know.
