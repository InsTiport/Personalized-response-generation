  Q. Doc, talk about the killer instinct and how important you think it is for the team.   
 DOC RIVERS: Well, we just have to focus on basketball and keep our focus on what we're doing. We can't get into killer instinct or whatever we're going to get into. We just have to focus on doing what we've been doing, and not taking our eye off of that.   
  
  Q. Is that going to be easy?   
 DOC RIVERS: Well, it won't be easy. But we earned this position and we should be happy for that. We earned getting up 2-0. But we still -- we haven't had the opportunity to defend our home court. We did our job there, but we haven't done our job at home. As far as we're concerned, until that happens, nothing has happened in this series.   
  
  Q. How do you guard against a letdown with this lead?  
 DOC RIVERS: Well, you don't guard against it. You just keep focusing on the execution and improving and getting ready. And each game is a single game. That's what we talked about. That's been our speech through this playoff series, all of the series. Each game is a single game. Game 1 was an individual game. Game 2. And Game 3 will be as well.   
 As I told our guys, we have yet to beat Orlando on our home floor this year. And that's something that we have to have our focus on.   
  
  Q. Did you have to tell guys to stay away from here yesterday?   
 DOC RIVERS: Yesterday was easy. We got in later anyway, so we did that on purpose. With the games being so late, 8:30 games, and you have to travel, we left from Orlando yesterday. We didn't leave after the game. By the time we got in -- some guys had to get treatment. Other than that, we wanted everybody off the floor.   
  
  Q. How difficult is it for you waiting for that next game? Do you like the prep time?   
 DOC RIVERS: I don't mind the prep time. For me it's always good in some ways. Sometimes you probably watch too much. I don't know how many more times I can watch Game 1 and 2. But I'm still going to do it, because that's what we do.   
 You never know. After the fifth time, which is where I'm at already, you do see something different every time. So, you know, you never know what it will do for you.   
  
  Q. I have to ask you about Paul -- what do you think about what he said after the game --  
 DOC RIVERS: I didn't like it. I don't mind the confidence part. That's good. You have to have confidence. But we want to be humble, and we haven't achieved anything. I think that's what he was trying to say. It came out at the end -- I wish they would have taken the mike away the last couple of words. Up until then it was pretty good.   
 We do have to go home, and our fans will help us. But we have to do it on the floor.   
  
  Q. Have you talked with him about that?   
 DOC RIVERS: No. I talked to the team about it. He is part of the team. Unfortunately I talked to the team in the locker room right after the game. You had already -- someone had already grabbed it.   
  
  Q. What did you say to the team?   
 DOC RIVERS: Just we've done nothing. We really haven't. Guys, we won two games. We're up 2-0. Again, we just have to keep playing. Orlando is the favorite, or was the favorite, for a reason. They were playing better than everybody in the playoffs for a reason. And we can't take our eye off of that.   
  
  Q. Do you also look at the fact that both games were pretty close.   
 DOC RIVERS: Yeah.   
  
  Q. The last game came down, Vince missed two free-throws, and the missed time-out, it could have gone either way.   
 DOC RIVERS: That's right. Either game could have gone either way. This series is going to be that way. There's not going to be a game where -- both teams are very good. Both teams are very close. Both teams play very similar in a lot of ways. So it's not going to be a comfort game. You're not going to have one of those whether you're at home or on the road.   
  
  Q. What kind of judgments do you expect? Do you expect them to make major adjustments?   
 DOC RIVERS: No, they have to think -- both games they could have won. So they're not going to make many. We'll prepare for it. We work on our zone offense every day. We have yet to see them run a zone. But we have to work on it every day, work on them going deep with Rashard at the three. We work on that as well.   
 When it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen. At least you worked on it. The good news is with all this rest is you do have time to work on stuff. At the end of the day, no matter what adjustments we make, and we'll make some too and the'll make them, the players have to play and they have to perform.
