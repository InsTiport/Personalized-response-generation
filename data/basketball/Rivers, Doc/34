 THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Doc.
 Q. After last game you said something to the effect of Zu had some good production, but some areas he still could have improved on.  After today, how did he do in that regard?
 DOC RIVERS:   He was phenomenal.  We talked about it.  He did the things we needed.  He really ran the floor.  That didn't show up statistically, but what it did, it created space, it created mismatches, then it ended up with Zub with a (indiscernible) in the post.
 I loved that our guys were looking for him.  I thought his rebounding was fantastic.  Really coming off the way we ended the game the other day with Zu, then coming back tonight, playing like that, that was fantastic for his confidence.
 Q. What did you see out of today's game that you think there are areas you could improve on specifically in this matchup?
 DOC RIVERS:   We got to find the shooters.  There's no doubt about that.  I thought in the first half they had a ton of offensive rebounds.  Luka is just a handful.  It takes a whole team to guard him.  I thought our guys did a pretty good job overall.  We lost him a couple times, which you can never do.
 There's a lot of room for improvement.  I just like how we played overall.  I thought we played like a team tonight on both ends.
 Q. On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being Playoff ready, where is your team?
 DOC RIVERS:   That's a good question.  I don't know, 6 or 7.  Still have Trez out.  We still have several guys that have minute restrictions that put a major problem on us tonight, especially with guards.  We still have Pat out.
 It would be nice to have a stretch where our whole team was available, practicing and playing.  But we haven't had that all year.  It's been amazing.  We just got to keep rolling.
 Q. How many practices do you think you've had with everyone?
 DOC RIVERS:   This year?  I think someone told us three.  I think it's been three with the entire group.
 Q. Obviously during the regular season when you have Trez on the floor, you have the luxury of playing him deep into games.  Without him here, what have you thought of Zu playing in more of those clutch minutes?  Does that change how you might approach his usage late in games?
 DOC RIVERS:   No, we already talked about it.  Between him, Trez and JaMychal...  JaMychal is a factor at the five.  He came in for Zu late, really closed the game off for us tonight with his facing.  We got three guys that we have used at the five that have been fantastic for us.
 Q. Maintaining this consistency and continuity that you seemed to develop today, how do you go about doing that?  What is the conversation like to your squad?
 DOC RIVERS:   It's a great question.  I wish I knew the answer.
 We just got to keep working and trusting.  I thought we played with a purpose tonight.  We didn't just show up for a game.  I didn't think they liked the way they lost the other night, and more importantly I don't think they liked the way they played the other night.
 We have to keep emphasizing sharing the ball.  We have so many guys that can score.  Marcus comes from the Nicks where he was the focal point.  Down the stretch he had the ball, dribbled it, posted Kawhi, got a bucket with it.  That's giving yourself to the team.  We got to keep guys continuing to do that.
 THE MODERATOR:   Doc, that's a wrap.
 DOC RIVERS:   Amen.  Take care, guys.
