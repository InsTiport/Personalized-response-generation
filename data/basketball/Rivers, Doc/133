 Q. How is the health of the players? Can you give an update real fast on how you guys are doing?
 DOC RIVERS: Everybody is good. Everybody is healthy, feels good, rested and ready to play. 
 So no, there's no issues on our end. Marquis Daniels is the only one. He's out for sure. 

 Q. Can you just give us a feeling for what's different from two years ago, just whether emotionally or what is different from this experience?
 DOC RIVERS: Oh, I don't know that there is. In some ways we have at least the starters, same starters, you but bench is completely different. For some of the guys this is their first time around. So you have to kind of watch their emotions. And even some of the guys who played last -- were on the bench last year, the last time they were not in the rotation as much. And then in a lot of ways it's their first time. 
 But other than that it's not much. We've got a veteran group, and you know, we know what we're in store for. 

 Q. Will you have to watch Rasheed's minutes, just judge how his back is doing?
 DOC RIVERS: Yeah, just judge. I mean, I don't anticipate any problems. You know, we are worried about conditioning a little bit. When you miss that many days in a row, even though you do bike work and stuff, I will watch that more than his actual injury, if he just tires quickly, especially the first stint just because of the adrenaline. But other than that I think he'll be fine.

 Q. And what about Marquis? Do you think he could be ready by the end of the series?
 DOC RIVERS: He actually did drills yesterday, had feeling again. So yeah, I do think he'll be ready. Before the series is over I think Marquis will be playing.
