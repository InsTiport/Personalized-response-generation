Spurs   111
  Clippers - 107, OT

Q.   What kind of game was that? 
DOC RIVERS:   It was disappointing.   D.J., I don't know if it hurt us or not.   We were actually down when he started doing it and we actually came back.   It was really after that.   Those probably hurt more.   We made a lot of mistakes, too. 
I don't know if we played our best game tonight.   I think that was pretty obvious, yet we still had a chance and you could say should have won the game, but we didn't.   It tells me a lot of things.   Number one, this is going to be a hell of a series, and we'll be ready for Game 3. 

Q.   How disappointing was it to lose this game?
DOC RIVERS:   Do I have to actually answer that question?   I mean, really.   I was disappointed, but you know, it's a loss.   We win the next one, we're happy again.   That's called sports, you know.

Q.   A few of Blake's turnovers, you guys are up two and he has the ball, was there kind of a play there or what was your view‑‑
DOC RIVERS:   No, it was a switch and we got‑‑ we've been running that play all game, got it to him on the elbow.   I think he scored the last two points from that spot, and he just made a good play.   The guy popped it loose and went down and made two free throws, so give him credit.

Q.   What did you think of Tim tonight?
DOC RIVERS:   He was great.   I mean, he was terrific.   I thought D.J. got those two fouls, and was a little more concerned about that then Tim got going, but Tim made some big shots for them.   Like I said, he probably has a notebook on how to adjust to everybody.

Q.   Was there any particular reason why Jamal Crawford didn't play any overtime period?
DOC RIVERS:   No, because we had J.J. on the floor.   That would be the particular reason. 

Q.   Every night from here on out, is there any worry now, just the amount of minutes that are going to your starters?
DOC RIVERS:   No, the minutes stand out because of the overtime, really, they do.   But we will adjust (inaudible) basically as many minutes as you wanted to, but from this point forward you have to be careful with minutes.

Q.   Did it seem to you that they were content early with letting Chris and Blake get there and really shut down J.J., work on Matt‑‑
DOC RIVERS:   I think that happened more than it did.   Matt had good shots and he just didn't make them, and J.J. had some good shots, but I thought they did a terrific job on him overall.   I thought Kawhi guarded him a lot and his length bothered him.   But I don't think pop went in the game thinking CP and Blake‑‑ no, I don't see that.
