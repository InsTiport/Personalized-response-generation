THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Doc.
Q. What did you see from Lou Williams tonight?  Seems like he found his rhythm.
DOC RIVERS:   Yeah, he just started getting his rhythm.  We talked about driving more especially in the second half.  I thought he started doing it.
Lou, he's a baller, man.  You can just see as the game went on, he just started filling in.  First time I thought he had his legs under him since he's been back.
Q. From the moment that you guys got Kawhi and P.G. last summer to now, what does it mean to get the No. 2 seed in the west?
DOC RIVERS:   It doesn't mean a lot.  Listen, with the injuries that we've had this year and all the other stuff, for us to be a 2 seed says that we're pretty good, right?  Everyone has done a hell of a job to keep this thing going.
Now let's hope we can get healthy, get Trez back hopefully the next couple of days, and go from there.
Q. This past six games Paul George has scored over 20 points per game.  What do you think that says in terms of what the break has been able to do for his health and rhythm?
DOC RIVERS:   Yeah, I think it's been great.  Number one, I thought he was playing great right before the break.  I thought that was the best basketball he played those last 10 games.  Then instead of taking off, he took his conditioning to another level.  You can see it in his play.
Q. Your thoughts about facing Dallas in the first round.
DOC RIVERS:   Not a lot.  I mean, they're terrific.  Best offensive team in history, right?  They have one of the young stars.  They're a two-star team now.  Porzingis is playing great.  I mean, I look at that, that's a tough matchup in the first round, that's what it is.
Q. How much of a jump do you have on the scouting?  You mentioned it might be Dallas the other day.
DOC RIVERS:   I think they thought it was us, too.  I don't know if either one of us had an advantage.  We had to win tonight to secure that.
We've played each other, what, three times.  We know each other.  It's going to be a hell of a series.
Q. All year obviously the goal has been to get P.G. and Kawhi and some of these guys healthy for the Playoffs.  Where would you assess where these guys are at physically and in rhythm?
DOC RIVERS:   I don't know rhythm-wise because, again, we just haven't had all our guys here.
Physically I think they're in great shape.  Lou is rounding out.  Got to get Pat back, Sham back.  But Kawhi and P.G. in particular, they're in great shape right now.  That's where we want it to be.
Q. You talked about wanting to get healthy, feeling impressed with yourselves that you're the 2 seed despite everything.  What is the vibe among the guys in that regard?
DOC RIVERS:   It's funny, I didn't mention that we secured the 2 seed.  I don't think anybody in the locker room talked about it.  We really don't care.  Like, we want to win it all.  We got to improve as a team.  We know that.  We have work to do.
But we're going to the Playoffs with that mindset.  That's the only thing that matters right now for us.
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, Doc.
DOC RIVERS:   Thank you, guys.
