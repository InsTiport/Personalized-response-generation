 Q. That first quarter, the defensive intensity.  I think Jokic was the only guy who made a shot, what did you think that have quarter?
 DOC RIVERS:   Just great intensity.  They really stuck to the game plan.  Didn't do a lot of individual thinking.  But I just thought we were competitive.  We competed.  We played hard.  You know, we made mistakes, but we covered them up because we're playing hard but more importantly than playing hard, I thought we were very competitive..
 Q. There were times you would take a big lead and they would reel it back in.  What did you think of your team's composure?
 DOC RIVERS:   This is a great example of a game, the old saying that your defense will save you and your offense at times will let you down.  We got great shots tonight.  We just couldn't make shots and I'm sure they are feeling the same way.
 But instead of worrying about the shots we wasn't making, we just kept playing defense and that allowed us to win the game.
 Q. You've played with a bench rotation in the playoffs but seems the last couple games you've settled on that group with Trezl, JaMychal, PG and Pat.  What do you like about the two-way balance?
 DOC RIVERS:   Yeah, I think in it we have two things:  We have enough scoring and we have enough defense.  So we need that balance.  We can't have all offensive players on the floor if your offense is not running, then get scored on.  So I just like the balance of offense, defense.
 Q. You're one game way of reaching the conference Finals for the first time in franchise history?
 DOC RIVERS:   Nothing.  Like that's not our goal.  So I don't even think no one cares to be honest.  It was a zero reaction is what I would say.  We haven't done anything yet.
