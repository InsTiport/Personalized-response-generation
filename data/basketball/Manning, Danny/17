  Wake Forest - 80 
 DANNY MANNING:   This afternoon was a very hard‑fought exciting ballgame.   Virginia Tech made a few more plays down the stretch than we did.   Jalen Hudson had an outstanding ballgame, and we couldn't slow them down, and having said that, I thought down the stretch we had a chance, and we just weren't able to capitalize.   But give Virginia Tech credit; they went out and made plays.  
 Q.   Danny, what was it about Jalen that made him such a tough match‑up and allowed him to get into the lane so much?
  DANNY MANNING:   Well, he's a talented player but we have to do a better job of staying in front of the basketball.  
 Q.   Cody, what did you know about Jalen?   He did not have a big role in the game in Winston‑Salem.   What did you see from him today? 
  CODY MILLER‑McINTYRE:   He was extremely aggressive.   Once he got his few points he just kept on attacking, attacking the rim, made 10 for 10 from the free‑throw line.   That was the biggest thing; he saw that he could get in the paint and he continued to do that throughout the game.  
 Q.   Danny, 60 seconds to go what was the play you Drew up there at the end of the game?   What were you looking to get?
  DANNY MANNING:   Well, we wanted dean owes coming off and then we had some action on the tail end and dean owes got a pretty good look and it didn't go down and we got a couple cracks at offensive rebounds and weren't able to put it in the basket.  
 Q.   Cody, I know you had a crack there at one of those tip‑ins, just your thoughts on the shot just not falling for you? 
  CODY MILLER‑McINTYRE:   I guess it wasn't meant to happen.   I was in the right position, got a hand on the ball, but it just rolled out.  
 Q.   Coach Manning, one thing that has been consistent with your Demon Deacon team is that they've always played hard.   How would you describe your first year of coaching here? 
  DANNY MANNING:   You know, obviously we'd like to have a better record than we ended with, so that's something that you like to see a little bit better.   I think these guys have gone through a lot of change.   I think change is hard for teenagers.   I think these guys have handled it very well.   We've come in and we've done things a lot different than what they're accustomed to, and they've handled it very well, and we just have to continue to work.   But to answer your question, I wish we were better off than we are right now, but I do feel we're moving in the right direction, not as fast as I would like or we would like, but we're getting there, and I think our foundation is almost down and intact, and we'll continue to work on that and build on it.  
 Q.   Danny and Cody, I had you with one stop of your last eight defensive possessions.   Why, and how bad did that hurt you? 
  DANNY MANNING:   Jalen Hudson.   We weren't able to stay in front of him.   He had the ball in his hands most of the time, and he made plays.   He made plays, and we weren't able to stop him. 
  CODY MILLER‑McINTYRE:   Weak side help.   We didn't do a good job at helping each other out and talking.   A lot of his points was just straight down the middle or straight to the rim after he got by the first person, there was no help.   As a team we have to play better team defense because he was a tough player tonight.   We shouldn't have let one person beat five players on the court.  
 Q.   Coach Manning and Cody, what are the most valuable lessons for foundational purposes that this team has learned this year, playing hard, getting competitive games?   I know right now it's probably not the best time to ask this question, but what are the most valuable things that you've set in place in this first year? 
  CODY MILLER‑McINTYRE:   I believe competing and playing hard are the two main things.   I believe if you look at the losses on the road throughout the few previous years, it was completely different, and even this year there was a few flashbacks to that, but it's a process, and we have to be patient with that and learn that it's going to come.   I think those are the two biggest things, just playing hard and compete like we did tonight.   We were down 11 at halftime, fought back, and from then on we was in a dogfight.   That's something that‑‑ those two things are the biggest foundations that Coach Manning has brought to the program, I believe.
  DANNY MANNING:   I think for me, we talk about doing things.   It's a new era for Wake Forest basketball.   We're asking these guys to do something they've never done before and they've handled it well, but I think for me the biggest center piece at this point in time of the year is how you feel after games like this.   This is supposed to fuel you when you're working out in the summer.   This is supposed to fuel you when you're in practice and the season gets long and you get tired, remembering this feeling and not wanting to have this feeling.   So that's something that we'll continue to talk to our young men about and let them know that, I mean, we have to continue to work.
