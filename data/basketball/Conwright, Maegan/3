THE MODERATOR:   We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then take questions for the players.   
COACH SEMRAU:   Well, they're a tough, tough basketball team.   I thought they played extremely well.   I thought defensively there was a stretch where they held us scoreless for awhile.   I thought that affected our defense.   And any time our defense is affected, that's not our strong suit.   
We have got to be able ‑‑ that's what we hang our hat on, defending on rebounding.   And this is the first time we have been out rebounded all year.   
I think that's what hurts the most is that in a big game situation, we lost what we were best at.   Give credit to Notre Dame.   I mean, they put us in tough positions defensively and made big plays.   
   
 Q.   Do you think the fact that Notre Dame had been in it last year and that you all were very rightfully to be in the game made any difference?  
COACH SEMRAU:   Well, it sure looked like it in the first half.   I thought that maybe ‑‑ I think any time you have experience at something it's a great teacher.   
I felt like the first time that we played at Notre Dame on January 2nd, that that experience was a great teacher for us for the rest of the year.   For the rest of our conference games.   
This experience will be a great teacher for us.   
   
 Q.   Obviously you got some more games to play, Maegan, what have you learned from the ACC tournament experience at this point?   
MAEGAN CONWRIGHT:   We played against some of the best, so going into tournament, that gives us a really strong suit as far as getting started.   We're playing against some of the best people, potential Final Four teams.   So to learn from them we wish we could have won, but to learn from them and get better is really the thing that we're going to take out of this.   
   
 Q.   You've been playing very well.   Is this just kind of a blip particularly since you got so long to get ready for your next game?  
COACH SEMRAU:   Yeah, I think it was just more mentality and possibly it was ‑‑ I just haven't seen my team respond that way in so long.   
We haven't‑‑ very, very, rarely have played from behind.   So, you can ask my SID, the statistic is unbelievable.   That we lead in most games for the entire game.   Maybe they come and make a run.   
So, learning how to play from behind is something that hopefully we got a taste of here today and we'll learn from that.   
THE MODERATOR:   All right.   Thank you.   
COACH SEMRAU:   Thank you.
