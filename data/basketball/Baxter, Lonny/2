<p>	Q.  Juan, given everything you've been through in your life, the personal triumphs, whatnot, how satisfying is this to get to this point?  Coach Williams, if you could talk about Juan's development more as a young man than as a player. </p>

<p>	Q.  What does it mean to try to win for this University which you care a great deal about, its first championship?  This has been a long desire going back many years, now you're in at least the championship game. </p>


<p>	Q.  Indiana has had pretty good success against guards in the tournament.  What kind of challenge do they present defensively?  What do you see from them?  If you could just talk about stepping it up in the tournament, kind of taking the team on your shoulders? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Coach Williams' journey to get to this point, what it would mean for you guys to get him a National Championship? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the fact that you guys will be playing a  -- being the favorite tomorrow night?  Usually you're in a situation in these kind of games where people are not looking at you in that role. </p>

<p>	Q.  There's been a lot of talk you guys want another shot at Duke.  You lost to Oklahoma earlier.  You were hoping you had a shot then.  Now that it is Indiana, describe your emotions on the match-up, you didn't get a shot at some of those other teams. </p>
<p>	Q.  It seems there's a theme of Indiana being the underdog team, references to the Hoosiers movie, whatnot.  When you look at your team with the no McDonald's All-Americans, where you are now, do you feel there's a bit of an underdog in your team, as well, in your mentality? </p>
<p>	Q.  Chris, Steve, Byron, Coach Williams is famous for his intensity.  Was that an attraction coming to Maryland?  Do you feed off it?  Are there times when you kind of shut some of it out? </p>


<p>	Q.  Could you kind of talk about the senior group's plays in Maryland history.  Also, the rarity of keeping such a talented group of seniors together through the senior year. </p>

<p>	Q.  Even understanding the greatness of Len Bias, do you think there's a case that Juan should go down as the best player in Maryland history because of what he's done individually?</p>
<p>	Q.  Along those lines, Coach, there's always talk about Indiana and their rich tradition, history.  Even with Kansas, the same thing.  Do you get the sense that Maryland's history is washed under the table, people don't know as much about it because of the lack of a championship? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said it would be interesting to see how this team handled the high expectations that it was given at the beginning of the year.  Have they exceeded your expectations in terms of handling that?  Did you anticipate they would do as well as they have done with it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Byron, is Juan even more determined this year than you've seen him in the past?  The way he is playing in the tournament, can you envision anyone slowing him down right now? </p>
<p>	Q.  Lonny, following up on what Gary was talking about, the Final Four last year, you said you won't rest until you win a National Championship.  Here you are poised to do that.  What were your thoughts and feelings as you go through the rest of today and tomorrow leading up to the chance to put that nightmare away? </p>
<p>	Q.  Are you surprised by the way Chris has become a stopper or is this something you were waiting to happen? </p>

<p>	Q.  Can you compare how you feel now on the verge of a National Championship versus how you felt during the first years you took over at Maryland when things were rocky? </p>
<p>	Q.  Have you played anybody this year that looked significantly like Indiana in style of play, maybe North Carolina State, and if there is such a team, what did you do good and bad against them? </p>
<p>	Q.  Juan was saying that you took a chance on him as far as recruiting him.  Do you remember the first time you saw him play?  Did he have to pitch you or did you pitch him? </p>
<p>	Q.  Along the lines of what you were asked earlier, you've been coaching for more than 20 years, can you talk about appearing in your first championship game and being 40 minutes away from winning your first title. </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the importance in your tournament run of the way Juan has stepped up his game, not only scoring a lot of points, but also kind of serving as a catalyst for the team as a whole? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is it better for tomorrow night that you were challenged down the stretch of the game last night?  In other words, if you go out and win the game by 35 points, can you maybe get a false sense of security going into the championship game?  Do you like the fact that you overcame that obstacle at the end of the game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Does Coverdale's ankle affect the way you sort of look at the match-up with him at the point guard position? </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm wondering, your bench, you've been so proud about how that has performed, and Indiana's bench was brilliant the other night.  How important is what you get out of guys like Tahj Holden? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mike Davis said they're not going to practice today.  Are you guys going to practice?  Have you ever been in a situation at a tournament on the off-day where you didn't practice? </p>
<p>	Q.  The key you said to stopping Kansas was stopping the transition game.  What's the one key to stopping Indiana? </p>
<p>	Q.  Dane Fife has a pretty well-earned reputation as a pesky defender.  How do you go about attacking a guy like that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Lonny, the foul trouble last night, were you a little overpumped or psyched?  Also, the Indiana players came in last night and said it was a big part of their game plan to try to get McGhee in foul trouble.  Thoughts about how not to do that tomorrow. </p>
<p>	Q.  What are your thoughts playing your final collegiate game in the National Championship game?  At any point in time during this season, did you guys know you would get to this position? </p>
