<p>	Q.  Well, team is back up against the wall now.  So the next game it could be all over, but you still have a shot. </p>
<p>	Q.  Are the turnovers that the team is suffering a result of Sacramento's disruptive play or sloppiness on the part of Connecticut or a combination? </p>
<p>	Q.  You guys made that great run, the 12-0 run to get back within two.  Did you spend up all your energy at that point or why were you guys unable to take that lead in the second half?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Yolanda Griffith's play in the middle.  I mean, these last three games it seems like she hasn't skipped a beat. </p>
<p>	Q.  Seems like you and Nykesha is pretty much gelling and everything.  Is it time for the other players to step up, at least for this game, put it together as a unit and try to take this back to Connecticut next Thursday?</p>
