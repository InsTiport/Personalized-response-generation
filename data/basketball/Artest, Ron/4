 Q. What's a good game for you offensively? 
 RON ARTEST: It depends. I don't know what people want from me sometimes. What do you want from me, 20? I want to win. That's it. I think last night I played great. I always think I play great, even in Game 2 when some people were probably saying I had a bad game. I had a good game. I thought I played great. And then yesterday I thought I played great. That's what it's about. It's not about me scoring two or eight or -- good game in Game 1 or 25 against Phoenix. All I want to do is win. Hopefully Game 4 I'll be great.

 Q. What are you going to do to be great tomorrow? What can we expect out of you, great defense, great offense? 
 RON ARTEST: The main thing is to play team ball. I don't know what else to do outside of play team ball. I learned a lot my first Finals, and I played better yesterday than I did in the previous game because I stayed within the team. If that means just having two points for the whole game, that's what that means. I'm totally fine with that.

 Q. You said that you learned a lot. What do you feel like you've learned going into tomorrow?
 RON ARTEST: Well, Fish and Kobe have taken me on a ride. They've taken me to school, and they've given me a lesson every day, so I get -- that's when I have most of my good games, after I have bad games so far in this playoffs, individually, which I don't care about at all.

 Q. What's the most important thing you've learned from Kobe and what's the most important thing you've learned from Fisher?
 RON ARTEST: Stay locked in. Stay locked in, and as long as there's another day -- there's ups and downs, but instead of having a down day, I have days where I help out offensively in games. I always stay steady and things happen.
