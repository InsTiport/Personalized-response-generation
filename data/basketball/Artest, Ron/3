 Q. How much do you think they've taken advantage of the fact that Andrew is out of the game?
     RON ARTEST: You know, we wish we had Andrew, but no matter how you look at it, it's true, too. 

 Q. Talk a little bit about Rudy. He never smiles, but how effective is he? 
     RON ARTEST: Rudy (Garciduenas) has been fabulous. He has a big job. He has to manage everybody on the team. Everybody has needs and superstitions and stuff, and Rudy accommodates us.

 Q. Some people have more needs, travel with more sneakers than other guys. Do you have anything like that?
     RON ARTEST: I have a couple things I like to do, but I won't tell you about them. They're superstitions. I've got to stuff I like to do on the road.

 Q. (Inaudible). 
     RON ARTEST: I think we just need to win, that's it. I had two points and we won. I'm not going to buy into that. We were on the road and I had two points. I won't buy into that. Drew went down yesterday, that's the biggest story to me. 

 Q. (Inaudible). 
     RON ARTEST: We need him on the team. But it's okay, things happen, and we just do it together. We score as a team, play defense as a team. Whoever scores, that's depending on what night it is. You don't need to force the issue.
