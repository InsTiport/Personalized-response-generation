   RON ARTEST: I don't have jitters and stuff like that, but for the most part I just focus and try to think about the game.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible).  
 RON ARTEST: I don't know what my future holds with contracts and trades. When you have control it's easier, but when you don't have control you don't know what's going to happen.  
  
  Q. How do you expect them to bounce back for Game 2?  
 RON ARTEST: I think they're going to play real hard. You know, I think Perkins is going to settle down and adjust to the situation he's in with the six techs, and I can see them playing better.
