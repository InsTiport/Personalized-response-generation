Lakers  Â– 103
  Sun - 101

 Q. You've seen the Lakers from afar win the titles. Now you're a part of this in the pivotal Game 5 of the Finals, you had the game-winning shot. Could you talk about how that feels and the experience?
 RON ARTEST: Well, usually after the games I like to move on. You know, win or lose, you know, good or bad, you know, you move on. You know we know Game 6 is going to be tough. We know it's going to be tough. And we've got to go out there and I felt we played good on their floor. We just couldn't sustain it, I guess. But win by 30, win by one, it's just a win. 

 Q. Is it safe to say that's the biggest shot of your career?
 RON ARTEST: Biggest layup. I missed a lot of layups during the regular season. Previous teams I made more jumpers and the layups. But now I'm missing jumpers and missing layups. 
 But you know just staying with it. Staying with it and trying to stay focused. And just trying to play my part and see what happens. 

 Q. Ron, obviously there were highs and lows in the last few minutes for you. 
 RON ARTEST: Yes.

 Q. And of course with the victory, it makes palatable the lows. Could you talk about the 3-point shot you made. Phil said he was sort of talking to you, wasn't sure you were, he was sure actually you were trying not to hear him, but I guess you did probably talk to him afterwards?
 RON ARTEST: No, just playing for coach my first year, obviously, I'm a better player than just seen me last year in the Playoffs. And, obviously, I'm a better player than my numbers are speaking of right now. But there's a new system for me. I'm trying to somehow, you know, make it work for the team. So that's kind of why I kind of wanted to take that shot. It's not always a good shot, but nobody's perfect. 
 And you move on and you try to get better from it. And obviously, you know, 24 seconds on the shot clock, you bring it out. You bring it out and you set back up.

 Q. How did you happen to be where you were on Kobe's shot. You were in front of the basket. Is that just all there was available there?
 RON ARTEST: I thought Kobe got fouled on the shot. So I just kind of figured it was going to be short. Looked like he got his on his arm a little bit. I figured it was going to be short. And it was a little short.

 Q. Could you just describe that last play unfold, from when you get the ball, who you felt on you, or if you felt anyone near you and putting it in and everyone hugging on you?
 RON ARTEST: It was weird, because I'm not used to getting hit a lot. Just like basketball hit. Not anything intentional or flagrant. But these guys, they're tough. And they're coming and attacking us. They're really playing hard. 
 So it was times where I would get a rebound, but I might not get it because these guys are playing so hard. I thought I might throw around my weight a little bit, being one of the heaviest, small forwards in the NBA outside of LeBron.  So I gotta let my weight work for me a little bit, because these guys are tough. They are consistently coming over our backs. They're just playing hard trying to win.

 Q. A lot of times when especially Kobe is known to make those shots, I think the tendency is just to freeze and watch. Especially with that little time left. Why did you run in and how did you not get caught watching?
 RON ARTEST: Just gotta continue to play. I was kind of not playing my game from the beginning of the game. And it kind of carried over. So in the second half, I was finding my way a little bit. Made some good passes and good steals and got some rebounds. 
 So I guess that aggressive play can carry over into that last possession.

 Q. When you were taking that 3-point, the entire arena was shouting no, no, no. Did you hear them?
 RON ARTEST: No, during the game you're not supposed to hear them.

 Q. But what was going on? Was it an impulsive thing, when the minute clock was going up? Did you know it was up? 
 RON ARTEST: It's not like -- was that an earthquake or something? Wow. During the game, you don't really hear, you don't really hear the fans. You see Kobe, he makes shots. You don't hear the fans. On the road he made big shots. You don't hear the fans. You don't scream yes, no, please don't or whatever. You just try to focus on the game and we was up 3. I was hoping to go up 6 at that point. 
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
