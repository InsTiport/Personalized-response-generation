  Q. Thinking about Coach Jackson, he's never been in a Game 7 in The Finals. Is that surprising to you? Do you think he'll be nervous tomorrow night?  
 RON ARTEST: I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I know we had a regular day today. We had practice and a regular day.  
  
  Q. How about you?  
 RON ARTEST: A regular day. Went through it like a regular day.  
  
  Q. How is the heart pumping?  
 RON ARTEST: Real good. Real good. Going to play hard.  
  
  Q. Andrew has been playing through this the whole year. Talk about that.  
 RON ARTEST: He just wants to help the team. That's it. He always hurts so much, but he's out there, he's trying. But he definitely does not like to not be able to help us.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible).  
 RON ARTEST: We've just got to put it together, just collectively we have to get it together. Probably part of that was there was a lot of veterans on this team.  We're going to stick together, play together.
