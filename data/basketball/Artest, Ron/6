  Q. Can you just talk about the mood of the team right now?  
 RON ARTEST: I'm not sure. I'm not sure how everybody is doing individually.   
  
  Q. Everybody talked about the physical play coming into this, that you guys were clearly more physical. It seemed like you set the tone early on. Is that something you wanted to do, just to let the Celtics know we won't be pushed around?  
 RON ARTEST: No, just play hard. You know, if you play hard, I guess that's physical, so just try to give a whole lot of effort.  
  
  Q. How have you managed to keep your composure, especially last night? RON ARTEST: I mean, I don't know. Last night was -- last night I guess I played hard. I don't know if I held my composure or not, but I just went out there and played hard.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).  
 RON ARTEST: I don't know. I'm not sure. I'm not sure what the other team is thinking. I know we came out here to play hard. I'm not sure what they think, so we're just coming out here to play hard and go out there and have fun.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).   
 RON ARTEST: When they come back I'm sure they'll play better. We're not expecting another game like that. First game jitters. I guess it's kind of tough for them being on the road, facing a lot of adversity. The Celtics are special, and we all respect them.
