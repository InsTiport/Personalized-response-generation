		   THE MODERATOR:  Joining us now from Alabama, head coach Stephany Smith, Dedrea McGhee and Kate Mastin. 
 Coach, if you could make an opening comment. 
 COACH SMITH:  Obviously it's been a very difficult season for the University of Alabama.  The thing that has plagued us all SEC play was definitely another Achilles' heel tonight with the 42 turnovers that we had.  We had talked a lot about it. 
 Ole Miss really had their way with us in Oxford when we played them during the regular season and forced a lot of turnovers.  We really looked at that on film, addressed it, and saw some easy opportunities to get the ball into the high post and for weak-side layups, which we did sporadically.  And more so in probably the last five minutes of of the game than any other time. 
 Have to give Ole Miss a lot of credit for their athleticism, their defensive ability.  Just very bothersome.  It created opportunities for them in transition, which is another thing.  I think they had 22 points in transition plus free-throws in the first half alone.
