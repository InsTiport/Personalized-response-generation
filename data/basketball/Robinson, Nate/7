  Q.  What's it like to come back and defend your Slam Dunk Championship?   
 NATE ROBINSON:  It's great.  It's an honor.  God blessed me with the ability to dunk and to have fun while I'm out there.  Hopefully I can win it again.   
  
  Q.  You were a fan favorite last year, how much did that motivate you and drive you?  Did you get that feeling from the fans, that you were the man they wanted to see?   
 NATE ROBINSON:  I did, but I was nervous, so I really didn't feel it because I was so nervous.   
 But I had a great time last year, and this year is going to be even more fun.   
  
  Q.  You have a pretty impressive list of judges, how do you feel about the caliber of those guys who are going to be judging you?   
 NATE ROBINSON:  I guess I have to bring my A-game.   
  
  Q.  Does it make you nervous?   
 NATE ROBINSON:  Not at all, not at all.  Being in this atmosphere here in Vegas, dunking in front of these fans and the world, especially all these great judges.  It's going to be fun, it's going to be exciting, I can't wait.
