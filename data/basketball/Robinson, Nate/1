  Q. (Inaudible).  
     NATE ROBINSON: I mean, it's kind of like you have to find your inner child and play the game for what it is, for the love, for the passion.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible).  
     NATE ROBINSON: I just think that as a team if we play together, the sky's the limit for us, no matter if there's momentum or not. We've just got to play.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible).  
     NATE ROBINSON: I mean, it's like being at school. You've just got to wait. Do your homework, and you come in, and when you go in the game, that's the test. You play good, if you do good, you pass the test.  
     You've always got to stay prepared.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible).  
     NATE ROBINSON: I mean, just try to get him as much pick-and-rolls and we can. Attack him, can't settle for jump shots, play inside out.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible).  
     NATE ROBINSON: Just multiple efforts, like Coach says. You've just got to keep trying and keep trying.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible).  
     NATE ROBINSON: Just continue to play hard. They've been giving us their all. That's what we love about them. You know, they play the right way, no matter if whoever is scoring, playing defense. Each guy brings something different to the table, and I think that's the beauty of having a good team like this.
