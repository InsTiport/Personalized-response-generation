 Q. What does it mean to you that you're the guy that represents the little guys in this competition?
 NATE ROBINSON: Yeah, I have all the little people on my shoulders. I've only got to represent for the small people in the world. They say do the little things, make it easier in life. I think I represent well, and I'll bring my A game and hopefully go out there and win the championship. 

 Q. (Inaudible). 
 NATE ROBINSON: I do that a lot. Yeah, I wish I had a penny for that, every time I heard that.

 Q. What is the most common line they do give you?
 NATE ROBINSON: They say I look shorter on TV. I guess I look taller in real life, so kind of cool. 

 Q. (Inaudible). 
 NATE ROBINSON: I mean, it was just perfect timing. I mean, when Nike, they did a phenomenal job with everything for me. Dwight was a great sport letting me jump all over him with that Superman, so everything was perfect. 

 Q. Along those same lines, how do you top last year? How do you think along the lines of what can I do that's going to be bigger than last year?
 NATE ROBINSON: Well, this year I don't want to use any props. I just want to go in and just have a natural dunk contest and show the world a little bit more of what I can do. Just going to try to do something different, that's all.
