  Q. A lot of guys think they can dunk well, but why do you think you connect with yours so much?  
 NATE ROBINSON: Because I try the crazy dunks that nobody would ever try. I shoot for the fences every time. It is either hit or miss.  
  
  Q. What do you think about the All-Star Game?   
 NATE ROBINSON: It will be fun to see Lebron, Dwight. You can even bring back some of those guys like Jason Richardson, Vince Carter, kind of like a tribute dunk contest type of deal or a teammate dunk contest, a teammate with one other guy; you get one dunk each. Something new, something different.  
  
  Q. You have persevered throughout your level playing college, NBA. What's the feel behind it for you? Why are you succeeding when people were counting you out?   
 NATE ROBINSON: God has just kept me balanced, kept me humble about the whole situation.   
 On top of that, I play the game for love and I just go out there and play my hardest. I play my heart out for my teammates and for the game of basketball. I think hopefully I can continue to keep doing it.
