  Q. What do the Rockets need to do with the remainder of the season?  
 AARON BROOKS: I think with Tracy hurt, this team we still have a great group of guys to still do some things.   
 Everybody is going to step up and rally. We have been through this before, it seems like. Last year, everybody stepped up and we still got the job done. That's the same thing that's going to happen this year.  
  
  Q. When you see all the young talent out there, you are used to playing with talent against the Dream Team and whatnot, is there a lot of talent coming up?   
 AARON BROOKS: Yeah, definitely, these guys, you play college ball with some of them. You watch them play. At love them has grown a lot in one year.   
 It is going to be fun playing with all of them.
