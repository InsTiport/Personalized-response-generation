THE MODERATOR: If you could start with an opening statement about what you'll bring to the Thunder.
DOMANTAS SABONIS: Trade just got confirmed, and I'm really excited to be part of this organization.  I know it's a great place.  I'm just really excited.
Q. Kind of a whirlwind.  What was that process like?  You got put on the Magic hat, told you're traded, locked in the room.  Walk us through what that was.
DOMANTAS SABONIS: It was pretty crazy.  I thought I got selected by Orlando Magic, then as I went down the stairs my agent told me I got traded.  I'm still very excited.  Proud to be a part of the league, and it's just crazy I'm here.
Q. What do you do in that time period where you have to wait for it all to work out?
DOMANTAS SABONIS: Basically I was locked in a room just there.  My dad came to be there with me, so we just talked a lot, and time went by fast.
Q. Finally going to the Oklahoma City Thunder, they were 30 minutes away from the NBA Finals.  How do you feel like you fit there?  Did the Thunder express any interest in you?
DOMANTAS SABONIS: Yeah, Thunder expressed interest in me.  As you said, they were 30 minutes away from the Finals.  Hope I can bring that extra piece to their team which will help them succeed even more.  I'm just really excited to be there.  They're a great organization.
