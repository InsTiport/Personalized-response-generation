 Q.  Could you start out with an opening statement about what you're going to bring to your new team, please.  
DWAYNE BACON: I'm just excited coming in and working, get being better in every aspect of the game.  I feel like I can bring a lot of scoring, a different type of scoring.  I scored at all three levels, and once I learn from the greatest in Michael Jordan and Kemba and all those guys, I'm going to add a lot to my game.   
 Q.  I know you talked about wanting to go higher and being motivated by being lower.  How much do you want teams to pay for making you wait this long?  
DWAYNE BACON: It's just all about playing my game now.  I've got a team, and I'm just going to do the best I can to make it home.   
 Q.  What were your meetings like with them?  What kind of feedback did they give you?  
DWAYNE BACON: They liked me as a player.  They've seen me play a lot.  They were at my pro day in full effect.  At my pro day they told me I helped myself, and it's just a blessing to be picked by those guys.
