Mississippi   82
  Vanderbilt   68

THE MODERATOR:   We'll go ahead with an opening statement from coach and then take questions for the student‑athletes. 
COACH STALLINGS:   Just thought it was a case clearly of Mississippi State just playing far superior basketball to what we played.   On both ends they were faster, quicker, more aggressive, more intent about what they wanted to get done.   Because of their start, we got knocked back on our heels and never really truly recovered. 
So usually the team that takes the fight to the other is the one that is successful and victorious, and they were the ones that initiated the aggression and the fight and they played very, very well. 
THE MODERATOR:   Take questions for the student‑athletes. 

Q.   Damian, just give us a couple general thoughts on the game. 
DAMIAN JONES:   We didn't come out with enough energy.   We didn't get the stops we needed.   We were hitting shots, but on the other hand, we just weren't stopping them.   It was just a better effort on their part. 
THE MODERATOR:   Same for Luke.
LUKE KORNET:   I think the big thing for us to be winning the fight.   In games where we have won it, we won the game, and the games where we lost it, we lost the game. 
In this game, they just beat us.   We couldn't get stops.   I mean, from the beginning towards the end, until the end, and that's just what set up the game and what caused it. 
THE MODERATOR:   We'll excuse you, you can return to the locker room.   Thank you.   Take questions for coach. 
Any other questions? 
All right.   Thank you.
