Q. How much did you brood after the Game 2 loss? 

DeMYA WALKER:  I did take it hard personally, because I'm smarter than that.  I knew the game plan, I knew I was supposed to take away the three and I didn't do it.  So I really was disappointed in myself.  And then I came out in the first half and didn't play the way that I'm capable of playing.  We let Taj get 12 points and I was still very disappointed in myself, because I knew I had already made my mistake in Game 2 and now she's got 12 points.  So that's 12 mistakes.  So you really got to buckle down.  And I said, "Come on, you're better than this."  Me and Becky talked about it and we said, "She's got 12, she don't get no more."  So for her to finish with 16 we felt it was a very big positive for us.  We felt like we really focused in and did the things that our coach asked us to do.  So that's as far as I thought about it during this game.  Probably during the game Yo came up to me and she said, forget about it, just let it go.  I think when she said that it just allowed me to relax and let me get back into the flow of things.
