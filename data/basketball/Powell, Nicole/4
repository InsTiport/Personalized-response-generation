Q. How do you feel about being this close to a championship?  How confident are you?  This is your second year, but...
 
NICOLE POWELL:  Yeah, it is my second year.  I just try not to think about it.  I think that it's an incredible opportunity.  Obviously Yo's played a long time, we were just talking about it, and she's never gotten to this point.  And it's really incredible and I feel fortunate to be a part of the league and to be here as a team.  Yeah, it is only my second year, but you never know when you're going to be able to get back here.  So I'm trying to take it in.  I think it will really hit me when it's over and done.  Because right now I'm just worried about the next game.  Because really we haven't accomplished anything.  And we have had a great season but I think really when it's over I'll be able to reflect on what a great season it was.  
 
Q.  Can you talk about the run they made yesterday?  Was that complacency on your part or did they just make some adjustments?
 
NICOLE POWELL:  I think it's a little bit of both.  Good teams are going to make runs.  And Connecticut is a very, very good team.  We're not going to shut that team out.  They're going to fight and come back.  And I think that we kind of got away from our game plan a little bit.  I think it's a little bit of both. 
 
Q.  How important was it for DeMya to play so well yesterday?
 
NICOLE POWELL:  Oh, it's huge.  She was huge.  Having her out there playing well was just huge.
