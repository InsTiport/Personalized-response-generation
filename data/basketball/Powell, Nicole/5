Q.  Just your thoughts on the upcoming Game 3, series tied.  
 
NICOLE POWELL:  It's a big game.  Every game is a big game in the championship series.  So I'm excited to play and I'm excited to be at home.   
 

Q.  After Game 2 I'm assuming that you guys are thinking that you have to complete the adjustments, you don't have to make any wholesale changes in the way you approach things.  
 
NICOLE POWELL:  No, at this point in the season what we have been doing has obviously been successful.  So you don't have time one day to try to overhaul something, which we don't think we need to do.  Obviously we need to tighten up on some things and play better, obviously, if we expect to win.  But there's no major changes, really.  
 

Q.  How much of a factor do you expect the crowd to be? 
 
NICOLE POWELL:  They're awesome.  I think they're just going to come out and support us.  It feels good for us.  I don't think Connecticut is going to really react to the crowd.  They're a good team, they have been here before.
