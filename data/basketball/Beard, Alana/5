<p>	Q.  Alana, could you talk about the last 2 minutes each time you tried to penetrate, what were your thoughts?</p>
<p>	Q.  Sheana, how did the other players feel when they look at what Alana contributed tonight and what everyone did tonight?  </p>
<p>	Q.  Alana, when you hit that 3 pointer at the end of the first half, did you feel like that was going to give you all of the momentum that you need to carry over into the second half and at what point did you feel like you all also had the momentum in the second half?</p>
<p>	Q.  Where did you feel you lost it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, after the official time-out you guys switched defenses, you went to a press and you went to some zone variance, can you talk about that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Gail, not only did they go to the Line 21 times to 6 for you here, but you only had 2 players who actually took free throws in the evening, was that a lack of aggressiveness from your guys or something else going on?</p>
<p>	Q.  Gail, this game seemed in some ways a continuation offensively of some of the struggles.  Looking at it now is there an explanation for it, or is each game different than the next, better defense, lack of aggressiveness, do you have something you can pinpoint?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, can you compare the emotions tonight and last year after the loss to Oklahoma, the gut feeling?</p>
<p>	Q.  Gail, what did you say to them in the locker room after the game because you had the dream for six months and tonight that dream died?</p>
