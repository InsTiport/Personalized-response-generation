  Q. Come out here to L.A., not a bad place for a couple of days off.   
 GREG MONROE: No, wonderful weather, great city. Just try to come in here and have some fun.  
  
  Q. The big question is how --  
 GREG MONROE: It was good.   
  
  Q. Being a guy from Louisiana, you know good food, where would you put Roscoe's?   
 GREG MONROE: It's different food down in New Orleans. New Orleans, best place in the world for food.   
  
  Q. Tonight's game, obviously the sophomores want to set a tone.   
 GREG MONROE: Yeah, we come here to get a win. We want to have fun, but we come out to set a tone, too. It means something to us.   
  
  Q. Could you imagine the talent pool that is out there tonight? When you were growing up, you were here and you finally made it; did you ever have that moment --  
 GREG MONROE: Yeah, I think I had that moment. But it keeps on coming. There's certain things that happen, different things that happen.   
  
  Q. Give me a sense of tonight's competition, who you think is going to win.   
 GREG MONROE: Tonight? I don't -- Saturday night is a mystery to me. It's going to be up for grabs. Three-point contest is a great field, it's going to be tough. I'm waiting to see. I don't have any predictions.   
  
  Q. I asked some of the guys; is there a dunk that you haven't seen that you have to see?  
 GREG MONROE: If I could name it, then it's not going to be that spectator. I want to be something like, I wouldn't even have thought of that.
