  GREG MONROE:   My role is going to be bigger this year.   I have more expected of me, so I think there's confidence as far as that coming together.

Q.   How do you like taking on that bigger role?
GREG MONROE:   I mean, I like it.   I know I've paid my dues, I've waited my turn, I definitely like it.   It's something I'm used to.   I've played a role like this most of my life, so I'm happy that people look at me in that light.   I just have to make sure I'm prepared to do that this weekend.

Q.   You have one of the highest PERs in the league for centers.   Do you feel underrated a little bit?
GREG MONROE:   I'm not worried about any of that.   I'm just worried about trying to play for more wins.

Q.   What's the difference between your rookie and sophomore years? 
GREG MONROE:   You know, you have a year under your belt.   You have that year under your belt.   You learn so much and you find out what the game is really about.   I think the second year is when you make a big turnaround.
