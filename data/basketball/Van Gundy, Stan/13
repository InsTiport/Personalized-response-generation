 STAN VAN GUNDY: You can't seriously have any questions for a coach in an All-Star Game? 

 Q. As an Eastern Conference coach who just watched Wade and LeBron playing together for 40 minutes, how much does that put the fear of God into you about the possibility of them playing together next year?
 STAN VAN GUNDY: You know, I don't think you needed to see tonight to understand that that would scare any of us in this league, yeah. 
 Incredible talents, both of them, obviously. 

 Q. Can you talk about Chris Bosh and what he did tonight and coming home to Dallas and all that.
 STAN VAN GUNDY: I thought it was great, and Kevin Garnett yesterday said play me just the first time-out of each half, it's Chris's hometown, give him a lot of minutes. So we were able to do that. And I thought Chris played very well, double-double. I think it was obvious from not just the numbers he put up, but the way he played running up-and-down, played with great energy; that this was an important day for him and he really wanted to do well. I thought he played extremely hard. 
 I was very happy for him, because you know, I mean, 108,000 people in your hometown, double-double, two game-winning points; I thought it was a great day for him. 

 Q. Coaching in front of 108,000, the atmosphere, what was that like? 
 STAN VAN GUNDY: You know, it was a game where you could actually look around, you know, check out the atmosphere. It was a little different. It was incredible, first, when we walked in just off the bus today to see the size of the place and the scoreboard and everything; but then when you walk out before the game and all of those people are there, I mean, you are just not used to seeing that for a basketball game. It was a very unique atmosphere and a phenomenal experience I think for everyone involved. 

 Q. George said that he had to be careful of hitting his knees on the raised floor. Did you have any issues there?
 STAN VAN GUNDY: I didn't stand up -- not really. I only got up there in time-outs and things. The way that was set up, real comfortable chairs, you could put your feet up. 
 The challenge was, as long as the game took, you know, making sure you could stay awake. But the game was so good, I mean, as All-Star Games go, I thought it was a good game. And particularly as you got into the fourth quarter, guys really wanted to play and win it. So it was a good game.
