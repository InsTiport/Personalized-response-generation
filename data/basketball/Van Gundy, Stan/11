  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 COACH VAN GUNDY: I think that's too convenient an excuse. We did not come with great energy. We did not play -- we didn't play hard enough. The Celtics brought a lot more energy than we did. That was the story.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 COACH VAN GUNDY: Well, I think they made a real concerted effort to stay home, to take that away. I thought they did a very, very good job of that. Anything you take away, there's other things there. We have to do a better job of that tomorrow. I thought because of them staying home, we got more drives to the basket. But at the same time we didn't convert on a high enough percentage. I thought we were able to get the ball to Dwight (Indiscernible) -- we did not convert on those opportunities. If you don't do that and they're staying home on the perimeter guys, you clearly have a problem.   
 I think they're a good offensive team. We have to take advantage of whatever it is we can. You have to be able to convert on the opportunities they give you.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 COACH VAN GUNDY: Well, I mean, I was surprised to start a series with our energy level being what it was. I did not think we ran in either direction. We didn't get back. They outscored us (Indiscernible) fast-break points. A big part of that was our 18 turnovers. We didn't make a great effort to get back. I think you have to try to put them on the move a little bit. So as good as they were defensively and as good as they are, I think we made it worse. We were playing at a low energy level.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 COACH VAN GUNDY: I think we're fine. I don't worry about that part. They seem very well focused. (Indiscernible) we've been through this before. We've lost in the playoffs.
