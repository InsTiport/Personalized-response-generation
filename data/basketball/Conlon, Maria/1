<p>	Q.  Coach, when Pat was in here earlier she said that you guys didn't really have a relationship and that it's not about you against her, but can you kind of talk about whatever the friction that seems to exist between Tennessee and UConn. </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there any friction in your relationship with Coach Summitt?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much is there a sense of this is a time to complete the journey for this team as the seniors graduate and the prospects for next year, this is going to be the final chapter of this particular team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Lady Vol fans have had a lot of fun with you over the years, much like the football team had with Steve Spurrier, do you see a connection there between you and Spurrier against Tennessee?</p>
<p>	Q.  Diana, both for you and Maria, just talk about the importance of going out a winner and here you guys are once again facing a team that you both have had a lot of success against. </p>

<p>	Q.  Maria, how much of your thoughts, if any, have been toward the success of the men's team and the chance that Connecticut could hit both championships?  </p>
<p>	Q.  Geno, what's the most emotional night you've experienced when losing a player whose been with you, a dominant player whose been with you for four years up to now and how do you think you'll feel or what emotions might you feel tomorrow night watching Diana finish up?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jessica Moore, Tennessee talked today about the success that you all have had in particularly in post play against their post players, is there any particular secret to what you all have been able to do or why has your success level on the inside been what it's been against Tennessee?  </p>
<p>	Q.  Geno, ESPN was showing numbers about their ratings and about for their live event programming the women's college basketball national championship is the highest rated event they have.  How big is it for Tennessee and UConn to be there from a ratings standpoint for women's college basketball over and over again?</p>
<p>	Q.  Diana, you've beaten them so many times, do you think you're in their head? </p>
<p>	Q.  This is for Diana.  Coach Summitt said earlier that while you were still in high school she called you to gauge your interest in Tennessee.  And that she got the feeling you weren't interested in coming there.  Can you just give your recollection on that phone call and why you weren't interested? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kingsport.</p>
<p>	Q.  Why not? </p>


<p>	Q.  For Diana and Barbara.  Some of the Tennessee players say they get a visceral feeling when they hear about the UConn rivalry, I think it was Shanna Zolman said, she gets a snarl on her face and there's a certain intensity, what kind of feelings do you get when you hear about Tennessee? </p>

<p>	Q.  Question for Geno.  I was wondering if you could just talk about having the two such successful programs at Connecticut and do you guys, do you feel like you spur each other on, that your level of success has spurred them to do what they're doing, is there a little competition and/or a chemistry between the two programs?  Can you just describe what it's like there?</p>
<p>	Q.  For Diana, Geno gave a little hint of the ending of his end of the relationship tomorrow between the two of you.  And it's been unique.  What would be your feelings tomorrow playing for him for one last time? </p>

<p>	Q.  I've got to play People Magazine reporter here.  I'm not sure we can let you off the hook that easy.  Pat was bombarded with questions about you.  One thing she said, at one point you had a pretty nice relationship, things went south and she said that she thought you created the relationship that exists now, meaning one that's not quite warm and fuzzy.  Is it true?</p>
<p>	Q.  But you are the coach that made the comment about the Evil Empire.  You seemed to have initiated --</p>
<p>	Q.  Nothing for this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Now that we have gotten to the last game with Diana, can you kind of put any kind of perspective what these four years have been like with her and just the whole entirety of her career now coming down to this final game what it's all meant to you to have her for the last four years?</p>
<p>	Q.  How crucial is Barbara Turner's role in tomorrow night's game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you find that either fitting, ironic or what exactly are your feelings that while you're trying to win three in a row now, your last hurdle is against the only team that has won three in a row?</p>
<p>	Q.  I'm going to piggyback on that slightly, Coach, in the thought that all the talk about parity this year, I mean these two teams are back in the championship.  Do you feel that there was some parity in the sense that maybe your programs will have to look over your shoulders slightly or was this a hiccup in the universe and order has been restored?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talking about the rebounding edge and trying to win the battle on the boards, do you see that as the common thread and in this string of victories against them you guys have?</p>
<p>	Q.  If your car was broken down -- no, just kidding.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously you had some basketball responsibilities this weekend but have you gotten to experience New Orleans at all?  What have you been up to?</p>
<p>	Q.  Being 50?</p>
<p>	Q.  You thought you had Tennessee to worry about?</p>
<p>	Q.  The guys are in the Final Four, you're in the Final Four these programs are national powerhouses.  Is the common thread, besides good coaching on both side, is the sports administration the athletic administration and Phillip Austin, what is it about the support of the athletic administration that's allowed these programs to get as far as they have had?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, obviously they have an All-American and in Shyra Ely, but it seems like in some ways this Tennessee team is more than the sum of its parts.  Have you seen any of these Tennessee teams come down with sort of this kind of low star power that you faced?</p>
<p>	Q.  To follow-up on the parity question, would it get better ratings tomorrow night if you were playing Minnesota or LSU say in a championship game or if they were playing each other?</p>
<p>	Q.  You don't think so?</p>
<p>	Q.  Why is that?</p>
<p>	Q.  I actually asked Pat a bit just reflecting on parity and the quality of coaching and how that's improved and caught up with the quality of players.  Can you reflect a little bit on what you've seen, I mean even the connections to Coach Borton and your view on her and how the quality has grown?</p>
<p>	Q.  I once heard Rick Majerus refer to coaches as funny beings, odd beings who can more sharply remember defeats a lot of times than they can victories.  So it's been a long, long time since you lost in this tournament.  But I'm wondering if like Notre Dame in St. Louis in 2001, does that still bug you or have 17 consecutive tournament victories, do they actually chase that away?  What's the makeup like?</p>
