 Q.   An update on Kyle, including timetable, diagnosis, schedule?   
  COACH BUDENHOLZER:   Kyle went to New York and got a second opinion, additional tests, additional information, and it's been determined that he'll need surgery.   He's scheduled for surgery tomorrow afternoon.   
I think this was always part of kind of the original timeline.   There was some hope that surgery may not be required, but with additional information, additional testing, he will need surgery to get him back to where we want him, and we all want what's best for Kyle.   Look forward to having him back.  
   
 Q.   [No microphone].   
COACH BUDENHOLZER:   I couldn't answer that honestly right now.   I think we'll know more post‑surgery, once they're in there and they perform, exactly what is happening.   I think that additional information will come when appropriate.  
   
 Q.   Ligament damage?   Cartilage?   What was the ultimate diagnosis?   
COACH BUDENHOLZER:   I think it would probably be best for our doctors and for that to come from Garin and our medical staff.   
There s a game tonight (laughter).
