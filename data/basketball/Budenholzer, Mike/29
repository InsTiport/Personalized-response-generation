  COACH BUDENHOLZER:   DeMarre is a game time decision.  
   
 Q.   It's almost game time.   
COACH BUDENHOLZER:   It's almost time for a decision.   
   
 Q.   Do you expect to play Paul Millsap in the small forward tonight?   
COACH BUDENHOLZER:   No.  
   
 Q.   Mike, I understand the nature of a game time decision.   What are you going to look for in the next 45 minutes to come to that conclusion?   
COACH BUDENHOLZER:   I mean, he's going to warm up a little bit, do a few things, see how he feels.   He's getting more treatment.   
I think a big thing is take a few shots, move around a little bit, see how it goes.
