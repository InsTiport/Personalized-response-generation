 Q.   Beyond the All‑Star Game, I want to know what are your three best kept secrets in order to have the chemistry that you have on your team right now?   You're winning, probably you have a lot of interesting things to share with us.   
MIKE BUDENHOLZER:   If they are secrets, I can't tell them.   I always say it starts with our players.   We've got great players.   They want to play for each other.   They want to play in an unselfish way on both ends of the court.   
After that I'll keep the rest of the secrets to us.   
   
 Q.   Did I see you drawing up a play for Pau before the game started?   
MIKE BUDENHOLZER:   For Pau Gasol?   No.   There were a couple of times when we actually tried to draw something up.   But I think he got all his just in the flow of the game.   
   
 Q.   When you had all your players out on the floor at the same time, were you tempted to open up the playbook or were you telling them to kind of keep it shut down?   
MIKE BUDENHOLZER:   There's not much of a playbook in an All‑Star Game.   But there for a couple of minutes it looked like the ball moved and a couple of them got to touch it.   
But, no, there's no playbook to really open up or keep closed in an All‑Star Game.
