		  COACH BUDENHOLZER:   Offensive rebounding and us getting back in transition defense.   I think a little bit more of the battle is can we take care of the boards and still get out and play at that pace and still run offensively?   When we shoot, we want to step back on the shot and transition defense is a priority.   If we can find extra opportunities on the offensive boards, that's always a delicate balance.   You know, those two things.   So I'm not sure. 

Q.   Mike, can you just talk about the overall challenge of taking on a player like LeBron James, especially in the Conference Finals. 
COACH BUDENHOLZER:   The whole league for quite a few years now has been game planning and trying to find ways to limit him and make LeBron James' catches difficult, make the entire game for him difficult.   We will try and do the same.   I think our guys are excited about the challenge, both individually and collectively. 

Q.   Coach, do you get the feeling‑‑ I'm probably sure you don't care‑‑ but have you heard the Hawks, like the Hawks are being overlooked in this series or underestimated in this series?   Is that something you relate to your players as far as bulletin board material or something of that nature? 
COACH BUDENHOLZER:   No.   To both questions, to both thoughts, the answer is no.   I think we're much more focused on ourselves.   That's when we're at our best.

Q.   The last four teams standing(inaudible).
COACH BUDENHOLZER:   I think each team is built differently, and it comes down to players.   These four teams, I think it's a credit to each of their‑‑ those guys' ability to make shots.   In this case, threes.   Whatever it is, however your team is built, you have to do it well in the playoffs, and that's the challenge for all of us in our league. 
It's a credit to each team and those players that are making shots.
