Q. After last night's game, Steve Kerr mentioned that sometimes when you win Game 1, it's a little bit harder to go into Game 2 and have the sense of urgency that you need just because of human nature.  How do you try to protect against that?
MIKE BUDENHOLZER: Yeah, human nature is a strong force.  I think every coach for a long time in every sport has been trying to fight it.  The good thing is we look at film.  We've been doing it all year.  We're hard on ourselves.  We look at ourselves, try to be honest and teach from positive, teach from areas where we can improve.  I think there are significant areas where we can improve from Game 1.  When the players embrace just getting better from day to day, from game to game, I think that's been helpful for us.
Q. From the last game you spoke about areas you can improve.  From Game 1 against Boston you also said it was the energy that wasn't quite there.  The game felt like it followed a similar path.  Was that something you found again when you looked back at the Game 1 here?
MIKE BUDENHOLZER: Yeah, there are some very, very similar traits to Game 1 against Boston.
