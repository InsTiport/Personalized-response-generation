 Q. Why do you think those openings were there yesterday, because the Celtics are usually so good in shutting them down?
 JORDAN FARMAR: We got a couple build-in plays, kick-outs or rebounding second shots, secondary break transitions before the defense actually gets set up is the best opportunity to be able to attack, or if a shot goes up scramble and kickback out and it opens it up. 

 Q. Do you think it's more important to push it against these guys than against some other teams just because they're so good in the half court?
 JORDAN FARMAR: Yeah, they want to be able to push it as well, push it, get good shots, if not, get inside and make them -- we're a good enough offensive team where we have to make plays like that.
