  Q. Sasha had a good match with Ginobili the whole game and seemed like he did a pretty good job shutting him down, especially late. What is it about the way he plays defense, just that pesky, flying all over the place, elbow, whatever you gotta do to stop the guy?  
 JORDAN FARMAR: That's what defense is. He wants to do a good job. He tries hard. Puts pressure on them to play defense as well. I think it wears somebody down throughout the whole game.  
  
  Q. How about just him specifically, Sasha's defense, the way he approaches the game and the way he plays?  
 JORDAN FARMAR: Annoying. Probably the best word to describe it.  
  
  Q. Is that maybe why he gets picked on sometimes or thought of as a pest, annoying?   
 JORDAN FARMAR: Probably, I would guess that, yes.  
  
  Q. Would you sense maybe they are wearing down a little bit in the fourth quarter?   
 JORDAN FARMAR: Not really. We didn't focus on them. We try to focus on what we do. I think we were playing better basketball. We picked up energy in the third quarter, more momentum to get the game close enough to where we can execute from the line.   
 We did the things we needed to do down the stretch.  
  
  Q. When you are 20 points down, what's being said in the huddle?   
 JORDAN FARMAR: Nothing. We didn't say anything. We said let's go get some momentum, play basketball the way we know how. Our job is to bring energy and we just played hard and got the tempo moving faster and it work in our favor.  
  
  Q. What does that say about the character of this ball club?  
 JORDAN FARMAR: I think that's the story all year, our versatility. We have different guys. I am a different player from Fish and Sasha is a different player from whoever, Vlady or whoever else. We can play different ways throughout the course of the game.
