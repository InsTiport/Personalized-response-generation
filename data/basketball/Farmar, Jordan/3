   JORDAN FARMAR: Just trying to be consistent. Trying to do what we can off the bench, attribute it to the team. We know we have so many minutes. We have to be really aggressive, do what we have been doing what's worked so far.  
  
  Q. I don't think people know how difficult it is to come off the bench and be productive like you've been.   
 JORDAN FARMAR: At times -- we're playing the right way, moving the ball, sharing, open some things up. Play ball and not really think about much.  
  
  Q. Most of the time the bench players have a difficult time playing on the road. How are you planning on overcoming that in Game 3?  
 JORDAN FARMAR: Not thinking too much into it. Just playing, when you get out on the floor, just go play basketball. Not thinking about whether you're at home or on the road. Dimensions of the court are all the same. Get lost in the game, get wrapped up in the competition, it should be all right.  
  
  Q. You're playing so well right now, then you have these days off, do you wish you could just keep on going?  
 JORDAN FARMAR: Yeah, we're having fun out here. We get to compete against each other. Us coming off the bench get to play the Suns scout team. It's a little fun to go out there, play their basketball every now and then.  
  
  Q. The Suns scout team, who are you?  
 JORDAN FARMAR: Steve Nash. (Laughter).   
  
  Q. So you've been doing a pretty good job because they've been shutting him down.   
 JORDAN FARMAR: Yeah. Been making it tough. We're having fun out here, playing real well, teams competing and pushing each other and getting each other ready for the game. That's what it's all about.
