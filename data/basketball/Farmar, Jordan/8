 Q.  Are you surprised that you're a big part of the rotation and playing a big role on a likely playoff team? 
 JORDAN FARMAR:  Not really.  When I decided to come out, I knew I was ready to play at this level. 
 It's been tough going through the ups and downs, playing more at times, playing less at times.  That's the toughest part of being a rookie.  But I definitely expected to be a part of the team and an integral member. 

 Q.  You made the gamble to play in the Pre-Draft Camp, and you played well, are you surprised you didn't go higher? 
 JORDAN FARMAR:  Maybe a little higher, but I wouldn't trade this for anything.  Crazy things happen on draft day, so many trades, people were available who they didn't think would be available, but that's just the nature of the beast.  That's what happens in this type of business.  I'm extremely happy to be playing at home for the team that I grew up watching, and I'm trying to map the best of it.
