 Q. You're one of the team leading interview givers from what we hear. 
 JORDAN FARMAR: Yeah, I've done my fair share. Now I'm just sitting back and letting the rest of them take some, get these Finals under way.

 Q. Do you have any go-to lines that you can tell like when you're going to get a lot of the same questions. 
 JORDAN FARMAR: Yeah, let it fly. Trust my instincts. That's when I play the best. Stay focused. Just let your instincts take over. Don't think about it too much. They always ask me about growing up in LA, what it's like to be playing for the Lakers in The Finals, how special would it be to win a championship. That's probably one I get more than anything, and I'm ready to roll. I change up the answer all the time.

 Q. You came into The Finals last year against Boston, first Finals. Now having kind of been there you've already seen all this, so it's not going to get you off your game and it's in Los Angeles. Does that make it easier going into Game 1?
 JORDAN FARMAR: I think there's no substitute for experience, absolutely. My focus now is the job hasn't even been really started yet. Here's our first chance that we've actually made it to The Finals and have a chance to redeem ourselves. Last year we were excited throughout the whole run, learning on the job. Now it's like, congratulations, let's move on to our real goal. I think the level of focus is really high and attention is focused on getting the championship.
