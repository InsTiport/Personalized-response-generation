  Q. Do you still ski a lot?  
 DIRK NOWITZKI: No, we're not allowed to ski. We're not actually allowed to do a lot of things that are fun.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible).   
 DIRK NOWITZKI: He was a special guy to me. He kind of got the whole thing started here. When I came I think I was perfect for the system, just being a tall guy, match-up guy, shooter, and I always say there weren't a lot of coaches that would have had a seven-footer shooting a three. So he gave me a lot of freedom from day one and gave me a lot of confidence, so if I would have been anywhere else in a different system, they would have made me lift weights and probably be closer to the baskets and I would have never had the chance to really show case my talents.   
 I owe him a lot. I loved playing for him because he gives me a lot of freedom. I'll always remember him. I just saw him the other day, and it was good to see him. He retired here, and when he comes back, he still has it.
