  Q.  Talk about being in Las Vegas and having the game here?   
 DIRK NOWITZKI:  I'm excited to be here.  It's obviously a fun city.  It's going to be a great weekend.  Obviously it's always an honor to be an All-Star.   
 Bringing it to Las Vegas for the first time and being a part of it is going to be great.  Hopefully we can put on a great show for the fans here.   
  
  Q.  Being the defending Three Point Champ, do you think you're going to beat them again?   
 DIRK NOWITZKI:  Since we played last night I barely got any practice in, but hopefully I'll be able to find the rhythm.  It's always important to find your rhythm in the first or second rack.  Once I do that, I think I should be in pretty good shape.   
  
  Q.  David Hasselhoff is starring here in The Producers, is there any chance you're going to get to see him in it?   
 DIRK NOWITZKI:  I don't think so (laughing), there are a lot of things going on.   
 We're practicing tomorrow and the game is Sunday, so I don't think I'll have a lot of time.   
  
  Q.  Are you going to come back?   
 DIRK NOWITZKI:  Maybe I'll come back.
