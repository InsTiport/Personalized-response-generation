Q. If you would make a comment about the award and what it means being the Twyman-Stokes Teammate of the Year?
DIRK NOWITZKI: Yes, great honor to be here for the first Awards Show.  I never thought I would get a Teammate of the Year award, but it means a lot to me.  It means that I lead my teammates the right way, on and off the floor.  I was fortunate when I got in the league, I had some great teammates to show me the way and that was Steve Nash and Michael Finley, two great, unbelievable pros that basically raised me right in this league and I basically followed in their footsteps ever since.
