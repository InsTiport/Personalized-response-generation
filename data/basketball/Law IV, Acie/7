<p>	Q.  Acie, what was the biggest thing or toughest thing as far as getting feeling going?  As you look toward last year, reflecting on last year, what was the toughest thing as far as getting the winning, you know, going again? </p>

<p>	Q.  Coach, do you speak with Lithuanian and talk about the recruitment of that guy better than you envisioned? </p>
<p>	Q.  Bill, what kind of impact could his presence have on Joseph this season?</p>
<p>	Q.  Yeah. </p>
<p>	Q.  Last year you got a starting five set pretty early so much more depth this year, characterize your depth and how that might place with competition for starting roles? </p>
<p>	Q.  Billy, who takes Antoine's spot and how do you replace what he did last year? </p>
<p>	Q.  Who is filling that spot right now? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, can you talk about your experiences what you learned in your first season stepping up to the bigger stage in the Big 12 versus what you saw at UTIP? </p>
<p>	Q.  This is for the players.  Describe how last year unfolded how your opponents seemed to respect you a little bit more?</p>
<p>	Q.  Billy, what's it be like sharing a campus with Tulane? </p>
<p>	Q.  Billy and Joseph, can you both address this.  I was looking at the Baylor schedule and of course, they don't start for awhile.  Can you imagine going through that situation?  I mean everybody talks about the Tulane situation.  Baylor doesn't get to play for a long time.  Can you address that? </p>


<p>	Q.  Joseph have you learned any Lithuanian cuss words or taught him any American?</p>
