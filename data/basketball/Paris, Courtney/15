<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) do you ball it up with one person, or who gets that responsibility?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned freshmen earlier.  Is this a year kind of a transition year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Leah and Erin, talk about -- you know, Courtney and Ashley obviously stirred everything up there.  What are your perceptions of how this Paris and her sister have done, and more importantly though, can they change how you guys play both inside and aggressiveness all those things? </p>

<p>	Q.  Sherri, we know that with Courtney coming in you all fill a spot that has been an issue for you all in the past.  Looks like you are solid everywhere.  Do you have what you need as far as someone to distribute the ball and get the ball to all those players, that pointguard, Dionnah -- I don't know how many assists she had.  She was far and away (inaudible) in terms of assists, do you have that --</p>
<p>	Q.  Courtney, coming in as a freshmen -- you keep hearing people talk, it's been one of the bigger stories in the Big 12 about Oklahoma needing  a post presence.  Talk about being a young post player how much you have learned even so far in individual workouts.  Then also what your summertime experience was like playing on USA basketball team?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked a little bit about just the changes in the conference this year with the kids that left, really the last two years have been tremendous classes for the Big 12 and nationally.  Does that open a way for a Leah Rush or Erin to maybe get the kind of national attention that they haven't gotten the last two years because there were upperclassmen ahead of them who were more national bigger stars?</p>
<p>	Q.  What time did you know you would go to OU and was it always you and Ashley or were you separately thinking or how did that come to be? </p>
<p>	Q.  How are you and Ashley similar, different as players on the court?</p>




<p>	Q.  Who gets to try to guard Courtney in practice?  And Leah and Erin, just speak up what you have seen so far from her on the court?</p>

<p>	Q.  Sherri, nationally, right now a lot of people probably are putting Tennessee, Duke, one, two, those are both teams that of experience but are going to count on younger players.  This seems last year seemed very wide open and Baylor won it and proved that was the case.  Do you have a feel nationally?  Do you feel like it is as wide open as a raise for the Final 4 as it was last year?</p>
