THE MODERATOR:   Questions.   
   
 Q.   James, talk about sitting out last game.   
JAMES BLACKMON, JR.:   So excited to get back out there.   It was so hard to sit out, especially against Wisconsin, since they're the top team.   
Coming in I worked hard on the defensive things, things I had to know to get back into it.   They helped me get going from right off tonight.   
   
 Q.   Talk about last year's struggle against Michigan.   
YOGI FERRELL:   I say the difference has been mindset, our mental mindset going into a close game like that.   You got to get a stop, whatever is necessary to get it.   We go out there and we fight for each other and we fight for the team.   We come out with the outcome we want.   
TROY WILLIAMS:   Last year, at the time of the game, wasn't in the game.   He got in all the people at the end of the game that would do that for us.   We're just happy that changed this year.   
   
 Q.   Do you ever look back at film and look at what could be different?   
YOGI FERRELL:   I say the biggest thing from last year to this year is making more simpler plays, not trying to make the home run play.   Driving in, just hitting the open guy, not trying to throw a crazy like behind‑the‑back pass.   We can throw a pass to another pass for a shot.   We call it the Indiana assist.   Doing basically whatever we can to help the team win.   
   
 Q.   Yogi, what does it mean to you moving forward with Hanner?   
YOGI FERRELL:   Yeah, just another guy they have to guard.   We definitely missed James in Wisconsin because that would have opened up the floor more for our drives, our guards.   
I say he definitely helped us in this game.   
   
 Q.   Troy, what does this win mean to you?   
TROY WILLIAMS:   The short alley.   Just stayed in, kept moving, got back cuts, dunks, got fouled a couple times.   
I guess I got comfortable out there, got the steal for the three‑pointer.   I guess after that I just got more comfortable.   
   
 Q.   (Question regarding Hanner.)   
YOGI FERRELL:   For us moving forward, just got to get back in shape, got to get back in game shape.   I know he played a couple stretches tonight.   
He's definitely going to help us.   We need that big body down there.   Hanner helped us with wins at Illinois and Nebraska.   To have him back, we're going to need him.   
   
 Q.   What does this mean to you?   
TROY WILLIAMS:   I mean, builds everybody's confidence.   Some people like break down or whatever, but we just stay with it in practice, stay with it on the court, off the court.   Just feels better.   
   
 Q.   You talk about not looking too big picture in the middle of the season.   You still have Maryland.   But do you feel like coming through this you have played well enough to move to an easier schedule in Big Ten play?   
YOGI FERRELL:   These last couple games we have are basically going to define who we are.   That's where teams get made basically, going from here on.   
Last couple stretches, we have to have the best focus we've had all year, last couple weeks.   Every game we play from here on now is a championship game, every possession is a championship possession.   Once we get those, win those, we'll eventually be in the championship game.  
   
 Q.   What is it like being in this position at this point in the season?   
YOGI FERRELL:   Yeah, we didn't really look too much where everybody picked us.   They picked us low in the Big Ten.   Expectations are high.   Just gave us a little bit extra chip on our shoulder to go out there and prove everybody wrong.   They don't know us.   But they gettin' ready to find out.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
