THE MODERATOR:   Questions. 

Q.   James, what felt different this game compared to the Maryland game? 
JAMES BLACKMON, JR.:   Well, I put in a little extra time with the coaches talking to them.   Coach Seltzer, I talked to him a lot. 
I guess for all of us, we just went to our old ways and shot it with confidence. 

Q.   Troy, talk about your improved three‑point shooting. 
TROY WILLIAMS:   I'm happy to be a part of the record.   But as for the shooting, we've been working hard on it with Coach Buckley and all the other coaches.   Just extra work in the gym. 

Q.   Robert, what is it like when everybody is hitting their shots? 
ROBERT JOHNSON:   I just think it's a lot of fun.   When it's going like that, everybody hitting shots, we getting stops, just building the lead up, I think it's fun for everybody.   It builds a better atmosphere. 

Q.   James, you started off slow offensively.   What changed to get you guys going? 
JAMES BLACKMON, JR.:   Halftime we looked at the film what we were doing wrong.   Also we just told everybody to meet the passes. 
We felt like we were rushing a little bit.   Slow it down and everybody catch the ball with two hands. 

Q.   Robert, how good does it feel to dispel any notion of fatigue and bounce back after Maryland? 
ROBERT JOHNSON:   It definitely felt good when everybody is hitting shots.   You have to approach every game with the same mindset. 
Some games, the balls aren't going to go in.   Some games, it turns around and goes your way.   You have to approach it the same every time. 

Q.   James, what does Yogi do to help make it easier for you guys? 
JAMES BLACKMON, JR.:   For me, he was finding me everywhere, any open spot I felt comfortable shooting with. 
The other guys, he hit Kyle and Rob with big threes.   Even though he didn't score a lot, we scored a lot. 

Q.   James, why were you so efficient against a good defensive Minnesota team? 
JAMES BLACKMON, JR.:   Well, like Rob said, I think it was a mindset thing.   We knew we were going to get good shots.   We just wanted to get everyone involved and run the offense.   I think we did a good job of that. 

Q.   James, talk about the biggest growth in your game this year. 
JAMES BLACKMON, JR.:   Really just my all‑around game, defense, not letting guys blow by, taking their first step away.   Also my rebounding has come a long way from high school, too. 

Q.   Robert, you out‑rebounded them by 19.   Was that a matter of positioning? 
ROBERT JOHNSON:   That's just something we're going to have to continue to do every game.   A lot of times we're playing a line that is smaller than other teams.   It's an asset thing.   It's something we have to do to stay in the game. 

Q.   Robert, at any point in the season has something like the three‑point record helped you cross the line knowing how well you can shoot as a group? 
ROBERT JOHNSON:   I mean, like I just said, we just try to approach every game with the same mindset and keep our rules when it comes to spacing, penetration, things like that. 
When everybody's shot is going, like you see, we can be dangerous sometimes.   It's not something we think about, it's just a mindset of coming to the game. 

Q.   What was your favorite dunk of the night from Troy? 
JAMES BLACKMON, JR.:   I think the one where he tried to dunk on the guy.   That would have been pretty nasty. 
ROBERT JOHNSON:   My favorite one was in the first half because I made the pass to him. 
TROY WILLIAMS:   I just dunk (laughter). 

Q.   (No microphone.)
ROBERT JOHNSON:   That's something we like to do.   That's something we talked about with coach a lot.   When they bring the pressure up like that, the biggest way to attack it is to reciprocate the same pressure and put the pressure on the defense. 
That's something we tried to go out there and do.   We had a few turnovers this game, but I think we'll be okay. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
