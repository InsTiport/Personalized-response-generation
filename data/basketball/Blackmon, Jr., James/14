PURDUE  Â– 67
  INDIANA - 63

Q.   Can you talk about trying to control them across from the basket? 
JAMES BLACKMON:   Really, we felt like we defended the three really well, which was our game plan.   But when the shot went up, guys weren't blocking up, they got a couple of rebounds and that's what got them going from the beginning.   I think Haas was leading them in scoring.

Q.   This is the second consecutive time coming from behind the arc against this team.   What do they do defending the perimeter against you guys that worked so well?
YOGI FERRELL:   I think we just missed a couple shots.   We just weren't down, ready to shoot, per se.   Maybe not taking open shots, the ones that we had, just not being focused when we were shooting.

Q.   It seemed like the first ten minutes you guys played at the pace you guys like.   Did they do anything to kind of press their defense? 
TROY WILLIAMS:   That was more of us stopping ourselves.   Like you said, the first eight to ten minutes, we were playing at our pace.   We had things going our way.   We slowed down and there was a stretch we didn't score.   We still got 23 for a while.   We just took ourselves out of that pace. 

Q.   Is that your ability offensively to kick and get the jump ball? 
YOGI FERRELL:   Yeah, I'd say so.   It does make it hard for us to go down there and try to finish it around the room when they have two seven footers because they're basically just closing out on everybody.   So what we've got to do is attack the big, look for the roll, keep your dribble and try to find everybody. 

Q.   On that last one, was that a set play or were you trying to find everybody? 
YOGI FERRELL:   That was a bad shot, that's what it was.

Q.   Why was it a bad shot? 
YOGI FERRELL:   Time to score, down two, had lots of time left on the clock.   Maybe should have pulled it out.   Just trying to go to the floor again.

Q.   Yogi, what do you have to do in games like this? 
YOGI FERRELL:   We've got to fight.   Tonight we felt like we came to play.   Played really well to an extent, but at the end of the day, our fight (Indiscernible).   I feel like playing Purdue and especially a big rivalry, we've got to go and match the intensity and just fight a little harder.

Q.   James, the kids of Ft. Wayne guarded you hard tonight.   Do they know some of your moves more than the other guys do? 
JAMES BLACKMON:   Yeah, I guess they do watching me playing with them growing up.   But what they did a lot was denying the ball so I couldn't touch it and that's what they tried to do the whole night.
