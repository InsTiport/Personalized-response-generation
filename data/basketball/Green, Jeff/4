  Q. What has changed for you since the coaching change? Anything you guys are doing differently now?  
 JEFF GREEN: You know, we are just out there having fun. That's one of the things that Scott Brooks says, Have fun but play hard. We have been doing that. This is '09. We have been playing pretty well, winning a lot of games in the first part of the season.   
 Things are starting to turn for us. We learn from the beginning of the season to now, and now we're sticking with a lot of teams to the fourth quarter which we didn't do in the first part of our season.   
 Now we are more freelance, but we are playing defense.  
  
  Q. Have you talked with Russell about tonight's game?   
 JEFF GREEN: No. Russ and I are teammates right now. We haven't associated with him. We told him when gets the ball, Kevin will most likely be guarding him. We told him we are going to take him out.
