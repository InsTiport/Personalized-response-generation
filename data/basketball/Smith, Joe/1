   JOE SMITH: You never know. You may not never get this close again. At the same time, he's really trying to drive us in the right direction. He is really trying to get us -- motivate us and accomplish what we are trying to accomplish.
 When your leader does that, then you can't help but to follow him.

 Q. How important is he to the success of this team? 
 JOE SMITH: Without him, we wouldn't be here. We all know that as a group. Cleveland knows that. And we are just riding the wave with him. He is a heck of a talent. We are just trying to ride the wave with him.
