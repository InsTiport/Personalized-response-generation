Q.   (No microphone.)
REGGIE JACKSON:   I don't know how it's going to work yet, but I tried a trick back here, but that's about it. 

Q.   A little more flash?
REGGIE JACKSON:   Maybe just a little more flash for the Allâ€‘Star weekend.

Q.   What does it mean to come down here and get to represent Oklahoma City?   You guys going into the break on top of the West, is there a sense of pride in knowing that you're a part of it?
REGGIE JACKSON:   Very prideful.   Any time you get to go out there and especially to represent that community and all that they do, it means so much to us.   I'm honored.   I'm just trying to have fun with it and win for them.

Q.   Anybody give you some good advice before you came?   Coach, KD?
REGGIE JACKSON:   Everybody has been on me about being real fancy on the dunk, that I better have some tricks up my sleeve. 
And then that I better go out here and compete.   So everybody is going to want to talk about that.   It's not necessarily all fun, but definitely still competition.

Q.   I think we have gotten to see some tricks throughout the season.   So maybe it's just added pressure on you?
REGGIE JACKSON:   Yeah, I have some ideas, but hopefully I can come up with something.

Q.   Have you ever been, do you want to be in the dunk contest some day?   Because you're known for being a guy that can get up there and throw down some dunks?
REGGIE JACKSON:   I wouldn't rule it out, but I definitely, I was told that I was mentioned as possibly an alternate.   I'm happy I didn't get picked.   I don't want to be necessarily rewarded maybe for being shorter and dunking.   I actually want to have some good tricks up my sleeve if I do anything.   But the guys that are in the competition, they, they have all the right to be there.   I'm looking forward to seeing what all of them can do.
