<p>	Q.  When you fouled out of the game, you looked like you came over and said something to Taj; what did you tell him when he came in the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  You?</p>
<p>	Q.  Johnnie, can you talk about the play of Terrell Everett down the stretch, just his poise and leadership? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about what happened in the second half when early on you had a 15-point lead then it became a game in the last five minutes?</p>

<p>	Q.  They never had the lead-in possession.  How was it that every time they got the lead that you guys answered, I mean, post-season big shots, you guys hit one after one after one to make sure you were in control down the stretch?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about putting Jaison Williams in for the inbound pass there at the end?</p>
<p>	Q.  We have watched your games throughout the season, it always seems like there's somebody else that steps up; one day it would be Bookout, oh, wait a minute the reason they are winning is because of Taj Gray, the reason why it's Everett or Godbold or whoever.

<p>	Q.  The dump-off pass when Terrell went into the lane and --</p>
<p>	Q.  I did this for you today.  On Everett when he goes into the line, he dumps off to Taj underneath, that seems to be maybe the key play of the game before the very last play when you made the touchdown pass?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about Gray picking up his third foul so early in the second half.  You gambling and you leaving him in there and not having to worry about him he didn't pick up his fourth?</p>
