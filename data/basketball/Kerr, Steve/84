 Q.  With so many teams shooting three-pointers, are you seeing more creative threes taken?  Step-back from James Harden, P.J. Tucker doing corner threes, Steph off the dribble.  How impressed are you by the creativity and more dynamic threes you're seeing being taken in the game now?  
STEVE KERR: Yeah, it's impressive.  The pull-up threes in transition.  I don't think that was the case 10, 15 years ago.  It seemed like it was more of a spot-up shot.  Now you see everything.  You see guys flying off screens, catching J.J. Redick style, or fading away from the basket, coming off screens, pull-up threes like KD, step-backs like Harden.   
It is impressive.  I just think it's kind of the way the game is going.  The three-point shot has become so prominent that players go home all summer and just shoot a million of them and practice a lot of different things.  So the skill level is amazing.   
 Q.  With what happened in Game 1, starting the Hamptons Five, are you tempted to switch that up after the 12-4 run for Houston to start?  
STEVE KERR: Yes, I am tempted to switch it up, but I'm not going to announce anything as usual.  So we'll see what I come up with.  I don't even think I know right now.
