Q. Coach, in the last series you talked about patterns. How do you see this game and can you talk about the patterns of the game?
STEVE KERR: I'll talk to you about the pattern after the game.  It's hard to tell going into the game.
But I don't remember exactly the context I used that phrase last series, but every game definitely has a pattern to it, and as a coach, you kind of have to read it and kind of base your decisions, especially in the playoffs, on how the game's unfolding and what you see.
