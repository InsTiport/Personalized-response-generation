Q.   Have those guys talked to you about that?
ROY HIBBERT:   No, they haven't, but I always envisioned that when I was laying in bed in my dorm room.

Q.   What are you most looking forward to about Sunday's game?
ROY HIBBERT:   Going out there, hopefully hitting a 3.   That's something that I like to do. 

Q.   Who do you feel are the teams that are playing well?
ROY HIBBERT:   I don't know.   Toronto is playing pretty well, Washington's right there, Chicago's been playing well, even though they're without Derrick. 
But I'm not jumping forward to the second or third round or whatever, so I'm just going to have to take care of business.   We don't want to have any surprises.
