 Q.   Roy, the mentality this year as compared to last year, how has this tournament been different compared to last year?   
ROY HIBBERT:   We're going in with more experience.   We're getting ready for two hard fought battles.  
   
 Q.   Why do you think you guys have been so good on the road?   You've won like five straight.   You've actually played better on the road than at home.   
ROY HIBBERT:   Just focus.   We're a tough team.   It is what it is.   Trying to get as many wins as possible when we get on the road.  
   
 Q.   Having lost Game 2, how crucial is it to win Game 3 and potentially try to get another one?   
ROY HIBBERT:   We want to win as many down there as possible.   We're of the mindset we're going to go for both.   They're a good team.   So they're not going to give it to us.  
   
 Q.   Are you guys more comfortable on this stage this year?   It just seems like you guys are more relaxed.   
ROY HIBBERT:   We're good.  
   
 Q.   How about Paul, whether he's going to play or not?   How does that look?   
ROY HIBBERT:   I haven't heard anything.  
   
 Q.   Are you all prepared, if you have to go without 24?   
ROY HIBBERT:   Yes.   The next man will step up.  
   
 Q.   Does that mean more of Roy Hibbert, more baskets, more postâ€‘up?   
ROY HIBBERT:   We're a team.   Whatever the team needs me to do, I'll do.
