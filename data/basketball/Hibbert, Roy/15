  ROY HIBBERT:   I'm just so proud‑‑ I'm going to work hard the second game and show that guys that go to school for four years can make an impact in this league.   Look at the story of Wesley Johnson and the most famous one right now, Jeremy Lin, guys that go to school for four years can go out there and have an impact on the game.

Q.   You came in here filming us?
ROY HIBBERT:   Yeah, I wanted to document this as much as possible, so I'm just living this up right now, just soaking it all in.

Q.   What's the experience been like for you so far?
ROY HIBBERT:   It's just been great.   Everybody is so welcoming.   It's just a fun atmosphere, and I know it's going to be a competitive game, but the past couple days I've been trying to help Paul with his dunks.

Q.   Can you tell us anything?
ROY HIBBERT:   No, no.   Be ready to have your mind blown.   That's all.
