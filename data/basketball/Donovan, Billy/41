 Q.   In the first half you guys moved the ball really well and in the second half it seemed a little more difficult.   
COACH DONOVAN:   I don't know if we were necessarily rushed.   I didn't think the ball moved like it did in the first half.   Probably give them some credit.   
They tried to pressure us in the first half and we did a good job of moving the ball and keeping the ball ahead of their defense.   
Then I thought in the second half, we did not do a very, very good job of that and you probably got to give them some credit of getting out and pressuring.   And we didn't respond well to it.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
COACH DONOVAN:   One of the things, defensively, against him, he had a very good game he made some big shots for them.  
But the shots he would get and was taking was long pull‑up 2‑point jump shots.   And that's better than a lot of threes, he made a few.  
But he wasn't necessarily all the problem.   I think there was a stretch there where they maybe scored nine straight times down the floor, and then we certainly fouled too much to start the second half putting them in the bonus.   
But he played well and ‑‑ I thought Alexander played well in the second half.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
COACH DONOVAN:   Well, I think, again I don't want to comment on Bill's team.   I'm sure Bill wasn't too happy with his team's performance in the first half.   
Again, I think for us we moved the ball very well, we kept it ahead of their defense, we had penetration, we were playing inside and out.  
And, certainly, there was a clear size advantage that they had against us in the front court.   And I thought the biggest thing that helped us was one we didn't foul a whole lot in the first half.   
We eliminated second chance opportunities for them.   I think they had four offensive rebounds in the first half.   That enabled us to get out on the break.   
The game was very, very fast in the first half and the game got slowed in the second half.   
But I thought we played well in the first half in terms it of‑‑ again, I don't know, Bill maybe feels his team didn't play great in the first half, but I thought our ball movement and the things that we did offensively and defensively were good.   
And in the second half‑‑ I thought we started the half okay.   I knew they were going to come out‑‑ they're down 15 at home.   I knew they were going to come out and at least try to turn up the heat and we responded pretty well.   
And then we had a stretch in the middle of the half there where they went on a 17‑0 run, or whatever it was, and basically, took the lead.   
We had our opportunities, we had our chances, we had some shots, I thought Horford had two or three wide open threes in the first half.   He didn't make any.   
Dorian had some drives he couldn't finish.   
Kasey Hill got to the rim, he couldn't finish.   
Frazier had an open three he missed.   
Coupled with the fact we had some turnovers and some empty possessions just the way we ran our offense and they were certainly more efficient in the second half.   
   
 Q.   What about the atmosphere, what kind of effect does this have an on a team?  
COACH DONOVAN:   I don't think so.   I don't think so.   
Our guys have played in really good environments before.   Wisconsin last year was great, Kentucky is great, this place is great.   
So they have been in those places before.   I don't think so.   I think if it was anything, we would have seen it earlier in the game.   But I don't think our guys were affected by that.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
COACH DONOVAN:   We spent a lot of time coming out of the Bahamas working on some things, and it's been hard the last week because we have had limited numbers in practice.   
The balance between trying to work and have physical contact and compete against each other.   And also the balance of trying to make sure that we don't come in here totally depleted physically.   
But we spent a lot of time with those guys and it was good to see Devin Robinson respond like he did.   I thought he was a bright spot.   
I thought Chris Walker had a very, very challenging week this week.   I give him credit, he stepped up and responded well and gave us some good minutes.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
COACH DONOVAN:   Ankle.   I just left him behind.   It's a school day.   To take him out of school and then have him miss rehab sitting here.   We have trainers back there that can work on him, he can do some rehabilitation and today was a class day.   I don't think there's any reason for him or DeVon Walker to come here with school going on.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
COACH DONOVAN:   I think that he's probably a lot like most young players.   I thought he would come off and play well tonight, because I think he was 0‑10 his last game.   He hadn't shot the ball well.   I think he's always been a streaky shooter.   
But the one thing about him is, I think he's got confidence in himself, and belief in himself.   
And I think that's what really good players do is that when they have the kind of night like he had in their last game, he came back and responded really, really well.   He drove it to the basket.   
But, again he made some tough pull‑up jump shots and we're going to give those up.   When I say gave them up, we would like to challenge them.   But I felt in a game, the three‑point line and their post up game were the two things that we really had to try to take away.   And we had to give help in the post and if we were going to settle for anything, it was going to be long 2s.   And we tried to cover the basket as best we could, having limited front court depth.
