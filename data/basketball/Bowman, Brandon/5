<p>	Q.  Obviously, Jeff didn't have one of his better nights.  Having trouble to find another scorer to go on until Darrel showed up in the second half (inaudible).  Can you talk about his performance. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, it's been almost a month since you guys won a game.  Were you concerned about the mental aspect of that, how it was weighing on your team going into such an important game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, what do you think this game did for your NCAA tournament hopes?  Is tomorrow a must-win, do you think? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can a player spark you guys (inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  Brandon, what was the difference tonight?  As Coach said, you could have packed it in and lost.  What made you guys turn it around? </p>
<p>	Q.  How do you feel about having this in your grasp now? </p>
<p>	Q.  Darrel, there was a point during the second half, middle of the way, where you guys looked like nobody really wanted to shoot.  You came in, you sort of broke that ice and started taking some shots.  Was that something you saw on the bench, when you got in, "Something is going to happen"? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, obviously you don't have a lot of time to enjoy this win.  Some people say you're playing against one of the best teams in the country.  Talk about what you have to do tomorrow in order to get a win. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you were talking about making defensive stops.  You were able to shut down Seton Hall's interior. </p>
