  THE MODERATOR:   The volleyball team begins the second half of the Big Ten season this weekend with a pair of home matches.   UW hosts Illinois on Friday at 7:00 p.m. and then Northwestern on Sunday at 1:00 p.m. here at the field house.   Head Coach Pete Waite is here.   We'll have some opening comments and take questions.     
COACH WAITE:   First round of Big Ten play we went down to Northwestern and got the win there and lost in five at Illinois.   Just missed that one.   We're hoping, get them on our home court this weekend, and get a couple of wins.   We need to and want to improve in the second half of Big Ten play here.     
Ellen Chapman's been on kind of a tear.   She's been great offensively.   Friday night's match she had 24 kills, 1 error, which is outstanding for an outside hitter.   We need the rest of the team to get on board and in sync offensively so we have more of a balanced attack so it's not just Ellen carrying the load.   Looking forward to this weekend in the second half of Big Ten play.  
   
 Q.   It's easy to look at how difficult the Big Ten is.   But has there been one thing or multiple things that have not allowed you to win some of these matches against some of these good teams?     
COACH WAITE:   It depends on the night sometimes.   As of late, we've hit a couple of really good serving teams, so our service has been the issue.   We'll continue to work on that.     
Our serves, I think, have gotten better.   I think Annemarie Hickey and Deme Morales are bringing a great jump serve.   So that's gotten more solid.   And even on Friday night against Indiana, we were down 20‑24 in the third and came back and we had set point at 25‑24 and 26‑25, and I think they beat us 30‑28, something like that.   That's one of those that, if we can close it out and get over the hump, then you go to the fourth, and we have a shot of winning the whole thing.   And each game, each set we got better.     
So it's still a work in progress, no doubt about that.  
   
 Q.   How different is the second time through, not only because you've seen them but they've seen you?     
COACH WAITE:   Everybody knows each other pretty darn well because, having played each other, watching more videotape on each other, but it makes everybody become better because they've got to step up their games.     
So we need to bring a little more variety in the offense and change some things up a bit.   You have good scouting reports on them.   But then you're telling your own players, here's what the other teams are seeing in you.   So you need to increase your shot selection, things like that.   Overall for us, I think it's just consistency in every aspect of the game, and I think we'll get a couple more wins.  
   
 Q.   You look at it too, you're only two games out of fifth, right?     
COACH WAITE:   There's a big clump.   There's a lot of people beating up on each other.   On any given day, Purdue is a top 15 team, got beat by Indiana and Iowa within a week, and they're in the top half of the Big Ten.   So there's kind of a top half and a bottom half, and the bottom half is beating the top half on occasion.   So it's real tight.     
We want to be one of those teams knocking them off up top and work our way up the list, yeah.  
   
 Q.   It's strange to see a team of yours 1‑4 at home in the Big Ten.     
COACH WAITE:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   It has to start at home, right?     
COACH WAITE:   You'll take them anywhere, and that's the strange thing is there's years we'll beat a team at their place, and they'll beat us at our place.   It's strange how comfortable teams get on the road sometimes and what they re doing.   And this is our chance right now.We've got two home games this weekend to get it done with.   So there's no reason not to.     
I think these are two teams we can beat, but they're two teams that have beaten plenty of good teams in the Big Ten also.     
THE MODERATOR:   Anything else for Pete?     
COACH WAITE:   Do you guys have assigned seats?   You're always in the same spot.     
   
 Q.   Like going to church.     
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
