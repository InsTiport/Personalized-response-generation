THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement from Coach Hampton-Keith.
COACH HAMPTON-KEITH: We're just excited to be playing another day.  And what a great first-round matchup.  It's a shame that someone had to bow out in the first round, because that was an awesome match.
It was well played and I thought well coached from their end for sure, and it was really a fun match to be a part of.  And so that's too bad that one person has to go home.  That sucks.  But I'm really happy that it's us not going home.
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.
Q. (A question about the school match record for kills in an NCAA match.)
BREE BAILEY: I was just going after it.  It's a whole different feeling when you're in the tournament.  And I was trying to be as aggressive as I possibly could and swing as hard and fast as I possibly could and came out with 22 kills, I guess.
JULIA BROWN: That was Bree.
BREE BAILEY: No, I didn't even know it was game point.  I thought we were tied, so I thought we had one more point to play.  My celebration wasn't as good as it could have been.  To come in at game point, you've just got to swing away.
Q. (Question about how it felt to record the final kill.)
JULIA BROWN: Kylee had great game.  And we also had great serve receive so we were able to be in system as well.  She had great sets and we were able to make it happen.
