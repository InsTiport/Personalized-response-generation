 Q.   Now you have to reset, moving on to Chicago.   What are your Chase hopes as we move forward?   
CARL EDWARDS:   Well, first of all, congrats to Ford for having five Fords in the Chase.   It was an awesome run by Brad and those guys.   I know Greg, he said that was the toughest thing he's ever done and I'm telling you, it had to because we were struggling.   We just missed the setup.   A year ago we won this race with our Kellogg's Ford and we went on to finish last in the Chase.   Hopefully tonight's poor performance will bode well for the final 10 races.   We'd love to get our Fastenal Ford to Homestead.   We've tested at Chicago, we feel like we have something that could be good, and hopefully it is.
