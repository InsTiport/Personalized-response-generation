  CARL EDWARDS:   I want to make a statement.   I just appreciate Stanley being a part of this.   This is a big race for us.   We had a good run, and we just‑‑ that last restart kind of got us, but the kids were‑‑ it was cool, got out of the car and saw the kids over there at the pit box, seemed like they had a good time.   It's not a win, but for us it is our first top 10 and we dug hard all day, and we had a lot of fun.   It's a good racetrack.
