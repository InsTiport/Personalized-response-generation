  THE MODERATOR: We are being joined by Brett Moffitt. We'll get right into questions. 

Q. Brett, on the restart, there was contact behind. Was that just a bad restart from you or did you feel like he ran into you on purpose?
BRETT MOFFITT: No, I mean, just out there on old tires. Longest run, most laps on a set of tires we had all night. You stay out like a sitting duck. 
It just is what it is. I have nothing to say really. 

Q. It sounds like you wanted to stay out when you were talking. Is that accurate?
BRETT MOFFITT: I mean, I wanted some information on what it was looking like. All they tell me is there's chatter. Everybody comes down pit road, there's not enough cars to block the new tire. 
Race strategy has been a downfall of us all year, for sure. We've thrown away multiple wins because of it. It's frustrating to lose a championship because of it. 

Q. Brett, just outside of the race, what does it mean to honor a sevenâtime champion in Jimmie Johnson?
BRETT MOFFITT: It's great. I mean, I'm just in a bad mood. Yeah, it was cool to honor Jimmie. I appreciate him allowing me to do it. To me he's the greatest of all time. Frustrating that we didn't put it where it belonged, and that was in Victory Lane, winning a championship. 

Q. Overall what would you say this year is? Not what you wanted, but what can you take going into next year?
BRETT MOFFITT: I don't even know what I'm doing next year, so that's that. This year's been hell on and off the racetrack. I don't know. It's been a tough year in my personal life with everything that happened. Having a bad year on track certainly doesn't help that at all. 
Honestly, I'm just glad it's over at this point. 
THE MODERATOR: Brett, thank you for taking the time to join us. 
BRETT MOFFITT: Thank you, guys.
