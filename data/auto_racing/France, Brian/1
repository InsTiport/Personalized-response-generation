  BRIAN FRANCE: Good evening. This is a special honor for me tonight and my sister and my family who you'll meet here in a minute. The Landmark Award was designed to recognize people behind the scenes who you may not see often but make a big difference, and that's exactly what my uncle has done through my whole career, and the most important thing he's done that I would tell you tonight is make sure our family stays going in one direction helping grow NASCAR in a good, smart way, and I have the utmost respect. So it's really proud for me and my sister and the rest of his family to recognize my Uncle Jim for the Landmark Award tonight. 
LESA FRANCE KENNEDY: Jim has such a steady guidance and influence behind the scenes. That's where he likes to be, and that's where he has made such a difference in our sport. He'll have a lasting impact on the sport, as he has over the years, but I think this award was designed for someone just like Jim France. Jim was very sorry that he couldn't be here tonight. He's a bit under the weather, and he wanted us to pass along his thanks and how honored he was to be recognized with the Landmark Award tonight. Thank you.
