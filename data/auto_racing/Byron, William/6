Q. First car on the restart with four fresh tires, three to go. Was that the designated 'go' lap or did you just feel it?
WILLIAM BYRON: No, there wasn't any Chevy orders or anything like that. We just did a good job of working together. Kurt was a great pusher and great helper. I really had a lot of trust in him. 
I was really trying to go with one to go, but I had enough momentum out of the triâoval. Watching the old races, that's where the momentum kind of lines up. I didn't know if I would get that kind of same momentum once everybody started pushing with one to go. 
Made it there, got to second. I guess Kevin played really nice and didn't pull a big block. Thanks to Axalta. This car looks really good. I'm sure it was beautiful under the lights. Excited for the 500.
