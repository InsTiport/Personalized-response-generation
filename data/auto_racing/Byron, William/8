Q.   Martin Truex Jr.'s closest competitor at the end of that race, 21âyearâold William Byron from Charlotte, North Carolina. What more did you need to maybe give him a better run for his money there at the end?
WILLIAM BYRON: I don't know, he was really strong. I could work my brake bias a little bit in the car and gain a little bit, and then I'd get to him and I'd heat him up a lot and then kind of fall back. I don't really know. He was super strong. Our car bounced a little bit on the short run, which was tough to kind of get around. But overall it was a really good day. 
This isn't a place that I've loved coming to, and it just clicked this weekend, the things we did with the car going into qualifying and then obviously our race. Super excited, but second is not super fun, either. We'll try to get one spot better next time. 

Q. If you could have gotten closer to him, would you have moved him for that first win knowing how close it was?
WILLIAM BYRON: Yeah, I mean, whatever it takes. I wouldn't race him dirty, but I'm really hungry for my first win, so it's going toââ whatever it takes. But he ran such a good race. I think he would have been able to drag the brake and do all he could to keep me behind him anyway. Close.
