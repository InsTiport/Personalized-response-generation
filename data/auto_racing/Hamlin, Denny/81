 Q. There's no question that it was uncomfortable inside the race car for Denny Hamlin, yet he persevered, finishes 6th tonight. Icing up the knee right now, obviously there was some pain in the race car. How were you able to overcome it?  
DENNY HAMLIN: Good race car for sure. You know, we had a bad stop there on that last stop and missed our adjustments a little bit, but you know, we didn't have anything for the 20, could see the 18 most of the day, so I thought we had a third‑, fourth‑place car, ended up sixth. I hate we ended our streak of top‑5 finishes there, but overall very proud of this FedEx Express team. We just got some fast Camrys right now, we always seem to be right behind our teammates that win. That's good momentum, though, going into the Chase, and I think we can go on a run here.  
   
 Q. Now you turn your attention to some really meaningful races. How are you going to deal with this in the next 10 weeks?  
DENNY HAMLIN: Well, I think it'll be a lot better next week. Just three days out, really, four nights out, from when it happened, and anybody that's had it happen before knows that the first week is pretty tough. I think I'll start to rehab and everything this week and try to get it stronger and make sure we're ready to make a Chase run.
