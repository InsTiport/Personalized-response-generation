 Q. Well, there is a little celebration, but it is a subdued Victory Lane right now. As a race car driver in these moments, the highs, the lows, how do you describe this style of racing, the adrenaline and the bravery that it takes?   
DENNY HAMLIN: Yeah, I think we take for granted sometimes how safe the cars are. But number run, we're praying for Ryan. Worked really well with Ryan through this whole race, and obviously he got turned right there.   
Proud of our whole FedEx team. I don't even know what to say. It's so unexpected. I mean, I knew they were going to come with a big run there. My job was to just make sure I didn't put a block that was going to wreck me, live to race another corner.   
We got to the 12's bumper, got to pushing him there, and I knew I was going to give him a big run, and it was going toââ the race wasn't over, and obviously it worked out well for us at the end there.  
Proud of this whole FedEx team, Toyota, Coke, the Jordan brand, Little Big Burger. Great to have my girls here. Great to have the team celebrating backâtoâbackââ I can't even tell you what it means to me.   
   
 Q. It doesn't matter what crew chief you have or what rules package or what year it is; three times now. What is it about you and this style of racing in Daytona?   
DENNY HAMLIN: Yeah, I mean, I just feel like I'm a student to the game. I never stop learning and trying to figure out where I need to put myself at the right time.   
It doesn't always work. The odds have definitelyââ we'vedefied odds here in the last eight years or so in the Daytona 500, but just trust my instincts, and so far they've been good for me.  
I can't do it without the car. That's making it capable for me to make those raceâwinning moves.
