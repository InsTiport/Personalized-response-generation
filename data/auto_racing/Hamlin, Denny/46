 Q. How did you win the race almost three or four times? Must have given you a heck of a car?  
DENNY HAMLIN: Yeah, our car was really, really fast. We obviously saw that. Once we got out front, we were able to pull away from the pack a little bit. Got a little bit loose when we were racing our teammates from the 18 and the 20. So wasn't able to be as aggressive as I was earlier in the race. We had a super fast car. That's why we won.   
I missed pit road under green, that cost us three or four seconds, as well. I don't know. We tried every way we could to give it away, and we found a way to do it with this FedEx Camry.
