Q. Best drive of your career, Denny. 
DENNY HAMLIN: One of the best cars of my career, I can tell you that. Fast car. But, yeah, I pushed for all I had. I mean, that's all I got. Once we got the big lead there, a little over 10 seconds, I just kind of sat there. I got to thinking about if the caution does come out, I want to lap as many as I can. 
That's all we had, so... Proud of this whole FedEx racing team, proud of Toyota for locking up the manufacturers championship this week. Toyota, the Jordan Brand, Little Big Burger, the entire FedEx group for an unbelievable team. 

Q. You downplayed it all week long. Honestly, were the nerves there understanding how big this moment was for your career?
DENNY HAMLIN: Yeah, I mean, I try not to put too much into it. There's still work to be done. Doesn't guarantee a championship. Gives us a chance. Live to fight another day. That's all you can ask for.
