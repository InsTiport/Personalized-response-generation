Q. It has been almost nine years since you went into Victory Lane here at Texas Motor Speedway. How did you overcome two penalties today to get the win?
DENNY HAMLIN: And a missed pit road under green. 
Just a fast car. Give me a fast car, a car that could really pass anyone in the field. That means a lot. Definitely was a different type of race here, trying to draft, trying to get out of everyone's wake. 
Proud of this whole FedEx Office team here, Toyota, Cocaâ€‘Cola, the Jordan Brand, Little Big Burger, everyone who helps put this racecar on the racetrack. Joe Gibbs, J.D. Gibbs, still thinking about him and his legacy. 
Have to say hi to Jordan and the kids at home. Hopefully we have some fun tonight.
