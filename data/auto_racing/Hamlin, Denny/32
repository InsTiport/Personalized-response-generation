Q. Huge smile as you just won here at Kansas. How good does this feel?
DENNY HAMLIN: Great. This is a great feeling. That car was awesome to dominate that whole second half. I have to thank everybody who pushed me on the restarts, Kyle, the 9 at the end. Good to see him make it by points anyway. 
But, hey, I'm just really happy for this whole FedEx team. It's been great. Been running really good. Cannot wait to get to Martinsville.
