 Q. Denny, what happened between you and Joey Logano?  
DENNY HAMLIN: We were having a discussion, everything was civil, and then like Joey does, he does a little push and then runs away. So that's Joey. Scaredââ he said, "Do you want to go?" I said, "Yes, I'm here." But then he runs away.   
   
 Q. What was the altercation on track that led to it?   
DENNY HAMLIN: I got close off of Turn 4. It looks like we got together, and it looks like collateral damage. He blew a tire. I mean, he would probably say, oh, short track racing.  
   
 Q. Are you going to find him after this?   
DENNY HAMLIN: No, I don't need to find him.
