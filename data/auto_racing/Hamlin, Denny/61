 Q. What happened getting into Truex?  
DENNY HAMLIN: We both drove in really, really deep. When I got on the brakes, the splitter slammed down on the ground, shot me up the track into him. We weren't racing for the win or anything. But it's unfortunate. Didn't want to get into him. He's a great teammate of ours.   
But, yeah, tough day for our FedEx team. Overnight we messed it up pretty good. We struggled all day. Got a little bit better there at the end by just kind of going back to where we started the day. Definitely not a car that could contend.   
   
 Q. You got back in the game by going backwards on adjustments, correct?   
DENNY HAMLIN: Yeah. We were trying to make it better, but it was just getting worse and worse. It was a miserable day actually. They tell me I'm a hero around here. Today I was a clown.
