 Q. It's been a while since the Pocono fans have been able to see Denny Hamlin celebrate on the frontstretch at Pocono. Last week he said, I made a deposit. This week he makes the withdrawal. How worried were you about fuel on this overtime restart?  
DENNY HAMLIN: I was really worried. Really worried. We just did a great job with the car. Once we lost the track position there to the 19 and the 20, I thought it's over, we weren't able to pass them.   
Thank Pocono for putting in this PJ1. I was able to use it there, get around those guys. Thanks, everyone, for this FedEx Camry. We're on a roll this year.   
   
 Q. You said, We've flown below the radar all year long. Is the 11 team starting to rise to the occasion right now?  
DENNY HAMLIN: We're running our best right now. No doubt about it. We are just going to keep plugging along. That's all I can say. We're doing the best we can.
