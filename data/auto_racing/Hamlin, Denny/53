  THE MODERATOR: We've now been joined by our second‑place finisher, driver of the No.11 FedEx Toyota, Denny Hamlin. Denny, a little bit wild and crazy last couple laps there. Tell us a little bit about from your vantage point how your race went and then being able to come home with a second‑place finish.   
DENNY HAMLIN: Yeah, we had a pretty uneventful race and just kind of kept our nose clean and did everything we needed to do to get a good finish. I thought that there towards the end‑‑ really the last 11 laps, we had probably anywhere from a fifth‑ to seventh‑place car, and we took advantage there on that last stop to take two tires. That put us in the outside line, got a good restart, and then they wrecked behind us, and that put us on the front row.   
Really just a great execution day. You know, like I said, didn't make any mistakes, just chipped away at it. We worked our way in the top 10 by the end of Stage 2 and then just got to like eighth, then seventh, then sixth, and just kept getting a little bit better throughout the day, and other guys were starting to falter or their cars were fading, and we took advantage.   
   
 Q. Denny, on that final restart with Chase in the playoffs, were you a little more cognizant of that, trying to race him for the win, trying to make sure you didn't make any contact?   
DENNY HAMLIN: After last fall, I was really making sure I didn't make any contact, to be honest with you.
