 Q. Denny, somehow you did it. The drive of a lifetime. The whole team here meeting you. You raced your way into Homestead.   
DENNY HAMLIN: I can't believe it. This race team worked so hard this whole year. They deserve to be there. I put them in a bad hole last week. I told them today in the meeting, I said, I'm going to give everything I've got to make up for the mistake I made last week. That's all I got.   
   
 Q. When that caution came out, the frustration was real. How were you trying to manage with the last restart?  
DENNY HAMLIN: I've been through so many Playoffs, so many things that go wrong. This year I'm waiting for the right next thing to go happen. I can't thank this FedEx Ground team enough, Toyota. I don't have words yet. I'm going to have to do a little bit more donuts. I'm not done yet, then go to Homestead.
