DENNY HAMLIN: It's Fred Smith, you better answer the phone. Fred Smith and his whole team, been so great to support me and this race team for 14 years of my career. Couldn't be happier to be with this company and all the associates that work there. 
Have to thank FedEx, Toyota, Coke, the Jordan Brand, Little Big Burger. The pit crew did a phenomenal job today. Chris made the right call every time. We just had a raceâwinning car. 
The second half race of the showed. Man, glad we could pull it off.
