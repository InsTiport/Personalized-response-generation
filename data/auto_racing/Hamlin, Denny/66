Q. It's been a few years. How does this feel?
DENNY HAMLIN: It was great. I'll tell you, our cars were really running well. Wheels and the whole group just gave me a great car. Really got it tuned in there the last half of the race. Just good restarts, finally everything just kind of worked well for us all day. I didn't think staying out was the right thing to do, but great call there, and actually I got this from one of our Toyota guests on his birthday day today. He gave me this. He said it helps him get through tough times, so kept that in the car, and thank Eli for that. Proud of this whole FedEx Ground Camry team. Everything has been great. Thank everyone from the Greenbrier, the Jordan brand, Coca‑Cola, everyone who's been just so good to us throughout my career, and hopefully we'll go on another Chase run.

Q. So many people rooting you on. This is home, Denny. 
DENNY HAMLIN: Yeah, that's what's so special about it so you get to do it at home, and there's just‑‑ I see all the extra Denny Hamlin shirts and hats and everything, and fires me up every time I get here. I've also got to thank Sport Clips for their support this year, as well. Got all that covered, and man, this is a great car. Hopefully we can use it in the Chase. 

Q. What kind of momentum are you guys now carrying into the Chase?
DENNY HAMLIN: I said that I thought we were like an 8 1/2 on momentum. I don't believe in 10, so 9, 9 1/2 would be optimum. I said if we won this race we'd go to a 9. Hard for me not to say it's 9 1/2 at this point. It's a great team effort here. We've got everything going for us. A total team effort, just everyone at JGR building these fast, fast cars, can't thank everyone enough.
