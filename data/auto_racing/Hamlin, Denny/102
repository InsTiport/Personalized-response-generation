  MATT HUMPHREY:   We are now joined by today's third‑place driver, Kyle Busch, driver of the No.18 M&M's Toyota Camry for Joe Gibbs Racing.   Can you talk about, the car you had today was really dominant. 
KYLE BUSCH:   Yeah, great car.   M&M's guys gave me an awesome piece, and unfortunately there I gave the race away.   You know, I hate it for my guys, and they worked so hard and they dug hard this weekend, and obviously having a car that's the class of the field you expect to win and you're supposed to win, but I guess I just didn't know how to win it today. 

Q.   On the two final cautions there, I guess on the one, did they call‑‑ was it correct, did you guys not make it to the line before the white?   And then on the second one, should the caution have been called there on the last one? 
KYLE BUSCH:   I would say that Harvick‑‑ I saw the yellow lights flickering before Harvick got to the start finish line, so I believe they called it right.   And there on that last one, there was oil and everything on the exit of Turn 4, and we all about‑‑ well, the front of us about crashed, so I can't imagine what was going on behind me. 
But evidently there was more carnage going on back there.   So not sure if they had time to react to all that, but granted, you would expect that they would see all of that and see the oil slick.   I mean, it wasn't small by any means.   It was three feet wide.
MATT HUMPHREY:   Joined now by Denny Hamlin, driver of the No. 11 FedEx Ground Toyota Camry for Joe Gibbs Racing.   Denny finished second today here at Phoenix International Raceway.   Denny, can you tell us about that wild finish? 
DENNY HAMLIN:   Who won the race‑‑ I mean the fight?   Anybody know?   No one knows who won?   Who had the best hit? 

Q.   Bowyer was the fastest runner. 
DENNY HAMLIN:   That's the most workout Bowyer has had in years. 
MATT HUMPHREY:   Can you describe your run out there today? 
DENNY HAMLIN:   Treacherous.   The racetrack is extremely treacherous.   With these hard tires, you just can't get a grip on the racetrack.   I did a tire test with Goodyear here not too long ago on the 2013 car, and I think they've got some ideas that's going to make it a little bit better.   But right now, holy cow, it's a mess.   What happens now is everyone is just sliding around and sliding into each other, and of course it makes for excitement on TV, but obviously it also makes for championship implications, as well. 

Q.   Did you see the Danica crash at the end, and should the yellow have come out? 
DENNY HAMLIN:   Well, I'm 50/50 on that.   The 29 almost wrecked coming to the line, and that would have‑‑ I would have said no.   But we almost wrecked, too.   So it was a‑‑ there was a lot of stuff on the racetrack.   I mean, that's why that wreck happened on the front stretch is there was oil all over it.   Ray Charles could see that (laughter). 
It was just a judgment call, I guess. 

Q.   Two questions for Denny.   How identical is your car setup to Kyle's car, and you raced here earlier at Phoenix International Raceway.   Are there any similarities, similar setup, or is it totally different later in the year? 
DENNY HAMLIN:   My setup from the beginning of the year was relatively the same, but the 18 car seemed to have a better car for the short run, and we obviously seemed to have a better car for the long run.   We just never had the long run.   If it would have went green with about 25 to go, I started reeling in the 18 again, and I thought it was pretty much going to be our race to lose at that point. 
But I mean, who knows what would have happened.   But obviously it didn't go green and had a bunch of cautions, and then it was all about whoever lined up in the right line. 
MATT HUMPHREY:   Denny, thank you for joining us, and we'll see you next week in Homestead Miami Speedway.
