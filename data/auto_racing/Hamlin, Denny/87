 Q.   You dodged a huge bullet.   Describe this early session.   
DENNY HAMLIN:   Mayhem.   There's no other word to describe it.   Everybody's on so many different agendas.   This stuff can happen.   
But, I don't know, it's the format we got to go by.   We're going to try to do the best we can to play the system, make it work.   
We flatten part of our tires here to where I can't join this last group.   In one lap, it will be hard for them to run faster than that.   We'll see how it all goes.
