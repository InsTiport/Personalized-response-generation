Q. Denny Hamlin, the problems started early with the hood issue, then some crash damage. You went a lap down. At that point how did the agenda change for you?
DENNY HAMLIN: It changed with every caution. It changed with every car that fell out. I mean, just a game of chess all day. Sure, we could have got up there and raced, got in the middle, but we would have been in all those wrecks. Didn't make sense to me. 
I knew the statistics, the odds, the chances. I looked at how many cars were on the lead lap if we were to crash at that point in the race. It just wasn't worth the risk. There wasn't enough to gain with cars still crashing. 
We waited till the bulk of them got out, then went up there and tried to win. We almost did. 
I think we played the race as good as we could given all the issues we did have. Just a great job with my FedEx team getting us moved on here. 

Q. Was this just typical Talladega or was it a little bit different this time around?
DENNY HAMLIN: I think it's typical with this package. Holes close quicker. You're not able to really block. We didn't do a good job blocking when we had a lower closing rate, much less this big one with the spoiler. 
I think everyone is just taking some time to get adjusted to. From our standpoint, we knew the odds, we knew the statistics, and we played that game.
