Q.   This will be the eighth Chase appearance for Denny Hamlin.   What do you feel is the strength of your team going in? 
DENNY HAMLIN:   Pit crew would be our strength right now.

Q.   We've seen that lately. 
DENNY HAMLIN:   You know, we've got a lot of pieces of the puzzle put together for a championship run.   As important as track position is nowadays, you've got to have great pit stops, and we feel like we've got that part licked, it's just you've got to have faster cars, you've got to qualify better.   There's a lot of things that go into a championship run, and we're missing a couple of them very important pieces, and that's speed.
