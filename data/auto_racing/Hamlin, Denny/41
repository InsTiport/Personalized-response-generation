 Q. Denny, third on a weekend where we knew the 11 was pretty good. Where was it just off from the top two?   
DENNY HAMLIN: I thought the Bus Stop was consistently where we would lose just a little bit each lap. I mean, we were a tenth to two maybe each lap off, and that's‑‑ I mean, when you spread it out amongst seven or 10 or 12 corners, whatever we've got here, it just adds up, and that's kind of where we were at.   
We were the next best. The 20 was really good there at the end, but just the next best. We just didn't have the car that was able to go out there and compete with those guys. I could hang with them for a little bit, but in the long run it seemed like that's where we struggled the most. But proud of the whole FedEx Cares team to bring me another fast car and keep this momentum going.   
   
 Q. Is that something you personally can work on, or is it that you were different than Martin's car and that was where the car was worse?   
DENNY HAMLIN: Yeah, we're always a little bit different in that sense, but I think that we could get the car a little bit better. I feel like I still could improve. I think that Martin is overall just a little bit better road course racer than I am, but we've closed the gap dramatically this year in particular. I thought at Sonoma we were lightning fast, and then here with another top 5. We're chipping away. I mean, we're really chipping away and really doing a good job executing, and that's paying off with good finishes.
