Q. Was there anything there you could do different fuel‑wise during that last run to catch the 4?
DENNY HAMLIN: Well, it seemed like we didn't have the best handling car when it was really hot and slick, but as the day went on and the track cooled off, the guys that had built more speed into their car, it kind of handicapped it for them. So we were able to hang on to those Fords there at the end, and then just got‑‑ the 4 was trying to save fuel I'm guessing there, the 2 and the 22 peeled off. But we were right there, just a really fast car. The whole FedEx team did a great job adjusting from the last time we were here. First and second on these tracks that we're going back to twice, so Chris is doing a great job making those adjustments. 
Nothing I could really do, just didn't have enough speed. 4 was about a half second faster than us in qualifying, and when we were holding it wide open there at the end, just couldn't overcome it.

Q. You say when it was hot and slick and handling mattered, that was kind of a choice you guys made going into this. Do you still agree with that choice and is that something you guys will continue to do? 
DENNY HAMLIN: Yeah, I mean, it's a balance. The fastest car won the race speed‑wise. So who knows what the right thing to do is, but certainly I feel like we had a great FedEx Camry today, just came up one more spot short again.
