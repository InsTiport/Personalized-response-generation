Q. I've got to believe it's a pretty rough way to make it into the Chase. How would you describe your evening?
PAUL MENARD: Justin and I were just talking, we don't know whether to be happy or sad, it was such a bad race for us. Obviously very excited to be in the Chase. It was a goal that we set at the beginning of the year. Everybody at RCR and the 27 guys and ECR, they work hard. We've had a lot of good runs this year. Tonight just wasn't one of them, but we did what we had to do.

Q. You made it on the strength of four top 10s, a couple of top 5s in there. What do you need to do now that you're in?
PAUL MENARD: Everything resets now, so Chicago has been a pretty good track for us. I feel good about our intermediate track program. Man, we had a fast car tonight, it just burned the leftâ€‘front tire off after 30, 40 laps and we started going backwards. Try to figure out what happened there, but Chicago is a whole new animal, and it's a track I really enjoy.

Q. Wipe the slate clean, just like the points?
PAUL MENARD: That's pretty much what we've got to do.
