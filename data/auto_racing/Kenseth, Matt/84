   KERRY THARP: We are joined by Matt Kenseth who drives the number 17 Ford for Dewalt; we appreciate you coming in. Your thoughts.
 MATT KENSETH: This is disappointing how we ran here the last three or four times for some reason. But really since California, we went to Vegas, and broke in the second lap or first lap and everything has really been downhill since there so I can't say I'm really surprise that had we didn't make it. I'm really disappointed we didn't make it but we just didn't perform good enough. 
 Yeah, there's mistakes here and there and some points left on the table but you can say that every year. Basically we just didn't perform good enough. We didn't run good enough to be in and the way we ran the last three months, we didn't deserve to be in there. 
 KERRY THARP: Matt, thank you very much. Appreciate it, you're a class act.
