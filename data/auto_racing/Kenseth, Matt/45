Q.   My friend, you are the No.1 seed in the Chase.   How prepared are you and this team to move into this Chase and win a championship?
MATT KENSETH:   I think we're prepared.   I mean, tonight was a little bit of a struggle, but yeah, it's been an amazing 26 weeks, that's for sure.   Jason Ratcliff and the whole team, really can't thank that group enough and everybody back at Joe Gibbs Racing.   They give all three of us really good cars every week, and they're a lot of fun to drive.   Kind of a frustrating effort tonight.   Happy about our finish and looking forward to going to Chicago and getting this thing started.
