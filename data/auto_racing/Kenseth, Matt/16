 Q. Four wins heading into the Chase, just the second time winning here at Richmond, and the Gatorade splash. Matt, what a performance that you put on there today, just absolutely dominant. You've now won three of the last six races. What sort of statement are you making as you enter the Chase?   
MATT KENSETH: Well, the main thing I want to say it that I'm glad that box isn't full, so I didn't hurt my fist. Man, these guys gave me a great car. Thanks to Jason and all these guys standing behind me, they had the pit stops we needed, held serve every time and kept us out in front. We were really superb in the long run. I had to work for it pretty hard in the short run. I was disappointed to see that last caution. I knew it was going to be tough but we were able to get the jump to get out front. Thanks a lot to Dollar General. Rick, I'm sorry, it's not a grandfather clock at Richmond, sorry buddy, but I want thank Sprint, Dollar General, DeWalt, Toyota TRD, Gatorade, Citizen, WileyX, Cessna and Reser's. We got great partners, couldn't do it without them. Great way to go into the Chase.  
   
 Q. You know what it's like to be a champion. How does this team compare to what you had in 2003?  
MATT KENSETH: Man, it was so long ago, it's hard. There's been so many rules changes, so many things are different. Certainly now as a company we're on a roll. They've given me some fast cars here the last couple months. I had a good one in Bristol and broke, and I was the goat last week and drove it in the fence early in the race and ruined our day with probably the best car. It feels good to come here and do everything right and get the win.   
   
 Q. Momentum and three more points headed into the Chase.
