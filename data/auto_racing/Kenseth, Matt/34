  KERRY THARP:   We're going to go ahead and hear from our racerunner‑up, Kevin Harvick, and our third‑place finisher Matt Kenseth.   Appreciate you guys coming in.   Kevin drove the No.4 Hunt Brothers Pizza Chevrolet and Matt drove the No.20 Home Depot Husky Toyota.   Kevin, certainly had a very strong race car.   Just talk about your performance out there tonight and how you thought things unfolded.   
KEVIN HARVICK:   Yeah, I thought we had a really fast race car and did all the things we needed to do to put ourselves in position on the racetrack and just couldn't get it done on pit road tonight.   We just didn't make it happen at the end and ran out of time as we got to the closing laps.   
KERRY THARP:   Matt, third‑place finish here tonight for you.   Just talk about how the No.20 car performed this weekend at Charlotte.   
MATT KENSETH:   Yeah, that last run was by far the best we were since we've been here, so I felt like we were kind of struggling to stay in mid pack most of the race, and I made some adjustments, had a really fast pit stop that last stop and the car was better and we were able to hang on to third.   So, like I said, we were kind of mid pack most of the night and that last run I could kind of break even at least with the top couple cars.   Felt like we gained on it a little bit, so hopefully we'll have it better next week.
