  JEFF GORDON:   Things just got escalated over the year, and I'd just had it.   Clint has run into me numerous times, wrecked me, and he got into me on the back straightaway and pretty much ruined our day.   I've had it, fed up with it and I got him back.

Q.   What did you tell them in the hauler?
JEFF GORDON:   I told them what I just told you.

Q.   Are you worried about what comes next?
JEFF GORDON:   They've got to do what they've got to do, and I guess I had to do what I had to do.
