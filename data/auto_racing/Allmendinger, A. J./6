Q.   One of the underdogs of the Chase, AJ Allmendinger, I know it was a tough night but you have to get excited to look back at your win.   What are your expectations looking forward to the Chase?
AJ ALLMENDINGER:   We're just, right now, it's the nature of our race team.   We're trying to take big steps, but at times you take one step back and you take two steps forward.   Our last two weeks have been a little bit difficult, but at the same point we kind of knew they were going to be, just the mere fact that we don't have many cars in the race shop, so we had to get our three best bullets ready for the first three races in the Chase.   Tough night tonight, but Watkins Glen is a great memory, and I feel like if we're at our best, we have a shot at getting through the first three races and having a shot to move on.   We did a test at Charlotte, RCR has helped us get a new car ready for next week, so we've got to be ready to go.   We're at least in it, so we've got a shot at it.
