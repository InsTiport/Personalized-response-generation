Q. One spot away from that 100th magical Wood Brothers win, but this is the type of day you dreamed of when you took over the iconic 21?
MATT DIBENEDETTO: It was, man. This is all just too surreal. Tough to be that close, but, hey, this is only the second race of the season. So it was the strength of this team. It's so cool to have the backing of all the people that allow me to drive this thing. It took so many people, Motorcraft, Quick Lane. 
To be driving this iconic car is so cool, Menards and Paul, I know you're watching at home and proud and I can't thank everyone in that whole family for this opportunity for it. 
Power under the hood is always good. I'm proud to have that Roush Yates power under the hood. This whole team, Greg Irwin, all of them, we were covered. It wasn't pretty at the start, but, man, they did an excellent job. So happy to be working with this team, the fans. Thank you all so much. The journey has been pretty cool.
