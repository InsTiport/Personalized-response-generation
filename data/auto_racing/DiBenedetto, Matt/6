Q. Matt finishes second. What is going through your head right now? 
MATT DIBENEDETTO: I don't know. So much. I wanted to win so bad for these guys, for this team, for them giving me this opportunity. I'm just thankful that they gave me this opportunity, Toyota, Procore, Dumont Jets. I'm so thankful. 
But, man, I'm sad. We got tight after the deal with Newman when he came up into us. All of a sudden it got really tight after that. 
Congrats to Denny. He raced hard. I've been a fan of his since I was a kid. To be racing door‑to‑door with him at Bristol, in front of a great group of fans... 
I'll try not to get emotional, but it's been a tough week. I just want to stick around and keep doing this for a long time to come. I love it. I love the opportunity. I'm not done yet. 
Something will come open. It's going to happen. I'm here to win. Something's going to come open. I'm proud of these guys. Thankful for my wife and fans for sticking with me. It's been a tough journey, a hard week. Cool for this team.
