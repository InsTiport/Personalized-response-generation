 Q.   What did you learn in your session?  
BRAD KESELOWSKI:   I don't know if we learned anything.   We were going over what we could have done differently.   I don't know if there was anything.   
You lose kind of your last two or three laps that might be the fastest, so no one was able to get back out because you couldn't get enough speed.   
Just all part of the game.   We did a good job controlling what we could control.   All three cars are close to making it to the next round, but I wouldn't put any guarantees on it.
