  THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by our second‑place finisher Brad Keselowski, driver of the No.2 Miller Lite Ford for Team Penske. This matches his best All‑Star finish. He finished second in 2002. Brad, congrats on a great finish. Talk a little bit about your race out there tonight. 
BRAD KESELOWSKI: Yeah. I guess a decent night but not the great night we wanted with the Miller Lite Ford, ending up second. Really happy for my teammate Joey Logano. He did exactly what you would expect out of an All‑Star Race format and made an incredible pass to win the race. Happy for Team Penske as a whole, but of course wish it was me in victory lane. 

Q. Brad, you're kind of credited for this format, and through many of the segments, drivers were saying that they were confused, they didn't know what was going on. Did it play out the way you thought it would, and would you change anything? 
BRAD KESELOWSKI: I mean, there was a last‑‑ or next to last lap pass for the lead. There were several passes for the lead. The last four races, there hasn't been a pass for the lead in the last 20 or 30 laps. I think our fans deserve a better format than that, and they got that today. 
I don't know how you can get much more compelling racing than what we saw today, so they need to get unconfused and enjoy the racing. 

Q. The rule changes this week, did that help the racing? 
BRAD KESELOWSKI: Absolutely. I thought it was certainly key to making the cars have more fall‑off and open up more passing opportunities, so yeah, I think that was a pretty big positive for here.

Q. Will the 600 be as good? 
BRAD KESELOWSKI: I don't know what the rules are for the 600, if they're going to use this package or not. I think it'll be better if they use this one. 
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Brad.
