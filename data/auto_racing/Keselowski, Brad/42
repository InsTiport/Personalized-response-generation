  THE MODERATOR: If I could have your attention here in the deadline room and in the media center, we will now start today's post‑race media availability for the Toyota/SaveMart 350, and we're joined by Brad Keselowski, driver of the No.2 Ford for Team Penske, and Brad, wild race out there, really long green flag run to end that race. Boy, you have to feel exhausted after a run like that. 
BRAD KESELOWSKI: It was fun. We had a really fast Elite Support Freightliner Ford, and man, when you have a car that great, you just‑‑ you really enjoy every moment of it, and today was a day I really enjoyed. I had the slip‑up there and got into Clint and that really stank, but other than that, just an incredible race car, and really a pleasure to drive. 

Q. We kept hearing how bad the tires were. How bad were they to drive on? 
BRAD KESELOWSKI: It was tough, but this is the big leagues. It's not supposed to be easy to drive. The cars are incredibly difficult to drive, but that's part of what makes it fun and I think exactly the way it should be. 

Q. Was there ever a time in there with the strategy‑‑ I was a little worried there with that little bit of strategy. How did you beat that because it looked like it was putting you behind a bit? 
BRAD KESELOWSKI: Yeah, it looked like it was putting us behind, but we had such a great long‑run car that it played back out for us, which was great. In fact, I think we were hoping to catch a yellow and didn't catch it. If we would have, I think that would have been the race‑winning move. But still, all in all, a great day for us. 
THE MODERATOR: Brad, good luck on your flight. We'll see you next week.
