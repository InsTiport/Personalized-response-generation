Q. Brad Keselowski, led 40 laps today. Early on we weren't sure what was going on with you. All of a sudden you guys made the adjustments and brought it home. What did it take to change things around?
BRAD KESELOWSKI: We were a little off really all day. We got a lot better from the first run till the end. We were so strong in practice. The track changing kind of threw us for a loop with the wind. Just never could get right off of turn two. Ended up kind of costing us the race there with the 22. I couldn't stay in front. 
But the team, Team Penske, the Wurth Ford Mustang, these guys worked really hard on this car to get it back. I brushed the wall a little bit earlier, they fixed it, got us back. They kept working on it and still had a solid day.
