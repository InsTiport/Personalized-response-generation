 Q. I'm so impressed that you are such a student of this sport, and when you get passed for the lead, you go to school. What did you learn running second there?   
BRAD KESELOWSKI: Well, I ain't gonna tell you what I did learn, but I'll tell you who I learned it from: Mark Martin. He used to be the best at that, and I follow him too much on Twitter. So I give Mark a lot of credit.   
But Chase I think was just a little bit faster than us all race long, at least on the short run, and when it came down to it, not a super short run but kind of I would say a half a run or at best at the end, and I knew I had to be a little bit better to beat him. He was certainly faster on that short run, and when he passed me I learned just enough, and the pit crew got me back in front of him on the next‑to‑last pit stop, and I seemed to kind of apply the lessons.
