Q.   Greg Biffle is in, but by a pretty slim margin, 19th place, two laps down, and we know that's not the way you want to do it.   Describe your evening. 
GREG BIFFLE:   I'll tell you what, it's got to be the toughest race of my life.   Man, I drove so hard, and we just missed the setup.   It was clear that our whole company did, Carl and Ricky and myself.   We were way off tonight, which is frustrating because five top 10s in a row put us in this position, but tonight was not pretty.   I drove as hard as I could, and it was enough to get us in.   I knew I needed to be in the top 20, and like I said, it was all I could do. 

Q.   What can you do now?   I heard you mention on the way in, maybe you should have been better in practice, better feedback, that kind of thing.   Is that what you're going to focus on? 
GREG BIFFLE:   All we can do is look at practice.   We know that practice, we've got to get our cars right, and maybe we weren't right leaving the shop, but we tested Chicago, we're excited about the first Chase race, but this was a little bit of a kick to us.   Five top 10s and then finished 19th.   That was rough, and there's some short tracks in the Chase, short tracks like Dover and Martinsville, Phoenix, so we'll have to go back and look at what we did wrong.   43 car ran good, which is an ally of ours, they use our equipment, so we'll look at what they did and try Monday to go through what we did wrong and get ready for the Chase.
