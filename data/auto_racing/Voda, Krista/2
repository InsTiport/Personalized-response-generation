  KRISTA VODA: No one knew Chris Economaki better than his colleague at CBS Sports, Ned Jarrett.   Tell us a little bit about Chris, obviously a power of words but a way with people, as well. 
NED JARRETT:   Oh, no question about it.   It didn't matter where they came from, how long they'd been racing, how successful they'd been.   He knew something about them and he could always put in the right words at the right time.   He was such an inspiration to be around, I'm proud to have had some time with him with CBS and just a great guy and certainly deserving of this order. 
KRISTA VODA: In a world of iPads and Eâ€‘readers it's so nice to see him punching away in that picture on his Royal Typewriter. 
NED JARRETT:   He never quit.   I can't believe the energy he had.   When he would leave the racetrack he'd go to the hotel or motel and work until midnight to get ready for the next day.   He was just such an inspiration to a lot of people.
