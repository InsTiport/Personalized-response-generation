 Q.   Junior, you were behind the 15.   What did you see?   
DALE EARNHARDT JR.:   He just spun right out.   That's the craziest thing I ever saw.   He just came right around.   He got‑‑ we were going into, through 3 and 4, and I don't know if they can put up his brakes and his gas.   We got all the technology.   But he was hemming around on the brakes and jerking the car around, and then the thing just spun out.   It was crazy.   I don't know what was going on.   It was right there, I almost run into it, so I'm glad we were able to get out of there without any trouble.  
   
 Q.   Sixth time you are in the Chase.   How close are you and Steve Letarte to getting into victory lane and being a real factor to win this championship?  
DALE EARNHARDT JR.:   You know, I don't think a lot of people were counting us as one of the favorites, so last year we were definitely putting up the kind of numbers where I think we were in that conversation.   Maybe not this year.   We've had a lot of races that we haven't been able to finish, but we've had fast cars, and I'm real confident in our ability to perform well enough in these 10 races.   We're going to work real hard.   I think we've got as good a shot as anybody, so we're going to go in there with a good attitude and work real hard and see what we get.
