 Q.   Based on your run tonight how do you feel about the strength of your race team right now?  
DALE EARNHARDT JR.:   Man, I wouldn't want to base it on tonight's running.   I was pretty disappointed.   Man, we ran hard, just sitting there behind these guys in front of me with 20 laps to go, and they were junk, fighting over 11th spot, and it was frustrating not to be able to get up there and do anything with them.   We were off, too.   Just couldn't get any power down.   I don't think it's reflective of how strong our team is.   I think we are a real good team going into Chicago, a completely different racetrack.   Got a lot of confidence.   We're going to spend this whole week in meetings with engineers and crew chiefs and everything and try to prepare as good as we can and try to get our minds right and ready for this Chase.   It's going to be a completely different atmosphere than what we've done in the regular season.   We've been locked in and really on a holiday for 20 weeks or so since we've been locked in, so it's time to get serious and get down to business, and we've got to get our heads straight and get ready.
