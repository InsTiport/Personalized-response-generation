Q.   After all you've been through the last couple years it's my pleasure to be among the first to welcome you back to the Chase.   What does this mean to you?
KURT BUSCH:   Thanks.   It's been a journey.   It's been a great ride of trying to persevere and going up against the odds when certain things are against you that are out of your control and sometimes you induce things that put you in a position where you have to dig hard and keep working.   This shows to people that when you can just pull through and believe in yourself and find good people like Patricia and little Houston, he said he wanted to go to victory lane this summer and I didn't get him to victory lane yet, but we're going to celebrate on the Chase stage.   I'm getting all emotional about the eight year old hanging out with me. 
But to make the Chase with these guys is an unbelievable feeling.   It's been an 18‑month work in progress, and I've been through a lot, and I've learned a lot, and I feel like I'm better ready for the Chase and life in general as a 35 year old. 
I've got a little one that's in a go‑kart looking up to me now.   Just these guys, it's an unbelievable feeling; Barney Visser started this in Colorado years ago, and here we are in the Chase.   You get a guy like Todd Berrier that comes in and helps arrange things, starts cutting weight out of cars and knows his way around the garage, he's a veteran leader, and I've always loved veterans and car guys.   Todd Berrier reminds me a lot of Jimmy Fennig, who's a guy that helped me win a championship years ago.   We've got some muscle in us.   We haven't won a race yet this year, but we're in the Chase, and we've got a good 10 weeks ahead of us where we can do some good things.
