Q. Thirdâplace finish for Kurt Busch today. Got to be pleased with that. 
KURT BUSCH: Yeah, really happy. All weekend the car just had a good vibe to it, the way it unloaded and the way we made small changes on our Monster Energy Chevy, I was really proud of this effort. To race and to do different things in the draft and to be able to gain speed with cars on the straightaway and then once you get all by yourself you actually lose speed, it's a whole type of different racing, and I'm glad that I had a good car to do it all with, and just thanks to my guys. I messed up on a pit cue, but to have a thirdâplace run right here in Monster Energy's back yard, this was a solid run for our Chevy.
