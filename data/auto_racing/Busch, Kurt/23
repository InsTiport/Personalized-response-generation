Q.   What kind of pressure does this mean for Thursday?
KURT BUSCH:   I'd like to talk about all the hard work and time and effort that goes into building a Sprint Cup car to qualify at the Daytona 500. 
We're a lot of smart people here.   There's drivers, owners, NASCAR.   We got to find a better system.   So much hard work goes into these cars, then you have this roulette wheel for qualifying.   It doesn't seem the proper system. 
But, hey, it is what it is.   We could be here smiling, getting belted up, going back out for the second round. 
Just want to thank all my guys for all their work, all of our sponsors.   We should just take the cars as we build them in the off‑season, unload, pass tech, then go qualify one car at a time, four‑lap average.   That would really give a sense of pride to putting effort towards building a car to qualify for the Daytona 500 instead of shaking up bingo balls.
