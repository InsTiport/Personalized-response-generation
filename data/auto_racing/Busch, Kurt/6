Q. What an incredible scene. Kurt Busch, absolutely exhausted. I'm not sure if that's from the win or from the celebration or the battle to get the win. Wow, Kurt, walk me through that final restart and passing your brother for the win. 
KURT BUSCH: Hell yeah! Hell yeah! 

Q. I think the fans like that, Kurt. 
KURT BUSCH: You know, racing your little brother every week and watching him win a lot, I'm proud of him, but I'm proud of him he gave me a little bit of room on that outside. He could have clobbered us against the wall, and third place probably would have got it. What an awesome run. We got this Monster Chevy to Victory Lane. Thank you, Kentucky! 

Q. So is this redemption for last week? I know you were so mad when all that went down with the lightning of all things that cost you the win. A little redemption for this team? 
KURT BUSCH: Well, we got a yellow at the end that put us back in position. Whatever last week was, it's this week right now, and we've got the trophy. Woohoo! 

Q. Your crew chief Matt McCall, first ever win for him.
KURT BUSCH: A lot of good first wins with this group of guys. I'm really proud of them. You know, the way that we came together early and had speed, we just weren't completing all the little steps that it took to be a winner in the Monster Energy Cup Series. Now we're all winners.
