Q. It was a strong day for Kurt Busch, starting 27th. You never gave up. Then the restart right next to your brother. Take us through the race. 
KURT BUSCH: It was tough battling our No.1 Chevy, the Monster Energy team is doing a good job. That one is tough. I really wanted to beat him. I was going to wreck him. I wanted to stay close enough so when we took the exit I was going to drive straight into three and four. 
He already won. Figure he could give a little love to his brother. I wanted that one bad. I feel like him right now, I'm all mad because I didn't win. 
This car, we were struggling on qualifying, we struggle on taking off. I just can't get that right rear to grip till it gets heat in it. It's hard to be patient when you're running for the win on old tires. 
I'm happy that we were in position to do it. This group of guys, we're not quite ready to win yet, but that was close. I was going to wreck my little brother to win today. With three laps to go, stepped out in turn one, and I wasn't close enough after that. 
But thanks to Matt McCall and everybody at Ganassi. This No.1 Monster Energy Chevy is fast.
