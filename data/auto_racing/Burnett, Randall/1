Q. It's the second championship for Tyler Reddick but a first here for crew chief Randall Burnett. What did you think of the moves that he made there to take the lead in this one? 
RANDALL BURNETT: That was amazing, man. To have Cole and Tyler and even Christopher before he had his little bit of trouble there, that's what this championship weekend is about. I'm just glad we came out on top. So blessed to be here. So thankful for this team. All of our supporters, Tame the Beast, Pinnacle, Blue, everybody that's on this car, man, it is unbelievable. I just can't thank them enough. Can't thank the guys at the shop, Jake Warren, Marty Houston and everybody at the shop, man, that puts their life and soul into this deal, this is an amazing team. Best team I've ever been a part of, amazing group of guys, and amazing driver, too, man.
