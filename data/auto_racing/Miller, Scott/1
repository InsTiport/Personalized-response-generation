  THE MODERATOR: We are going to bring in Scott Miller, our senior vice president of competition. We received some questions on the last lap, he will take a few questions to clarify. 

Q. Can you explain the no call on Denny, the call on DiBenedetto and Elliott at the end of the race?
SCOTT MILLER: It was pretty clearâcut. The 21 hung a left, drove those guys down below the line. We called that twice on the 22 car during the race, so nothing different there. 
On the 24 and the 11 being down there, I mean, in our judgment they were down there to avoid a wreck. On the 9, I mean, he obviously just pulled out and passed underneath the yellow line. 
I think all of it was, from our vantage point, I think fairly clearâcut. 

Q. Would there be any consideration to eliminating this rule, maybe for the final lap?
SCOTT MILLER: I think you heard Erik say in the previous interview there would probably be even more wrecks. We certainly don't need more wrecks than what we saw today. Probably not. 

Q. Is there much more that can be done in terms of the rule? You explain it in the drivers meeting. You had to penalize multiple people today. Are you bothered you had to make this call this many times?
SCOTT MILLER: Yeah, I mean, outside of putting a wall there, I don't really know what more we can do. I do sincerely believe we need the rule. You see all the real estate that's around here. If we started having cars running 12 wide down the back straightaway, imagine what would happen when you get to turn three. 
I think it's important that we continue to have a rule. You get out there in the heat of battle, things happen. It's hard when there's all that real estate down there, but you just can't do it. 
I don't think that we can eliminate it. I think it would be a mess. We kind of are where we are. 

Q. Where did you view the 17 in all this? Was he one trying to avoid the wreck? He may have forced the 11 down. 
SCOTT MILLER: I mean, we saw sparks flying and everybody trying to avoid the mess that the 21 created. We didn't even consider much about the 17. 
THE MODERATOR: Scott, thank you for taking the time to clarify for us. 
SCOTT MILLER: Thank you.
