 Q. Chris Buescher, a careerâbest finish in the Daytona 500. I know that's not your concern right now. Talk me through the last lap from your view.   
CHRIS BUESCHER: Yeah, we're hoping Ryan is okay at this point. Very wild last lap and proud of our Fastenal Ford Mustang group. Had a fun race all the way up to that last point, and really thought they had it, him and the 12 tandeming there through the backstretch. Wish I could have got in line, but without any real help behind us, was kind of pulled away and had that gap. The 11 was able to fill it there, and I don't think if it would have been for that if we could have gotten three Fords in a line, I don't think we would have had much to worry about. Obviously trying to do everything you can to push, and it's kind of part of it. Really just hoping Ryan is okay at this point. Wishing him the best.
