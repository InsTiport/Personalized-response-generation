   KERRY THARP:  We'll start with our post-race media availability.  We've got two of our drivers in here.  We've got our third place finisher in the race and that's David Ragan, career best third, driver of the No. 6AAA Ford and one of our Chase drivers, Kevin Harvick, came in 12th in points and he'll be seeded 11th as we begin the 2007 Chase for the NASCAR Nextel Cup 
 David, your thoughts on your career-best performance tonight at the Chevy Rock and Roll 400.  
 DAVID RAGAN:  It's a good, solid night it.  Takes a lot more than a fast race car to finish well in the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup races.  We were good on restarts, we were good on the long runs.  We got shuffled back to 20th and we were able to drive our way back up to the front.  It's a lot of fun and certainly enjoyed it.  Our car was pretty good all night and all weekend.  We had a lot of fun and it was certainly, you know, deserving for the team and all just to have a good night.  

 Q.  How mindful do you have to be of what all went on around you with all of this Chase stuff?  Do you have to pay attention to all of the stuff going on around you?  
 DAVID RAGAN:  Yeah, that's certainly something talked about during the race.  We don't want to be the bad guy to jeopardize someone else's year or making the Chase.  So we tried to be a little careful or just acknowledge the guys we were racing around and certainly there at the end, the last 50 laps, when you're around guys like the 8 and the 2 and the 24, you certainly don't want to do anything to jeopardize their runs.  
 So, yeah, you do pay a little more attention to that, certainly the last ten races of the year, I'm sure we'll keep that in the back of our minds.  
 KERRY THARP:  David, congratulations on a good run tonight.
