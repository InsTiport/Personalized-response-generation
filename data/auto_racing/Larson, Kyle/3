Q. Here he comes now, the winner of today's race Kyle Larson to the cheers of a lot of folks here in Victory Lane, including that crew that got him here. I think if you look way, way over there you can see Martinsville from here, Kyle. What is it like knowing you're locked in? 
KYLE LARSON: Well, it will be nice to win before I have to win Martinsville, or Martinsville might even be the first raceââ

Q. First race of that round, yeah. 
KYLE LARSON: Well, that stinks, but yeah, just awesome to get a win and not have to worry about Talladega next week. It'sââ I don't like that place (chuckles), so it's pretty neat to do what we did today, to dominate that whole second half there. The pit crew did a great job to get us out as the leader and kind of control the race from there. Just hats off to everybody back here. This is awesome. It's been a long time since we won a pointsâbased race. We won the AllâStar Race earlier this year, which was great, but we wanted to win a points race, and we did it when it mattered. 
It's going to be nice to not necessarily relax these next two but not have to worry about Talladega quite as much. There's still two more opportunities to get stage points, get a win, but yeah, no, this is sweet.
