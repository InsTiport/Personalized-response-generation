Q. Kyle Larson smokes out the crowd, everybody is on their feet. Kyle, it's been a long time for you to get to Victory Lane. It's been a tough year. You finally made it happen, but on top of that, you won a million dollars. What are you going to do with it?
KYLE LARSON: Oh, I don't know. I don't know. I didn't really have many plans set out. This is unbelievable. This whole day was up and down from the be main (phonetic) we were in to getting a little bit of damage, having to repair the car, had some great restarts there the last few, and Harvick gave me a heck of a push to get to the lead from the third row, and that was huge. Then again to get by the 18 that final restart, just had to guess kind of what he was going to do behind me and try and take his air away. The 18 surprised me how good he was. But man, this is amazing. I've been close a couple times. I feel like every time I've been in the Allâ€‘Star Race I've been close to winning, so it's neat to finally close it out. Thanks to Advent Health, CreditOne Bank, McDonald's, everybody who helps out on this Chip Ganassi Racing team, everybody back at the shop. There's a lot of people from the shop here today, so we get to do some celebrating. I'm excited about that.
