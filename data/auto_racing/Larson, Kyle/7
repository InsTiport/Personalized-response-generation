 Q. Second place for Kyle Larson, leading 44 laps tonight, and man, you had control of the race at times, but what was the thing you needed at the end to be able to get the 20 there?   
KYLE LARSON: Erik did a good job on that last restart to get by me, and I was better than him all throughout that run. It's just I couldn't ever do anything with him just because the dirty air was really bad. Woreâ€‘out surface and the groove is already narrow, and it was just extra difficult. I felt like both 18 and I were a little bit better than he was at the end, but couldn't do nothing with him.   
That part it was frustrating, but still good to have a good run, good day for our Clover Chip Ganassi Racing team. Led some laps and was able to challenge a little bit there at the end. Wish we could have got it done, but coming away with another top 3 at the Southern 500 is not too bad.  
   
 Q. Big news: You're locked in; does that make you breathe a little easier heading to Indianapolis next week?   
KYLE LARSON: I guess. I don't know, I felt like we were going to have a good shot to make it after the last few weeks we've had. Would have been nice to get a win today, but yeah, good to be locked in and look ahead to the playoffs. We've been running really strong here lately, so just got to keep it going.
