  MODERATOR:   We'll go on ahead and get started with our post‑race interview here at following the 55th annual Oral‑B USA 500. 
We're now joined by Kyle Larson, driver of the number 42 Target Chevrolet.   Our highest finishing rookie tonight with an 8th place finish.   Kyle, talk a little bit about your run out there tonight. 
KYLE LARSON:   Yeah, it was a tough race.   The first corner or so I felt pretty good.   For whatever reason, we got pretty tight in the center and I couldn't roll the bottom like I wanted to.   Really couldn't go anywhere. 
I lost a ton of track position.   And we got the car better.   Couple times we got caught on pit road when the caution fell, so we had to do the wave around and restart behind all the lap down cars. 
That kind of worked out to where at the end where we are the green‑white‑checkered and the Target Chevy felt pretty good through the green‑white‑checkered.   Just had to start pretty far back. 
But Top‑10 is not bad.   Doesn't really matter any more because Kasey won. 
So happy for Kasey, but that pretty much ends our Chase hopes.   Unless we win. 
MODERATOR:   We'll open it up for questions for Kyle. 

Q.   Obviously another big story this weekend was Tony's return.   Your thoughts on seeing him back out there.   It wasn't the finish he wanted.   But what's your thoughts on seeing the 14 back out there with him behind the wheel
KYLE LARSON:   I thought he was pretty strong all weekend.   It was cool to see Tony on the track.   He was really fast and then I think he had some tire issues or something there at the mid point of the race. 
But, yeah it was nice having Tony back out here.   He's a tough competitor and really fun to race with. 
THE MODERATOR:   Kyle, thank you very much for your time tonight.   We'll see you next week end.
