Q. Kyle Larson, ready for his first Chase. I want to start with the race at the end there. What a fun thing it must have been to come from behind with the tires and almost win this thing. 
KYLE LARSON: It felt like a video game on rookie mode, having fresh tires like that. That was fun. Our Target car was probably a eighth to tenth car most of the race. I was really good on short runs. I could pass a few cars every restart which really helped us. It seemed like we could never get the race going there at the end of the race, which helped us. Fun, fun last restart, get all the way to second. I thought I could get to fourth, but second was a little bit better, so that was great. I had a blast there during the last couple laps.

Q. Obviously your Michigan win puts you in the Chase, but it's the first time a Ganassi driver has entered the Chase with a victory, not just on points. What are your expectations starting the first round?
KYLE LARSON: Yeah, you know, the Chase tracks, most of them are good tracks for me, so starting off in Chicago, that's one of my favorite tracks to go to. I really think we can go there and have a strong run. The way we've been rolling lately, hopefully we can get another top three. I think this is our third week in a row of top threes. It's been awesome. Looking forward to it. First time in the Chase. There's a lot of new guys in the Chase, so should be pretty exciting.
