 Q. Kyle, we had fun with the whole luck thing coming into it. Finally you delivered. Describe your day overall.   
KYLE LARSON: It was solid. I thought we ran inside the top five all race long. Fought tight early on. Freed it up. That's where I feel like I was pretty good.   
The last run there after cycling through green flag stops, I was really loose. Got stuck in traffic. Was just looser in dirty air. Just made my tires pissed off. Had to just make sure I hit the bottom lap after lap to hold Harvick off.   
Yeah, it was good to finally have a clean race. I don't think we've had a clean weekend all year long. I don't know, what are we, 11 or 12 weeks into the season. It's good to finally get a clean day, like I said. Thanks to our race team. Our pit crew did a good job today, as well.   
Nice day.
