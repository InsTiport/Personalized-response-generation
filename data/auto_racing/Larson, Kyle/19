  THE MODERATOR: We are joined by our secondâ€‘place finisher, Kyle Larson, driver of the No.42 McDonald's Chevrolet. Kyle, just oh, so close. Why don't you take us through that battle there with the 18 at the end. 
KYLE LARSON: Yeah, I was just checked out there that long run. It was really, really good there, and was just hoping it would go green until the end, and then we pitted, and I was actually fine with that, too, because I knew we'd leave as the leader and restart on the outside. I just didn't expect to get that loose that run there. The 17 almost got by me, was able to hold him off. I thought the grip was getting better, which it did a little bit, but not nearly good enough. 
Not sure if the track changed a lot there or what, but I lost the balance on the car.

Q. I know you mentioned you got really loose at the end there. After Kyle bumped you. Did you think you were going to be able to get back to him, or how was the feeling of the car after he bumped you?
KYLE LARSON: I knew it would be hard to get back to him. I knew I would need a lapper to kind of hold him up on exit and kill his momentum to allow me to maybe get back to his bumper, but there just weren't a whole lot of cars left out there.
