Q. Kyle Larson finishes third, and I say that kind of smiling because we were just both saying, where did that come from?
KYLE LARSON: Yeah, the last thing I knew I was running like ninth and I passed a couple guys, but so yeah, I guess more people ran out of fuel than I thought. I don't really know what happened there. But yeah, it worked out. That was a great point saver, well above the cut line now, so happy about that. Our McDonald's Chevy handled really well today when we had four tires on it. When we would do two rights, I'd be way too tight, and then we'd put two lefts on and I was way too loose, but then that finally balanced out and I was back to being good, and running really fast laps at the end. 
Passed what felt like the most people today, so happy about that. 
But yeah, we're getting a little bit better. I feel like our cars are good. I feel like for intermediate style kind of racing, Michigan would probably be our worst track right now as far as just speed, so I'm excited now for the rest of the season.

Q. You guys had a lot of bad luck to start the season. Does it feel like things are turning around and right in time for the Playoffs? 
KYLE LARSON: Yeah, definitely. I feel like we've been showing a lot of speed here the last two to two and a half months now, so we contended for a win in Chicago and have had some good runs since then. Some mistakes on my part to run backup cars, but all in all we've done a good job to bring fast race cars to the track every week. Just says a lot about our team and fighting through the season, and yeah, it's a good time of year to get the speed and get some rhythm, so hopefully we can keep it going.
