 Q. What a time to end a twoâyear winless streak for Kyle Larson. I think Chad Johnston put it best; you won one when it counted. How critical was this win for the 42 team, Kyle?   
KYLE LARSON: It's really critical. Everybody in this playoff field is going to be stressing next week at Talladega except for me, so that's good. You know, last time I was at Talladega I was on my lid, and I mean, I could still end up on my lid next week, but it's not going to matter after this win. What a day. This Clover Chevy was really good. After the first stage I kind of changed my driving style up and I felt like I made the car better at the same time, and it really benefitted our long runs. That's as good as I've ever been around cutting the bottom here. Just a great combination here. Good to be fast in practice and then be good again in the race and get the win.   
Can't thank all you fans enough for coming out (cheers and applause). This cool weather was nice for a change. This is unbelievable. I've always wanted to win a Cup race here. I've been close a number of times, so to get a Golden Monster is going to be pretty sweet.   
   
 Q. The biggest win of your career maybe, Kyle?   
KYLE LARSON: A million dollars earlier this year was pretty nice, but to win a playoff race, my first playoff victory is special. I hope there's another win in our future, especially in the next round. We'll see what we can do. I've kept saying that I felt really close to winning here or anywhere right now. Our pit crew has been doing a better job, our team has been doing a better job. I've been doing a better job. So just gotta keep it going now.
