  THE MODERATOR: If I can have your attention here in the media center, we will now roll into our post‑race media availability for today's AAA 400 Drive For Autism in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, and we're joined by today's runner‑up finisher, Kyle Larson, driver of the No.42 Target Chevrolet for Chip Ganassi Racing. Kyle, great run out there again today; wild restart. Could you please walk us through that final restart from your perspective? 
KYLE LARSON: Yeah, you know, it was a good race for us. Obviously I didn't need that last caution. Yeah, I mean, Jimmie is the best of our time, probably the best of all time. He just has obviously a lot more experience than I do out on the front row late in races and executed a lot better than I did. I've got to get better at that and maybe get some more wins. 

Q. Kyle, did you notice anything in the outside groove there on that last lap? Was it cleaned at all? Looked like you were running through a bunch of Speedy‑Dry there. 
KYLE LARSON: I mean, it didn't matter for me. He was already clear of me by the time he got to Turn 1. I mean, I got loose off of 2, but I was also trying to run really hard, so I don't know if the Speedy‑Dry affected me or not. He already had me beat by the time he got to 1. 

Q. Kyle, I just wanted to see if you would walk through the contact that you had with the 78 a couple times during the race. Is everything okay? 
KYLE LARSON: Yeah. Yeah, it's fine. I was on two tires I think at that point, and I was just trying to fight him off as good as I could, and his patience probably ran out with me and shoved me into 3. I almost got in the wall but was able to stay out of it. Yeah, we were just racing hard. We're race car drivers, so that's what we're supposed to do. Always enjoy racing him. He was really, really fast the first half of the race, and I was just racing him hard to try and hold him off. 

Q. Kyle, you led a career high in laps led. Is this the biggest disappointment of your career? 
KYLE LARSON: That's a dumb question. No. No, I mean, I've had bigger disappointing races, I guess. I don't know, I mean, it's disappointing that I didn't win, but it's also a positive that we led more than half the race and held off guys on four tires when we had two, and we were at a disadvantage a lot of the times and I was able to hold people off. So I'm disappointed that I didn't win, but I'm proud of the effort that our team put in and proud of myself for the effort I put in most of the race. Just, yeah, just got to get better.

Q. Would you say this is the best car you've ever had? 
KYLE LARSON: At Dover for sure. I'd say the best car I've ever had was Fontana when I won. Yeah, I mean, this was close to it. Yeah, this place is hard. I don't think you ever really feel perfect here. 
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by today's third‑place finisher, Martin Truex Jr., driver of the No.78 Furniture Row Racing Toyota, and Martin, you had a strong car out there again today, a wild restart there at the finish; would you please walk us through the end of the race from your perspective? 
MARTIN TRUEX JR.: Well, for us the ending of the race was really all about trying to pass cars and get back to the front where we'd been all day long. We got caught on that caution there with, I don't know, 60 or so laps to go and we pitted. Caution came out, got trapped a lap down, had to do the wave‑around and then drive up through the field from the back. 
Definitely proud of our finish today. I thought we definitely had a shot at the win until that happened, and after that it was just‑‑ we were kind of playing catch‑up. At a place that's really difficult to pass, we had to come from about 15th to get to third. Definitely proud of the run, proud of the effort and the car the guys brought here today. Wish we could have had a little better shot at it towards the end there, but all in all, third is a decent day with two stage wins.
