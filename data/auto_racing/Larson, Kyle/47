 Q. Another driver that was trying to win his way into the Chase was Kyle Larson. You knew it would take a win tonight for the 42 team. How was your night overall?  
KYLE LARSON: We ran about where we typically do here at Richmond, which is right around the top 10. Was able to drive up to fifth at one point in time and kind of hold that for a while, which I thought was good, but I just wasn't very good throughout our run but especially the long runs, and I don't think anybody was beating Matt Kenseth tonight. He was super fast. Disappointing run for the Chase. I think everybody on our team thought the 42 would definitely be in the Chase to start the season the way we ended last year, but it wasn't the case this season, so we'll work hard the last 10 races to try and run strong for Target, get them a win and just work on being consistent. That's where we've struggled pretty much all year long was being consistent, so we'll try and work hard at that and try and finish strong.
