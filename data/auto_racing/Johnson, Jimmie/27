 Q. Pretty wild night for Jimmie Johnson, penalties, you got into the fence a couple times. How did you manage this 11thâ€‘place finish?  
JIMMIE JOHNSON: We just kept fighting, kept digging. Eventually everybody hit something or someone or a wall, and there was 40 damaged race cars out there slipping and sliding around. A long night for sure. Disappointed in the way we started the race, but very proud of everybody keeping their cool on the Lowe's 48 race car Chevrolet and making the most out of a tough day. Finished 11th, which is okay. Just a wild night with plenty to talk about I'm sure.  
   
 Q. In talking with your team earlier today, they said the goal was just to come away with a nice clean race, which obviously didn't happen. How do you start off the Chase on the right foot?  
JIMMIE JOHNSON: We had a decent result, definitely not a clean race, but I don't think anybody did. I don't think anybody did. We've got to get better. There's no doubt about it. Inside of our walls at Hendrick Motorsports we know we're getting better, we know we're bringing a better product to the track. We're showing it at times, we've just got to show it consistently and finish in the top 5 consistently, and that will lead to opportunities to win, and hopefully the big trophy at the end of the year.
