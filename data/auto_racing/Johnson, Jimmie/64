 Q.   Jimmie, a lot of people wonder where is the team right now after another bad finish tonight.   
JIMMIE JOHNSON:   Yeah, it was definitely a bad run tonight.   When I look at the Chase and the tracks that are in the Chase, those are tracks that we're really good at historically, and when I look at August, August is normally tough on the 48, and this year it was once again.   I think the big tracks we have plenty of speed.   Some of the shorter tracks we're off.   The big tracks leading into the Chase we had speed but had some issues, mechanical with the engine and then blew a tire at Pocono.   
So I'm not pleased with where we're at, but I'm still very confident and feel that going into the Chase it's a clean sheet of paper for everybody, and we're going to be where we need to.   People can speculate and wonder all week long, but I really look forward to getting to Chicago and showing people what this team has in it.
