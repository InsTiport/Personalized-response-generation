 Q.   When was the last time you had a car that dominant at a plate race?   
JIMMIE JOHNSON:   Oh, man, it's tough to do at a plate track, especially with how tight the rules are.   I think I showed strength early and a lot of guys were willing to work with me and kind of help me through situations, which was great.   I don't know if I really made a bad move tonight, so I'm pretty proud of that.   
Had a great horse to ride, got White Lightning in Victory Lane, I was very proud of.   I want to thank Lowe's and all of the employees at Lowe's and all their dedication and support of our race team, Chevrolet, Kobalt Tools, Gatorade, Sprint for their support of our series, as well.   
And I want to give my daughter an early birthday wish.   Her birthday is tomorrow, three already, so time is flying, but just an awesome night tonight.   
   
 Q.   First guy in 31 years to win the 500 and the 400 since Bobby Allison.   
JIMMIE JOHNSON:   That's amazing.   Gosh, growing up in Southern California and watching Bobby Allison, and I remember where I was the day Davey passed away.   That's how much the Allison family meant to me.   I always thought it was so great to watch Bobby and Davey race, and to do anything Bobby has done is pretty special.   Very happy tonight.       
   
 Q.   After the last few weeks nice to pay one off in Victory Lane?  
JIMMIE JOHNSON:   Yeah, we've been knocking on the door for, for sure.   It's great to bull ride right into Victory Lane and also want to wish everybody happy 4th of July, thank all the men and women who have fought for our country for independence, and it was fun tonight.
