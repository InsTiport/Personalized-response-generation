Q. Strong day for Alex Bowman, finishing third. Just how good was that 88 car? 
ALEX BOWMAN: Yeah, it was really good. I felt like we struggled a little bit on the short run but really made up for it throughout the middle of the runs. It felt like I had to pass the same guys over and over again after a couple bad restarts and that issue on pit road. But just so proud of my guys for keeping their heads on straight, staying focused on what we needed to stay focused on, and we just got to continue moving forward. 

Q. How was that for you to do, the jack situation, not something in your control. How did you refocus? 
ALEX BOWMAN: Yeah, the fortunate thing was our guys were so fast, we still only lost like two or three spots. You know, we just had to kind of take that time over again to pass some of the same guys, but yeah, at the same time, our race car was so good, it's always fun passing people. 

Q. How do you face Talladega next week? 
ALEX BOWMAN: Man, I don't know. That's a tough one for sure. We've got to go execute and do the best job we can and go from there. You know, this week was really cool with Cincinnati on the car, their first primary race, and we finished third. Next week is going to be a lot of fun, as well, and we've just got to stay out of trouble and make it to the finish there and have a shot at winning it.
