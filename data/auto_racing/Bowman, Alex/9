 Q. A lot of fellas have won a race in the NASCAR Cup Series. Less than 150 in history have ever won two. You have arrived. What's that feel like?   
ALEX BOWMAN: Yeah, I'll take it, man. After last week I wish we had three, but this Cincinnati Camaro was as fast as Xfinity internet, and I just got to thank Axalta, Valvoline, Llumar, Chevygoods.com, everybody that makes this deal possible. We've been so good to start this season. We started the season very poorly really over the last two years, and it just means the world to show up at the racetrack and have the first run on the racetrack really be almost perfect and just be able to really fine tune the race car. Greg Ives has made the right calls. So, we've got to go win a bunch more, but man, it feels good to have one this early.
