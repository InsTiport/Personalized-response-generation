 Q. What an incredible day for Alex Bowman. You are standing here‑‑ how about that, you're standing here in front of these fans as a Cup Series winner. Did you dream this moment would ever happen, Alex?   
ALEX BOWMAN: I mean, it's all I've wanted my whole life. I feel like this is a lot of validation for a lot of people that said we couldn't do this. So proud of everybody at Hendrick Motorsports, AXALTA, the Hendrick engine shop. My guys have worked so hard. We struggled so bad last year and the beginning of this year, and man, I had questions if Mr.H was going to let me keep doing this, everybody, all the rumor mills. But to be here winning a race in the Cup Series means so much. Just couldn't do it without these guys. My pit crew is the best pit crew on pit road, and this is all I've ever wanted.  
   
 Q. Kyle Larson got by you, I see you choking up there. How did you regroup and pass him for the win?   
ALEX BOWMAN: I was just tired of running second. I don't want to do that anymore. I feel like this is the last box, aside from going and chasing a championship, that I needed personally for myself to validate my career. I feel like obviously there's a lot more left to accomplish, but this is always what I hear is you haven't won a race.   
I think even Chad said something about me not winning a race, so Chad Knaus, there, we went and did it. Everybody can stop giving me crap; we finally did it.
