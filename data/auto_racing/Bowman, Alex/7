Q. How about that; no debate on that right rear now. 
ALEX BOWMAN: No, Greg said save it, so I saved some to use some there. But man, how about that, California? I grew up quarterâmidget racing maybe 20 minutes from here, Pomona Valley. Went there every week, made a lot of great friends. I know you guys are here. Man, so cool for Cincinnati. Seems like every time they're on the car we're so good. Promised my buddy Aaron we would all get matching 88 tattoos if we won, and I think I have to go get a tattoo now, but that'll be a good time. It's been a lot of fun. Thanks to Greg, all the guys. He made good calls all day and we were up front when it counted.

Q. This win is huge for so many reasons. The first one is always special, but the second one is a statement because it proves the first one wasn't a fluke, and you guys certainly proved that today, dominating. 
ALEX BOWMAN: Yeah, for sure. I mean, the first one, that was really enjoyable experience, and then we sucked for six months. You know, we started this year so strong. I feel like I've got a lot on my side that I'm doing better. My life is kind of a lot more organized than it was back then, and Greg and all the guys, they're just on point. We've unloaded the last two weeks, I don't think we've had got change in the race car from how it came off the truck. That makes my job a heck of a lot easier. I'm just so proud of this team, Hendrick Motorsports, Hendrick horsepower under the hood, the whole shop back home. They work their butts off. We put a lot of effort into this new car, and it's obviously working well.
