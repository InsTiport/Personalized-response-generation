 Q.  Great execution. Just sticking to the plan?  
ALEX BOWMAN: There was no plan coming off of turn four. Big props to Chevrolet, everybody at Hendrick Motorsports. They brought great racecars here. We had a great Nationwide Chevy from the time we unloaded. Showed a lot of speed.   
We all stuck to our plan and executed really well. Props to everybody back at home at HMS, the fab shop, engine shop, everybody that makes this deal possible.   
   
 Q. If the caution didn't come out, you were going to try to make a move on him?  
ALEX BOWMAN: Yeah, I'm not just going to let him win, right? I got to try. I knew I could get to his quarter panel. I was pretty confident I could get to his quarter panel through the triâ€‘oval. Who knows who is going to get to the line first. At that point I thought I could do it. Depends on the car behind you, where he goes.   
It would have been fun to try, but happy for Chase, Nationwide, everybody that keeps lets us keep doing this thing. I am glad to kind of turn the season around. It has been a rough start to the year. These guys deserve way better than the finishes they've had. To come home second, it's not a win, but headed in the right direction.
