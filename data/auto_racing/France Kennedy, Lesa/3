  LESA FRANCE KENNEDY:     This is a tremendous honor to be here this evening, and what a special event and a grand stage to recognize those who have contributed so much to our sport.   
My grandmother, Gram, Ann B. France, would be so grateful to receive this inaugural Landmark Award for outstanding contributions to NASCAR.   It's the sport that she loved and the sport that she helped create, one that she truly, truly loved.   
I thank you so much on behalf of Ann Bledsoe France, Annie B., as they called her, so many people referred to her as Annie B.   She was the epitome of what this award represents, a great ambassador to our sport and someone who always strived to grow the business.   She did it her way in an honest, often understated and pragmatic fashion.   She was the glue that held NASCAR together in the beginning, and she worked tirelessly to see it succeed.   
Let me share with you a one‑time secret, and it's become pretty well known lately.   She kept two sets of books.   She kept the set of books that were the real set of books for the business, and then she kept the set of books that she shared with my grandfather, Bill France, Sr., just to make sure that he didn't spend us out of business.   I think everybody in this room today should be thankful for that.   
You know, I was fortunate enough to know her and to call her Gram, but NASCAR will always remember her as that strong‑willed, pioneering woman who helped build the foundation of our sport.   Thank you very much.
