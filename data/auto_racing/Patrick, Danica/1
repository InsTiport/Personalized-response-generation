THE MODERATOR: Thank you for coming in, Danica.  We appreciate it.
DANICA PATRICK: I didn't really want to.
THE MODERATOR: Obviously not the result you wanted to do, still much to be proud of this month, and with a tremendous career.  Tell us a little bit about what happened today, but more than that, what this month meant to you and your impressions of the last year.
DANICA PATRICK: The last year?
THE MODERATOR: This year running the double.
DANICA PATRICK: All right.  Let me just talk.
Definitely not a great ending, but I kind of said before I came here that I feel like if it's a complete disaster, 'complete' like as in not in the ballpark at all, look silly, then people might remember that.  If I win, people will remember that.  But probably anything in between might just be a little part of a big story.  So I kind of feel like that's how it is, you know.
I'm appreciative for all the fans, for Go Daddy, for Ed Carpenter Racing for giving me a good car.  Today was a tough day.  A little bit of it was okay, a lot of it was tough to drive.
Take my mic away, I'll leave.  I don't even want to be here because I'm pretty sad.  I guess I'll stop there.
I will say, though, for sure I'm very grateful for everybody and for being able to finish it up like I wanted to.  It still was a lot of great moments this month, a lot of great moments this year.
THE MODERATOR: Questions.
Q. You seemed relaxed before the race.  Did you have a lot of nerves or emotions in the hours leading up?
DANICA PATRICK: Yeah, for sure, I was.  I was definitely nervous.  But I found myself most of the time on the grid feeling confused.  What part of prerace we were in?  I was like, I don't remember this.  Where are the taps?  When is the anthem?  I had all my people around me, so I was in good spirits.
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us.  We appreciate it.
DANICA PATRICK: Thank you, guys.  Appreciate everything.  I'll miss you, most of the time.  Maybe you'll miss me just a little.  Thanks, guys.
