Q. We just saw the celebration with your team, Jeff. Describe what it means to win at Daytona. 
JEFF HENSLEY: Oh, wow, it's huge. I've been lucky enough to win here before. It's been 10 years ago, so it's big. I mean, this race team needed this. We were so consistent last year, and just could not win a race for whatever reason, and we kind of changed our philosophy on what we did as far as stage points and different things and racing to be in position to win, and man, it looked like we were, and then we lost it, and I thought, oh, well, here we go. But grant did a heck of a job getting back to where he needed to be, and you know, hey, we won this thing. We won Daytona.
