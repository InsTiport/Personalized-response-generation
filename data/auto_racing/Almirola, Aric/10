 Q.   Should you change with your strategy?  
ARIC ALMIROLA:   You form a plan, you kind of want to stick to that.   When I left pit road I had a really bad feeling about our position in the pack.   We weren't close enough to the Penske cars to get a good tow off of them.   All the cars were in a place to draft off of us.   My gut was telling me to bail off that plan.   I would have been the bad guy stranding all my teammates out there.   
My car was really fast.   The Ford Fusion is really good.   We'll race really good in the Duels on Thursday and we'll get a better starting spot than 17th.   I really thought I had a shot at a pole, and that's what I'm most disappointed about.
