Q.   You take Richard Petty Motorsports into the Chase.   How special is that to take The King possibly back to a championship stage?
ARIC ALMIROLA:   It's really special.   We've got an opportunity to do that, so really excited about it.   But we don't want to be just happy to be in the Chase.   We want to go and execute for the next 10 weeks, and we're going to have to be flawless.   We know that for the next 10 weeks to have a shot.   But we're up to the challenge.   We've got two good weeks under our belt with topâ€‘10 finishes, and going into the Chase with a lot of momentum I feel like.   I don't feel like we have a lot of pressure.   I feel like we're major underdogs, so we're going to let it all hang out for the next 10 weeks and see what happens.
