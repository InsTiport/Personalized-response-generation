Q.   What goes into all the groups working together?
RICKY STENHOUSE, JR.:   I'm not sure we knew exactly what we were doing.   We had a plan.   I was one of the last cars.   I couldn't get out if I wanted to.   There was really no way around it. 
The Roush Fenway guys brought some fast Fords down.   This Ford has been at the top of the board any drafting practice.   It's just about timing it right. 
We got in that group that timed it right.   Like you said, Jamie and Aric and I were all talking about what we wanted to do. 
There was a whole other line of cars we wanted to get together.   It's crazy how it just doesn't work out sometimes.   You got a plan and it always changes. 
We'll see if we can do it again.   I think we got the first part of our job done that we wanted to, to get to the second round, but also put a fast lap up.   The top six speeds are locked into the race.   After Talladega last year, we definitely feel good to make it out of the first round.
