 Q.   What is your mindset for Thursday?  
RICKY STENHOUSE, JR.:   We think we ran a good enough time we would be in our speed from the first round.   
We want to keep this Ford as pretty as we can throughout those Duels.   We obviously want to get the best starting position as we can, which is winning a Duel.   That would be our plan.   If things get hairy, we want to make sure we have this car for the 500.   
I think our first session went according to plan.   The second one not so much.   We obviously needed to be that last group, but it's tough to wait and wait and wait.   
So all us Fords went to go see what we could run.   Just wasn't quick enough.   Not a bad day.   It was a lot more stressful than thinking about it after the Shootout what we were going to do after the Unlimited.
