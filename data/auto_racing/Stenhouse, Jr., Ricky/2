 Q. Ricky, this week you lead 31 laps. Mix it up, you finished third. Tell me about when you guys stayed out, that option to stay there. What were you thinking?   
RICKY STENHOUSE JR.: You know, Brian is just really good at calling races, and he apologized for that one. That one backfired on us that second run. We got good track position, and then we stayed out a little too long and gave up that track position. So then we were fighting kind of all race to get it back up, and he went long again, and it paid off with the caution.   
Our Kroger Camaro was good. It wasn't perfect by any means, but we know what we need to work on now, and it was cool to get a good solid run in this Camaro for everybody at JTG Daugherty Racing. Got to thank Hungry Jack, NOS Energy Drink and everybody that works on this car.   
So far so good. Two weeks, we've been fast this week, we weren't bad this week, and we know what we need to work on, and I know Brian and the boys will tune it up.
