Q. With Michael Waltrip Racing closing its doors at the end of the year, what does it mean to get this team into the championship fight?
CLINT BOWYER: Well, I mean, just to go through the year we've had, I mean, a lot of ups and downs here, a lot of downs, and then through the summer months we shook things up and really catapulted the organization to get going and getting our self back in the swing of things in this championship hunt and the Chase talk. Just super proud of Billy Scott, everybody, Dax, all the guys in the 5â€‘Hour Energy Toyota, Brian Pattie, he's got me to where we are, we made a crew swap there, but still, he's a big part of this like all the other employees at MWR. We did this, now we're in the Chase! Pressure is off, go cat go! Let's go out and have some fun.
