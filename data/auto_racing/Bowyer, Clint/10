  THE MODERATOR: We are joined now by Clint Bowyer, driver of the No.14 One Cure Ford. Clint, take us through the last several laps out there today.   
CLINT BOWYER: You know, you just don't know what's going on. You kind of do but you kind of don't. You pick up little bits and pieces of what the crew chief and spotters are telling you. But I saw him stay out when we pitted, and I was like, what's that mean? Where are we going to come out? And I kept looking, where is the 78. He just had such an advantage on tires there at the end, same advantage we did the time prior when we had tires.   
All in all, there was three cars that were class of the field, and proud that we were one of them but kind of frustrated that we weren't over there in Victory Lane.   
   
 Q. If there had been a caution, did you have a car enough to take him?   
CLINT BOWYER: You know, it would just have been a good race. I mean, obviously if we stayed out, it would have been one thing. If we pitted, you would have adjusted your air pressure and things like that for a short run, and again, it was three cars that were the class of the field all day long, and you knew you could get to him, you could get to their bumper, and without moving him or dive bombing him or something like that, you kind of just settle in and save your tires because you knew you needed to be patient and wait until the end of the race. We had‑‑ all three of us were kind of doing that. You could see one of us drive up to him, and we'll just, well, we'll just wait and see what happens. It never did. It never did present itself to have a restart like that, and honestly, I think that's a credit to the caliber of equipment out there, the caliber of drivers out there. A lot of rookies out there and young kids that haven't been here very often, if not the first time. I really thought and expected there to be a few more problems out there, and there just wasn't.   
   
 Q. You had a special guest in your pit box today, Evander Kane from the San Jose Sharks. I was wondering if you had a chance for his very first NASCAR race to get an idea of what he was all about.   
CLINT BOWYER: Yeah, I enjoyed him over at the One Cure tent before the race and I'm sure the guys enjoyed him. Just seemed like a good personality. It's always fun to see celebrities and sports figures come out to these races, and certainly this is one that they all flock to, so it was cool to have him on board this week for sure.  
   
 Q. Obviously the temperature was a little bit different today than yesterday. I wondered if that figured into anything that happened out there.   
CLINT BOWYER: Yeah, you know, all weekend long, just turn was a little bit more of an issue than forward bite, and that's been different in the last five or six years that we've been here. It's always been kind of a forward bite deal, and it seemed like we all fought turn a little bit more this year than forward bite. All in all, it was a lot of fun. It always is coming out here. There was three cars that were‑‑ like I said, that stood tall amongst the crowd.   
We never got a restart or anything else to put on a show. That's unfortunate. You know, we're all competitors, and trust me, when you're out there in clean air like that, it's kind of nice, but we all understand everybody is here, and I hope they enjoyed the race. You work your ass off out there. I mean, it's hard to showcase that. That track is demanding, full attention and full focus every single lap, especially when you're racing up there against my teammate Kevin and Martin. You don't see mistakes out of those guys.   
You know, cars that you lap and things like that, you see mistakes, but the guys that are running up front, they don't slip, they don't make mistakes, they take care of their tires, and if you look at the cars sitting down there stacked up, it showcases that. I had fun. Ready to go see my little guy. See you guys.
