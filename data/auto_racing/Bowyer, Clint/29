Q.   It was a good run for these guys, Brian Pattie said we should have been running like this all year, the bad news, you just missed the Chase.   What's going through your mind? 
CLINT BOWYER:   Yeah, I mean, you know, if you make the Chase you want to compete for a championship.   Truth be told, we're not there right now.   A lot of work to do.   We've got to continue to build on momentum like we had here tonight.   You know, it's definitely frustrating not making that Chase, but like I said, when you do make the Chase, you want it to be for a championship, not just ride around in it.   We still haven't won a race, and this 5â€‘Hour Energy Toyota team, everybody on this 15 team deserves a win by the end of the year, and I'll see to it they get it.

Q.   Your crew chief told me earlier today some changes are coming for you guys and they're starting next week.   Where do you need to improve to get back to winning form?
CLINT BOWYER:   Well, they say they are.   We'll just have to see.   Everybody is working hard, everybody at TRD, everybody at MWR.   The 2 and the 24 have pretty much been the class of the field all season long.   That was our best effort.   That's all I had, that's all we had as a race team.   We put it all out there, and still, we were just third best.   Got some work to do, but a lot of racing left.
