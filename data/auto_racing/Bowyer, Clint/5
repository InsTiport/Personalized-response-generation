 Q. How would you sum up this day?  
CLINT BOWYER: We had to unclog ourselves. Once we unclogged ourselves, we were really good.   
Our Mustangs were fast all weekend long. Took a while for our Mustang to get good. This Rush Trucks Center Cummins car to be honest was a little off all weekend long. I was pretty nervous coming into the race. Mike and everybody made some good adjustments, and then lean on your teammates.   
When you only have an hour's worth of practice, it pulls you away from something you were trying, anything out of your wheelhouse. Just kind of put us all back together with all four cars at Stewartâ€‘Haas.   
All in all, hey, I wanted to catch him bad. He just come out of the pits way too far ahead of me. Wasn't much I could do about it. Everybody involved, ITsavvy folks were here, Rusty, all his Rush Truck Centers guys, this is a home track for him, everybody involved. I appreciate everybody's support.
