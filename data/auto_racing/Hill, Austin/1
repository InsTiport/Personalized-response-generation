Q. Austin Hill celebrating victory No.4 on the season with his team. You are soaked, man. What a way to end a year like this. How do you explain this year, coming to a new team, coming into your own and then with four wins and a big one today at Homestead? 
AUSTIN HILL: I've just got to give it all to my guys. It's probably the best truck I've had. I know we were really good at Vegas, but man, this thing was good. I know at Vegas we were on different tire strategy than other guys, but we wasn't this time, and we just showed how good we actually was. 
I'm excited for the win, but at the same time it stings a little bit just because I know that if we would have been a little bit better in the round of six, we could be celebrating a win and a championship. But like I say, I can't thank everybody out there enough, Tim, Grayson, Dusty, Ron, Ruben, just everybody in the shop. Can't thank Toyota, TRD enough. With this win we locked up the manufacturer's championship, so I'm glad I could be a part of that and help that out, but awesome way to end the season.
