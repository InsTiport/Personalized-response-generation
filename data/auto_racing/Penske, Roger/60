Q.   As someone who grew up on the short tracks, it wasn't about the trophy today, but when you look back on this first championship, what do you think you'll cherish most about what you guys have accomplished? 
    BRAD KESELOWSKI:   Just how far we've come, Penske Racing.   This team is phenomenal, and I'm just so fortunate to have them.   Everybody back in North Carolina and Morrisville that supports this team, I hope you're listening.   None of this was possible without them.   I feel so lucky to have everyone here, just a dream come true to have a car like the Blue Deuce, everybody in the Miller Lite Dodge, and to have fast cars, to have a great team, this is what you dream of as a driver, and I'm just so very fortunate. 

Q.   Roger Penske, 40 years of trying, 15 Indianapolis 500s, but tonight for the first time you're a NASCAR Sprint Cup champion.   Where does this rank among all the accomplishments? 
    ROGER PENSKE:     Well, I'll tell you, it's at the top of the mark now.   As I told you when Brad and I got together three years ago and we talked about a plan, we executed, but I want to thank all the people in our company, all our 40,000 employees that have helped us.   This race shop team is outstanding, with just the reliability of that car and engine and Dodge, I want to thank Dodge for what they've done and certainly Miller Lite and Shellâ€‘Pennzoil. 
    But this guy Keselowski is something special, and for me it's a lifelong goal when you think about Hendrick, you think about Earnhardt and Childress and Gibbs and just to mention all the guys that have been up there, and we've been close but we've never delivered.   But this guy here delivered it for us.   Every week all through the year, gave us this championship.   Boy, I'll tell you, man, I love you. 

Q.   Let's bring in mom and dad.   Brad was five years old when you won your ARCA title, and you said to him, someday you will win one and you will understand what it means.   What does it mean for a dad to see his son's dad realized? 
    BOB KESELOWSKI:   Well, that's something you're always going to say and naturally hope for, but how many people get to realize that dream.   There's many young short track racers out there, and I was selected as one of millions and got this opportunity, and it paid off. 
    I'm still just blown away. 

Q.   Got to be so special, and Mom, you said the Keselowski family had waited a lifetime for this moment.   What does it mean to you, to dad and mom, see this young guy that you gave so much sacrifice become a champion. 
    KAY KESELOWSKI:   He's reached the pinnacle, the absolute pinnacle of success, and I am so unbelievably proud of my son.   I can't even begin to tell you.
