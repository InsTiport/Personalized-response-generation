  KERRY THARP:   Let's roll into our post‑race for tonight's 17th annual Ford EcoBoost 200 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, and our race runner up is Kyle Busch.   He drove the No.18 Dollar General Toyota.   Take us through the final laps of that race if you would, please. 
KYLE BUSCH:   Well, we had a really good truck.   All day today, we just kind of watched Nelson run up there and Kyle Larson and those guys.   They ran good races, too, and both really fast.   We just bided our time, kept working on our stuff, making adjustments there to try to make it better, and that last run there, the battle we had with Crafton, I was really loose but I was giving it everything I had, so just hate it that we had that caution that came out and then we had the red flag and then ‑‑ we had a caution and then we had another caution with a red flag.   Just brought too many trucks and changed the order around too much and came down to losing it on a yellow again. 

Q.   From your point of view can you describe what happened on the last lap? 
KYLE BUSCH:   I got drove in the fence.   You saw it. 
KERRY THARP:   Thanks for coming in, and good luck the rest of the weekend.   Thank you.
