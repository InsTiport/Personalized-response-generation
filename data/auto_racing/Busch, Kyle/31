Q. When that speeding penalty happened, what was going through your mind? Did you think your chances of winning this race and getting to 200 were maybe over?
KYLE BUSCH: Yeah, that thought certainly crosses your mind. I knew we had a great racecar. We had a great racecar all day long. We were fast. I wasn't sure how well we were going to be able to come through the field, get back in traffic, get our way worked back up to the lead. 
Brad was really fast that run, he was way out front. We were catching the 22, the 4. If it went green to the end, I wasn't sure how it was going to play out. Sometimes you have to a little bit of luck on your side. Fortunately we were in the Interstate Batteries green today with being St.Patty's day. Cool to get all these guys in Victory Lane. 
To win my 200th race with Interstate Batteries, with Norm Miller, Scott Miller, everybody that does such an awesome job of supporting us since day one, the reason why Joe Gibbs Racing exists. It certainly is a monumental moment for all of us, including M&M's, Skittles, Snickers. Maybe the stars aligned a little bit more perfectly today.
