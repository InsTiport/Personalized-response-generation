Q. Kyle fought hard from that final restart and against your teammate, of course, before the little wall contact. Describe for us trying to get Erik Jones. 
KYLE BUSCH: You just can't get there with this package. Just such a one‑lane racetrack. There's not enough options, there's not enough grooves that you can get enough air on your car to close that gap and make that pass. We kind of lost control of the race there on pit road when we came down the leader and then came out third, and I thought if we could just keep in touch with those guys and keep close to them, then we might be able to out‑pit road them at the end of the race, and we did one of them but not the other one. 
Overall a good day, and the Snickers Camry was fast and was the best we've run here in a long, long time, so that was fun. It was nice to lead some laps, be up front like that, but I hate it that we got behind on pit road and then we couldn't make it up on the track. That kind of sucks.

Q. Before you caught him there at the end, were you doing a little conserving trying to save a little bit to try to get him?
KYLE BUSCH: Yeah, when he started to inch out a little bit, I was trying to save my right front because I knew my right front wasn't going to make it the whole rest of the way without me knocking the wall down, and I was right. I hit the wall with about four to go and then I hit it again with three to go, and that was‑‑ it killed it that time. Luckily we were able to salvage a third, just dragging the fence for the last two laps. 
I don't think I've ever seen NASCAR not throw a caution in that scenario ‑‑ oh, yes, I have, that's right. I blew a left front tire at California in an Xfinity race and we had to finish the whole last lap, so doesn't surprise me.
