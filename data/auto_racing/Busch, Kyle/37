 Q. After winning Truck and Xfinity, a little bit short today. The pit speeding penalty, was it just too much to come back from and overcome today?  
KYLE BUSCH: Yeah, because the cars don't have any speed. You're wide open just trying to suck off of any cars that you can that's in front of you and get a draft, and I was running 31 flats when I was chasing those leaders down, and then once I got there I stalled out to 31:40's because the wind was just so bad behind those guys that you couldn't corner anymore. You couldn't maneuver. I couldn't run low.   
If they ran low, I couldn't run high; if they ran high ‑‑ so you're always trying to figure out which way to go, and I certainly screwed up our day. Coming to pit road there we tried a different brake package for us this weekend, and trying to make up time, and in order to get a bigger jump on the guys behind me coming to pit road there, just ruined it for us, and we had to come from the back, and I think we passed the most cars today so I think we were the most impressive today, but doesn't matter because we don't have a trophy. Whatever. Next week.
