Q. Kyle, congratulations. You started on the outside pole, you won the race, you led 79 laps. You went to a birthday party and another trophy for the warehouse, buddy. You've got to feel pretty good. 
KYLE BUSCH: Absolutely. We sure do, man. This M&M's Hazelnut Spread Camry was awesome. And Hazelnut Spread is in stores now, so be sure to go check those out. I just can't say enough about everyone at Joe Gibbs Racing. Everybody that works there, works so hard to build these awesome Camrys, and thank you to Toyota and TRD for their support, of course, and Interstate Batteries, Rheem, Stanley, Monster Energy, Cessna, DVX Eyewear, and of course the fans. We've had an amazing roll this year here so far. We've been really doing well, and we feel like we've kind of given away a couple of wins that we thought we had a shot for, but overall it's awesome to be able to get back to Victory Lane here. Pocono has been a struggle, but it's a lot better now.

Q. You ran just about a perfect race, so congratulations to you and the whole team, Adam and all of y'all. 
KYLE BUSCH: Thank you. Appreciate you guys.
