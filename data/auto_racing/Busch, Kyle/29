 Q. Eight wins and you did it with a car that's beat up as can be. What was your confidence level when you decided to stay out with 20 to go.  
KYLE BUSCH: I don't know. We're crazy. We just do what we do, try to win.   
It's pretty awesome to be able to snooker those guys, get our win today here at Bristol. Love this place. It was fun to battle out the brother there at the end. I know we didn't quite get side‑by‑side racing it out. I saw him working the top. I'm like, I better go. I got up there, was able to make some ground.   
Man, just awesome to be here in front of this crowd, here at Bristol Motor Speedway. The Skittles Camry wasn't the best today, but we made the most of not having the best and got everything we needed here at the end.   
   
 Q. What does it mean to have won here eight times?  
KYLE BUSCH: It ain't 12, that's for sure. So I got more to go. We're getting there and it's fun.   
It's the most active driver, I guess. I think I heard that. But, you know, there's a lot more years left hopefully.
