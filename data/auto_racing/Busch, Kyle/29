Q. Kyle Busch for the fourth straight week brings it home with a topâ€‘3 finish, but it wasn't easy today, Kyle. Where do you feel like you just missed it a bit?
KYLE BUSCH: Just overall speed. Even when we unloaded here in practice, we just weren't quite up on the speed charts like we expected to be. First run off the truck was really good, but as the track took rubber, our car just kind of slowed down and we just didn't have what we needed there.
Overall, though, today the midpoint day of today's race was a bit ugly for us, and then we turned it around, and thankful to have Adam Stevens and all my guys that give me everything that I need to kind of go out there and work with, and we were able to turn our day around. Fast pit stops got us a lot of track position today. It was hard to pass, besides rooting a guy off the bottom, and even when you tried to do that, they just cut your nose off and you lose a spot. 
But overall, just we fought hard for today's finish. Not a finish that we wanted to get. Thought we had a chance to win actually, but could have been a whole lot worse. M&M's Chocolate Bar Camry comes home with another Top 5. We'll go on.
