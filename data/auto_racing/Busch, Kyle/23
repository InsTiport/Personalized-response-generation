KYLE BUSCH: I passed one guy on the outside of Turn 3 and that was the only guy I needed to pass, I guess. It was hard otherwise. We kind of got stuck in traffic back there a little bit earlier in the race. We were about fifth or sixth and couldn't really do anything. But overall my guys on pit road were awesome. We got some spots there, track position. Adam Stevens and some of our race calls getting us further up towards the front, so it's cool to get a win here, cool to get a win at Pocono again, Rowdy Nation is up there supporting us, and having some M&M's Hazelnut Spread Camrys that are fast like this makes my job of a hell of a lot easier.
