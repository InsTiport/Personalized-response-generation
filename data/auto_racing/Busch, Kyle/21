Q. Kyle, three laps fresher tires, you put on a show. Did the car go away when you got within about a second?
KYLE BUSCH: Yeah, any time I had to lean on the left rear, I just didn't have the drive that I needed. Actually tried to hold on to it, trying to save it. I knew that was going to be our problem. That had been our problem all day long. You get closer, you're like, Okay, I can get him, I better go, pounce on him fast, so then he doesn't have the time to pick up the pace. 
But it didn't work. He was obviously saving a lot. I knew he was going to be saving a lot, have enough to be able to most likely hold us off. I was right. 
I still tried everything I could to get there and ran real hard. But our M&M's Hazelnut Spread Camry was fast. Real proud of that. Adam and the boys, we came here a little better this year than we have in years past, so that felt nice. 
Sucks to finish second to a teammate, but it's good for the company. Overall Martin is really, really good here. I'm just pumped that I actually ran good here.
