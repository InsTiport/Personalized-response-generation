 Q. Kyle, considering the weekend that you guys had, how do you feel about second place today?   
KYLE BUSCH: Yeah, we have a lot of work to do. Guys did a great job here, though, just trying to work on it and trying to make everything that we could out of it all day long, all weekend long. The Interstate Batteries Camry wasn't a secondâplace car, but thankfully we got a good finish out of here, we tried to get some points. Guys are doing all they can, I know, and all everybody at TRD. So I appreciate all the hard work. We've just got to get a little bit better. We finished the end of last year so strong, I don't know what we're missing here, but obviously it's a little bit of something here or there, maybe a little bit of something in a few different areas, but overall, good car today. Thank M&M's, Snickers, Skittles, Rowdy Energy and go next week.
