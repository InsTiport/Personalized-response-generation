 Q.   Kyle, not happy with your race tonight, but look at the big picture and assess your Chase chances.   
KYLE BUSCH:   Well, we made it, I guess.   Certainly last week was a lot more promising situation to be going into the Chase than tonight.   But we've got to look at our program and where we've been.   The mile‑and‑a‑halfs have sort of been our strong suit.   But yet you still have those races like Loudon and Martinsville and whatnot and Phoenix that you've got to be good at, too.   We'll just have to work and lay all the pieces out and see what needs to be better here with tomorrow's Monday morning meeting.
