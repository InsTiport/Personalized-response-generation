 Q. Alex, driving for small teams at the fringe of the Cup Series to getting a part‑time opportunity and filling in for Dale Jr. to now being a Cup Series winner for Rick Hendrick. Put it into words.   
ALEX BOWMAN: I can't believe it. You know how it is; we were both in the same boat and had a different set of circumstances. I can't believe it. There's so many people that are capable of doing this, but so thankful that I got the opportunity. Big thanks to AXALTA, Nationwide, Llumar, Valvoline, chassis shop, everybody that makes this happen.   
I didn't change anything from running 35th every week. I might work out a little harder and study a little harder, but I didn't change much, and to go from doing that to doing this is pretty incredible.  
   
 Q. What did Rick say to you there?   
ALEX BOWMAN: He said, I can't believe you got us stuck in the mud, which I can't believe I did that, either. I feel pretty dumb, but I guess you'll have that in big‑time auto racing. I just tried to go bogging out there, and we needed some knobby tires to make that happen.   
   
 Q. And, Greg, how amazing was that for your young driver here in the 42 to get back by him?  
GREG IVES: Yeah, I kind of knew that was going to happen. He wants to get me a little excited there at the end. We were in a situation at Kansas where I think he learned a little bit of something that ‑‑ never give up even if the guy gotbehind ‑‑ you got behind the guy. So he did a great job. Appreciate everybody. I want to thank all our sponsors and I want to dedicate this win to my mom.
