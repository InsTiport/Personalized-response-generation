 Q. He's made his way to the stage on the frontstretch. HomesteadâMiami Speedway, now a threeâtime NASCAR champion. Come down here, old man. We've been waiting all year asking what's going on with this 88 team. Who are they? They're up, they're down. Right now you are sitting here a threeâtime NASCAR champion. How does this one stack up for you?   
MATT CRAFTON: Yeah, it feels amazing. It's one step closer to what Hornaday has done, and they called us the underdog. I heard Bodine and everybody say I was the underdog and I didn't have it, and we fought harder, I guarantee it, every one of these guys worked harder. This Menard Fâ150 was fast tonight. That first run, I'm like, oh, boy, we're in trouble, and just made air pressure adjustments from there. We made a few adjustments, tightened up, because we thought the track was going to be green, and it was going to go away, but this thing ran flawless all night. And motor was very good, as well, and everything just went our way. I was praying there. I do not want a yellow right here at the end of this thing.  
   
 Q. We go back to Phoenix last week, the stages, early part of those races, the restarts, all the things that you guys had struggled with, y'all started to nail. You did the same thing tonight. What made the difference coming down the stretch?   
MATT CRAFTON: Yeah, I guess I finally could get out of a wheelchair and got up on the wheel and got it done. Like I said, I guess I took a lot of criticism over the restarts and it was time to get it done now.
