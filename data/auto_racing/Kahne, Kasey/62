   HERB BRANHAM: Good afternoon again everyone. Welcome to Part 2 of today's NASCAR Cam Video Conference. I guess you could call it a doubleheader. It's in advance of the 50th running of the Coca Cola 600. That's set for Sunday at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina.   
 Joining us for today's second NASCAR Cam Teleconference from the NASCAR Research and Development Center in Concord we have the defending champion of the Coca Cola 600, Kasey Kahne, who drives the No. 9 Budweiser Dodge.   
 Kasey's currently 16th in the Sprint Cup Series points. He's only 66 out of 12th place, 12th is the cut-off position, of course, for qualifying for what we call NASCAR's Playoffs, the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup. Last year, May was really, I guess you could say, magic for you as you won both the All-Star Race, then came back the next week and won the Coca Cola 600.   
 What's the outlook for you and your team as you try to defend your title in the 600, NASCAR's longest race?   
 KASEY KAHNE: It's really exciting to be back to Charlotte for the 600. It's always a really good weekend for our team. And for myself, we ran well in the 600 a few different times. So looking forward to it.   
 Excited about having a new car and working on the engine and everything to be better. And I think this should be one of our better weekends we've had so far this year. So everything's good.   
 HERB BRANHAM: Questions?
