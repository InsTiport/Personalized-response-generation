 Q. Another driver that missed out on making it into the Chase, Kasey Kahne. This is a tough one. You don't make it in, and first of all, just walk through your night and kind of how the race went for you?  
KASEY KAHNE: I could take off alright on restarts, we could go for a little bit and then I get so tight with the front, wouldn't turn, and I was having a couple other issues with brakes and stuff. But we tried to kind of fight through there, we got a lap down, and then once we didn't get the lucky dog, we ran in position for a while and we were too far back and we ended up two laps down. Matt was really good, Kenseth. Those guys were fast.  
   
 Q. What are the couple of things you want to work on in the next 10 races to get better for next year?  
KASEY KAHNE: I think the main thing for me is just figuring out how to get a car to turn again. I've struggled all year to have front turn, and if I don't have that, I can't race. That's how I've been my whole life. We'll just work on trying to get the cars the way I need them to, and if we can't, we'll keep running about 15th.
