 Q.   Kasey, a lot of those Chase races are on mile‑and‑a‑half racetracks.   That's right in your wheelhouse.   Feel pretty good about your chances coming up?  
KASEY KAHNE:   Yeah, I felt really good last week at Atlanta, especially at the end of that race, and look forward to Chicago next week.   It'll be a great track for us to get started.   Tonight wasn't what we wanted, but it was tough just with the tire combination.   I feel like it made the aero so bad, so it made it pretty difficult to do anything except in open track you could make ground but not pass a car.   
But yeah, hopefully some of these other tracks will be better for us, and we'll be able to compete.
