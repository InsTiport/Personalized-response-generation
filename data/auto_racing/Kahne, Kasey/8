KASEY KAHNE:   Yeah, I felt really good last week at Atlanta, especially at the end of that race, and look forward to Chicago next week.   It'll be a great track for us to get started.   Tonight wasn't what we wanted, but it was tough just with the tire combination.   I feel like it made the aero so bad, so it made it pretty difficult to do anything except in open track you could make ground but not pass a car. 
But yeah, hopefully some of these other tracks will be better for us, and we'll be able to compete.
