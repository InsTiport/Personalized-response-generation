Q. When you got that caution, you're running fourth, were you thinking, here's my chance?
KASEY KAHNE: Yeah, I mean, I tried. I wanted to. But Denny was fast. Truex was fast. Neither one of us‑‑ well, Truex, I stayed right with him on the restart but the inside took off a little better. Yeah, I wanted to win, but Denny was a good bit better than we were. We got up there because of the right pit call. We got on tires at the right time and got by those guys and then when they pitted they were too far behind us to get us back. It worked out. I think we would have run fourth at best. We ended up sixth with that final restart. It was a good effort by our Farmers Insurance team, just not good enough.

Q. You got a big congratulations from Mr. Hendrick on the effort this evening. Do you feel you are bringing more speed, the team is bringing more speed the last few weeks? Does that encourage you going into the final 10 races?
KASEY KAHNE: Yeah, he said good job, way to fight, and I was like, man, thanks for giving me the last three weeks. We had cars that we were capable of fighting with. So that was nice for me, have three cars in the last weeks that we could actually go and battle. So that was good. So the team is doing a nice job. We just have to keep going from there, and our whole deal the last 10 races is try to get consistency and keep running in the top 10 and work on winning races. We haven't been anywhere close to that this year. We've been like a 13th to 18th, and we want to be in the top 10, top 5, and the last three weeks we haven't, so we need to keep pushing forward on that.
