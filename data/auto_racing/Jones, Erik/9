 Q. When you look at this paint scheme, the throwback to your rookie season in the late model, to now be sitting here with a crown jewel under your belt, what does that mean to you?  
ERIK JONES: Well, it's pretty special, 100th start. I guess sometimes funny things happen, right, and 100th start we're in Victory Lane with my first‑ever scheme on a big car, so it's pretty special. Thanks to SportClips for letting me run that. That meant a lot to me and my family. My mom is here for this one; that's great.   
But all my partners, man, I'm so happy for them, DeWalt, Craftsman, Reser, Stanley, Circle K, Interstate, Toyota, just sticking with me through this, it's been a big year of speculation and maybe moving around, and I don't think there's much more to say than this right here, so it's pretty good.  
   
 Q. You mentioned the trophy and the iconic names, the biggest in the sport that adorn it. What's it going to be like to have your face next to them?  
ERIK JONES: It's going to feel pretty special. There's a lot of great names on there, and this is one‑‑ this race for me has always held a special place. When you think of NASCAR, for myself, I think of Darlington and this tough place.   
I'm drained, I'm mentally drained, I'm physically drained. I just‑‑ man, I'm so happy right now to be here and can't wait to celebrate with these guys, get back home and celebrate with my friends. It's going to be a lot of fun.
