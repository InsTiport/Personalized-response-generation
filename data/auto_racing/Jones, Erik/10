Q.  What a performance for Erik Jones today. Racing his mentor, Kyle Busch, he gets the win in the Southern 500. That's Daytona, now Darlington. Is that the hardest you've ever had to drive, and how much pressure was Kyle putting on you? 
ERIK JONES: Yeah, I mean, I'm wore out just mentally and physically. More mentally than anything. But Kyle was really running hard, and he's one of the best guys out there. Our SportClips Camry was good, but man, I was pedaling as hard as I could and just glad to hold him off. And to finally get to Victory Lane, I feel like it's been coming for us for a long time, so it just feels really good.

Q. You had all the speculation this year about what's going to happen next year. What kind of answer is this for you to win a crown jewel event like this? 
ERIK JONES: Is there anything more to say? I mean, it's been a lot of doubt and a lot of speculation, and I put my heart and soul into this and this race team, and this is my living and how I want to make a career and what I want to do. It doesn't get any better. On my list, this race is really high, and it's going to look damned good to see my face on that trophy. 

Q. How about these Darlington fans who stayed through the rain delay? It's almost 2:00 a.m. and they're still here. 
ERIK JONES: Thank you guys for coming. You're welcome to stay up all night with me because I guarantee I ain't going to bed.
