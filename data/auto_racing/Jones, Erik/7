Q. Tell us about the pit stop, where you slid through. 
ERIK JONES: I just missed the box, to be honest with you. Kind of knocking the rust off from last year. Got in too hot. You get back out on the track, I was trying to stay cool, hoping let's get a caution. Got back on the lead lap, got in one wreck, then another wreck. I think we got in another wreck. 
We had some great help there at the end from Denny. Awesome win. Really cool to start off like that, get the Sport Clips back in Victory Lane. All my sponsors: Stanley, Reser's, Interstate Batteries, Toyota. 
Start it out right. Getting this race back to its original namesake, being able to be the first guy to win it, feels pretty good.
