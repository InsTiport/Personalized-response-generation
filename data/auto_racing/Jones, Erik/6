Q. The nose looks more like it had a bad night at Kalamazoo Speedway. How would you describe this day?
ERIK JONES: Well, not one I would have thought we want. It was an awesome race. I got to give a huge thanks to Denny there in the 11. He stuck with us there that whole last lap. It wasn't the fastest car I don't think left in the race, but we brought it home. I owe him one for that one, for sure. 
Really cool, though. Busch Clash, first year back to win that one. Sports Clips, these guys have been loyal to me the last two years. It's really cool to get them another win. Hopefully next Sunday we cap off another one there. 

Q. The last restart and the one before, could you have a game plan with so few cars left?
ERIK JONES: I was hoping I could get pushed, get up front, that Denny was going to help us. That didn't exactly work out. Everybody was slicing with that few of cars. He just locked on and we stuck together. 
I think honestly my car was so draggy it wasn't so much for him to stay connected. He was able to push us home. Feels good. Started off with a win. Really cool race, one that I grew up watching. To have it back with its original namesake feels pretty good.
