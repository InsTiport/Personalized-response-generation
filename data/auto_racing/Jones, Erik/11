 Q. Erik, you led some laps, finished in the runnerâ€‘up spot today. How tough was that challenge of leading and fighting for the lead while conserving fuel?  
ERIK JONES: It's always a challenge. Probably my least part of racing at times, is just having to save fuel. Our opportunity to win when we were going green was to make it to the end. It would have been really tight. Those guys kind of gave up saving there. We were hoping it was going to stay green.   
Had a couple good opportunities on the restarts. The Reser's Camry was there all day, second half of the day, we had problems at the start. Man, it's a bummer. We're close every week. Third, third, second. We're right there.   
We're doing great building points, but it would be great to knock a win out. We're just so close, it stings a little bit more when you get close to it.   
   
 Q. What is clicking for this team so well right now?  
ERIK JONES: It's a little bit of everything. Honestly, we started the race so far off today, I wasn't sure how we were going to run. We were able to turn it around halfway, get back in contention. There at the end I wasn't sure how it was all going to play out. It was nice to get some good restarts. Martin gave me a great push at the end.   
We were there for second, then the top got rolling. I couldn't really do anything. Good to get another top three run. We just got to break through. Once we get that first one, I think we can click a few off here.
