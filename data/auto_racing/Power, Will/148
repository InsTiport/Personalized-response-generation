  WILL POWER:   There could have been a much better qualifying, but it went as bad as it could possibly go.   At the end of the day, we were just too loose.   

Q.   Did either of you encounter any problems with seams out there?   
WILL POWER:   I did.   I definitely got caught on the seams.   
SIMON PAGENAUD:   Yeah, that's the tricky part to this racetrack, for sure, obviously got loose on the seams, but it's not too bad.   I think some cars react more aggressively than others on those seams.   It's a matter of making sure the car can make you comfortable enough to run 500 miles.   

Q.   And for both guys, just want to know from Wednesday night to this afternoon how much different was the track?   
WILL POWER:   It's a lot different.   It's a lot harder.   Obviously running at this time of the day, it's‑‑ even this morning it was a lot different.   We did 2:21, and you're lucky to crack 2:19 today.   It was a lot different.   
SIMON PAGENAUD:   Yeah, a lot different than night running, for example.   We lose so much downforce in those conditions, the track is very greasy.   It's hard because we're not running in those conditions in the race, so you don't prepare for these conditions.   That's what makes it difficult.   But it was an exciting qualifying session, I guess.   

Q.   Will, you've been in this position before, running for a championship.   What have you done this time either mentally or physically or emotionally to make sure that you get that championship tomorrow night?   
WILL POWER:   I think the circumstances change obviously as qualifying unfolds.   Starting with the air, it changes things at the start of the race, and just to start, to be there at the end.   That's the beginning of it.   And then just understand what we've got to do when we got to that position.   
Yeah, we've got a long night ahead.   You know, it's far from over.   It's a long night.   We're going to do everything possible to make it happen.   

Q.   Does it really matter what the position at the start?   It's a long race, it's a lot of laps.   Does it really matter where you start?   It matters where you finish.   
WILL POWER:   Yeah, everything is going to be where I finish, but yeah, it does.   It helps, you know, just to keep yourself out of trouble, but then again, you definitely learn traffic on the way through.   If you can keep yourself on stride, you learn what your car is like in traffic and probably get pretty good at passing.   You've got three hours to work your way to the front.   I think that's got to be the mindset.   

Q.   Tomorrow the race is in the evening, I'm not sure what the temperature will be, lower or the same.   Do you expect a difference, better handling with the car, under the conditions tomorrow?   
SIMON PAGENAUD:   Like we just said, it should be a lot easier, should make it a better race, as well, with traffic since we'll have more downforce from the conditions, and the track should allow us to run more lanes.   It should be good racing.   

Q.   Will, being such a wide track with so many lanes, how much advantage is that going to help you to move forward in the race during those 500 laps?   
WILL POWER:   Yeah, that's a big plus.   It's a track that you can pass on.   I think that's definitely good for us.   So yeah, hopefully it is cool enough so there are multiple lanes, and we can work our way through.   
SIMON PAGENAUD:   Yeah, it's a good track for passing, good racing here, certainly personally it's one of my favorite for that reason, this track.   It allows you to be creative with your mind and understand what your tires are doing and understanding the option to run this lane, inside lane, outside lane, and also looking at the overall competition when you're running up behind them, it's easier to do what you want to do, pass them.
