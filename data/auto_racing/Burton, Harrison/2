 Q. Daytona is certainly special for everyone, but boy, what a great way to debut with this team with a secondâplace finish.   
HARRISON BURTON: Yeah, absolutely. Not as great as it could have been, which is unfortunate. There was a couple times where we almost got wrecked, and we kind of barely squeaked out of it, so I know I had John Andretti kind of over my shoulder watching me for that. That was really cool. There was a couple times this weekend in general where I blew a tire in practice and somehow didn't wreck. Had a lot of help there from him.   
I wish I could have won it. You know, our Dex Imaging guys really work their butts off to make this car really fast, and even with damage we had a really, really good car. Proud of our guys, proud of our hard work. Hopefully soon we can put this Supra in Victory Lane, though, and finish the deal.
