  THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by the driver of the No.17 Red Horse Racing Toyota, Timothy Peters. Solid run tonight. Looked like you were coming on strong there at the end and kind of ran out of laps a little bit early.   
TIMOTHY PETERS: Yeah, we ran out of laps for sure, but I wished our night would have ended the way the race started for sure. We fired off really well. We had a really good balance, had a little miscue in the pits, lost some track position, but we were able to gain it back. Hey, all in all, we said in the beginning of Daytona that we wanted a shot. We had that down here, and we came up just a little bit short. We know what we need to do over the offâ€‘season, and can't wait for Daytona.
