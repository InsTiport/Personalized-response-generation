Q. What did you learn on the restarts before that you executed on the last one?
JOEY LOGANO: I can't tell you everything I learned (laughter). 
You race this whole race, you keep building that notebook up. What a great execution day from our racecar, obviously very fast, our pit crew was amazing. T.J. Majors spotted his butt off up there. The race fans sticking around till Monday. You guys are the best. 
We love coming up to Michigan. Nothing like bringing a Ford to Victory Lane in their home turf, Roger Penske cars as well. This is a big win for us. 

Q. The importance of this event for Ford Motor Company, the Michigan Heritage Trophy. Edsel Ford will keep it for another race at MIS. 
JOEY LOGANO: He made it known how important it is, how racing is in their blood at the Ford Motor Company, the Ford family in particular. I couldn't be more proud to be able to deliver that for them.
