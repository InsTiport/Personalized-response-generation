Q. 1966, Henry Ford went to Le Mans. A little car he gave to every driver and crew chief, said, You better win. What did Edsel Ford tell all of you Thursday night at dinner that put the fear of losing in all the Ford drivers?
JOEY LOGANO: Almost exactly identical words to that (laughter): You better not lose. 
He told us how important it was. I wish he was able to be here today. Man, this feels so good. Winning at Michigan means so much to Team Penske and Ford. Being able to pull into this Victory Lane, see everybody, means so much. A day like that, you don't get those days all the time. 
The best car, the best team. We executed perfectly all the way through. Ultimately able to bring the Shell Pennzoil Ford into Victory Lane. 
Can't thank everyone at the shop enough. Everyone that builds this thing, Roushâ€‘Yates motors, MoneyLion, Wheels Up, everybody that helps through this whole thing. Amazing feeling getting into Victory Lane. 
We've been so close this year getting into Victory Lane multiple times. Coming up short, mainly because of execution. Today everything was cleaned up perfectly and we did a great job. This is what we get. 
Hopefully we can start stacking up some more here. 

Q. I think you're going to have all those teams looking at your telemetry on that restart. 
JOEY LOGANO: I don't know what I did (laughter).
