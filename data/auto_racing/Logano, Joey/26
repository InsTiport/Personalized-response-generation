 Q. How would you describe what happened out there today?  
JOEY LOGANO: In one word, it was a battle out there. The restarts were insane, three, four wide, cars were all over the place. I thought to start off the day, we were pretty far off, on the splitter pretty hard, and we tried making adjustments to fix that and got off too loose, we were too tight, and then we finally got the balance to where it was pretty good as the sun went down and had a good flight cycle where I caught the 42. I just couldn't get around him. I couldn't get to either side, couldn't break that plane on his bumper to get to either side of him to try to make that pass, and then I started getting tight, I was just racing so hard with him.   
He was able to take off, and that was kind of the end for us. But a great recovery. We didn't score any stage points. We were running in 12th or 13th most of the race, and then we got the Shellâ€‘Pennzoil Mustang quite a bit better to get a top 3. It's hard to say I'm happy with that, but all things considered, we'll take it.
