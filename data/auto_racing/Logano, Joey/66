 Q. How do you feel like things set up for you this time?  
JOEY LOGANO: I think we're pretty good. We showed consistency over the last few races here with a lot of top 10s, top 5s. I think we were third in points overall throughout the first 26 races. Proud of the effort the team's put in. All of that's washed out now. I think we're ninth or something. We'll just hammer down. We know what we've got to do in this Chase throughout each round, and we'll just attack the way we know how to and have some fun with it.  
   
 Q. The last two seasons you were among the four finalists in Homestead. Would anything less than a championship be acceptable for you guys this year?  
JOEY LOGANO: That's the goal, right? Why else would we show up at the racetrack if our goal wasn't to win the championship? I know our team can do it. Same team pretty much from last year, and our cars have decent speed in it, and we showed that some tonight. We were just good on the long run and not necessarily the short run. Overall I think our team is in a great spot right now, both the 2 and the 22. We are ready to fire away and see if we can put one of those Fords in victory lane.
