Q. Joey Logano, a controversial crash last weekend and talking about it all week. You have a different crew chief, a different pit crew. How awesome is it for you to get to Victory Lane on Daytona 500 weekend? 
JOEY LOGANO: It feels so good. I mean, obviously it's the Duels, not the Daytona 500, but momentum is momentum. Just T.J. does such a great job up on the roof and understanding the draft, and then working with this new group here, they're not new to working together but I'm new with them, and it's been a good partnership so far. Been pretty seamless and working out some of the kinks last week and being able to come to Victory Lane here in Daytona. Winning anything in Daytona is such a big deal, so just ready to go for the 500. 
Just can't thank Ford enough. Aric Almirola, can't thank him enough. Boy, what a great push that he has given me throughout the run and a great partner out there to work with. It was awesome. 
So excited that NASCAR is partnering with CocaâCola and Xfinity, man. It's just such a great spot for our sport right now, so I'm excited to be a part of it and excited to run for a championship this year.
