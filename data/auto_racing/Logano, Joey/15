Q. A little bit of miscommunication there coming to that last stop kept you out there and it paid off. What were your thoughts as the restart began?
JOEY LOGANO: I'm not really sure what I was supposed to do, but boy, we fought hard for this one today. Man, what a battle between Blaney and I and Chase Elliott and the 19 earlier in the race, and then to see this finish with Matt finishing second is great day for Wood Brothers and for Team Penske. 
Man, nothing like winning the Pennzoil 400 in front of this amazing crowd with this awesome yellow car right here in the front. Man, this is a huge win, and nice to kick off the season with a W.

Q. You got a huge push from Stenhouse on the restart. Was that the difference? 
JOEY LOGANO: Yeah, it really was. You get a good start like that, and I watched him, he pushed me and then he shoved me ahead, which was great, and then the block on the 24, that was the winning move, I was able to get down in front of him and then be able to separate myself a little bit from the field. 
Clean air was going to be key with old tires. If I got swallowed up by a couple cars, I was just going to fall backwards really quick. Being able to get that clean air, secure that. Man, this is great getting back in Victory Lane.

Q. Your first win with Paul Wolfe, one to remember. 
JOEY LOGANO: Yeah, it really is. He's done such a great job, and it's been fun getting to know each other, and with the whole team. The pit crew was amazing today. I think we gained a spot every time at least. Proud of the effort that everyone has put in over the offâseason, to come out here the start of the West Coast Swing and get one of those cool stickers right next to my name on top of this car.
