 Q.   In and out, in and out during those final laps and you finished it in the Chase.   How good does it feel to have made it in?  
JOEY LOGANO:   It feels really good after having such a rough night.   Man, the car was just struggling all night, man, and I kept asking Todd where we were, if we were good, if we were bad, and he didn't really answer me.   So I don't think that's good.   But thank God for the last caution, I guess, because I think we were out before that.   I'll tell you what, we've just got to forget this finish tonight and reset our goals to the championship and Friday to get the Shellâ€‘Pennzoil Ford in the championship because this team is capable of doing it.   
Thank God we're not ever coming back to Richmond until next year and we'll try to score some points and score some wins now.  
   
 Q.   I know you weren't happy with the car tonight but over the course of the last six or seven weeks you guys have been strong.   How encouraged are you that you can go into the Chase and contend for the championship?  
JOEY LOGANO:   I'm encouraged for sure.   All our finishes leading up to this race were really, really good.   I feel like we were the hottest team in NASCAR coming into this race.   We're going to try to take this momentum off of getting into the Chase here and let her rip and have some fun.
