 Q. Joey Logano pits from the lead on that last pit sequence. How disheartening was it to see how many cars stayed out?  
JOEY LOGANO: Yeah, I was hoping we had more laps left. 15 to go, not good. At least we were in the right lane. The restart was a mess. I don't know what was going on there on the restart. We were all three, fourâ€‘wide. I don't know what the deal was.   
Outside of that, we had a great Auto Trader Mustang, car that should have won the race. I feel like we won the race a couple times. We just didn't win it when it mattered the most, when the 18 got ahead at the end.   
I think we had the fastest car, we just didn't get all the pieces right. You can have the fastest car, don't do the rest of the stuff, you don't win. The 18 capitalized on that. Congrats to them.   
When you make the pass for win, there's only a few laps to go, you think you did it. You have to hold off the 2, then everything went wrong at the end.
