Q. Joey, Denny said he felt like it was a civilized conversation until you pushed him. What's your side of the story? 
JOEY LOGANO: Yeah, I just wanted to talk to him about it and was pretty frustrated. He just kind of came off the corner like there wasn't another car on the outside of him and ruined our day. A shot at the win for sure. We probably weren't going to beat the 19, but we had a top 5 for sure coming our way, but we just were able to survive there. 
I don't really know what happened because once he started hitting me he didn't lift, he just kept finishing me off. We ran each other fine all day, so I don't know. I don't really know what happened. He just kind of sends me up there and keeps on going with it. Cut down my tires and fender rubs everywhere. 
You know, at the end of the day we still got a decent finish out of it and some points in the stages at least. But a little frustrated with the situation. I wanted to talk to him about it, and maybe I shouldn't have shoved him at the end. It may have escalated it a little bit more. It's frustrating. There's a lot of passion out there.

Q. Why did it get physical, and what did you want to deliver in terms of a message to Denny by going down and talking to him? 
JOEY LOGANO: I honestly just wanted to see what he was going to say, and he really wasn't apologetic at all. That's more frustrating when someone is like that, isn't it? When someone wrecks you and he's like, meh, that's not really what I was going for there. I just wanted to see what his thoughts were, and wasn't quite the answer I was looking for.

Q. Is this what the Round of Eight in these playoffs do, bring out these emotions?
JOEY LOGANO: Just the playoffs. It just happens. It's part of it. Emotions run high.
