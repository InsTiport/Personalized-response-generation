 Q. Joey, P2 today here at the racetrack. Do you feel like possibly you and your teammate, Keselowski, might have used up your tires a little bit battling so hard earlier in the final run?  
JOEY LOGANO: No. We were going to battle for the lead. Clear air meant a lot once the tires wore out. You're battling trying to get it.   
No, we didn't wear our tires out a little bit. We only raced for two laps before the 18 blew our doors off and drove away from us. Fastest car in the race. We got a little bit of work to do.   
Solid run for the Auto Club Mustang here. You want to win at your sponsor's home track. Gosh, we came so close. Proud of the effort. Hung in there all day, hung strong. Just didn't have enough for the green car.
