 Q. You had a little bit of everything happen today. You had a pit road penalty, a broken jack at the end of the race. Was there no way this 22 car wasn't going to win today?   
JOEY LOGANO: I guess not. Man, we had a really good car, really good ShellâPennzoil Mustang. We had more things go wrong today. Unfortunate situation with the jack brake. No one's fault.   
Had some good restarts, get ourselves back up there, being aggressive, having some tires there towards the end. I knew racing Kevin was going to be hard. I was figuring I was going to get hit, so I throttled up in the corner so much, I thought he was going to give me the bumpânârun, which I expected, wouldn't blame him for. I'm out of breath.   
That was a pretty intense last 30 minutes or hour of the race. A lot going on. Couldn't be more proud of this team. Two wins already in the books. We got to keep this thing rocking.
