 Q. Congratulations. Similar to what happened in the Las Vegas. Your restarts were really wild. Had a little contact with your teammate there, Brad Keselowski. What did you learn today that you could take into November by winning this race, the performance you had, because this is where the championship is going to be won?  
JOEY LOGANO: You think I'm going to tell you that (laughter)?   
Definitely, everybody learned something out there today just whether it's racing, the way this traction compound is, the awesome sauce up there, how that worked out, played throughout the race. There's a lot learned, for sure.   
We learned that this No.22 ShellâPennzoil Ford team is just stout and is not going to get beat if we have the opportunity. We tried everything we could to regain our track position and get control back of the race. I knew that last restart was going to be crazy.   
I have to thank my partners, Moneyline, Auto Trader, AAA, Ford, CocaâCola, Snapâon, everybody that helps this program at Team Penske. RoushâYates motors. It was cool to see two Fords on the front row at the end of a race like that. This is a motor racetrack as much as we don't think it is.   
Proud of the team effort today to make this one come.
