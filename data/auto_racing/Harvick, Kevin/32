 Q. Obviously solidly in the playoffs now, Kevin, but what more can this win do for this team and for SHR as a whole?  
KEVIN HARVICK: Well, we've run well enough a few times this year to win, and we've just made mistakes, and to finally battle and get over that hump is a great day for everybody at Stewart‑Haas Racing, everybody on the 4 car.   
I was really questionable about how that was going to go, and the thing took right off. The only thing that was not good for us waswe got the traffic and my car started pushing. I knew he was going to take a shot. I would have taken a shot. I just stood on the brakes and tried to keep it straight. I just didn't want to get him back on the inside and let him have another shot. I at least wanted to be in control of who was going to have contact in 3 and 4.   
It was a heck of a finish, closer than we wanted, but like you said, it was our only chance. I would have never done it, but that's why he's on the box and not me.   
   
 Q. Let's talk to Rodney, the man who made the call to leave him out. What gave you the confidence that he was going to be able to hold off fresher tires behind him?   
RODNEY CHILDERS: Well, I felt like we had had a great car all weekend, and everybody had been doing a good job, and we were just in a bad spot there with track position, and I didn't think we were going to win from where we were at. Sometimes you have to make those decisions, and Kevin did a great job on the restart and holding his own, and that track position was key today, clean air, and just really proud of everybody at Stewart‑Haas Racing and everybody at Ford and everybody that has pushed hard for us all year to try to get our cars better and to get back in Victory Lane.
