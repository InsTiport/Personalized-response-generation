  THE MODERATOR: Now joined by our fourth‑place finisher, driver of the No.4 Jimmy John's Ford, Kevin Harvick. Kevin, exciting race throughout from the beginning, and you guys were right up there battling the whole time. Talk to us a little bit about that. 
KEVIN HARVICK: Yeah, we just‑‑ it was kind of up and down as far as where you were against the championship guys. There at the end, we just got a hole in the nose and had a tire equalize and all kinds of stuff happen right about dark, and we never got it back 100 percent right to really do what we needed to do, really at any point during the run. We were just kind of treading water there. The last run really, really loose. They did a great job. Just really proud of everybody on my team, and they did a great job getting us to this point and having a chance, and gave it all we had right up until the end. Some points were good, some points were bad, and in the end it just wasn't quite good enough. 

Q. Are you at least able to feel good for Martin and everything that he's gone through to get to this point? 
KEVIN HARVICK: I mean, yeah, they've had the fastest car all year, so it was good to see him win.
