  KERRY THARP:   We'll go ahead and hear from our race runner‑up.   That's Kevin Harvick.   Kevin drove the No.4 Budweiser Chevrolet today here at Michigan.   Another tough one for you; maybe just talk about how things went out there today. 
KEVIN HARVICK:   I mean, the car was fast, just wound up on the wrong side of all the strategy.   We finished second, and that's it. 

Q.   Kevin, six of the top eight were Hendrick engines.   This is a pretty big track in terms of horsepower.   How well positioned are the Hendricks right now? 
KEVIN HARVICK:   I think it's pretty obvious.   Self‑explanatory.   Good question. 
KERRY THARP:   Kevin, thank you.   We'll see you at Sonoma.
