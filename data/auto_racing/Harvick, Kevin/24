 Q. Strong finish today. A lot of points to start the Playoffs. How would you assess the day?  
KEVIN HARVICK: Man, we always want to win, but just really got to thank everybody on this No.4 Stewart‑Haas Racing Mobil 1 Ford Mustang. These guys did a great job.   
We were way off when we got here this weekend. They just kept working. We qualified well. Wasn't where we wanted when we started the race. Got stage points, led there late, gave ourselves an opportunity.   
I knew the Gibbs cars would be tough. Martin was just so much better on the second half of the run. He made up that ground there, was able to stay close enough to us. My car started to get loose and push the front. It was just in kind of a four‑wheel drift.   
Got to thank Busch Beer, Jimmy John's, Mobil 1, Morton Buildings, everybody who helps us on this Mustang, just great job by our team.  
   
 Q. Were you impressed with the speed today?  
KEVIN HARVICK: Yeah, because we really had okay speed at the first race, but I still felt like the Gibbs cars were better than us. So we did some things this weekend that we probably will have to undo going forward. I think we can do a little bit better going forward.
