Q.   What's your assessment now that you have finished the regular season and looked at these final 10 races? 
KEVIN HARVICK:   Well, I think tonight with our whole Budweiser team was very important.   Our car was fairly a good ways off as we started the race at the beginning of the night, really loose, and by the end of the night I thought we were going to win the race as we came to pit road, and I thought we were getting ready to take control and have a chance to win there.   Just a good night from the guys on pit road, and when you can take an illâ€‘handling car and make it right, you know that everybody is communicating well and everybody is doing a good job trying to put the things in the car that you need.   Just been a good 26, solid 26 weeks for everybody on our Budweiser Jimmy John's Rheem Chevrolet, and hopefully we can put together 10 more.
