Q. Impressive speed in the car from the back to the front, and you almost walked away with another million dollar check. How would you describe this night? 
KEVIN HARVICK: A letdown. That's how you take the fastest car and don't win the race with it. You spot him the whole field, and just an incredible Busch beer Ford. Ryan and all these guys on the team just did a great job, and it was just unfortunate the way that pit road went tonight because it wasn't even close to anybody having a good car like we had tonight. So it was just a great night for performance, just a bad night on pit road.
