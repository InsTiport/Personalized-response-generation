Q. His position in the Championship 4 already established, this was a day when you didn't have to get a lot done. You ended up with a top 5; what kind of a day was it?
KEVIN HARVICK: Yeah, we were just average today. It was one of those days that weââ I thought we were not the best car throughout the weekend. I thought that the Gibbs cars definitely had the most speed and obviously that showed up in the race as you see the 11 and the 18 run up front all day, so it was definitely what we thought it would be, and we definitely have to go to work and get better here and on this style of racetrack.

Q. Was the momentum factor anything today? It wasn't a bad day. You're not going into Miami with a downside. 
KEVIN HARVICK: You know, the one thing about this particular year, it seems like you've had great weeks, you've had mediocre weeks, so that momentum thing is kind of hitâorâmiss as you go throughout it. Sometimes finishing fifth is almost like winning the race because you figured out how to make it through a day and make the most out of that day to finish fifth. I feel like that's what we did today, and sometimes those days are more rewarding than the days that are easy to win the race. 
But just really proud of everybody on our Mobil 1 Ford.
