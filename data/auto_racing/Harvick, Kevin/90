  THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and start with our post‑race availability for today's pure Michigan 400. We are now joined by our second‑place finisher, Kevin Harvick, driver of the No.4 Jimmy John's Chevrolet. Kevin, take us through the race and the last few laps. 
KEVIN HARVICK: Yeah, we had an up‑and‑down day, that's for sure. The first half of the race or so really struggled with the handling of the car. The guys did a great job of getting that, and then ran out of gas and came back and didn't lose a lap and were able to have a good enough handling car to drive back up through there and good everything go good. Just really proud of my team and everything that they did. I didn't have anything for the 20 today, but for everything that we overcame, it was still a good day. 

Q. Kevin, you're locked into the Chase, but what did you learn from today if there's anything that will help you really get ready for September? 
KEVIN HARVICK: Yeah, I would say we didn't really learn anything today. Not only is this racetrack nothing like what we race on in the Chase, it's just kind of a unique animal, and then you have the rules package. Today was really just about trying to win a race, and it's really not going to lend itself towards anything that we do in the last 10 weeks. 

Q. I understand the first race here at Michigan Speedway you run without the aero package, now with the aero package. Can you tell us something about the difference in handling?
KEVIN HARVICK: I'm really proud of my team and the things that they did to prepare for the race, and we had a good, strong day.
