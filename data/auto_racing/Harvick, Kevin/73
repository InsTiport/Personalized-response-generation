  THE MODERATOR: We will now begin our post‑race media availability for today's Bojangle's Southern 500. We are joined by the runner‑up of today's race, Kevin Harvick, driver of the No.4 Busch Beer Chevrolet for Stewart‑Haas Racing. Kevin, great car this evening, led a lot of laps here. Has to be very frustrating to be in this position, but could you walk us through how that unfolded from your position? 
KEVIN HARVICK: Yeah, we had a great car. The guys in the garage and at the shop continue to do a great job, and we continue to give it away on pit road. Pretty much summed up the night. Just the dominant car and just three bad pit stops on pit road. 

Q. Kevin, I know you're frustrated, but how do you fix these things this late in the season? What do you do? 
KEVIN HARVICK: Yeah, I really don't know. We have championship cars and we're just mediocre on pit road. It's kind of been that way for a few years, and they've moved some things around, but it just seems like it's just week after week after week. You have a couple good weeks here and there and every once in a while you just put together a day, but they just can't put together a whole day on pit road right now.

Q. How do you balance trying to be a cheerleader‑‑
KEVIN HARVICK: I'm over being a cheerleader. Those guys get paid a lot of money to perform on pit road, and cheerleading hasn't really been working. You've got to get after it on pit road and do your job.
