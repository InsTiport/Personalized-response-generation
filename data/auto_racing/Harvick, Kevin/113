Q.   People are saying that if there's going to be a team, maybe a driver to unseat the Hendrick guys this year, it could be you.   How strong do you think this team could be as the Chase begins?
KEVIN HARVICK:   I think we definitely have the race cars to do it.   We still have some hiccups on pit road that aren't very good at this point of the year that you have to address in order to beat those guys week in and week out.   I don't know what our plans are for that as we move into the next 10 weeks, but our race cars are as fast as they need to be, and everybody is doing a great job and bringing fast cars to the racetrack.   If it all comes together, I feel like we can do what we have to do on the racetrack to win a championship, and I know those guys can do it on pit road, but we have to be more consistent to make that happen. 
We'll see, just got to thank everybody from Jimmy John's and Budweiser and Outback and everybody who makes it possible to put this race car on the racetrack and really everybody at SHR for building a brand new team this year and making it possible to do what we need to do to even talk about racing for a championship.   We're excited and looking forward to 10 weeks. 

Q.   How do you fix the problem you're talking about on pit road?   What would you do?
KEVIN HARVICK:   Well, you know, you've got to have faster pit stops.   I don't really know where that problem lies.   I know we have a lot of people that work on those things in the shop, and I know the guys building the race cars and everybody at the racetrack is doing what they have to do, and they've got to figure it out.
