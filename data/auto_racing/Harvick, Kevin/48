  THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Kevin Harvick, driver of the No.4 Busch Beer Ford, who finished fourth and led the most laps at 89 laps today. Take us through that final stop and restart. 
KEVIN HARVICK: We had a good car all day, just came down to really losing control of the race on the last pit stop. Really not pitting or pitting didn't really seem to matter. We lost control to the 18 and wound up losing a couple more spots on the restart starting on the inside, and that was the end of the day. Car was fast and everybody did a great job, it just didn't work out. 

Q. You kind of touched on it there, that decision not to pit didn't hurt as much as not having the track position with clean air. Were you surprised by the fact that the tires didn't play into it as much as maybe years past? 
KEVIN HARVICK: Not really. I mean, it just‑‑ with all the restarts and everything and everybody sitting there cooling their tires off, I think everything kind of evened out.
