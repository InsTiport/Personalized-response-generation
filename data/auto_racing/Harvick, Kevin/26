 Q. Kevin Harvick climbs out to huge cheers here at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The whole team is on the wall behind him. Kevin, you put on a show today. Congratulations. You have won the Brickyard 400 again.   
KEVIN HARVICK: Yeah, this is great. Got to say thanks to all the fans. Can't tell you how much‑‑ yeah, that's great. How much coming to Indianapolis means to me, as a kid I watched Rick Mears win Indy 500s and got to be around him as a kid, and he was my hero, so coming here and winning here is pretty awesome.  
   
 Q. You saw your whole team climb down here. What do these guys mean to you?   
KEVIN HARVICK: Well, they built a great race car. Just got to thank everybody from‑‑ can't say enough about everybody on this Mobil 1 Ford Mustang. These guys on this race team, they built a heck of a race car. This is the same stuff that we took to Michigan and had a real good weekend there, obviously, and went to Victory Lane. So to come here to the Brickyard, I know how much this means to Rodney and Dax and all these guys that work on this car because we've been so close to winning here before.
