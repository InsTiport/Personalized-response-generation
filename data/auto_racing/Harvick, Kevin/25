Q. You mentioned it, Indianapolis Victory Lane, some hallowed ground. And this is how you celebrate your second Brickyard 400. I know this place brings so much emotion for you, your hero Rick Mears won here four times. What does the second win at the Brickyard 400 mean for you and this 4 team heading into the playoffs?
KEVIN HARVICK: Well, I know how much it means to everybody on our Mobil 1 Ford Mustang team. Just got to thank Busch beer, Jimmy John's, Hunt Brother, Haas Automation, everybody at Stewartâ€‘Haas Racing, all these guys that make this car go around, I know how much this means to really everybody, and this is a great engine package that Roush Yates has been to Victory Lane twice now, once at Michigan and the same engine here. That's a huge credit to those guys and Mobil 1 for everything that they put under this car. Just can't thank everybody enough. This is awesome. I kept telling myself, get the baby girl a trophy. Good weekend to come, so she doesn't really quite know what's going on, just a lot of noise, but pretty special.

Q. For you guys to win the pole, dominate like you did, what kind of statement is that in the final race of the regular season heading into the playoffs?
KEVIN HARVICK: Yeah, I don't know if we had the best car but we had the fastest car. We gave up the lead there on one of those restarts and then we came and pitted and the caution came out, and it worked our way. We've given so many away just because of circumstances here, and the way that the caution flag fell today actually worked in our favor. It gave us control of the race and we were able to keep control of the race and not make any mistakes and here we are in Victory Lane at one of the greatest places on earth to race.
