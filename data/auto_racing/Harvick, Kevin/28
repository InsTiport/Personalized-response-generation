 Q. That's way better than a burnout, isn't it?   
KEVIN HARVICK: That's way better than a burnout. The coolest thing is we've spent the last couple summers together. He wants to go get the flag. He told me before the race, if I win today I can get in the car again, right? I'm like, yeah, I guess so. Just got to thank all the fans. You guys have been great to us. To come here with Mobil 1 and everybody from Ford and Hunt Brothers and Jimmy John's and everybody who's helped us‑‑  
   
 Q. I'm not sure who they're cheering on more, you or Keelan.   
KEVIN HARVICK: Well, they should cheer for him. Just got to thank everybody from Fields and Haas‑‑ who else do we got to thank, Kee? Hunt Brothers, Mobil 1, Jimmy John's, Busch, Haas, everybody at the shop. Everybody. Takes a lot of people to make these cars go round, and winning races is what it's all about. Just can't do it without all you guys. I mean, to come here to Michigan and win for Ford, and I know how much Mobil 1 likes to beat that Shell car, so that was cool.
