 Q. Kevin Harvick, you were up there in the hunt all day long, led 66 laps. Take me through the end, what you think the 22 maybe had just a little bit more.   
KEVIN HARVICK: He just had control of the race. After we pitted there, I got stuck behind a couple of cars there, lost five or six spots. He got by and got control of the race. He got to restart where he wanted to.   
Our Jimmy John's Ford was better, especially when we could put it in front of his. We just didn't get the control of the race back there, and he was able to get by us on that restart where I got hung up.
