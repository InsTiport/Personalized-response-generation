 Q. After that pole, Kevin, the confidence was there all weekend, but you have just punched your ticket to Homestead for a chance at another championship. Congratulations.   
KEVIN HARVICK: Oh, thank you. Just want to thank all these fans. Texas has always been so great to us, and what a racetrack the last few years. They brought a great Ducks Unlimited Busch Beer Ford to the racetrack this weekend, but I've got to thank everybodyââ got to thank Mobil 1, Haas, Fields, Hunt Brothers Pizza, Jimmy John's, everybody who helps put this car on the racetrack week in and week out, and all those guys in the race shop, Roush Yates engines for putting this engine in this last week, and so it's just been a lot of work put into this race. We knew this was a good racetrack for us. Felt like it fit the styles of our cars, and man, did it.  
   
 Q. Some of your teammates were some of the other fastest cars all night. Did you have that sign the whole time that you were going to get yourself that ticket to Miami?   
KEVIN HARVICK: Well, we got put back in the back there for the pit road violation, and I didn't really know what was going to happen. We had a bad restart after that, and then all of a sudden we got on a different set of tires and got on a different cycle, and wound up making our way back to the front. It was a fast car.
