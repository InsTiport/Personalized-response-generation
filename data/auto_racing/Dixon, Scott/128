THE MODERATOR:   We\'ll go ahead and get started with today\'s Verizon IndyCar Series post practice press conference.   We are pleased to be joined by Tony Kanaan.   Tony has one win here in 2010 and has also finished on podium in the last five races here at Iowa Speedway.   
Fastest today in practice, what have you figured out at this track that you may be able to bestow upon us?   
TONY KANAAN:   Can\'t tell you.   
I don\'t know, we\'ve just always been good here.   I think we have a pretty good setup.   The track suits my style.   The short ovals are definitely one of my strengths.   I think that\'s pretty much what it is.   
It\'s going to be a very close qualifying tomorrow, I think, especially with the weather.   It\'s going to be a lot hotter than it was this afternoon, so we\'ll see.   
So far I think we\'re pretty happy with the racecar so we\'ll see what\'s going to happen.   
THE MODERATOR:   Speaking of the heat, you look like you just ran a marathon.   What is the added physicality with this heat?   
TONY KANAAN:   It\'s tough.   But where I live, it\'s as hot as this.   That\'s what I train for.   It\'s definitely a lot of people going to have their hands full.   Definitely going to be a physical race, always is.   
THE MODERATOR:   We are joined by your teammate Scott Dixon.   
Scott, you won pole here last year, actually a qualifying two-lap record.   Best finish of third here.   You\'re also second in the points standings behind Juan Pablo Montoya.   Tell us a little bit about practice today and what you think we can expect in qualifying.   Do you think you might be able to repeat that pole?   
SCOTT DIXON:   You know, that\'s obviously the goal.   I think the Target Team has done a good job.   All four Ganassi cars are at the right end of the field so far.   
These sessions are so short, everybody trying to achieve different things makes it very confusing out there to see what people are actually trying to do.   
I think straight-out speed we\'re definitely okay.   The car seems decent in race trim.   The car isn\'t as fast as last year.   Whether it\'s the track, it\'s obviously extremely hot here this weekend.   With the ambient conditions and track temps way up, grip is going to be definitely key to the race.   
Yeah, you know, I don\'t know.   The car feels good, and hopefully last year I think Tony kind of got nabbed there from behind.   We were looking good for a 1-2 finish.   That late strategy with tires got on top of us.   
Hopefully we can be in the right situation at the right time and come through at the end this year.   
THE MODERATOR:   You are currently second in the points standings.   What is your mentality heading into the final few races?   
SCOTT DIXON:   To get as many points as possible and hope they have a problem.   That\'s kind of what it\'s going towards.   In Milwaukee it was kind of playing out that way till the shift in strategy, which didn\'t go our way.   
But, you know, it\'s still wide open.   I don\'t know how many points, 260 plus points on the table with four races to go, obviously double points at Sonoma.   It\'s wide open.   
But we\'re on the backside of it so we have to try to make some gains here quickly.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Tony and Scott.   

Q.   (Question regarding track temperatures and the tires.) 
TONY KANAAN:   It\'s hard to predict.   The race won\'t start until another hour or 50 minutes.   I don\'t think it\'s going to be as bad as it was this afternoon, to be honest.   I think we had the worst conditions.   Once the sun goes down, the track is going to cool off.   I don\'t think it\'s going to be as bad as it was today.   
THE MODERATOR:   We\'ll see in qualifying tomorrow, gentlemen.   Thank you.
