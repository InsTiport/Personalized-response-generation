 Q. How good a deal to bring it home, a strong run in front of a lot of family and friends in Texas?   
DANIEL SUAREZ: It was a solid day, for sure. Overall I want to just say that I'm very proud of Stewart‑Haas Racing, everyone that makes this possible. We've been working very hard to make our racecars better. Definitely we're heading in the right direction. Is the second week in a row that all Stewart‑Haas cars are in the top 10. That's something very good.   
Overall very proud of the 41 crew because we been working hard to slowly get better and better. We are showing that. This car was fast entire weekend. Just very proud of the effort. Hopefully we can keep heading in that direction and finish in Victory Lane one day here soon.
