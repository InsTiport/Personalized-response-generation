Q. Daniel SuÃ¡rez was third here in Texas back in the spring, third again here tonight, but led 25 laps. Ultimately where did your teammates that finished ahead of you kind of have you beat tonight? 
DANIEL SUÃREZ: I felt like they just had a little bit more raw speed. For whatever reason, I felt like a little bit better probably than them in the long run, but on the sticker tires, I just couldn't go as fast as them. It was taking me 15, 20 laps to actually get going, and by then they were gone. 
Overall just very proud of everyone at StewartâHaas Racing. The 41 Ford Mustang was pretty sporty. StewartâHaas Racing did an amazing job. We brought very fast race cars this weekend, and so it was fun. Hopefully we can have more weekends like this to finish over there in Victory Lane. 

Q. A lot of people have been asking questions about what the future holds for you. With question marks like that, how good does it feel and what does it mean to put up a performance like you did tonight? 
DANIEL SUÃREZ: I feel like honestly in the last few weeks we have had cars to perform the way that we performed today. But we have been with issues either on pit road or bad calls or stuff like that, but we've been pretty fast lately. We've been running up front, top 5, leading laps; Kansas was the same thing, Martinsville was the same thing. It was nice to finally have a good strong car with a clean day.
