   KERRY THARP: Ryan Newman is kind enough to join us, he is the driver of the number 39 U.S. Army Chevrolet for Stewart Haas Racing, and Ryan, certainly came up short in your bid to get in the Chase, but your thoughts about how things unfolded, maybe tonight, and just your thoughts right now.
 RYAN NEWMAN: Just a race at Richmond. Close to Top-10 and finished 11th. Obviously disappointed not to make the Chase but proud of the guys, we got a victory in Phoenix and did some things this year that we had not done. Unfortunately we will not have a shot at the championship but an opportunity to win in ten more races, and that's a lot of fun in itself. Looking forward to going to Loudon and congratulations to the 14 car. 
 Tony and his car did a good job rebounding through the season to make the Chase. 
 KERRY THARP: Ryan, we'll release you. Class act for coming in here tonight. Thank you.
