Q.   Describe how frustrating it is trying to work yourself in?
RYAN NEWMAN:   I wouldn't say it's frustrating.   The frustrating part is dealing with this whole system which makes no sense whatsoever.   It's hard to stand behind NASCAR when everybody I talk to up and down pit road doesn't understand why we're doing this. 
Maybe I need to be sat down and educated a little bit. 
Not what we wanted for our Caterpillar Chevrolet, no doubt, but we also avoided the next two crashes that come in qualifying, which should never occur.
