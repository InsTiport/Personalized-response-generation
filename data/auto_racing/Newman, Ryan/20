Q.   You were in and then the caution fell.   How do you describe what's going through your mind right now? 
RYAN NEWMAN:   I mean, I told Matt when we came into this race that we couldn't make up everything we've missed in the first 25. 
Now, winning would have changed everything and that last caution definitely hurt us, but we got killed on pit road, there's no doubt about that.   Carl and those guys beat us on four tires.   The guys that took two were just doing some strategy, but we should have been able to come off pit road first and come off pit road first if we were a championship contending team.   We needed a championship contending pit crew, and we didn't have that tonight.
