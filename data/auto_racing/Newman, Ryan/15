 Q.   Luke Lambert making his first Chase appearance, so we'll looking forward to seeing what you have.   What do you have for the Chase?   
RYAN NEWMAN:   We've shown a lot of consistency and I think that can pay off at times with the exception of Homestead, so if we make it that far, we'll hopefully have some improvements and a little bit of everything.   The guys are doing a good job of having better pit stops.   ECR is doing a much better job on the engine side.   Everybody has stepped up, and it's time to step up even more now.   I'd like to thank Caterpillar,   Quicken Loans,   Wix Filters and Kwikset, Chevrolet, Sprint, everybody for this opportunity, Richard Childress for giving me this opportunity to drive this race car and we'll go see if we can make the best of it.   Luke has done a great job.   All these guys have done a great job, and again, as I've said before, this will be some of our first time going back to the racetrack for the second time, and that can mean some good news for us..
