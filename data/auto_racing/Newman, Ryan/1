Q. Sevenâoneâthousandths of a second there. You came out smiling. Take me through the final moments. 
RYAN NEWMAN: I mean, just close. I told Aric, I said they spent $50 million redeveloping this place. I should have threw in 50 bucks for them to move the start/finish line, repainted it or something. 
It was a great run for our Wyndham Rewards Ford. Everybody at RoushâYates, Roush Family Racing. All the team effort that went into it was good. 
I mean, we just came up that little bit short. I don't know what else to say. I could have pinched him some more. I could have probably took the aero. You can go back and bench race that three weeks from now. It was a good race until the end. 
I saw the guys spinning in the back. I was hoping for a yellow, but there wasn't.

Q. What is the feeling at the end of this one? Playoff spot secured. 
RYAN NEWMAN: That's special to just have a good run. We had a good team effort today. Overcame a lot of obstacles. Cars flying on top of us, all that stuff.
Just proud of the team. Upset, disappointed we didn't close it out. But we survived it. That's a big part of this deal.
