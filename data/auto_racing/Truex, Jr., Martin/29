Q. Martin, third time at Sonoma, fourth time this season, you get to Victory Lane here. What an impressive run at the end of that race. Kyle had fresher tires, coming for you. How did you hold him off?
MARTIN TRUEX JR.: Just dug down deep, tried to be smooth, hit my marks. Luckily I was able to have a big enough gap where I could settle in, not feel too much pressure. It was definitely difficult. That was the longest run of the race there at the end for us on tires. It felt terrible the last 20 laps. Last 10 it was just like on ice, no grip anywhere. 
Just really proud of all these guys. Everybody on this Bass Pro Shops Camry, everybody at TRD, everybody back at JGR, all the fans, Auto Owners, everybody who makes this thing possible. 
What a season we turned this into. Want to say thank to DW for all you've done for us, buddy. Been an honor watching replays of you calling the races and stuff. Been a big fan a long time. I want thank you for all that, wish you all the luck going forward. 
This group, man, they're unbelievable. Hopefully we can keep this going. 

Q. A number of drivers look at your data at this racetrack. They can't duplicate it. What have you figured out on this track that they can't?
MARTIN TRUEX JR.: I can't tell you that, man. C'mon. Through the years you've seen guys figure things out, it lasts a while. I wasn't sure this weekend how it was going to hold up, what we've been doing. With the carrousel, the big leftâ€‘hand corner, it really changed things up. Took a while to figure that out in practice. 
But luckily we were able to just make the right tweaks. I had confidence that when the track got hot and slick on the long runs, we've had what we needed. Just a matter if we had enough speed to get there, and we did today.
