 Q.   What an effort two weeks in a row, and tonight you made it.   You are in the Chase, my friend.   
MARTIN TRUEX JR.:   I'm speechless.   I don't even know what to say.   Just to proud of Chad and my guys.   We were terrible tonight.   I mean, just terrible, terrible on long runs and we fought and we fought last like last week.   Last week we were tailing along just fine with 100 to go and almost won and finished third and tonight, I don't know how that happened.   Good Lord was on our side tonight.   My guys did a good job and now we can go back and regroup and start back from zero.   Go get 'em.  
   
 Q.   With 20 laps to go, Jeff Gordon ran you down, then your crew chief said you've got to keep the 24 behind you.   How did you do it?   
MARTIN TRUEX JR.:   I don't know, I really don't.   My tires were shot.   It wouldn't turn.   I couldn't touch the gas.   It was like I don't know how on my tires.   I don't know how.   I don't know how I kept him behind me.   I tried to run where he was running, tried not to make mistakes.   I don't know.   Somebody was riding with me tonight.
