 Q. Martin led 15 laps today and then made a couple of good runs there, challenging for that lead there towards the end. How big of a factor did traffic play in this one today?   
MARTIN TRUEX JR.: It was about everything, to be honest with you. We got the lead there, Stage 2, got that stage win, and then had a pit stop issue and lost track position, then we justââ the whole third stage we were behind. We were catching him at the end; we got close, but yeah, just unfortunate there. We win and lose as a team. The guys will clean it up, I'm sure, and it's cool to come home second after that as hard as it was to pass today.   
   
 Q. 54âpoint day today for you today. How does that ease some of the pressure as you head to Talladega next week?   
MARTIN TRUEX JR.: Yeah, it's good. Every week it's just about doing the best you can and getting all the points you can. Positive day for us today. You know, had a shot to win, come up short. Would have been nice to have that win and the free pass, but second is the next best, so good job to all the guys and good rebound on the pit crew, and just a good solid day here at Dover. Wish we could have won again, but that's the way it goes.
