 Q. A third‑place finish. Bottom line on that final restart? Was that the frustrating part?   
MARTIN TRUEX JR.: No, I felt like before that we were going to finish second no matter what. My mindset there was at least we got a shot at it here. Rack 'em up, have a green‑white‑checkered and see.   
I don't know, my second gear was off a little bit all day on restarts. I was getting Jonesed. Then the 22 went like a whole car length before the restart zone. I don't know how you get away with that. I thought we were supposed to go in the box.   
Aside from that, great day for Auto Owners Toyota, everybody back at JGR, TRD. We had a solid racecar. Man, you have to be so patient in this racing, it's really hard. Early in the race I kept getting runs, going underneath guys, getting them in the corner. If you can't clear them, you lose two, three, four spots every time.   
Everybody did a good job. We had a fill‑in rear tire changer this weekend. That's a lot of pressure to come in. He's a young kid, did a good job there. Great job by everyone.   
Came up a little bit short, but a solid day for us here.
