  MARTIN TRUEX JR.: Man, I don't know what to say, I really don't. I'm speechless, just an unbelievable job by all my guys. Toyota, TRD, Bass Pro, Auto Owners, everybody back at the shop, you guys built some unbelievable race cars right now. Had a heck of a race with Kyle and Denny all night long really, and we just kept plugging away at it, kept plugging away at it, as we always do. We just keep digging and we never quit. Next thing you know, catching the 18 for the lead, I'm like, cool, all right, here we go. Man, to sweep Richmond finally is pretty awesome, as much as we've led here coming into this year, and just thanks to everybody. It's pretty amazing.  
   
 Q. Unbelievable this redemption here at this track, the top four for Gibbs. It looked like there was no way Stenhouse was trying to slide you around, but somehow you spin, you keep your cool, you come back and win. How did you do that?  
MARTIN TRUEX JR.: Luckily I didn't hit anything. I just tried to keep it off the fence, tried to get spun around and get going, and we ended upââ because we were pretty far up front, we got going in a pretty good spot and left pit road in a good position and then good adjustments at the end again by Cole and James and the guys. This is just freaking unbelievable, so we came here to get bonus points and damn sure we did that.
