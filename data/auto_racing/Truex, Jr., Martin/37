Q. First track in which Martin Truex Jr. has won three times in this series. It's one of the places you call home. You're going to hope for rain every year when you come here to get a chance to race on Monday. How good does it feel to be back in Victory Lane at this place?
MARTIN TRUEX JR.: Man, it feels incredible. So thankful for this team. What a racecar we had today. Sirius XM Camry was just incredible. Thanks to everybody back in the shop, JGR, Bass Pro, Autoâ€‘Owners, everybody that supports us and makes this deal happen. We got one hell of a team. 
We came here with a new setup this time. We had an older setup from 2016. We'd been good, but not good enough. Hats off to Cole and James and everybody. Everybody at TRD back in California, Costa Mesa, for some awesome engines, awesome horsepower. 
Thanks to all the fans who come out on a Monday. This is awesome. 

Q. They say this is a tough place to pass. You started at the back, won by over nine seconds. You made it look easy. 
MARTIN TRUEX JR.: I promise, it wasn't easy. It was a lot of work. It was tough. This racecar, man, it was just incredible. Just thanks to everybody that makes this all possible, honestly. 
What a relief. I can't believe it. If we got Talladega, two in a row. Pretty special. New group of guys this year. Coach put together a good bunch, Cole and everybody. I'm really, really proud to drive these Toyotas. They're awesome. I'm a very lucky guy.
