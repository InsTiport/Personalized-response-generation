 Q. Sixthâplace finish today for Martin Truex Jr. Seemed like you guys never quite got the handling where you needed it on this 19 car, but bigger picture you've known for two weeks that you're going to be a part of the Championship 4. I asked you after the win in Martinsville how crucial, how beneficial these two weeks would be. You didn't know then. What do you know now?   
MARTIN TRUEX JR.: Well, I know we're ready for Homestead, and feeling really confident about that. Today we had a really strong car on the long runs, we just would get killed on restarts there. I was in a good spot on that last one to make a run at him, and went down into 1 and it just went straight. We fought that all day long, just took us too long to get going.   
You know, for having half a team and and old car and not really working on it, I thought we had a secondâ or thirdâplace car today, so that's pretty good. Excited for Homestead, and can't say enough about everybody back at JGR. To put three cars in the Championship 4 is pretty incredible, so thanks to TRD and Toyota and all those guys, Bass Pro, Auto Owners, everybody that helps us on the 19, and we'll see what we can do next week.  
   
 Q. You've got to like the odds of the team as a whole getting the win in Miami, but will it be like to go to the Championship 4 up against two of your own teammates?  
MARTIN TRUEX JR.: I'm not sure. We've raced against the 18 there a few times, and kind of quasiâteammates, but never under the same roof, so to speak. I'm not sure. It's going to be interesting for sure. I feel like we're here for a reason, and that's because we all work together so well, and hopefully we'll do that the same this week and throughout the weekend next weekend and then Sunday let the best team win.
