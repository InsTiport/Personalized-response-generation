 Q. How much fuel were you having to save there at the end? Was the 4 going to pass you guys?   
MARTIN TRUEX JR.: I don't know. I mean, hindsight it 20/20, right? It's hard to say. We were in good shape there. We had a good day overall. We weren't the fastest car. 18 and 11 was really strong. 20 was pretty good. Put ourselves in position to win. 11 got us there in the lap traffic.   
That was really the game changer because, I mean, had I been able to keep him behind me, the 20 was starting to back up and save more. Should I pass him yet? Should I pass him yet?   
The 11 got me in lap traffic. Once the caution came out, he had on the restart the outside. You can't do anything about it. Inside on the front row is just sitting ducks.   
We were lucky to maintain on both of those restarts starting on the bottom. Come home third was a good day. Good weekend overall for us.   
   
 Q. Between the restarts and the strategy, not knowing how much fuel you had to save, how tough was the game today behind the wheel?  
MARTIN TRUEX JR.: It's probably easier dealing with that kind of stuff when your crew chief is calling race strategy, has you on the right side of everything, than it is just to have to try to pass guys, maybe your car not be as good as you want.   
It wasn't a tough day. Our car was pretty good. Thanks to Bass Pro, Tracker, everybody back at TRD. Thanks, guys. We'll get after them in Michigan.
