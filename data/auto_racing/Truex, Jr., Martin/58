  MARTIN TRUEX JR.: He set the foundation for the rare few who capture the most coveted prize in motorsports, a championship at NASCAR's highest level. This driver had admirable talent but possessed even greater toughness and courage. He will always be the first, he will always be a pioneer, and now he'll always be a NASCAR Hall of Famer.

Here to induct red Byron into the NASCAR Hall of Fame, please welcome the Executive Director of the NASCAR Hall of Fame, Winston Kelley. 
WINSTON KELLEY: Thank you, champ. In Major League Baseball, it is the 1908 Boston Americans. For the NFL, the 1933 Chicago Bears, in the NBA, the 1948 Philadelphia Warriors, and for NASCAR it is Robert Red Byron in 1948. The common denominator of each is they are the first champions in their respective professional sports leagues. One thing is crystal clear: Red Byron's pioneering spirit, contributions and accomplishments solidify his legacy and rightful place in the NASCAR Hall of Fame. 
And now it is my honor on this the 19th day of January, 2018, to formally induct Red Byron into the NASCAR Hall of Fame. Here to accept on his behalf are family members Betty, Beverly, and Samual Byron.
