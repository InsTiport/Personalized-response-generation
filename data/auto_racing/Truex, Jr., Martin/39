Q.  Martin, congratulations, man. What a heck of a drive. We're all really happy for you to get that first short track win. We were talking up here at the end that that looked like one of the best drives that we've ever seen you do, so the reason is we know how difficult it is to be inside that car with those guys bearing down on you, but explain to everybody who's watching how disciplined you have to be and how difficult a situation that was. 
MARTIN TRUEX JR.: You know, it's really tough, and I don't know how you explain it other than it's like driving in the snow and trying to hit a line of six to eight inches in the center of the corner. It's just lack of grip, not‑‑ the car wasn't doing anything I wanted it to do that last run. We got really, really tight. 
Being out front was really the key, and just trying to do all I could to not screw up and hold those guys off, but it was definitely really, really difficult. 
Thanks to everybody on the team, man. It's been an up‑and‑down start to the year, but I feel like we've got a great team and we can continue to do this.
