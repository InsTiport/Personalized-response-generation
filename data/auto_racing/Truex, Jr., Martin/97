 Q. We had to wait a while, but we're about ready to take the green flag next week and get going. What are you expecting?  
MARTIN TRUEX JR.: I don't know yet. You know, I'm really excited about being back in the Chase again. I'm excited for Cole and all the guys at Furniture Row Racing. They've done a really great job this season to come from where we were last year to what we've been able to do this season was really great, and just looking forward to continuing that momentum. I think that we've got the speed to do it. We've got what it takes to get far in this thing, it's just a matter of executing and getting the job done, not making mistakes, and if we don't have too much bad luck along the way, I think we've got the speed to get real far in this thing, so looking forward to it.  
   
 Q. You've had the consistency, too.   
MARTIN TRUEX JR.: Yeah, honestly with crashes and flat tires and hitting oil and things like that the last month‑and‑a‑half or so, aside from that stuff, it's really been flawless. Again, fast race cars make that possible, and certainly we're going to have to find some more speed and step it up for the Chase, everybody is. There's a lot of cars that are really fast right now, and we feel like we're not quite where we were in the middle of the summer, so we've got some work to do but excited about the opportunity. Hopefully we can do some great things.
