Q. Martin, as they came around, as you all came around a lap after the green, what did you feel when you had Joey Logano stuffed up under your bumper?
MARTIN TRUEX JR.: I didn't feel the rear tires on the ground, I'll tell you that much. Just trying to hold it straight and not let him to my outside going into 1, so that's kind of what I was trying to do. But man, just what a race. Up and down, you never know what can happen in these things, and we were so good early on, blew that tire, hit the fence, and I'm like, we're done. How are we going to fix this thing; I didn't know how bad it was. But the guys worked hard, fixed it up. Bass Pro Shops, Auto Owners, TRD, Toyota, everybody, thanks to them to make this happen, and this guy is really special to me, Johnny Morris. Without him, I wouldn't be here, and he's got a special message for somebody because this is a great holiday. 
JOHNNY MORRIS: It is, and thanks to NASCAR for celebrating America and our Patriots, our veterans. All day I was thinking about my dad, Martin. He was in the Battle of the Bulge in World War II, and he never told me about it until later in life. I've got a nephew that just came back from a deployment. 
But there's no place like America, and thanks for helping us celebrate it and making us so proud, you and Coach Gibbs, everybody. Love this sport. 
MARTIN TRUEX JR.: That was awesome, and Nicholas Null, the armed service member that lost his life that's on our car, really special. I got to meet some of his family today, and they were just so honored that the teams and NASCAR did this, and just what a special day, what a special weekend. That's really what it's all about, and this victory is just a little bit extra special.
