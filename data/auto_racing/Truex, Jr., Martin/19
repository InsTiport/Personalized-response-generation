Q. Martin, how much redemption is this win for what happened here last year? 
MARTIN TRUEX JR.: I don't know. I mean, that was completely unrelated to today in my opinion. Luckily we were just able to do all the right things, and I didn't feel great about our car after practice and we made a lot of changes on it, so hats off to James and Cole for making the right changes. I'm just proud to win here. This is a big, big race for anyone in this sport. Grandfather clock coming home with me, baby. I never would have thought it. 
Just hats off to everybody on this team back at the shop, TRD, everybody at Costa Mesa; put a beatâdown on that engine right there, and she still sounded pretty good, so thank for that. But Bass Pro, Auto Owners, everybody that helps us, Interstate, Textron, Garmin, just everybody that makes this possible. I'm a lucky guy to drive for these guys, and hopefully we can spend the next two weeks getting ready to go to Homestead and do this again.

Q. The first to be locked into that Championship 4, how big is that advantage? 
MARTIN TRUEX JR.: I'll let you know in three weeks. I really don't know. We've never done it this way. We've always pointed our way in through the third round. This is the first time we've won at one of these tracks, so I mean, they still give out trophies and money the next two weeks, we're going to go after them.
