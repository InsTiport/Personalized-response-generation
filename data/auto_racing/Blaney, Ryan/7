Q. Walk us through the final lap. 
RYAN BLANEY: We pushed Newman there to the lead, and then we got a push from the 11, and I made a move off 4 on Newman and he blocked it and I kind of went low and he blocked that, so then I was committed to just pushing him to the win and trying to have a Ford win it, and I don't know, we just got bumpers hooked up wrong and turned him. I hope he's all right. Looked pretty good. Definitely was trying to push him to a win. I don't want to say those things happen. I feel really bad about it. Man, but close one. But I hope Ryan is all right.
