 Q. What a team you had today, what an effort today.   
RYAN BLANEY: Yeah, I mean, an amazing effort the last two days, to be honest with you. From spinning out early yesterday, missing some big ones today, weave our way through.   
I can't thank Aric at the end for helping me out. That big push that Newman and the 11 got, I knew I wasn't going to be able to block it. They were coming so fast, they would have split me.   
I wanted to stay to the bottom. I kind of pulled the 11 off of the 6 there. Just had a big enough run to get to the 6. We kind of hit above the line, kind of pushed me below the line. That's a big judgment call. You never know.   
I definitely wasn't going to go below the line before we hit, made contact.   
I can't say enough about this Dent Wizard team. Super fun the last couple days. Moving on, pretty cool.   
   
 Q. Talladega, so historic. What does it mean to win here?  
RYAN BLANEY: It just means a ton. I've been coming here ever since I was really young. Watching dad run here a lot, watching him run pretty good here a lot. Drive for the Wood Brothers here. Man, a cool feeling. This new infield, special to be in this new Victory Lane. I love coming here. Love it even more now.
