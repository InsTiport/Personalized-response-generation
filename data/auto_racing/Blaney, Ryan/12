Q. Ryan, third place, talk about your day. 
RYAN BLANEY: Kind of a smooth day for us. Qualified decent. The way the stages are, you can either choose to finish the stage out, get stage points, but you have to restart way in the middle of the pack, or pit early. That's kind of the strategy we wanted to do. 
Today even though you hate giving up stage points, you just get yourself ahead of all the mess. You can kind of get in your own rhythm, do your own thing, not have to worry about someone behind you and in front of you all the time. 
A real decent day for our PPG Ford Mustang. Those top two guys were just gone. All the Gibbs cars looked pretty good. They got something figured out. 
Overall not a bad day. A smooth one. What we need, hopefully we can just keep going.
