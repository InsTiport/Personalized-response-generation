 Q. What is going through your mind when Kyle is stalking you?  
RYAN BLANEY: Honestly we hung on better there on two tires than I thought we would. Fired off really good. Got Kyle a little bit. I was kind of riding trying to save tires, save gas. They were telling me we were really close on gas just doing two. I think he was kind of riding back there, too. I think they knew what situation I was in. Started to get real tight.   
I got the lap cars, I was done. Then when we got past the lead, just fullâ€‘on fuel save mode. A good recovery. We had to come back in for a wheel that was going to be loose. Two tires was the right call. I don't think we would have run third if it wasn't for that.   
A shame we couldn't get MoneyLion and Ford to win. It definitely is a good weekend after the start of the year we've had. This is where this team deserves to run. Hopefully we can just keep moving forward.
