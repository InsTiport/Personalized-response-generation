   THE MODERATOR: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us for today's Indy Racing League teleconference. Our guests today are joining us to talk about the one-year anniversary of the unification of open-wheel racing under the IndyCar Series banner. On February 22nd of last year, the unification agreement was signed, and five days later a press conference was held at Homestead-Miami Speedway in conjunction with the first open test of the season. 
 Now one year later, the IndyCar Series is preparing to head back to Homestead for testing next week. There will be nearly a dozen Firestone Indy Lights rookies on track Monday, followed by the full-field on Tuesday. The IndyCar Series will be on track under the lights on Tuesday and Wednesday, with the rookies getting some time on track on Monday night. 
 Also on Monday, the IndyCar Series will stage a major photo op at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami. Past champion Scott Dixon, Dario Franchitti, Dan Wheldon and Tony Kanaan will pose with a giant sand sculpture of the IndyCar Series trophy, and that is scheduled for 3 o'clock. 
 Joining us now this afternoon are Terry Angstadt, the president of the commercial division of the IndyCar Series, Eric Bachelart, owner of Conquest Racing, and Graham Rahal, driver for Newman/Haas/Lanigan Racing. 
 Terry, let me ask a question of you first to get us started. Obviously it's been an eventful year for the IndyCar Series with the unification, all that brought about. Can you take a quick look back for us and also a look ahead to 2009 what we can expect. 
 TERRY ANGSTADT: Thanks, Tim. Be happy to. 
 I think the look back is really an easy one. That was the pride I think everybody felt when we had the number of cars, 26 cars or so, on track at our opening race. You really can%
