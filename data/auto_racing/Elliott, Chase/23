Q. That was an awesome job. How does that feel to get out of the car, you've won some races before, but to win in front of a crowd that was cheering like this, that had to feel amazing? And could you have held off Bowman if it went all the way?
CHASE ELLIOTT: That was one of the coolest things ever. This crowd was absolutely insane. Just glad we could get Mountain Dew, Little Caesars, and Chevrolet, a lot of Chevrolet teamwork done today. Hendrick power was incredible. NAPA, Kelley Blue Book, Valvoline and Hooter's, all the people that make this deal go around. 
It was a really crazy day, wellâ€‘executed day on the Chevrolet teams' behalf. Proud of that effort. That last lap was going to get wild. I don't know exactly what Alex had up the sleeve. I know he was coming with something. 
We'll take it. Unbelievable feeling. The crowd was intense. We're proud to get it done for them.
