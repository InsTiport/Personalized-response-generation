  THE MODERATOR: We are joined by our second‑place finisher Chase Elliott, driver of the No.24 Mountain Dew Chevrolet. Chase, a really strong run out there, obviously not quite the finish you were looking for, but you do move on to the Round of 12, so what does that mean for you and your team?   
CHASE ELLIOTT: Not as much as the disappointment today, so that's‑‑ man, such a bummer, such a disappointment for my team. I don't really have a whole lot to add.   
   
 Q. Chase, did you feel to the very end you have enough to hold on, or could you sense that he was coming?   
CHASE ELLIOTT: It was all just lap traffic dependent. I thought if I had a clean track, I could have run as fast as he did, but I didn't, and I should have done something different. So that's just on me, and he did a better job than I did. At the end of the day that's what it comes down to.   
   
 Q. Jimmie said that he said some stuff to you; does that make it any easier for you, knowing that other people have been there, too?   
CHASE ELLIOTT: Well, you know, I certainly appreciate his friendship and him willing to come over and talk to me, but yes, I think that kind of shows the kind of person he is, but it doesn't fix my lack of performance this afternoon.   
   
 Q. Chase, any solace in the fact that you and Jimmie did run up front and Jimmie said you could see the front for the first time in a while, that Hendrick is at least starting to make a push?   
CHASE ELLIOTT: Yeah, I mean, I hope so. I hope. I mean, I don't know. If I knew the future, I'd go lay some money down in Vegas or something, but I don't know. So we'll see.
