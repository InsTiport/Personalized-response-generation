Q. Chase, you heard it on the radio, how important this win was for this team, for Chevrolet, for Chase Elliott. Chevrolet waited since last October, their last win. They did it in thrilling fashion. What do you have to say to the fans?
CHASE ELLIOTT: Just thank you. What a day, just a huge thanks to all of our partners, my team, Hendrick Motorsports, Chevrolet obviously. A lot of teamwork done today. Big thanks to Mountain Dew, Little Caesars, NAPA. 
You guys up there, you're really what makes it happen, thank you. 

Q. You and Alan talked this morning about the Chevrolet meeting. Alan Gustafson said something is different this time, we are going to make it work. How important was that today?
CHASE ELLIOTT: It was huge. We just had a plan, executed it really well. Obviously could have gone both ways. Fortunately everybody stayed together, stayed the course, had some help on that last lap with a caution. 
Appreciate all the support, man. This is unbelievable. This is close to home for me, so feels a little bit like a home race.
