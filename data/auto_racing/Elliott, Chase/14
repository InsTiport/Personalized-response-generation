Q. What was going through your mind on the final few restarts? Under the impression you had to win to get in. 
CHASE ELLIOTT: I was under the impression. I was trying to make a run at Denny. We never got our momentum up enough for me to do anything about it. The restarts was helping his cause on tires. 
The good news was the bottom lane rolled good enough on the last restart to at least get back to second. So I appreciate the effort. We were really struggling there at one point in the race. You have to stay fighting in these things, especially with these lateârace restarts. 
Just proud of the effort today. Just excited we get to fight another race. Back up against the wall, to come out here and battle for a win, that's what you have to do when you're in the position that we were in. 
If you ever get to Homestead, you're going to have to fight for a win down there. Proud of the effort. Learned a lot. To be able to come out here and, like I said, in our minds have to win, come and fight for one, to finish second, I think is step in the right direction for us. So excited to move on. 

Q. Second half of the race, that's when the car started to struggle. You got updates. How then did you turn it for the final two runs?
CHASE ELLIOTT: I mean, really just the restarts, I feel like were saving us. If it had gone green, I don't know that I was going to finish second. So just a lot of good fortune there to have cautions when we did, to make the most of those restarts. 
Guys had a heck of a pit stop on the last one to put us in the position we did. A total team effort. 
Get to move on, get to reset the points, put those three wins that we had in the bank, use those points for the Round of 8.
