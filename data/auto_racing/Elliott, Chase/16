 Q. A massive burnout from the tire wall that got him, and the fans are going crazy, proving why this guy keeps getting voted the ost popular driver in the sport. That restart the tires got up on you. You never checked up. Congratulations. How did you do that?   
CHASE ELLIOTT: Holyâmoley. Did y'all like that? (Applause.)  
Oh, my gosh. What a mistake, holyâmoley, you talk about messing something up, right here, don't do that. What a day. Such a fast NAPA Camaro ZL1, and honestly that was the only reason we were able to get back in it. I pretty well blew it and got the cautions at the right time and brought it home. Thank you, guys. Y'all made a hell of a lot of noise there.
