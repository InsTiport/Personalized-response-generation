 Q. Coming on the heels of that epic burnout, and I can tell you that the team loved that one. Chase, from the moment where you said, "I can't believe I did that," putting it into Turn 1, to this, how much redemption is this win?   
CHASE ELLIOTT: Yeah, holyâmoley. I don't even know. I mean, I couldn't believe I did that. That was just so stupid. I mean, if you couldââ I don't know that you could have done anything more stupid leading this race than what I did right there. Obviously I was just really pissed off, and luckily our car wasn't too bad, and our NAPA Camaro was fast enough to drive up through there, got the cautions at the right time, and just didn't quit. If there's ever a lesson to not quit, today was the example.  
   
 Q. How does this send the message to the competition, as fast as this hotrod was today and picking up that win here in the first round of the playoffs?  
CHASE ELLIOTT: Yeah, it's our last road course, so the biggest thing is I think we have six more bonus points to continue forward with. A win is awesome. It doesn't get any better than that. There's no feeling like winning one of these races.   
Appreciate all our partners, everybody that helps us on this car, Hooters, Mountain Dew, Kelley Blue Book, Valvoline, Chevrolet. Obviously had great power today to drive back up through there. What a day. Somebody in the media the other day asked me if this would be like an upset if a guy from Georgia came up here to North Carolina and won, and I never really thought about that, but now that he says that, I kind of like it. We'll take this one back to Georgia. For me and all my guys here, we're going to celebrate and enjoy it. These wins are too hard to get not to enjoy, and just happy we could overcome a lot of adversity.
