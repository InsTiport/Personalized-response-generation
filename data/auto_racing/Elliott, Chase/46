  THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by our Sunoco Rookie of the Year in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, driver of the No.24 NAPA Auto Parts Chevrolet for Hendrick Motorsports, Chase Elliott. You finished up your initial campaign in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series with 10 top 5s, 17 top 10s and two poles this season. Talk a little bit about your season. I think you had a pretty good view of what happened here tonight. 
CHASE ELLIOTT: Yeah, well, first off, how about Jimmie Johnson. That's incredible. He's the story. I don't need to be sitting up here right now, seven championships versus Rookie of the Year. You guys need to be watching him.
But I'm proud of our season for sure. I'm definitely proud to earn the Rookie of the Year honors. It's been a long season, a lot of ups and downs, but we're happy to be here and definitely enjoyed racing against those guys for the Rookie of the Year this season. Felt like it was a fun group, and we're excited to get on to season two. 

Q. After 36 races, do you feel like a veteran now and ready to get the yellow stripe? 
CHASE ELLIOTT: Far from. Good news is I don't have to go to any more rookie meetings, which is nice. Beyond that, it really‑‑ I think you learn things as you go, but I can't see the back bumper, so I don't know what's there or not. I think you just kind of learn from experiences and things you encounter along the way, not so much whether it's your first year or first race or whatever it is. I think it's more of an experience‑based kind of feel, whether you have that comfort moving forward. 
THE MODERATOR: Chase, congratulations on a fabulous campaign.
