  THE MODERATOR: We'll begin our post‑race driver availabilities here. We're joined now by our fourth‑place finisher, driver of the No.24 NAPA Auto Parts Chevrolet for Hendrick Motorsports. Chase, you led a whole lot of laps there, very exciting restarts, a number of times there where you are holding off challengers. Tell us a little bit about your run today. 
CHASE ELLIOTT: Yeah, just definitely really proud of our team and the work that everybody at Hendrick has put in. I felt like we had really four really fast cars today. I hope that's a good sign for races to come. We certainly had I feel like one of our best days of the year personally. I thought for us to be able to contend and lead laps all day and have a car that could fight for the lead the majority of the day I thought was great. Obviously I made a big mistake there behind Dale in the tunnel after that restart. I wish I had been a little more patient and given ourselves a better chance, but you live and you learn. 

Q. It looked like on restarts any time you started out out front you were able to really pull away pretty easily there. Take me through those restarts because obviously behind you they got pretty wild. 
CHASE ELLIOTT: I mean, yeah, definitely. The lead is the best place to be. If you can clear those guys before you get to Turn 1, you kind of have whatever lane you want and you hope that the guys behind you are still two wide, and if that's the case they just don't have the air they need to run as fast of a corner. Just a big aero advantage to be out front. We see that every week.
