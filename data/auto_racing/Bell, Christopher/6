 Q. Tell us a little bit about how you're feeling heading into this weekend's championship.   
CHRISTOPHER BELL: I'm feeling great going into Homestead, especially after last weekend at Phoenix. I went into Phoenix knowing I had to beat 39 other competitors to win the race. This week I only have to beat three, so I'm feeling really good.  
   
 Q. Is there one piece of advice that your crew chief has given you heading into the weekend that you're really focusing on?   
CHRISTOPHER BELL: Don't change. Just make sure that we go in here and attack the same way that we've attacked all year and just do our best. If we go out there and perform to the best of our abilities, then that's all we can do.   
   
 Q. For your season as a whole, was there something different about this year in terms of your approach this year versus last year?   
CHRISTOPHER BELL: I don't think so. I think my approach has been really similar, and moving forward into next year, I'm just going to focus on controlling my DNFs. A lot of them have been outside my control, but just make sure that I don't make any mistakes that cause DNFs.
