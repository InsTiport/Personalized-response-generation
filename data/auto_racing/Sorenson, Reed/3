Q.   What is the game plan from here? 
REED SORENSON:   I have no idea.   We'll have to reevaluate and see.   We don't have a backup car as of now. 
As you can see, I was just trying to block.   That's what got Matt Kenseth to win last night.   I was doing everything I could to stay in front of Clint.   Pretty obvious what I was trying to do.   I didn't mean to wreck anybody or anything like that.
Just a product of this qualifying, trying to get that one lap.   I didn't want it to end that way, that's for sure.   I apologize to all the guys.   Try to get a car here and try to get in the race on Thursday.
