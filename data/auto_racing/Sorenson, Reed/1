Q. Reed Sorenson will now start the Daytona 500. For a small team, how big of a deal is this?
REED SORENSON: It's a huge deal. Just proud of all these guys at Premium Motorsports for putting this car together. They've been nervous for a couple weeks now. A lot of work gets put into these things. So proud of them that we made the race, and this kind of gets the ball rolling, like you said, for a small race team. So got a pretty blue car and maybe we can put some decals on it now with sponsors. Just really happy to be in the 500, and everything that happens from this point is icing on the cake, so we're going to try to go have fun and drive hard on Sunday.
