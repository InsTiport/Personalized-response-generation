Q.   (No microphone.)
NATALIE COUGHLIN:   No, I don't.   Life will go on.   That's why you don't see me freakin' out. 
I think a lot of people after the backstroke expected me to throw a little hissy fit, which is offensive, because it's just a race, and I was truly happy forBoots and Missy. 
The 100 free is one of my best events as well, so hopefully I'll do something special tomorrow night. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NATALIE COUGHLIN:   No‑‑ I mean, yes, but that's the nature of the sport.   It's racing. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NATALIE COUGHLIN:   Well, I hope people think of me as a good leader.   I've been the captain for several years, so as much as I can I want to help the younger ones, or the less experienced ones, and give them a little bit of perspective at least to this meet. 
This meet is kind of a horrible meet.   It's super exciting for the people making the team, but there is so much stress and anxiety in the air, and I just want people to enjoy it as much as possible and just give their personal best and that's what I'm doing. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NATALIE COUGHLIN:   Tomorrow.   One more race.
