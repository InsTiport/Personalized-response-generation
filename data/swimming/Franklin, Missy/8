 Q.   You made that look so easy.   How was that?   
MISSY FRANKLIN:   I'm so happy with my 200 Backstroke.   It felt really great.   It always hurts so bad at the end but if it doesn't you're not doing it right.   
The whole week has gone really well, just as well as Todd and I could have asked for; we're so thrilled.   I can't believe I have seven events.   
It's so overwhelming and so exciting at the same time, and I'm going to focus on the small things and hopefully be better in London.
