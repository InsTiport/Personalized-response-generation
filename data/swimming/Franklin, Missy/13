Q.   (No microphone.)
MISSY FRANKLIN:   I set that bar very, very high so the fact that I get to go out and be next to her and race her tomorrow night is going to be awesome for both of us. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MISSY FRANKLIN:   Absolutely, and the fact that there is such a young heat and amazing heat, there are so many incredible backstrokers that will be in that final tomorrow night. So I'm excited to get out there and race and see what we can do. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MISSY FRANKLIN:   I think it's impossible to take Natalie's spot.   I mean she's the best women's swimmer the sport has ever seen and probably ever will, so she's done her job and no one can really fill her spot. 
But hopefully to do an okay job with helping USA with its backstroke. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MISSY FRANKLIN:   I love how I feel right now, strong, and powerful. 
It's so awesome to feel this way and to be able to come here and do what I came to do.   Thank you so much.
