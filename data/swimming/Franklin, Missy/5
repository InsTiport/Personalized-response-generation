MISSY FRANKLIN: -- I would have had a little bit more of a shot, but I was just saying the point of this meet is to be the best of the best, and the best of the best is Olivia Smoliga and Kathleen Baker, and they're going to represent us in the best way possible, and I'm incredibly proud of them.
Q. How fatigued were you from the quick turnaround?
MISSY FRANKLIN: It was definitely tough, but it's what I'm used to doing, and I actually felt strong in that, so that gives me hope for my 200 moving forward, but that's a tough one.
Q. (No microphone.)
MISSY FRANKLIN: Definitely, you know, I think I am feeling more pressure than I ever have before, but that's all part of the process is learning how to deal with it and learning how to move forward, and all I can do is the best I can do, and I had a race strategy and I went out and I did it, and it just wasn't good enough this time.
Q. (No microphone.)
MISSY FRANKLIN: You know, I think so, you know, you definitely have a little bit more on your shoulders than normal, so it's going to be really hard not to be in that this summer, but, like I said, I cannot wait to watch how Olivia and Kathleen do and I can't wait to see what they're capable of.
Q. (No microphone.)
MISSY FRANKLIN: Right now I need to make the team in whatever way that looks like.  I need to make the team, and I'm going to do my best.
