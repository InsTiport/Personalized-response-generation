Q. (No microphone.)
MISSY FRANKLIN: My 100's just -- that speed just doesn't feel like it's quite there this meet.  No idea why.  It's super disappointing, but, you know, I really feel like my endurance is there, so it gives me a lot of hope for my 2 Back.
Q. Where did you find the last 50 meters last night?
MISSY FRANKLIN: I think I just found it from a lot of different places.  I think most importantly just believing in myself and knowing that I've put in this work and this year has been probably one of the hardest in my entire life, and I've already been through the challenges, and now this is the part I just need to enjoy and kind of reap the benefits from, and I believe able to do that last night.
Q. So you even surprised yourself a little bit?
MISSY FRANKLIN: I think so, yeah, and I couldn't have asked for it to go any better coming out of there with not only with the relay spot but with that individual swim as well.  That meant the world to me.
Q. Is that as deep as you've ever dug?
MISSY FRANKLIN: Probably.  Coming back from the night before, and being able to pull that out, I think that was the most heart I have ever had in any race, so, like I said last night, I think it was probably one of the most proud races of my entire career.
