Q.   (No microphone.)
MISSY FRANKLIN:   I've waited so long for this.   I can't believe it's happening right now.   I'm so happy. 

Q.   What does it mean to get an American Record like that? 
MISSY FRANKLIN:   It was a perfect way to top it off. 
I would have been happy with anything, but for the first time to get an American Record and make the team, it's just a dream come true. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MISSY FRANKLIN:   It means everything to me, and I can't even tell you guys. 

Q.   How do you feel? 
MISSY FRANKLIN:   I feel so great right now.   I felt awesome in the race. 
It was so much fun being able to race Rachel, and I had a blast while I was out there. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MISSY FRANKLIN:   I feel happy right now.   We definitely talked about our options for tonight, scratching the 200 did come up, but I was like, "Todd, I want a chance to be part of that relay."   So I knew it was going to be tough, and we planned for it, and I think we did okay because everything worked out just as I had hoped. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MISSY FRANKLIN:   For the 200 I was just trying to get out there and get a spot in finals, and that was the main goal, and I did that and then come back in the 100. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MISSY FRANKLIN:   I know that Rachel always has an incredible first 50, so I knew she was going to be out there, and I tried to be out there as fast as I could, and last 50 is my specialty.   I love coming home and seeing the rings on the bottom of the Jumbotron and pushing myself as hard as I can. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MISSY FRANKLIN:   Natalie has so many chances to make the team, and I'm praying for her and hoping for her because I would absolutely love to be on another team with her.   Thank you so much. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MISSY FRANKLIN:   I couldn't be happier tonight.   There was a lot of training that went into that double, but I love doing doubles. 
I love doing back‑to‑backs, and I didn't have time to get nervous for the 100 Back, so it worked out perfectly. 

Q.   Did you think it was going to take a sub 59? 
MISSY FRANKLIN:   You know what?   I didn't know what it was going to take; I had no idea.   I just wanted to get out there and get my hand on the wall. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MISSY FRANKLIN:   I didn't.   I felt like I was pushing myself harder than I've ever pushed myself before, and if I just kept going I could get there.   Thank you so much.
