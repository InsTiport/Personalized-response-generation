Q.   How does it feel? 
KATHLEEN LEDECKY:   Four years ago I never knew how to qualify for an Olympics Trials.   I thought it was this unreal thing that‑‑ so a year ago I didn't have the 800 cut at this point.   I think I got that in Julyor August. 
I had the 400 cut in May.   It's just unbelievable to think back where I was and to think about the work I've put in in the last couple of months with my Coach, who has prepared me, and I had a lot of confidence going into that race. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KATHLEEN LEDECKY:   I don't think the 400 was that much of a disappointment.   My time was great, and I just got back to work right after my 200 Free semifinal. 
I started hitting the pace that I wanted to, so‑‑

Q.   (No microphone.)
KATHLEEN LEDECKY:   It's unreal.   It's unbelievable. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KATHLEEN LEDECKY:   Dara?   I think so, yes.
