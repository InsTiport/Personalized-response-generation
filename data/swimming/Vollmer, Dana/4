Q.   (No microphone.)
DANA VOLLMER:   When I first looked up I kinda squinted and looked at the top, and the first thing I looked at was the place, and I saw second, oh my gosh, I was so surprised.   I was wanting it, and I've been working for it, but when I saw it I was speechless and just so happy, there just aren't words.   I was ecstatic. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
DANA VOLLMER:   There were people who said I had a good shot, and, in my opinion, there were a lot of girls that had a really good shot at this.   Everybody in that final had a really good shot, even people who didn't make it had a really good shot.   I guess it depends on who you ask, but I would say I had a good shot at it. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
DANA VOLLMER:   For me the main point that I was trying to do was calm myself down before the race. 
I think that was the main part, the most important part.   Then when I got out there, I swam my own race and did what I do every race and made sure I nailed everything. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
DANA VOLLMER:   I don't think I could be disappointed right now.   Going into the race I wanted it to be a smart race.   I wanted to get on the team first and foremost, so I didn't want to take it out super hard. 
I know that my back half is really strong, and I set myself up well and got on the team.   I'm really relieved that I did that, and I'm so excited to get to do it in London. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
DANA VOLLMER:   Definitely.   As I walked in the pool, it looked the same.   I was nervous, and it's nice to put that behind me and to be able to go out and really have fun. 
This is the first meet that I really remember hearing the crowd as much as I do, and it's really exciting and really cool and definitely I could hear the crowd get going, and it definitely helps me those last 15 meters. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, Dana.
