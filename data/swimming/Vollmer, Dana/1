 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DANA VOLLMER: I had no idea kind of how this -- how it would go when I started, and it's really been an amazing life journey for me to really take things day-by-day, to come in with kinda no expectations and just kinda improve all the time.   
The time, I was a little disappointed when I touched at the time, but then you realize, like, time doesn't matter!  I'm in second place, and you are going to Rio!   
So I've got a lot of things I want to work on, so for having my first taper in three years, it did feel different but I'm excited going forward.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DANA VOLLMER: I mean, I had to almost remind myself that I was at an Olympic Trials, and the time doesn't matter.  Kelsi made that race for me.  When she touched the wall and to see that kind of excitement and her tears, and it's just like, I remember that feeling of making my first Olympic Team and the journey that I've had and getting second place, you know, the time doesn't matter.  I'm really looking forward to training with her and going toward Rio.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DANA VOLLMER: I honestly expected to be faster here.  To be slower than I was at VISA is disappointing to me, but I feel like I know that I have that speed there, I have that ability.  I've been putting up times in practice faster than I've ever gone in my life, so it didn't show up here, but, um, yeah in a couple more weeks, I hope that it will.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DANA VOLLMER: I don't know.  I mean, I know -- I haven't had to kind of process how nerves affect how I swim, and prelims, I was super nervous, but yet I was still trying to keep it smooth, but it still didn't feel that great, and I had like no pressure in semifinals, which was nice, and just coming up here I just wanted to race Kelsi, and so I don't really know. It's always something that Teri and I will sit and kind of look at over the next couple of weeks.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DANA VOLLMER: He's doing great!  He's doing awesome, and it's kinda nice because normally it's Momma, Momma, he just wants Momma because I'm there all day with him, and to have him really say Dada all the time, I know it's melting my husband's heart and he just loves it.
