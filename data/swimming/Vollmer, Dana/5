Q.   (No microphone.)
DANA VOLLMER:   It hurt a little bit more, but I think that's to be expected.   I feel like I'm still getting into it and I'm excited I will have the morning to recover and then maybe I'll feel fantastic tomorrow night. 

Q.   What a great way to start, huh? 
DANA VOLLMER:   Definitely. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
DANA VOLLMER:   Um, I was next to a different person, Elaine tonight instead of Natalie and I've been working on my dive and underwaters and working on getting out quick.   I tend to fade the first 50 and I have the strongest second 50 and taking that speed and trying to charge coming home.   Trying to get out that first 50 fast was key. 

Q.   Talk about setting the record, did it feel good? 
DANA VOLLMER:   Definitely, and I feel better than I did at World's.   I don't feel perfect, and that's exciting for me tomorrow.   I'm going to get a massage tonight, hydrate and get a good dinner and I think I will feel better tomorrow night. 

Q.   How fast can you go? 
DANA VOLLMER:   I'm hoping for that 55.   I've been having good practices and going faster than I ever have in workout and putting it together and doing the things that I have been doing, the ocean training, the Pilates and stuff is coming together and making me really strong in the water. 

Q.   Is there anything specific about this morning, where you got better this evening than this morning? 
DANA VOLLMER:   Going into tonight I tried to focus a little bit more on my breakouts, and I had a great race this morning. 
I knew that would make top 8, so bottom goal was to obviously make top 8, top goal is to go 55, and just kind of playing with different things, working on my breakout tonight and putting it all together tonight.
