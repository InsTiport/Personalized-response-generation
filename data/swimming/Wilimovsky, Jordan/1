JORDAN WILIMOVSKY: Yeah, it was sick to race Connor.  He's the fastest American ever, so I tried to hang with him as long as I could, and, yeah, I'm happy I got a best time.   
 Q.  When you told me in Mesa that you wanted the double.  Be careful what you wish for.  
JORDAN WILIMOVSKY: Yeah, that's what I've been working toward this year was try to represent the United States in the two events, so I'm happy about that.   
 Q.  How do you feel about being the first one to do it?  
JORDAN WILIMOVSKY: It's really, really cool.  Obviously Open Water has only been around since 2008, so it's not that old or anything, but I'm sure there are a lot of people that are going to do it.   
 Q.  What was the hardest part for you to try to do that double?  
JORDAN WILIMOVSKY: I think just, like, getting ready for the 1500.  I was watching Trials on my couch until Thursday.  (Away from mic.)   
 Q.  You cut all your hair off from a while back?  
JORDAN WILIMOVSKY: Yeah, it used to be long.  I cut it off before World's.   
 Q.  Decided to go with --  
JORDAN WILIMOVSKY: The short look, I guess.   
 Q.  What was your strategy in this race in terms of hanging with Connor.  Did you think you could stay with him as long as you did?  
JORDAN WILIMOVSKY: Honestly I wasn't focused on what he was doing, I was just trying to stay in my own lane.  I talked to my coach and he said, "Swim your own race," so that's what I tried to do and I kind of looked around and Connor was right there, and I was like, oh, he's probably going to go a good time, so I was trying to stick with him the last 500.  I'm happy with the time.   
 Q.  He's known for that, right?  
JORDAN WILIMOVSKY: Yeah, definitely.  He went, what, 3:40 (Away from mic.)  Low, so, yeah, very happy with that.   
 Q.  What do you think you're known for?  When they say something about Jordan, what is your signature?  
JORDAN WILIMOVSKY: I have absolutely no idea.   
 Q.  What do you get complimented about?  
JORDAN WILIMOVSKY: Distance swimming, I guess.   
 Q.  What kind of conditions do you anticipate in Rio in terms of Open Water?  
JORDAN WILIMOVSKY: Just based on the course, like the (Away from mic.)  can get waves, but for the most part the course is pretty far out in the water, so it's pretty flat with a little bit of chop and -- (Away from mic.)   
 Q.  Can you recap how you qualified for Open Water?  
JORDAN WILIMOVSKY: It was at Worlds last year.  You had to get top-10.   
 Q.  You did that?  
JORDAN WILIMOVSKY: Yeah.   
 Q.  What were the conditions that particular day?  
JORDAN WILIMOVSKY: It was pretty flat for the most part.  (Away from mic.)  Really nice, like a straight course.   
 Q.  Jordan, how much do you anticipate training down there?  
JORDAN WILIMOVSKY: In the ocean itself?   
 Q.  Yeah.  
JORDAN WILIMOVSKY: Personally we don't get in the ocean that much for training, so I don't think I will be in there just except for maybe the day before to test out the course and (Away from mic.)   
 Q.  So do you have any concern about what they've said about the water conditions?  
JORDAN WILIMOVSKY: Absolutely not.  USA Swimming is great, and they're not going to put us in the water if there is anything like that, so race day will come and I think everyone is going to swim.   
 Q.  Have you ever done a test event like that before?  
JORDAN WILIMOVSKY: We took a site visit in January to look at the course and go through what the day is going to be like, going town to the beach getting ready and it all looked sick.  I'm excited.  (Away from mic.)  It will be a lot of fun.   
 Q.  What did you like about it?  When you say it looked "sick" what do you mean?  
JORDAN WILIMOVSKY: The atmosphere, the people on the beach; it's spectator friendly.  You can see the whole course pretty much just from standing on the edge of the beach, so I think it will be great.
