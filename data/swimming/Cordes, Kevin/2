Q. (No microphone.)
KEVIN CORDES: I'm very happy, very happy.  Can't believe, it's an amazing feeling to be able to say I'm an Olympian and going to Rio.  It's awesome.
Q. (No microphone.)
KEVIN CORDES: Yeah, definitely carried that for four years.  It's been in the back of my mind throughout many practices and many points, and I'm happy this time it's a little bit different.
Q. (No microphone.)
KEVIN CORDES: Definitely.  It's all been motivating.  There's been a lot of -- I'm so thankful for this opportunity right now.  There's been a lot of ups and downs throughout my last four years, and I'm just so thankful.
Q. (No microphone.)
KEVIN CORDES: Excuse me?
Q. (No microphone.)
KEVIN CORDES: I'm going to give it everything I have, you know, I'm going to go out there and compete.  I've got a lot more work to do to prepare, but I'm just excited for the opportunity.
Q. (No microphone.)
KEVIN CORDES: Yeah, it's helped me out tremendously.  Coach Lopez, he's been amazing.  Going from swimming college where it's been a lot of short course focus, now toward long course, has really helped me get a sense of my strengths about my stroke and applying that into long course and I think just gaining confidence along the way, it's been awesome.
Q. (No microphone.)
KEVIN CORDES: I knew it was going to be -- I knew it was going to be a race.  A spot on the Olympic Team is on the line so, you know, stick to my plan, stick to my own race, and I knew it was going to be tight.  Just wanted to touch 1 or 2.
Q. (No microphone.)
KEVIN CORDES: I had no idea.  I kinda got the sense he was next to me, but I had no idea!  Happy when I looked at the scoreboard and saw the result.
Q. (No microphone.)
KEVIN CORDES: I broke the barrier in semis, so now we know I've done it once, I can do it again.  And it's just like here, it's not really about time, it's really just about going out and racing guys, just like here.
Q. (No microphone.)
KEVIN CORDES: Yeah, that was the first time, yeah.
Q. (No microphone.)
KEVIN CORDES: Yeah -- for the Wildcats baseball team.  It was just like this in 2012 they won the College World Series when we were here in Omaha, and I got third place, so I was like, now that they're here again, I was seeing if I could turn my luck around, and luckily I was able to do that.
Q. (No microphone.)
KEVIN CORDES: Absolutely.  Hopefully I'll be able to talk to him, get some of his thoughts from his experience.  That would be awesome.  Thanks.
