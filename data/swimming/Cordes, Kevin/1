 Q.  You just keep getting better every time you race.  Talk about how it felt tonight.  
KEVIN CORDES: Well, it felt pretty good.  You want to get faster each race, and tomorrow is the most important one, so it's going to be a fast race, so I've got to bring my "A" game.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
KEVIN CORDES: Definitely.  I knew we were going to have to do three races, so I was prepared.   
 Q.  You just missed the American Record.  (Away from mic.)  
KEVIN CORDES: Hopefully, I mean, I would like to be able to drop.  At this point it doesn't really matter as long as I get first or second.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
KEVIN CORDES: You know, I'm feeling pretty good, big weight off my shoulder off the 100 Breast.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
KEVIN CORDES: I wanted to go out and have a fun race, do what I know I can do and stick to the plan.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
KEVIN CORDES: Yeah, definitely.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
KEVIN CORDES: There are things that you can tweak here and there that I've been focusing on.  I've been going back and watching film and things like that.  It's pretty exciting, and I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
