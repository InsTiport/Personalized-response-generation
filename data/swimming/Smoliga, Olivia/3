Q. (No microphone.)
OLIVIA SMOLIGA: I feel like I don't remember it that well.  Definitely tried to have a great underwater breakout.  I think the one thing that I was focusing on tonight as opposed to this morning was attacking the wall and not gliding in, so just finishing as hard as I could is all I could have asked for.
Q. Obviously there is a lot of talent in that race?
OLIVIA SMOLIGA: Oh, absolutely.
Q. And you know people are going to bring it in the finals when it's on the line.
OLIVIA SMOLIGA: Yeah.
Q. What was your mentality?
OLIVIA SMOLIGA: My mentality was to focus on my own race, really relax and calm down.  It's hard to relax in this kind of venue, but that's what you have to do because the jitters, like all those nerves definitely took hold of me this morning, and it affected my race, so calming down, just being confident, staying confident is what I have to do, and I think what all the other swimmers are doing going into tomorrow.
Q. We're seeing a lot of first-timers making the Olympic Team.  Are you seeing them thinking, why not me?
OLIVIA SMOLIGA: Yeah, right, yes, J, Chase just made it last night.  That was the most exciting race to watch!  That motivates me completely, so it's awesome.  It's like, I train with these guys -- I don't really train with them but, you know, I want my spot on that team.  So hopefully, hopefully I can do it tomorrow.
Q. Did that motivate you a little bit extra?
OLIVIA SMOLIGA: It did, it did, because at NC's, I kind of misstepped.  I was like okay with this time I will probably make it into the finals, and I didn't.  So you really have to show up at the semis, and prelims, for that matter and try to make it into the final, definitely get a shot.
