Q. (No microphone.)
OLIVIA SMOLIGA: Oh my gosh, it was a star-studded heat.  To have Nat, Missy, Amy, Kathleen, all those girls in there, and I know every single one of them, so it's so comforting to have them in the ready room, and you know they're going to put up such a great race, such a great fight, and it was a fight.  I'm just so happy with the outcome.
Q. (No microphone.)
OLIVIA SMOLIGA: She's the most amazing competitor.  I mean, I don't even think she is struggling.  She has been doing so well.  She is so strong, and she is going to have a hell of a meet for the rest of the week.
Q. (No microphone.)
OLIVIA SMOLIGA: Great!  I still can't believe it.  Honestly, I'm in shock right now.
Q. A long way from where you were two years ago.  (No microphone.)
OLIVIA SMOLIGA: Definitely, definitely a long way, and I'm so glad it all came together at this meet.
Q. (No microphone.)
OLIVIA SMOLIGA: Yeah, you know, I think it's so great having the NCs come out as they did, and I've just been telling myself, ride this wave.  It's such a high to come out of NCs and come in here and have my confidence be so high, and being with Georgia, having them on the sidelines cheering me on is awesome.
Q. (No microphone.)
OLIVIA SMOLIGA: You know, I think it's great, honestly. It's like this new wave of people that are coming in.  Gunnar just made it tonight in the 200 Free as an alternate. He got fifth in the 200. J made it in the 4 IM. Chase made it in the 400 IM.  I'm so happy for them, so happy for, like, young kids coming up, like Jack Conger, Townley Haas.  It's awesome.
Q. (No microphone.)
OLIVIA SMOLIGA: My gosh, just enjoy it. I hope to get more international experience, just enjoy being with such amazing athletes.  It's definitely going to be so much fun.
Q. (No microphone.)
OLIVIA SMOLIGA: Definitely.  I think there is a huge -- like I had, it's like this new wave, not out with the old, because that's a bad saying, but it's in with the new-type deal, and I think looking at it collegiately, everyone had such a great NCAA season, and it's an Olympic year. You know, I think NCs were so successful because people were focused on Olympic Trials.  They want to get focused early and stay focused.  Thank you.
