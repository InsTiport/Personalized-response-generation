Q.   (No microphone.)
MICAH LAWRENCE: ‑‑ since I was very little, Josh‑‑ came to my church when I was seven or so, and he let us touch the medal and I think that sparked a dream then. 

Q.   Was that‑‑
MICAH LAWRENCE:   Yeah. 

Q.   Is that in Texas?
MICAH LAWRENCE:   Yes. 

Q.   Now, you took the year off from Auburn; is that right? 
MICAH LAWRENCE:   I did.

Q.   Talk about that.   Obviously it paid off. 
MICAH LAWRENCE:   I knew I could do better than I was. 
I wasn't 100% into the team.   I was really into school. 
I was doing graphic design at the time and it just happened to be another one of my passions that I found, and swimming just went to the side. 
I knew this was going to be an Olympic year, and I told myself, I really loved swimming but I really loved graphic design, so I wanted to put it all out there for swimming just in case at some point I leave it by the side when I go off and do graphic design. 

Q.   What was a personal best for you, obviously, I guess. 
MICAH LAWRENCE:   Yes. 

Q.   How much did you drop? 
MICAH LAWRENCE:   I dropped about a second.

Q.   Really? 
MICAH LAWRENCE:   Yeah. 

Q.   Were you surprised? 
MICAH LAWRENCE:   Oh, yeah. 

Q.   You were seated second or third.   Did you think you were going to finish this high? 
MICAH LAWRENCE:   I was hopeful but I always know that at Olympic Trials people bring out their best, and I wasn't going to be like, well, I'm going to get second. 
I was waiting for them to come up. 

Q.   Were you nervous going in?
MICAH LAWRENCE:   Definitely.   Very nervous!   I just had to tell myself to keep it smooth that first 100. 

Q.   Do you have eligibility left with Auburn? 
MICAH LAWRENCE:   I do, I have a year left.
