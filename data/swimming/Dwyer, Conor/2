 Q.  (No microphone.)  
CONOR DWYER: Um, man, I was out there in front, I could see someone in lane 2 or 3 going hard.  Didn't even see Jaeg's.  I kinda put him in my blinders, just wanted to swim my own race, and he was truckin' coming home, and I know he's one of the toughest racers there are for USA.  He's represented our mile and 400 team as good as you can in the last three years, so it was good to race him.  And even better to get my hand on the wall second.  I don't like losing, but I will take a bid to Rio.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
CONOR DWYER: It's a dream come true.  I've had a lot of coaches this year that have really stuck behind me and have shown me the road to make this 400 team, Dave Salo, John Urbanchek, Bob Bowman, Jack Roach, all these people, all the USC Team, a lot of coaches have helped me out this year, and I owe it all to them.   
 Q.  (No microphone  
CONOR DWYER: I think that it is.  I kind of like to be a hybrid in swimming and kind of soak in all these legendary coaches, Dave, his type of training and John and Bob are very similar, and I just like to soak it all in.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
CONOR DWYER: Sunshine!  No, I live with a cousin out there in Manhattan Beach.  It's a dream come true getting to surf and hang out with him and train there, and, yeah, I love LA.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
CONOR DWYER: Yeah, legs hurt.  Everything hurts.  I need to warm down for the 200.  Thanks, guys.
