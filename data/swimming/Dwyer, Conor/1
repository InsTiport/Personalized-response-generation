 Q.  I guess you got second by 1/100th?  
CONOR DWYER: Yeah, it's good to get my hand on the wall and get to represent the US in that race, so that's three events so far this week that I will get to -- 800 Free Relay, 200 and 400, so I'm excited.  The week has gone well so far.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
CONOR DWYER: Yeah, I thought it would be a good race, and it ended up being a good race.  I'd still like to be a little faster. The time wasn't necessarily happy with, but overall finish I am.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
CONOR DWYER: Yeah.  Absolutely.  I think it's a great group of guys representing the US and we're looking for revenge from Worlds.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
CONOR DWYER: I saw Jack coming to my right.  I didn't see Townley at all.   
 Q.  How are you different as a swimmer than four years ago?  
CONOR DWYER: Yeah, I mean, my career when I worked out with Coach Troy, he kind of instilled my work ethic and the Gators, I learned how to train as hard as I could, but I really put in a crazy amount of work this year, and I feel like I'm a smarter racer.
