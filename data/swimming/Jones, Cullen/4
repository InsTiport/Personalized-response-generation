Q.   (No microphone.)
CULLEN JONES:   And I'm not fully tapered yet.   I know my coach has a lot more for me to do.   I hope he comes with me to London, but I'm feeling good, it's always fun racing Nathan. 

Q.   (No microphone.) 
CULLEN JONES:   He has been a big mentor to me, a father figure, he's molded me into a different swimmer.   My stroke is different, my mentality toward racing has been different.   He's been a God send for me. 

Q.   Why has Charlotte become such a swim city? 
CULLEN JONES:   Because we've marketed to be that way.   We have a team atmosphere, when someone else cries, we cry with them.   We're a family.   It's as close to a college atmosphere as you're going to get. 

Q.   You were laying on the floor over there, tell me about that. 
CULLEN JONES:   I don't care how fast I swim the 100 Free, I'm always dead after I do that, and that one I did something special.   I did what he wanted me to do.   First thing when I came out he hugged me and said, "Perfect" and you don't get that very often! 

Q.   That's right.   Good job. 
CULLEN JONES:   Thank you. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CULLEN JONES:   I was breathing to the right side, so I saw on the way coming back I was out in the lead.   But from my prelim swim I went out entirely too fast, couldn't bring it back, and I was out ahead the same way.   After the second swim and getting to that third swim I felt better about how I was going to execute it.   Each swim was different, but when I got out, David said, "Perfect" so I knew I did something right. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CULLEN JONES:   It means a lot for me to be training the way that I did this year. 
Having to race Josh last year and racing him all this year definitely puts a fire under you, Nick, we have a great group of people that come in every day to race hard and race fast, and I'm thankful for the people around me because they help me get better. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CULLEN JONES:   I had some definite downs this year, past couple of years, living the celebrity life, going out.   Although a lot of my work is positive and talking to kids, I wanted to live, I wanted to enjoy what I had got in 2008. 
And I refocused this past year and a lot of the coaches from the National Team in Shanghai said to me, "We need you for this relay.   We need one of the best 100 Freestylers to come to London, because the world is getting faster," and I'm happy to answer that call.

Q.   (No microphone.)
CULLEN JONES:   I'm just thankful to be a part.   USA Swimming Foundation and Philips 66 chose me to be the face, and I just ran with that ball ever since.   We've reached a million kids, and I hope we will reach another million.   I'm blessed for what I'm able to do, talking to the kids.   I don't even think of it as work anymore.   It's fun. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CULLEN JONES:   That's Superman.   You never know what he's going to go.   When you go 46 low, I'm scared of him!
