Q. (No microphone.)
CULLEN JONES: Exactly how I wanted to.  Twice in the same day is pretty good.
Q. (No microphone.)
CULLEN JONES: Yeah, we have a lot of depth, but the world is getting faster.  We need to get a little faster, and I think a little time -- morning off tomorrow.
Q. (No microphone.)
CULLEN JONES: Well, third time here.  Knock on wood -- (Away from mic.)
Q. Are you getting a lot of friends and family support?
CULLEN JONES: Yeah.
Q. Do you mind sending them a message?
CULLEN JONES: Hey guys, Cullen!  Going to Finals, baby!
Q. (No microphone.)
CULLEN JONES: It's a friendly rivalry.  We're all friends outside of the pool, so it's funny because we don't speak as much while we're here, because it's game time, but we're all good, good friends.  Tony came and trained with us the last three months, and he gives me hope, man, seeing him swim and seeing him train.  I never saw him swim one bad stroke so I know his commitment is there, and racing against him is always a challenge.  He dropped gears like no one else, so that's always fun.
Q. (No microphone.)
CULLEN JONES: It took a lot, you know.  You get a lot of negative thoughts.  It was my first swim.  I overswam the 100.  I'm in much better shape than that.  I felt like I could have went 48 when I was done with it, but 50 is a different day, and a large part of it was me thinking is this going to be my last swim.  Every time I get on the blocks I'm asking myself that.  Tonight I did the same thing, let emotion take me, 21.9.  I want to be faster than that, need to be faster than that, tomorrow morning off, getting ready, should set.  Hopefully the American Record, I want that!
