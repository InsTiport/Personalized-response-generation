 Q.   (No microphone.)  
TYLER CLARY:   My legs are pretty sore.   It was good.   I wanted to break into the 54 range and I did, and I'm excited with how the race turned out.   
I mean, I wasn't expecting to be ahead at the 150 at all and that kinda helped me a little with my confidence in my front half speed.   There is room for improvement in that swim and excited to make changes and race in London.   
   
 Q.   How aware are you that Ryan Lochte is next to you?   
TYLER CLARY:   He's right next to me, and he's the World Champion so I better be aware of where he is.   
   
 Q.   But you're able to tell?   
TYLER CLARY:   Absolutely.   
   
 Q.   Good.   What now?   
TYLER CLARY:   Warm down, I get to celebrate a little tonight.   My meet is over and I finished up the meet in a fashion that I think is acceptable, and now we're going to figure out where I go from here as far as whether or not I go home or straight to training camp.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
TYLER CLARY:   The amount of support I've been getting over Twitter and in Facebook is amazing.   I said it last night during the award ceremony it's absolutely incredible, and it's a great feeling to have kind of a lack luster start to the meet, especially being sick and having everybody willing me to get up and get better and keep going is really powerful and I've been appreciative of it.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
TYLER CLARY:   As far as my race strategy goes, I wanted to be ahead at the 150.   I made a couple of mistakes in the last 50, and those are things that I'm going to change over the next couple of weeks in training camp, and I'm really happy I've broken into the 1:54 range.   
I know that there have been a couple of guys in the world already at 1:54, and I think the strength of the United States team is once we get into a heat with any other international swimmers, we have the ability to get our hand on the wall.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
TYLER CLARY:   It's fantastic!   Initially my goal was to make it in four events, so after Monday, I knew that wasn't going to happen, but under certain circumstances we had to be dynamic with what my event schedule was, and taking that into consideration and the last two swims I've had, I'm more than happy to call that okay and work with what I've got for now and definitely take that into my mind‑set and motivation going up to the next quad.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
TYLER CLARY:   Hopefully I won't have to do as much distance training.   Obviously I've cut my total distance in half, and we've got to focus on more of the little things and easy speed versus straight‑up aerobic training.   Don't get me wrong, that's a huge part of the 200, but there are more fact things to factor into a 200 than a 400.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
TYLER CLARY:   That doesn't cross my mind.   Every time I get an opportunity to swim against them, it's a bit of a blessing and it helps me get better, and they're older than I am and eventually they're going to stop swimming, and whether or not I beat them before that doesn't matter.   I'm going to keep getting better and the US is going to remain strong.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
TYLER CLARY:   I don't think Ryan Lochte's last wall was the difference in the race.   I think it was my last wall that was the difference in the race.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
TYLER CLARY:   I went crazy with my legs in the first 75 and I definitely felt that off the last wall, and I also noticed at about 35 meters to go in the last 50 that I was starting to sit up and force myself to lay back, and that shouldn't be something that I would have to cognitively make a decision to do in a race, so I'm going to have to work on that, and my finish was a little long.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
TYLER CLARY:   That's a great question.   Let's hope I can stay healthy until the Games.   Thank you.
