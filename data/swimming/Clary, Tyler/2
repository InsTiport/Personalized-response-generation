TYLER CLARY: I wanted to go in the 55 range, did that, and I'm curious to see (Away from mic.)   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TYLER CLARY: Yeah.  It's actually something I did during 2012 Trials as well, didn't do that great, went out and rode some Go-Karts, came back refreshed.  Got my whole family out, went out and did some Go-Kart racing yesterday and kicked all their butts!  But it was a lot of fun.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TYLER CLARY: It's been a tough quad.  Had some health issues, and, you know, just having (Away from mic.)

My backstroke feels very strong and, like I said, (Away from mic.)  See what happens.

 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TYLER CLARY: Yeah, Matt is a fantastic guy.  I've been swimming with him for years, and nobody wants to come to this meet and (Away from mic.)  But that's how it works sometimes, and that's the decision that Matt's made.  And he's got an incredible list of accolades, and he's an Olympic Gold Medalist, and they'll never take that away from him.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TYLER CLARY: Absolutely!  It's the greatest spot to be in and the worst spot to be in at the same time.  Obviously there is a whole lot of eyes on you when you get into an event which you've won in the past but (Away from mic.)
