 Q.   (No microphone.)  
TYLER CLARY:   Yeah, I mean, there's a lot more there in the second 100, and I was able to shut it down in the last four or five strokes, so I'm pretty confident I can get 54 tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Was there a point in which you figured you had it?   
TYLER CLARY:   I was actually really surprised at how my first 50 went, especially swimming next to Nick.   He has better outspeed than I do.   
After the first 50 I knew that I was right next to him, so I figured the race was pretty much in the bag from there.   
   
 Q.   Good job.   
TYLER CLARY:   Thank you.
