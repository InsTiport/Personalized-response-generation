Q. (No microphone.)
MELANIE MARGALIS: I just looked up and I was just so happy that I did.
Q. (No microphone.)
MELANIE MARGALIS: Yeah.  Thanks to you!
Q. (No microphone.)
MELANIE MARGALIS: Um, I don't know, it's a little bit of a tricky question.  I really died in the 200 Free.  It's one of the more painful ones I've done recently, so at first I was kind of like, oh no, I have another event to do.  But I think it worked out.  I think it did take some pressure off, just because I was like, they may take me, so, yeah.
Q. (No microphone.)
MELANIE MARGALIS: I really didn't know.  I was just really hoping.
Q. (No microphone.)
MELANIE MARGALIS: Yes, it does!  I can't believe that just happened!
Q. (No microphone.)
MELANIE MARGALIS: Going into the race, I just knew that I needed to be near Caitlin.  I knew she was going to go off in breaststroke.  I've raced her 100 times; she is a great competitor.  I knew she would go off in breaststroke, but I am really confident in my freestyle, so I knew I still had a chance to do it if I just dug deep.
Q. (No microphone.)
MELANIE MARGALIS: Oh, yeah, of course.
Q. (No microphone.)
MELANIE MARGALIS: Well, after the 200 Free (Away from mic.)
