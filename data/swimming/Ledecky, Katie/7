 Q.  (No microphone.)  
KATIE LEDECKY: I mean, that's where I should be at.  Maybe it was more like a 1:56 high, probably would have been a better closing, but the instructions -- well, Bruce didn't give me any instructions tonight, he said, "You don't need me tonight.  Just go out and race and have fun," and that's what I did.  I felt really relaxed and felt good.  Just had to get my hand on the wall.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
KATIE LEDECKY: It's awesome!  I'm probably more pumped about her race than mine.  Just -- she's -- she pushed me there, and I know I need that, and I know after this week we're going to have to get back to work, and we'll get to train together, and she is a great trainer, fun to race at practice and at meets, and I know we'll just encourage each other and have fun along the way.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
KATIE LEDECKY: Yeah, I mean, that's fast!  That's three seconds faster than anybody else in the world, so I think we're going to really represent the US well, no matter what.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
KATIE LEDECKY: I hope to, I hope -- she's pushing me, I think, just as much as I hope I'm pushing her, and she's been extremely consistent this year, and I knew if I was out ahead of her that I was having a pretty good swim, and just to look up on the board and see how great of a swim she had, too, is just really inspiring and exciting moving forward.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
KATIE LEDECKY: Maybe, yeah, probably!  I guess (away from microphone) was pretty good, too, but the 400 is just such a race and it's -- it's a sprint.  Leah, I think, really embraces the races a lot like I do.  She really attacks them and holds on and she has that endurance background, too, so I think we swim pretty similar races, and I think that's the way to swim it.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
KATIE LEDECKY: Felt pretty good.  I think the last 150 I just kept telling myself Rio, Rio, Rio, just come on!  I just tried to keep myself fired up on that and didn't really care what the time was but really happy to be back at 58.  I haven't been at 58 in two years, so I think that's a good sign moving forward.
