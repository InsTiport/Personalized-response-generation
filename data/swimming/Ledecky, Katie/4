Q. So how was it?
KATIE LEDECKY: Got seventh, that's what happened!  (Away from mic.)  I was seventh, Kelsi was eighth, and we're both already on the team, so if they want us in that relay, they can put us in, and if somebody gets sick, we'll be there.  It's a good outcome.
Q. Did you want to be in a relay?
KATIE LEDECKY: Yeah, obviously I would have liked to have gotten first through six, but I'm also happy for the people that made it.
Q. Would you be happy to swim the prelims?
KATIE LEDECKY: Yeah, honestly, I would love to, but that's always up to the coaches, and they will make the right decision.
Q. (No microphone.)
KATIE LEDECKY: Yeah, (Away from mic.)  That was the first race of that meet, (Away from mic.)  A little different situation.  Honestly, I would have liked to have gone faster, but I'll take it.
Q. (No microphone.)
KATIE LEDECKY: Sorry?
Q. You're not used to --
KATIE LEDECKY: (Away from mic.)  It is what it is.  Move on, have a great 800 tomorrow.
Q. (No microphone.)
KATIE LEDECKY: No, I mean, it's not -- I didn't feel flat.  (Away from mic.)  Move on, learn some things. Four years ago I never would have thought I would be swimming a 100 Free final.
