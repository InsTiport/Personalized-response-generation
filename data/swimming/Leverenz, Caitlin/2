 Q.   How do you feel?   
CAITLIN LEVERENZ:   It feels amazing.   It's hard to put into words, I'm incredibly happy with my race and happy that I got that second place in there.   It was awesome.   
   
 Q.   (Questions away from mic).  
CAITLIN LEVERENZ:   Good, I think I was in a good place.   I'm usually further behind so I think I still have work that I can do on my walls and backstroke in particular, and I think I set it up well.   
   
 Q.   What did she say to you after the race when you guys hugged?   
CAITLIN LEVERENZ:   Before the race we were like ‑‑ I just gave her a hug in the ready room and we were like:   "Let's do this.   It's our time.   We can do this together."   We've been good friends racing each other since we were 13 and 14 years old.  
In 2008 I was giving her a hug and telling her congratulations when she made the team.   
It was an amazing thing for us to be like, "We did this, and we did it together," and this time I'm giving her a hug and it's both of us together.   
   
 Q.   How much has Teri been pushing you to get here?   
CAITLIN LEVERENZ:   She has been an amazing inspiration, a counselor and a guider and anything you can ask for in a coach and as a mentor for me.   
I would credit all of‑‑ you know, everything I can and how well I'm swimming is because she has made me so good and coached me how I needed to be coached and inspired me and helped me through races so much.   I can't sing her praises enough.
