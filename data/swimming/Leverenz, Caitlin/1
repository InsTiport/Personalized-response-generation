 Q.   How are you feeling?   
CAITLIN LEVERENZ:   I feel great.   I'm happy with that swim.   
It was a solid semifinals, and I have a lane for tomorrow, which is all I needed to do.   
I'm just still waiting for the big one tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   So you went pretty fast.   Are you saying that you're holding back a little bit?   Are you going to "bring it"?   
CAITLIN LEVERENZ:   I think so.   I definitely wasn't going all out, and I think I have more in me.   I'm excited for the race tomorrow.   I think it's going to be a good one.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
CAITLIN LEVERENZ:   I miss the rain, and I miss the monsoons, and the smell of the rain, and I was reminiscing with my sister about it.   I definitely do.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
CAITLIN LEVERENZ:   I'm missing it!   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
CAITLIN LEVERENZ:   Um, yeah, I mean, like I said, I think I have more in me, and I'm just excited to see what do tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
CAITLIN LEVERENZ:   Definitely, just resting up.
