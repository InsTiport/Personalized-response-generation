 Q.   (No microphone.)  
JASON LEZAK:   He's got two other events tonight, he said there was no way he could do it.   Fortunately I could get in there and get the opportunity.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
JASON LEZAK:   Well, I was nervous.   There's no doubt.   It was a big race for me, trained four years for this, real hard, nobody understands how hard it's been for me except my wife and I.  
And it's a pretty good accomplishment to get in there, even though it's sixth place, still made the team.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
JASON LEZAK:   Yeah, I mean, fortunately it's like how I just started, I made the first team on a relay and then made individual events and now finishing up my last one on a relay.   
It's a great feeling because I've learned alot, and hopefully I can be a team leader and help these guys swim fast.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
JASON LEZAK:   It's so much different because, like I said, this has been a really tough run to make it here.   I'm actually really surprised that I was able to go faster than last night, felt terrible, this 36 year old body was rundown and somehow I closed my eyes for a little bit, I'm breathing to go my rightâ€‘hand side, there is nobody there, and I actually kind of visualized some things from the past to help me get to the wall.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
JASON LEZAK:   I mean, training changes so much.   There are days that you want to go for it, and your body won't let, and there are days that you work hard and you come back and you want to do it again and you can't, so it's a huge learning curve for me, and I'm happy I made the team.
