Q. (No microphone.)
ABBEY WEITZEIL: Yeah, it was crazy.  I knew I was going to have to put my head down and fight for it because I knew everyone would be right there with me.
Q. Looked like the last 30 meters you found another gear.
ABBEY WEITZEIL: Yeah, like I had, I had no idea where everyone was.  I couldn't see anybody after the turn so I just went for it.
Q. Were you telling yourself anything in the closing meters?
ABBEY WEITZEIL: I was focusing on the technical things that I have been working on.  I know I tighten up really bad in the last 15, so I was trying to stay loose.
Q. How has your confidence been so far in this meet?  You seem comfortable and confident out here?
ABBEY WEITZEIL: Yeah, I've been to a lot of bigger meets or big meets, but this is a different one, I'll tell you, the nerves and the vibes in the ready room are totally different, so it's a big, nerve-wracking meet.
Q. What do you think of your time?  You dropped probably three-tenths of a second.
ABBEY WEITZEIL: Yeah, it's great.
