 Q.  (No microphone.)  
ABBEY WEITZEIL: Thank you.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
ABBEY WEITZEIL: Yeah, no problem.  Yeah, for sure.  I don't know what I went out actually.  I felt a little faster this morning, so I'm working on going out, building it and holding on to the speed I had coming home this morning.  I have to look at my splits, but overall I'm coming back top seed again, so it's a good spot to be in, and I'm looking forward to finals tomorrow night, for sure.   
 Q.  Do you feel like you built that race as far as getting faster as you went throughout?  
ABBEY WEITZEIL: I tried.  I tried to come home like I did this morning, because that's what I need to be home in.   
So it felt okay.  It hurt a little bit more than this morning, for sure, but I definitely want to be faster overall.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
ABBEY WEITZEIL: I love elephants!  Actually my family just got them for me for this meet.  They're my favorite animal, but "trunks up" like the elephant.  Just something fun.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
ABBEY WEITZEIL: Elephants?  I don't know, I just like them.  They're cute.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
ABBEY WEITZEIL: Um, I mean, I came into this meet with confidence and I'm carrying it through.  I just need to figure out some things to be that 52 that I want.  USA, we need a 52, so I'm trying to be that.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
ABBEY WEITZEIL: Oh, yeah, we could use as many 52s as we can get.  For my personal best and for the US I definitely want to be 52 tomorrow.  Gotta rest up.  Thank you guys.
