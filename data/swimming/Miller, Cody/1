 Q.  (No microphone.)  
CODY MILLER: I wasn't expecting that!   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
CODY MILLER: Yeah, you know, it's kind of a blur, so I thought I would go back and watch the race but, you know, I knew -- I've had a lot of closing speed this meet, and I was just focusing on trying to hammer that last 20 meters and try to get my hand on the wall, and I got the job done, and I got on the team, and I'm just trying to soak it in now.  It's very surreal.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
CODY MILLER: Oh, absolutely, yeah.  You know, that was -- one step back, you gotta take another step forward so little set-backs help motivate me, absolutely.  I've gone through a lot -- God, I can't even talk I'm so excited.  Been through a lot this past year and just really grateful and thankful.  I said earlier, I have just too many people to thank.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
CODY MILLER: My dad passed away in December.  That was kinda hard.  You know, let's not focus on that, I had a lot of good things.  I got engaged, so I gotta thank my fiancÃ©e, Alley, love her to death.  Wouldn't be here without her, absolutely.  So, yeah, you know, it's been good.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
CODY MILLER: I'm sorry?  Say that again.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
CODY MILLER: What do I bring to the team?  A funky chest!  I don't know!  Good hair?  How about a positive attitude.  Go with that!   
You know, I grew up idolizing guys that win this meet, you know.  My first time was in 2008, and I was just lucky to be here and swim as a high schooler, and then in 2012 I was lucky enough to make a final the 2 IM a couple lanes down from Michael and ever since Trials in 2012 -- you know, every kid dreams of this.  The fact that, you know, I'm not very big, and I've got a lot of disadvantages, and the fact that I'm able to be here and do this, I'm just trying to soak it in, like I said, I've just got a lot of people to thank.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
CODY MILLER: That wasn't me.  That's Kevin.
