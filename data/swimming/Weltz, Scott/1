 Q.   How are you feeling, man?   
SCOTT WELTZ:   So much better than after the 100.   The 100, I was kinda crushed and that last lap I was like, I won't feel that way again.   
   
 Q.   You're headed to London.   
SCOTT WELTZ:   I know.   I've said is so many times in my mind and now I can say it out loud, and it's great.   
   
 Q.   A lot of work put into it?  
SCOTT WELTZ:   A lot of work, a lot of work.  
My coach had a plan and we followed it and it paid off.   
   
 Q.   Was there a point where you thought you had a good chance?   
SCOTT WELTZ:   You know, there was, at the 100 ‑‑ I didn't swim my own race in the 100 Breaststroke, and today it was like here I have to go out easy and come back.   And I feel like I didn't take a single hard stroke in the first 100.  
When I turned, I wasn't a body‑length behind, and I said, "I can do this," and I built it in the third lap and brought it home.   So I just had that in my mind at the 100, I was like, "I can do this, I can do this," and I didn't feel a thing after that.   
   
 Q.   What was going through your mind when you touched the wall and you saw the‑‑  
SCOTT WELTZ:   Oh my God.   I was swimming and I can kinda see out of the sides, and there was no one there.   And I just kept accelerating, and I saw the wall and I looked up and I‑‑ automatically I looked at the bottom, I didn't look at the top, and I saw my time, and I was like, "Oh my God!"   It was a dream come true.   Twenty years of work paid off.   
   
 Q.   Anything for your friends at home?   
SCOTT WELTZ:   I had so many e‑mails from kids I coach, thank you guys, monsters all the way.   So much love for all my friends sending me things, telling me I can do it, so I feel like this is for them, too.   They were with me every step of the way.
