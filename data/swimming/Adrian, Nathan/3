 Q.  You just keep getting better!  
NATHAN ADRIAN: Yeah, I guess!  I'm happier with my 47.7 than 21.5, but it's all about racing and qualifying.  It's crazy, right?  There are two guys that have won medals in that event.  Caeleb, some of the younger guys are certainly capable of winning medals in the future, so it's an honor to come out of that field on top.   
 Q.  How do you feel about swimming this at Rio?  
NATHAN ADRIAN: How do I feel about it?   
 Q.  Because last time you didn't --  
NATHAN ADRIAN: Right.  I did not!  (Laughter.)  You know, it's not going to be easy.  Certainly other people have harder schedules, I'm not going to try to tell you mine is the hardest, but, you know, switching between the 100 and the 50 takes a lot of focus and really mental energy switching the stroke, switching the timing of the kicks, head position, body position, and then, you know, hopefully after a solid 100, we will have to switch it back to -- for the 100 Meter Freestyle for the relay at the very end.   
So it's something that Dave and I are going to focus on, being able to switch between the two whenever we need to.   
 Q.  Is one a priority over the other?  50 or the 100?  
NATHAN ADRIAN: I've always been a 100 guy that swims the 50, just as Michael is a 200 guy that swims the 100.  I think my speed I was always training for the 100.   
 Q.  What about qualifying with Tony?  
NATHAN ADRIAN: It's fun.  Tony and I have swam next to each other a lot, and he usually gets me.  I snuck in there by one-hundreth of a second this time but I'm sure he'll be there come Rio.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
NATHAN ADRIAN: I don't know.  (Away from mic.)   
 Q.  Do you take any breaths, Nathan?  
NATHAN ADRIAN: Oh, no.  I don't think anybody in there does.
