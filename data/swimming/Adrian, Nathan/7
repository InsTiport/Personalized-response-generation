Q.   (No microphone.)
NATHAN ADRIAN:   Did he?   That's good, good.   Semifinals, good to get in the final and swim for that Olympic spot, so in a good position now. 

Q.   How do you think that time will set you up for tomorrow? 
NATHAN ADRIAN:   Fine. 
Again, I mean, you just need to get a lane. 
Once you get that, you're good.   Top two spots going to the Olympics.

Q.   You talked about qualifying individually yesterday; you finally got it.   What would it mean to take it for two events? 
NATHAN ADRIAN:   I mean, it would be perfect. 
Qualifying two individual events, could be the perfect Trials for me, so I would be happy with that. 

Q.   You know what you're both capable of.   Where do you think your effort puts you going into finals? 
NATHAN ADRIAN:   Fine.   21.8, happy with that.   That's fine.   Nothing spectacular.   I think we've got some left in the tank, so we'll see.
