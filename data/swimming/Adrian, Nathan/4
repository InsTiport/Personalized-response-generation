Q. (No microphone.)
NATHAN ADRIAN: Going fast in (Away from mic.)  It's not going to hurt me to go fast in the semifinals.
Q. (No microphone.)
NATHAN ADRIAN: It's exciting.  It's always good to have Tony around.  He's not training with us on a regular basis, but he's a great friend, and it's always excite to go see him.
Q. (No microphone.)
NATHAN ADRIAN: Just trying to get faster!  It's fun.  You know, it's -- each and every day I get to live my life and try to be the healthiest and best version possible, and to be able to say that and to be able to live that and own that is absolutely a dream come true.  I have a lot of friends (Away from mic.) that are pretty jealous!
Q. (No microphone.)
NATHAN ADRIAN: Yeah, no, what the heck.
Q. (No microphone.)
NATHAN ADRIAN: I don't know, man!  Last time it was old guys, like me, and now it's young guys, so I guess I'm just bucking the trend a little bit.  I don't know, it's the ebbs and flows of swimming, but I couldn't be more excited about the direction swimming is going.  It's certainly a lot faster than it was four years ago, so hopefully give it another more or so and we will be even faster than that.
