Q.   (No microphone.)
NATHAN ADRIAN:   The first 15 meters I said to myself, I think can do this; I might have put myself in a good spot. 

Q.   Anything to the friends back in Washington State? 
NATHAN ADRIAN:   I love you guys.   Some of my friends said they threw a party to watch the Trials, so hello, I wish I could be there with you guys. 

Q.   You got fourth in the 100 last time.   How does it feel to take first? 
NATHAN ADRIAN:   It's good.   I've been hungry for an individual spot since I got that fourth and to actually get it feels really good. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NATHAN ADRIAN:   It was good.   I was happy to be in the middle with a couple of sprinters, who were going to go out with me, helped push me that first 50.
And I was able to get my hand on the wall first at the end. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NATHAN ADRIAN:   Obviously.   It's funny, Jason and I switched lanes from 2008.   I was actually in lane 8, and he was in lane 4 at that time.   So it's kind of poetic. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NATHAN ADRIAN:   Seed time, I suppose.   There is a reason why we're going out there to race, because you don't know what's going to happen in the race and I was looking forward to that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NATHAN ADRIAN:   I don't know.   I think it can be faster, but to put a numerical value at this point would be nothing.
