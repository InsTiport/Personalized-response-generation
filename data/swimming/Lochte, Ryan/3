 Q.  (No microphone.)  
RYAN LOCHTE: I'm feeling better as far as, like, mentally, but (Away from mic.)   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
RYAN LOCHTE: No.  I think any chance I can get up on the blocks and race him is definitely an honor, but I don't have a preferred race one way or the other.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
RYAN LOCHTE: Yeah.  On the walls you can kinda, like, look and see where you're at, so I did that and I was coming home, I knew I was in front, so I knew I was able to let off.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
RYAN LOCHTE: It was easier than this morning.  I definitely -- I took some painkillers to help me, help the pain earlier today, Advil and whatever, just helped my mind with the pain.  First part of the breaststroke felt good and halfway through it started hurting more and more, until the last couple of strokes, and I was able to get in.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
RYAN LOCHTE: I will be swimming the 100 Fly, man.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
RYAN LOCHTE: I don't know if that will be my warmup, but the 100 Fly is more like (Away from mic.) and any 100 for me is like (Away from mic.) -- tomorrow night would be definitely a good battle.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
RYAN LOCHTE: I think it's one of the greatest rivalries in sports, me and him, just from what we have both done, and it's definitely fun.  It's fun racing against him, and it's competitive out there.
