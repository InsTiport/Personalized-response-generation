 Q.  After all you've been through this week, how do you feel about this one?  
RYAN LOCHTE: I knew going into this race it was definitely going to be a dog fight till the end.  I love racing against him.  It's so much fun!  It was kinda a little heartbreaking at the end because after we finished, we gave each other a hug and said good job, but we both knew that was probably the last time me and him were going to race against each other on US soil.  It's been a long journey.  The journey is not over.  We have another month to get ready and show the world that US is still No. 1.   
 Q.  What were you guys chatting about on the deck?  
RYAN LOCHTE: We were walking out, and I gave him a flat tire by accident, and he was like, "What are you doing, trying to mess me up?" and I was like, "No, no, no, don't think that!"  I mean, it's all fun and games.
