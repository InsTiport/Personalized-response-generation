Q.   Are you going to scratch the 100 Freestyle Final? 
RYAN LOCHTE:   Yes, I am. 

Q.   Why?
RYAN LOCHTE:   I have a hard double tomorrow, a 200 Back, 200 IM, so‑‑ I know I have enough time to do the 100 Free. 
But we made a plan going into this meet that I was just going to do semifinals of 100 Free and whatever happens, happens, and just get ready for the 200 Back, 200 IM. 

Q.   Why did you swim the 100 semis?   Why not do the prelims this morning and then rest today? 
RYAN LOCHTE:   Because I always do better at night.   I mean, I took this morning as basically like a warm‑up swim, and then I just got the ready for tonight.
