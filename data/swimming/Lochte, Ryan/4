 Q.  (No microphone.)  
RYAN LOCHTE: No, I mean, anytime -- I'm just happy that I'm going to Rio, and I'm representing my country at the highest stage in sports, so I'm really honored about that.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
RYAN LOCHTE: What?   
 Q.  Were you having any doubts at all?  
RYAN LOCHTE: You can never go in knowing that you're going to make the team, just because the US is one of the hardest countries to make the Olympic Team for, because they're so strong in every event.  So I'm glad I got than opportunity now to represent my country.   
 Q.  If it wasn't for the groin injury, would you be disappointed with fourth place?  
RYAN LOCHTE: Whenever I go on the blocks, I always want to win, doesn't matter what event it is.  I always feel like I can win, but, you know, sometimes you do, sometimes you don't, but I made the team, and I'm happy.   
 Q.  How does the rest of your week set up?  
RYAN LOCHTE: I'm going to take each day at a time.  You know, I got two events down; I have about three more, four more left, so just keep going.   
 Q.  I know you expected to make the team but is there something emotional when it actually happens?  
RYAN LOCHTE: I mean, a lot of excitement.  Like I said, I'm representing my country at the highest stage in sports, and it's a beautiful feeling.   
 Q.  Can you imagine a scenario that you wouldn't qualify in an individual event?  
RYAN LOCHTE: You can never -- you're never 100% sure, especially for the US, because we're so strong.  You've just gotta hope and believe that you can.   
 Q.  How much did it hurt in the race today compared to the other days?  
RYAN LOCHTE: Every race hurts.  There is no doubt about it, you can't hold back at all in any race just because everyone is so strong.  You've just gotta go out there and give it your all.   
 Q.  Where is your pain on a scale of 1-10?  
RYAN LOCHTE: My pain?   
 Q.  With the groin?  
RYAN LOCHTE: The groin?  It's like a 7 or 8.  But, I mean, I can't really think about that.  I made the Olympic Team. I'm going to Rio.
