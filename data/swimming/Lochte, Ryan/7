 Q.   Just talk about doing the triple tonight.   
RYAN LOCHTE:   It was probably the most pain I've tolerated in the sport of swimming.   
   
 Q.   Overall, how did you feel?   What do you think of the three swims?   
RYAN LOCHTE:   I took one at a time.   
Backstroke was decent, I can go faster in IM.   
I can go a lot faster.   It was just the race, and then fly.
