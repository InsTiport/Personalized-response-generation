Q. (No microphone.)
RYAN LOCHTE:   I heard some kid on the 4th floor and I was like, "Oh, I'm going to find that can kid!" Um, like I said, I mean, the first race is always the hardest.   But I mean, I can take a deep breath now, relax, and just whatever happens, happens now.   I'm just going to go out there and have fun now. 

Q. (No microphone.)
RYAN LOCHTE:   I guess good.   I mean, whenever I go on the blocks no matter what it is or who it is, I always feel like I can win.   I knew I was capable of doing it, and it happened, but I mean, that race is over, I'm not even thinking about that race anymore.
I got so many other races left in this meet, the first day is over and now I just got to get ready for tomorrow's races.   Thanks. 

Q. (No microphone.)
RYAN LOCHTE:   I was like, what is going on!   My first‑‑ I saw it and I thought something is going on right now.
