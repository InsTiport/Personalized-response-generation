Q.   How do you feel? 
TYLER McGILL:   All right.   The goal was to be faster this morning, and it wasn't quite what I wanted, so there is a little ways to go before the final tomorrow. 
I've got to find a way to get some rest tonight and find a way to be faster tomorrow night. 

Q.   You seemed to take out the first ‑‑ or second 50 about 25 meters into it.   Was that planned or just going all out. 
TYLER McGILL:   I think that's naturally the way I swim the 100 Fly.   So tomorrow night, I have to find a way to be better before that point, and I didn't finish the same way. 

Q.   Can you talk about what the NewYork Athletic Club has done for you? 
TYLER McGILL:   They've made it easier to train.   As a professional swimmer, your support has to come from somewhere so the way the NewYork Athletic Club has supported me has been tremendous and I owe them a lot. 

Q.   Is there a certain cachet in making this team?   There are 45 or 50 athletes going to London‑‑
TYLER McGILL:   You want to add your name to that, be part of that group.   It's obviously a talented group, some of the best athletes in the world, so you always want to add your name to that list.
