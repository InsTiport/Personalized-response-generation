 Q.  Talk about that reaction when you hit the wall.  
JACOB PEBLEY: I had to look at the scoreboard several times to believe it.  It was like I was in a dream the whole race.  When I saw the "2" next to my name, I started freaking out.  Why you believe it.   
 Q.  Talk about your race.  What was your plan of attack?  
JACOB PEBLEY: I watched Josh's 200 Breast yesterday and saw he was fourth at the 100, and I knew I need to do attack it similarly, just be out smooth and have that last 50, where I make my move and be out fast.

JACOB PEBLEY: I've been rooming with Josh since my freshman year, so once he made it I was like, I can't be the guy in the room that doesn't go to the Olympics, so I had to do it today.
