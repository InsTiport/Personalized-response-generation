Q.   (No microphone.)
KATHLEEN HERSEY:   She's one of a kind, so my goal going into it was to get my hand on the wall first or second and I gave myself a way to do that, and, you know, this was not a smart race. 
I didn't swim it the way I should have, but when you get yourself into this nervous state it's hard to get out of. 
All the breathing exercises and all the yoga I could do only help to a certain point, and I'm so grateful to have another opportunity to represent the USA in such an honorable manner and with such a great girl next to me.   I couldn't be more thankful for the personalities in the 200 Fly.   We have a great group going. 

Q.   You really fought the nerves here, and in '08 you fought 'em, too, I know you talked about that. 
KATHLEEN HERSEY:   Yeah, and also I felt like there was more than just swimming on the line.   I recently lost my mom and I felt like that was weighing heavy on my heart and I felt like this wouldn't happen if there wasn't a reason, and I felt her presence so much today. 
All I wanted to do after my 100 fly was give her a big hug, but the relationship has changed and it's much more intimate now, because she is a part of who I am. 
I'm so grateful‑‑ I'm so sorry, I'm hitting my help!   (Laughter.)   I'm so grateful to have 
such a wonderful group of athletes going with me and having the Texas team behind me, 
Camille is Texas A&M, so Texas girls unite in the butterfly. 

Q.   You guys aren't supposed to be friends; you're rivals, right? 
KATHLEEN HERSEY:   Oh, we can't help it.   She's too nice!
