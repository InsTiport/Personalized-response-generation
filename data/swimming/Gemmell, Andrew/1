 Q.   How are you feeling after that?   
ANDREW GEMMELL:   Good, good and tired.   It's so much fun!   After getting third last year at Open Water Trials, I didn't want to feel that feeling again.  
I tried to remember that all year for training and finally come here, and it feels amazing.   
   
 Q.   Did you have a game plan going in, like when you would make your move?   
ANDREW GEMMELL:   No, I just wanted to treat it like open water, and I knew I had to swim my own race.   I knew people would be going out faster than me, and I would have to race coming home, and I just wanted to get my hand on the wall.   
   
 Q.   What's the plan going to London?   
ANDREW GEMMELL:   Get faster.   That's all the plan is.   
I want to try to medal in London and got to get faster for that.   
   
 Q.   Congrats.   
ANDREW GEMMELL:   Thanks.
