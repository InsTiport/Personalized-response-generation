 Q.   (No microphone.)  
ELIZABETH BEISEL:   Oh, I'm definitely happy with that swim.   You know, I don't ever really know what to expect from a 200 Backstroke.   You always feel different when you swim it, so I'll definitely take that.   
   
 Q.   Another 10 meters you may have had it.   You were right there.   
ELIZABETH BEISEL:   I knew that I was going to make it back, because I saw how Missy and I were ahead of our heat, so I didn't want to kill myself on the last 50.   
   
 Q.   Pull out.   
ELIZABETH BEISEL:   Yeah, exactly.   
   
 Q.   Pleased with that swim?   
ELIZABETH BEISEL:   Yeah, definitely.   Anytime you get a chance to race Missy, it's definitely something you want to take advantage of.   
I think everybody can learn from the way she races and stuff, so I'm definitely pleased with that time, and she had a good race as well.   
   
 Q.   Up against two fast times tomorrow, too, just going to be right around your seed time, then?   
ELIZABETH BEISEL:   Hopefully.   I definitely want to go under what I went tonight.  
It's going to be fast tomorrow night so we'll see how it goes.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
ELIZABETH BEISEL:   A very fast race.   It's a pretty deep field.   You have Bonnie Brandon who had a great swim, Missy, Liz Pelton, me, who else?   It will be a good one.   
   
 Q.   Strategically where is your race going to be tomorrow?   
ELIZABETH BEISEL:   I think it's going to come down to the last 50‑‑ Missy is probably going to turn it on all of us, but it will be a race for second.   
   
 Q.   Did that feel better than this morning?   
ELIZABETH BEISEL:   Absolutely, and it gave me more confidence going into tomorrow night.   
   
 Q.   A light day, only two swims, the morning off.   Is that the biggest thing that's going to help you tomorrow is less swimming?   
ELIZABETH BEISEL:   Absolutely, and just from taking yesterday off I feel like a million bucks compared to what I felt two days ago, so definitely need more recovery, but hopefully be better for tomorrow night.
