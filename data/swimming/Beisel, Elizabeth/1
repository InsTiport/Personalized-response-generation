ELIZABETH BEISEL: Too tall for me.  I swam the 400 IM, of course, and on the breaststroke leg I pulled my groin and later on tore my Vastus lateralis, so it's been a long road to recovery but hopefully I'm back.   
 Q.  On Ryan Lochte:  
ELIZABETH BEISEL: Oh, yeah, and Ryan has been one of my best friends over the years, and I've seen him have injuries and come back from them.  Tonight obviously isn't probably what he wanted, but if anyone can bounce back it's him.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
ELIZABETH BEISEL: Well, that means so much.  I can't tell you how emotional today was for me!  Just so many nerves and doubts over the past year having the injuries and stuff like that, it's hard to block it out, but it's such a relief, such a relief.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
ELIZABETH BEISEL: I was born and bred in New England, and we're sorta like that; we're tough.  But, no, I grew up swimming for a great club coach, Chuck Batchelor, and he sort of instilled that in me and obviously swimming for Gregg Troy, you have to be tough and it's sorta been something I've done throughout my whole life.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
ELIZABETH BEISEL: It's awesome.  She is one of the coolest kids ever.  She is so much fun, so humble and, you know, to have her going into Rio with me, we're going to be very good in Rio, I think.  It will be awesome.   
 Q.  On Maya DiRado:  
ELIZABETH BEISEL: Oh, yeah, I knew exactly where she was the whole time.  She was right next to me, and I knew it was going to be a really close race and, you know, it's awesome that she made it and also awesome that I made it, so it will be a good duo in Rio.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
ELIZABETH BEISEL: Yeah, I thank so.  Thanks, guys.
