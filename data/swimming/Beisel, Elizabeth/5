Q.   Have you exhaled yet? 
ELIZABETH BEISEL:   Barely.   It's so exciting. 
I haven't caught my breath since Ryan won and Peter and Connor got first and second in the 400 Free.   And it's exciting to see my teammates do so well.   It's exciting. 

Q.   How hard is it to do something everybody expected you to do? 
ELIZABETH BEISEL:   It's hard.   I came in before the race tonight, and I was a mess. 
I was so nervous, and it's probably because I put so much pressure on myself, and I have the dart on my back because of last summer, winning World Championships.
It's relieving to have this over and be going to London now.
