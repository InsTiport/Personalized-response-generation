 Q.   What's going to happen between now and the finals?   
CAMILLE ADAMS:   Just get a lot of rest, twelve hours or so, and keep having fun and be positive.   
I think that's key for this meet is just to have fun.   It's a sport you've got to enjoy yourself.   
   
 Q.   Is there apoint at which you would question what was going on?   
CAMILLE ADAMS:   No.   I have the best two coaches a girl could ever ask for and the best support system, so if you start to question yourself things don't work out like you want them to.  
So you have to believe in yourself and what the training has done.   
   
 Q.   As much mental as physical?  
CAMILLE ADAMS:   For sure.
