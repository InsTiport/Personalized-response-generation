Q.   You were looking at to our side going out. 
CAMILLE ADAMS:   Yeah. 

Q.   Is that typical? 
CAMILLE ADAMS:   I usually breathe to the my left side so I mean, Steve is big about swimming your own races, doing your own thing, taking it out where I feel good. 
That's what I did.   I like bringing it home so I wanted to keep things exciting. 

Q.   That last 50 you took off! 
CAMILLE ADAMS:   For sure. 

Q.   How does it feel to qualify? 
CAMILLE ADAMS:   I can't even put it into words.   I just feel so blessed for this experience, and to be part of team USA.   I think I've made five Junior Teams and you get to a point where you stay, am I ever going to make a National Team, and so this will be my first one, for sure. 

Q.   Anything to say to the folks back home in College Station? 
CAMILLE ADAMS:   Yeah, there is no way I would be here without all the support I have, especially from my family, so thank you guys. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CAMILLE ADAMS:   I feel great.   I'm so excited, I can't even put it into words, how excited I am right now. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CAMILLE ADAMS:   I mean, I've said it a million times, Steve likes us to swim our own race, and swim your own strategy. 
So I tried to take it out as easy as I could the first 100, and I knew those girls were going to be there, they're such great competitors, and I feel lucky to be in the same heat as them.   So just swim your race and come back strong the last 50 and leave it in the pool. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CAMILLE ADAMS:   I'm happy with a best time so I can't complain. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CAMILLE ADAMS:   I think it's honestly being happy, and that's something I've focused on this past year is doing things that make me happy.
And honestly I think that's been the biggest change, having fun at the meet, like I said before.   People take it so seriously, it's just a sport.   Put a smile on your face and have some fun. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CAMILLE ADAMS:   It's been a dream of mine since I can remember.   Like Missy said, dreams really do come true.   I can't tell you how excited I am. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CAMILLE ADAMS:   From Texas A&M. Breeja is such a great competitor.   It's going to be so much fun to be in London together, seeing her in practice and stuff all the time, so it's going to be great.   Thanks, you guys.
