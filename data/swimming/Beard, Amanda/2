 Q.   (No microphone.)  
AMANDA BEARD:   Having a blast.   
It's been a fun time so far.   
   
 Q.   Surprised you're back here doing as well as you're doing?   
AMANDA BEARD:   I wouldn't say surprised.   You train last three years of my life for this.   
So it's kinda like, you better be going fast or what have you been doing for the last three years?   
   
 Q.   How do you think it sets you up for the final tomorrow?   
AMANDA BEARD:   Great.   I'm doing exactly what I've been wanting to do every single time.   
This morning, I did the exact time I wanted to do, this was the next best time I wanted to do, and tomorrow night I'll have another time and hope I can do that, too.   
   
 Q.   Summer Sanders said this was the most relaxed and fun she has seen you have at a Trials.   
AMANDA BEARD:   It's definitely been fun.
