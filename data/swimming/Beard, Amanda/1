Q.   (No microphone.)
AMANDA BEARD:   Yeah, I mean, of course you come to something like the Olympic Trials you want to make the Olympic Team, but I'm at a point in my life where I'm really proud of myself.   I keep pushing myself and chasing my dreams and having fun while I'm doing it, and I really can't be disappointed. 
I want like all the girls out there, especially who compete, who don't always do as well as they want to, to know that you dust yourself off, and you start over again and you know how to change and adjust things. 

Q.   Where do you go from here? 
AMANDA BEARD:   Honestly, my husband and I want to start trying to have a second child.   So there's a silver lining.   Baby number two!   That's a good thing for me. 

Q.   Congratulations, Amanda! 
AMANDA BEARD:   Thanks.

Q.   (No microphone.)
AMANDA BEARD:   You know, I can't be disappointed in myself.   I'm very proud that I've pushed myself, I'm thirty years old, so things aren't as easy as they were when I was younger, but I still enjoy it, still having fun.   I'm not heart broken, not disappointed with myself at all. 
I'm proud that I am here in this moment with this crowd, out there.   Fifth in the United States, you know, you have to put things in perspective, and that's not that bad.
