Q.   What do you expect to be able to improve on now? 
BOB BOWMAN:   Any number of things.   His breaststroke has to be better, there are any number of things he can do better and basically he needed to have a race that he could swim at that level and know where he is. 4:15 you don't know if you can do a 4:07, and now we know where he is and we feel pretty good about it. 

Q.   Were you expecting that time? 
BOB BOWMAN:   Yep that's about what we expected. 

Q.   So what do you think about Ryan?   What type of competition does he offer? 
BOB BOWMAN:   Obviously great competition, he just kicked our ass! 

Q.   Were you expecting‑‑
BOB BOWMAN:   I don't think that's an issue, I don't think competition is an issue. 

Q.   Were you expecting those flames to go shooting off? 
BOB BOWMAN:   I really wasn't.   I didn't know what was going on with that. 

Q.   It was motivating? 
BOB BOWMAN:   It was a great environment. 

Q.   Do you think you are happy now that Michael is doing this?   When you look back‑‑ he took time off from this event, was that the right decision? 
BOB BOWMAN:   Yes, because this is the catalyst for everything else.   How this goes everything else goes.
