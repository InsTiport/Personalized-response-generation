 Q.   (No microphone.)  
BOB BOWMAN:   She comes in, has a smile on her face, no matter what I ask her to do, she does it with a smile, and she thanks me at the end of the practice every day.   Actually every time she comes in to warm up, she thanks me, so it's just a joy to have her around.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
BOB BOWMAN:   I never yell AT her‑‑ well, seldom, only when she is NOT paying attention, and then she is like, "Okay."   and she pays attention.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
BOB BOWMAN:   I think a lot of.   I think one of the reasons she is more consistent now is he has taught her how to manage her energy.   
Because of her personality she loves to be social and interact with people, and I think that drains her to a point, and in some of the big meets before, she burned up her energy before she could USE in a big race, and now she is learning to manage all that.   I think he's helped her with that.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
BOB BOWMAN:   She made practice fun, which is hard to do a lot of times, and no matter what I give her, she can make it fun.   
I think that's helped lighten the mood for him and made him want to come to practice more.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
BOB BOWMAN:   Oh, the way she has changed in the last year is this year she has made a huge physiological change.   She has‑‑ her strength, per pound, of body weight is much changed.   I remember when she couldn't do a push‑up or a pull‑up and now she can do three sets of eight pull‑ups.   That's a monumental change.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
BOB BOWMAN:   I think she is just glad to be in the 200.   We'll see how it goes.   She has to improve, and I think she needs to improve to be able to win a medal.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
BOB BOWMAN:   Someone, perhaps‑‑ no, no, I don't know.   I think that's just how she swims, and I do think it gives you somewhat of an advantage.   It's an advantage and a disadvantage.   If you overdo it, you don't finish, but if you can do it and control your speed a little bit, you have more options in how you race.   So I kinda like that, you're more in control of the race instead of other people.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
BOB BOWMAN:   A fair amount.   You can't play around here, particularly with someone like Allison who hasn't shown a whole long meet like this of consistent performance.   I had to have her ready to go; she is pretty tapered.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
BOB BOWMAN:   What else is he swimming?   He's not swimming the 200 Back.   He will be swimming the 200 IM and the 100 Fly, so normal program.   Thanks guys.
