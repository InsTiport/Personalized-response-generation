Q.   (Questions away from mic).
GREGG TROY:   He's done a good job training.   There is a lot left in the tank.   He's been to three Olympics and hasn't quite done what he wanted to do; he's been to two and hasn't done what he wanted to do, so his goal is the next one is‑‑ makes it tougher getting there.   Pretty happy that he got on. 

Q.   (Questions away from mic).
GREGG TROY:   It's nice when you win.   This will be his first of this meet. 

Q.   (Questions away from mic).
GREGG TROY:   He's just a little more experienced, and we think we can go a little bit faster.   Pleased with the time but we think there is a little more left here. 
He's done a great job training.   He had a tremendous fall and put in a lot of work. 

Q.   (Questions away from mic).
GREGG TROY:   When you look at the splits there is a couple of spots we felt like we had another couple seconds to play with.   So much of it isn't what I think, it's how the race plays out and how he feels on that day.   We've just got to go back to work a little bit, and we have several big races coming up, so trying to save a little energy. 

Q.   (Questions away from mic).
GREGG TROY:   Michael is a great athlete; doesn't surprise me at all.   There is not another event that fits him today.   It's a free day, and he's good.   He's the World Record Holder.   Doesn't surprise me. 

Q.   (Questions away from mic).
GREGG TROY:   We've been on the other side of that, and it's competition. 

Q.   (Questions away from mic).
GREGG TROY:   We're still the same.   We're going to take it day‑by‑day. 

Q.   (Questions away from mic).
GREGG TROY:   How far we go in each event.   We're going to go to the prelims in some events and decide where we're going.   He's got a lot of events, so we're going to kind of‑‑ our plan is very fluid.   It's a long meet with a lot of different events.   He trains real well, but we're not going to leave a great performance in one event on the table because we got greedy and swam too many. 

Q.   (Questions away from mic).
GREGG TROY:   We have a good group.   I'm happy that the rest of the team is behind him.   It's a real close group, and I have a great staff.
I can't work with all these people without a great staff.
