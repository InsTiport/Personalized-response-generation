Q.   How are you feeling? 
CONNOR JAEGER:   It's unreal.   I can't believe the race unraveled the way that it did.   Knowing that I wasn't in the lead the whole time, and me and Andrew Gemmell were slowly catching up.
And he and I were together the whole time and really came down‑‑ the race for first came down to the last 100. 

Q.   Did you get a sense of urgency?   Did you see Chad, or at any point in the race where you thought you needed to get going? 
CONNOR JAEGER:   I knew I needed to get going but fatigue was kicking in, and the last 100 I put everything I had into it and still wasn't enough for the first.
But I'm happy that I placed where I did and happy that the competitors were there to push me the whole way. 

Q.   Congratulations. 
CONNOR JAEGER:   Thank you.
