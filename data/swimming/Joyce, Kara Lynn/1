Q.   Hey, so you looked emotional down there.   Can you describe your feelings? 
KARA LYNN JOYCE:   Yeah, you know, I have had a very up and down last few years, been on quite a few different teams, which is not something that I'm used to. 
I didn't start out the meet very well.   I finished 18th in my 100.
I didn't get a second swim, and that was disappointing. 
I did my best to visualize and work on my one chance to lay it on the line for this 50, and I can't believe I did it! 

Q.   You were fourth at Trials in this event four years ago, so to be able to come back and get your hand on the wall‑‑
KARA LYNN JOYCE:   Yeah, and being in Omaha, I have the images in my head of four years ago when I got fourth in the 50 and seventh in the 100 and didn't qualify for the team traditionally, so it was getting that out of my head and visualizing how it was going to be this time. 

Q.   Are these tears of happiness this year? 
KARA LYNN JOYCE:   Yeah, tears of shock and joy, a lot of happiness.
