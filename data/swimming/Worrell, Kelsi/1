 Q.  (No microphone.)  
KELSI WORRELL: It's really exciting.  I was rooting for the underdog yesterday, so I'm just so excited to be here and I'm thankful for all the prayer warriors that have been praying for me all over the country, because it is my first time, and I don't know what to expect.  I've never been in a semifinal before, so just exciting overall.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
KELSI WORRELL: Shock for sure.  I wasn't expecting to see a "1" next to my name, because I couldn't see Dana at all the whole time, so just really shocked.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
KELSI WORRELL: Yeah.  I'm most pleased -- after he told me splits, my coach told me, and I finally got under the 30-second mark bringing it home, and that's what we've been training for all year, so most pleased that I finished well and executed the race the way I hoped.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
KELSI WORRELL: It's incredible.  I've looked up to her so much and getting her to know her the past year, swimming a lot of meets together.  She has a lot of wisdom, and I'm hoping that she can pass some of that along to me this summer.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
KELSI WORRELL: I hope to bring a positive attitude, and my faith is really important to me, so I hope I can bring some of that, and hopefully we can do some devotionals or something as a team.  I'm really just excited.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
KELSI WORRELL: My sister first and then my mom and my dad.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
KELSI WORRELL: That's when it really started to hit me, like, emotionally, seeing them all crying, too.  Really special to share that with them.
