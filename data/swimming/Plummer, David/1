 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAVID PLUMMER: Good, a little stunned.  Feels good.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAVID PLUMMER: No, not really.  In semifinals we're more spread out, a little more room in that race, so to really go after it in finals is what it's all about, getting your hand on the wall.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAVID PLUMMER: I might have worked a little hard yesterday, but I think I still got more in that race.  I still got more I can squeeze out that last 25, for sure, so it will be a matter of tightening things up in the next few weeks.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAVID PLUMMER: No, we -- it's something we take very seriously, something we take a lot of pride in. You want to live up to the people who paved the way for where we're at, and I don't know that it's stress. It's something that we have a lot of confidence in.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAVID PLUMMER: Honestly, I think it's shock, both times, and we'll see in about an hour where I'm at!   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAVID PLUMMER: You know, I'm just in a really good place in my life.  I have a wonderful wife who is super supportive, two healthy kids that are just amazing, and I'm just happy to be around that.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAVID PLUMMER: I knew it would be tough on him.  He's just one of the greatest competitors in backstroke of all time.  He's been the most consistent guy over the last eight years, and it will be hard for him, but he's had an amazing career and, you know, he will do whatever he wants.  He's capable of anything.
