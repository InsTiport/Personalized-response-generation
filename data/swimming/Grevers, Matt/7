Q.   (No microphone.)
MATT GREVERS:   Backstroke is pretty nice where you can see people.   I like to get out a little bit, so I can see where everybody is out. 
As long as I'm ahead of lanes 3 and 5 it's usually a good indicator that I'm going to make it.

Q.   (No microphone.)
MATT GREVERS:   I didn't get to see any of his race, and watching is way harder than doing it. 
It's an emotional roller coaster.   Selfishly, I'm glad I swim before him tomorrow.
