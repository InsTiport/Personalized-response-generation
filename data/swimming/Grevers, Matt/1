MATT GREVERS: (Away from mic.)  I want to check on the splits but it felt great.  (Away from mic.)  In correlation with the effort.
Q. (No microphone.)
MATT GREVERS: Feel really good.  Man, it's going to be fast, but, yeah, I think I might -- I don't know.  I might have been the only one not to show their cards, but maybe that's not true.  Maybe they'll go really fast!  It's going to be a great race tomorrow.

MATT GREVERS: It's very possible all three of us could get under there, definitely.
Q. (No microphone.)
MATT GREVERS: Absolutely, I don't think it's every a smart idea unless -- I mean, at this point we don't care about the time that much, it's all about the pace.  So it's good to know race strategies, but I think the overall time is just how you can get your hand on the wall.
Q. (No microphone.)
MATT GREVERS: I think so.  It's a new battle every time, do believe.
Q. (No microphone.)
MATT GREVERS: The more you do it, the more practiced you are and all that practice helps!
