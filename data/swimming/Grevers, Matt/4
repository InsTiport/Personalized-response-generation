Q.   How did it go? 
MATT GREVERS:   It was good.   I was hoping for a faster time, so I'm not sure what I'm doing tomorrow.   200 Back, that's right before the 100 Free final.   Have to make a decision, is my time good enough to get on a relay, or do I have to swim it again tomorrow.   I was hoping for a 48â€‘low, so I might have to redo it, which will make for a hard double tomorrow. 
But I think I'm in shape and I can do it, so I have to talk to my coach and figure out what I can do. 

Q.   Is it getting any easier getting in and out of that pool? 
MATT GREVERS:   A little bit.   The excitement from last night, I don't think I could match that again, the crowd is awesome every night, so you can use some energy to hop out of the water. 

Q.   Matt, some people like doubles and some don't.   How do you feel? 
MATT GREVERS:   I don't like 'em.   I don't have the recovery system that Michael and Ryan do, and to be honest, I don't do the same yards, it's a different style of training, so I'm not going to be as good as them on doubles. 

Q.   What's the difference between now and how you feel and Beijing? 
MATT GREVERS:   You mean London? 

Q.   Yes. 
MATT GREVERS:   Yeah, I mean, I think I'll be in a little better shape then.   We are going to training camp, they're going to provide us with the best food, make sure we get the best rest and the most technical support so I think you can only get better. 

Q.   No, I mean how did you feel going into Beijing versus now? 
MATT GREVERS:   Sorry, I apologize. 

Q.   That's all right. 
MATT GREVERS:   About the same, I think.   Rest is the same, energy level pretty much the same. 

Q.   Good job, man. 
MATT GREVERS:   Thanks.
