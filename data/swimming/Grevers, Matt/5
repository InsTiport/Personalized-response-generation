Q.   (No microphone.)
MATT GREVERS:   I did awesome.   I mean, I didn't want to say it, I didn't want to predict it but I wanted to go for the world record after prelims, and I think predictions are a curse because you do it, okay, if you don't you look silly. 
I'm ecstatic with that time, I think I scared the Frenchies, and definitely other swimmers, so I think I'm the guy to shoot for now, and I like that. 

Q.   How important is your height? 
MATT GREVERS:   Height is always a great thing, especially for backstroke and freestyle.   The long axis strokes, you get more water per stroke, so that helps. 

Q.   That was quite a celebration.   Why were you so pumped for that exact race? 
MATT GREVERS:   Because I almost got it.   I never thought I would be that last.   I've been training so hard, making so many sacrifices, and it's hard to make the Olympic Team twice, and I got excited.   My family is all here and to see 52 low is something I've been dreaming about, so I had to give it a good celebration. 

Q.   You're on your way, man. 
MATT GREVERS:   Thanks. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MATT GREVERS:   So excited.   Michael Phelps, Ryan Lochte, they know they're going to make it.   I didn't.   So of course I'm going to get pumped up.   When I saw the time, I realized how fast I went, I mean, that's a real shot for Olympic Gold and being less than two tenths off a World Record, I'm going to do that, I hope. 
It's in my sights now.   It's not just a dream; it's something that's real and something I can get excited about. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MATT GREVERS:   Right now, for sure, Annie.   I had to take care of myself, she had to take care of herself.   She is a veteran swimmer.   She knows how to get things done, so I'm not going to waste my emotional energy before my race.   Now all my energy is going toward her. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MATT GREVERS:   Extremely smooth, went out pretty fast.   I didn't hurt much so I have a great race planned for London. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MATT GREVERS:   Yeah, right now I'm in the league that Aaron was in, maybe not mentally.   That guy is still‑‑ he's in his own league.   That guy is the coolest cat there was.   I wish I was going there with him.   Nick Thoman is a great teammate to have with me, though with me, hopefully we can go one‑two in London. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MATT GREVERS:   I did see the Mutual of Omaha people have those huge heads.   That's awesome.   This is such a cool event.   Omaha does it best.   I've never been to a meet like this, including the Olympics, way cooler meet. 
That's why it gets you so pumped up, great crowd, we feed off that energy and it's so energetic here, it's awesome.

Q.   (No microphone.)
MATT GREVERS:   That was not expected.   That was not the point of that, but it feels good to know that other people felt emotion from our proposal, that they were excited.   Just that they got smiles and tears, whatever emotions they felt, that's a good thing for us. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MATT GREVERS:   You're getting me to tear up. 

Q.   Obviously you've been here before but this one was special. 
MATT GREVERS:   So special.   I'm not Michael Phelps or Ryan Lochte.   I'm not for sure going to make it, so when you make the team, you've been thinking about that for four years, that heart break in 2010, which led to not being able to swim in 2011, been out of the major meet game for a while.   So this was to prove to myself and everyone that I'm still a good swimmer and hopefully internationally those guys are going to worry about me now.
