Q.   (No microphone.)
MATT GREVERS:   Try not to rag on him, because he's a good friend.   It's so tempting to have that huge man next to you going so fast you want to jump on that wave, so I did.   I'm sure it helped me go faster. 
I'm so impressed with Nathan.   Look at his body; it's not really shaved.   I think you can expect drops from him at the Olympics.   I'll let him speak for himself on that, but I'm excited to see the guy go fast. 

Q.   Obviously you're in the relay pool.   What do you think it will take to make the final pool. 
MATT GREVERS:   So since I didn't make the top‑two, I'm a prelim relay swimmer, and there you just have to prove yourself.   You have to prove‑‑ there's probably one spot that moves up in the finals, so I have to be the fastest split in the preliminaries to make the finals, and I think I can hopefully prove that, because I want to do both.   I think I have a great relay start, something I've prided myself on for years.
