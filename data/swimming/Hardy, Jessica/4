 Q.   (No microphone.)  
JESSICA HARDY:   I never in a million years would have thought I could win that race!   That was just pure heart right there.   Really excited!   
   
 Q.   When you looked up and saw your name first what went through your mind first?   
JESSICA HARDY:   No way!   I still don't think it happened.   I still don't think it's real.   I think going through that breaststroke race made that race possible tonight and going through processing that disappointmentand how much I wanted it.   It means so much more right now.  
   
 Q.   How much did the crowd help you out?  
JESSICA HARDY:   They're amazing.   In freestyle ‑‑ I swim breaststroke, I can hear them on every stroke.   In freestyle it's really hard, but I heard them tonight for one of the first times ever.   It was great.   I can't believe it; I'm so happy.  
   
 Q.   Congratulations.   Good for you.  
JESSICA HARDY:   Wow, never in a million years would I have thought I could win that race.   So shocked right now.   I thought breatstroke was my best stroke.   What just happened?   I'm so shocked and so happy and really grateful for that one.   That was pure heart out there.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
JESSICA HARDY:   Yeah, I don't think that race would have been possible without going through the breaststroke and that disappointment.   I think I still could have had a good 100 Freestyle, but not that good of a 100 Freestyle.   I'm really happy with that.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
JESSICA HARDY:   Definitely.   This is so meaningful.   I can't even tell you guys how happy and grateful and so incredibly grateful for that one.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
JESSICA HARDY:   I was just trying to stay calm and not look around, stay level‑headed and not look around.   I think that it went pretty well.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
JESSICA HARDY:   My real thoughts were, dont' look around.   Stay calm.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
JESSICA HARDY:   No, that's why I'm so shocked right now.   No clue.   I'm excited for that one.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
JESSICA HARDY:   I think that race wouldn't have been possible with how hard that 100 Breaststroke was for me.  
   
 Q.   So you're saying if you would have had made the Olympic Team in the 100 Breaststroke, you may not have done as well as you did tonight?  
JESSICA HARDY:   I think I would have had a good 100 Free but not that good of a 100 Free.   I'm really, really appreciative of that race.  
   
 Q.   What was the key?  
JESSICA HARDY:   Staying calm.   Focusing on myself, not looking around and just trying to stay calm.  
   
 Q.   What was the key to these past two days?  
JESSICA HARDY:   Staying calm, not getting too nervous and not doubting myself, just trying to believe in myself.  
   
 Q.   Are you believing the emotions you are feeling right now?  
JESSICA HARDY:   No, it's so beyond insane right now.  
   
 Q.   Congratulations.  
JESSICA HARDY:   Thanks you guys.
