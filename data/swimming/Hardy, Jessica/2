Q.   (No microphone.)
JESSICA HARDY:   I guess so.   I'm still practicing being a sprint freestyler, exclusively, and winning two races here, I couldn't have predicted this.   I'm so happy and so grateful that this meet went as it did. 

Q.   It came down to a scramble.   Did you think you had it? 
JESSICA HARDY:   I didn't look around and I didn't have any cognitive thoughts during the race.
It was just like go, go, go, and I think I did a good job of doing it, and I just wanted to make the team in that race, and hopefully can learn some stuff going into London and continue to improve. 

Q.   How much did you focus on the sprints compared to the breaststroke?   How would you break that down? 
JESSICA HARDY:   I've been doing the same thing that I've done my whole career.
I do more freestyle training in practice because it's the main stroke that everyone does, but I thought I was going to be a better breaststroker for sure, here. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
JESSICA HARDY:   It was definitely more of a mental struggle than a physical struggle coming back from that. 
I was surprised in prelims of the 100 Free that I was able to do it so well and coming back to win two races, I couldn't have predicted that after the 100 Breast, and I was surprised and really stoked. 

Q.   Did you and Dara say anything there at the end? 
JESSICA HARDY:   Yeah.   I love Dara, and I wish she could have made it this year, and swimming with her this past couple of years has been an awesome treat, for sure.
