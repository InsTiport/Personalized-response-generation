Q. Michael, you look exhausted.
MICHAEL PHELPS: Yeah, that hurt.  Two in 28 minutes used to be pretty easy, but that one wasn't easy.  Hopefully 51.8 is enough to get in.  It's really all I want to do and probably would have like to have been a little faster in the fly, but my legs were hurting.
Q. What was it like racing Ryan?
MICHAEL PHELPS: Ryan and I always have a great race.  Him and I have been racing since 2004 together, and, you know, I think when we race each other we bring each other to a different level, we take each other to that next step, and that race especially.  I think there is still a lot that I can improve on there.  I don't think I swam that race as well as I could have, but we get another chance in a couple weeks.
Q. He said it was bittersweet there at the end when you guys shared a moment.
MICHAEL PHELPS: Yeah, it's kind of like, probably the last time people in the US will see that, the two of us race one another, and like I said, we've had great history in the 200 IM, 400 IM, 200 Free, kind of every race, so it's just been a good experience.
Q. And he tried to step on your foot there, right?
MICHAEL PHELPS: I know!  He gave me a flat tire!
