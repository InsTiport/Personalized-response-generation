 Q.   (No microphone.)  
MICHAEL PHELPS:   I know he took off so I was like, I probably should save something for tomorrow.   I kinda just shut it down once the race was kinda over, and I figured we were moving a little bit.   
1:56 is right where I've been this year so that's fine.   I have the 100 Fly tomorrow morning.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
MICHAEL PHELPS:   We were talking about the 100 when we went up there, and it's going to be somebody definitely good to have on the team.   
We are going to have to do a lot of work for that relay, but I think it's some kind of start, and having the experience that Jason has, and hopefully we can help some of the younger guys get up and try to get a good relay.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
MICHAEL PHELPS:   He had a lot of time tonight, tomorrow I think it's closer.   I think if you have over like 40 minutes, 45 minutes you're fine.   That's not too bad.   Yeah, I think tomorrow is a lot less.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
MICHAEL PHELPS:   I don't know.   I felt fine.   My entry wasn't very good on the start.   I have to look at splits and see how everything turns out.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
MICHAEL PHELPS:   Obviously I want every race, so I don't think that's a real question, but tomorrow is my birthday, so hopefully I get a real present.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
MICHAEL PHELPS:   I don't expect anything.   They always talk about how hard I am to get stuff for, but having them here is enough.
