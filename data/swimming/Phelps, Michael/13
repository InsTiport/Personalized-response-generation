 Q.   (No microphone.)  
MICHAEL PHELPS:   Those were two all right races.   It was right off, I guess, what I went last year in the IM, and I was just happy to be able to come back and do a 1 low, that's fine.   I'm pleased with the fly, and I'm okay with the IM.   A win is a win.   Feels good to be back on that side, but I'm sure that's not going to be the end of us going back and forth.   
I'm happy to have a good race like that and kind of hold it all together.   I think one of the things I wanted to do in the IM is nail the back‑to‑breast turn and keep the breaststroke together.   
I watched some things in the video yesterday, and I kind of saw some weak points in my race that I thought I could fix and I think I did that tonight.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
MICHAEL PHELPS:   I had to.   I think it's‑‑ I kind of used Ryan having the 200 Back before having to set the pace early.   I know the 200 Back long course is a very tough race and I know it takes a lot out of your legs, so I wanted to jump on it the first 100 and see what happened.   
I think our backstroke we kind of let off a little bit, and we were probably playing that cat and mouse game again, and then of course the last 50 we went crazy.
