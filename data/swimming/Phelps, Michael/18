Q.   (No microphone.)
MICHAEL PHELPS: Obviously it s been a while, so it felt better, but there s still some things I can improve on.
I saw the semifinals, and watching the turns.   I just got crushed on the wall, so I tried to sort of use more speed than anything else and try to do that and take it out.
It s okay, but there s still a lot that needs to be fixed.
