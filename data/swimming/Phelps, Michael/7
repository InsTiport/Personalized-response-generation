 Q.  (No microphone.)  
MICHAEL PHELPS: Um, I think that means the most tonight.  I think just with everything that's happened and sort of being able to come back.  That was probably harder than any swim I've had in my life.  I didn't feel good the first two swims and didn't really feel that good tonight, but getting on the team was the most important thing, and that's the only thing I had to do tonight.  So I tried to take it out and prayed to God that I was going to hang on.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
MICHAEL PHELPS: No, I was just excited, because, you know, this is -- I had the opportunity to make my fifth, that has been (away from mic.)  for a long time.  Just being able to finish how I want to is so important to me, and getting on this team was what I wanted to do.  This 200 Fly that will happen in the next couple of weeks will probably be harder than any 200 Fly I've ever done.  Getting ready for some of the guys who have swum some decent times already this year, and last year as well.  That's what I have to prepare for, and that's what Bob and I are employing to work on.
