  MICHAEL PHELPS:   It was a bit painful but I think the biggest thing was after watching Ryan and Tyler swim this morning and I know how Tyler swims that race and he is a strong front half swimmer so I just tried to put myself into a good position for the first 200 and I kinda felt‑‑ I guess the crowd from there, the excitement from the crowd, all three of us were side‑by‑side‑by‑side and we were neck‑and‑neck and I was saying to Ryan you could see the flames going off and you could hear the excitement of the crowd and I think that's something that definitely.   
The crowd played a big role in giving me extra energy the last 150 so I was very pleased with that, and I thought it was‑‑ if it was 4:07 I thought I would be happy with it.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
MICHAEL PHELPS:   There was discussion about me doing it and Bob and I had tried a lot of different things and played around with a lot of different ideas but it came down to that I wanted to do that and, you know, having a year and a half off from it, it was good, but this is an event that I've done for a long time, and I'm happy to finish off my career with.   After Austin I was pretty upset and I didn't want that to be my last 400 IM but I wasn't at the time that I wanted to be at so coming off this I'm pleased and like I said to Andrea upstairs I'm happy to get that first monkey, or that monkey off your back for the first event and get the first race jitters out.
