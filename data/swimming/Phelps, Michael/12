Q.   How did you get to the wall first? 
MICHAEL PHELPS:   Um, I don't know.   It was a pretty crappy first 50 and a pretty terrible finish.   I was super long.   I should have taken another stroke. 
You know, felt okay.   Didn't feel great, didn't feel terrible. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MICHAEL PHELPS:   Yeah, my stroke felt fresh, but I guess I‑‑ I don't know if I‑‑ I counted my first strokes the first 50 and it was 18, and usually I'm 16, so I don't know what that was, but it's behind us. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MICHAEL PHELPS:   Well, it shows that I can do it.   In a program at a high‑level again, I think we were struggling over the last few years of doing one at this level. 
Being able to get a couple under the belt this week will hopefully do a lot.   We head home Tuesday.   We have a workout here and then head home.   It will be good to get home and start working toward London.
