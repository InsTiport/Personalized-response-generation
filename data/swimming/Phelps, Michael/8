 Q.  (No microphone.)  
MICHAEL PHELPS: I gotta see what my splits were.  My stroke didn't feel that good.  I wasn't long on any walls, which was good.  Honestly, didn't really feel that good in the whole race.  It was decent.  I probably would have liked to have been a little faster, but I get to swim in the middle of the pool tomorrow.  That's not something that I had a chance to do that much this year.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
MICHAEL PHELPS: Um, I don't know.  Maybe, but I think there was a lot of emotional energy that was spent over the first couple of days with those guys, especially watching.  You know, you get excited, and I was able to sit in the booth for the first two days, and I felt the nerves and kinda the excitement, and that energy kind of running through me.  After the first night watching Chase, there was a lot of emotion through that.  So I have a day of rest and finals tomorrow night.   
 Q.  What was it like to see Missy not make it and (away from microphone.) -- Matt not make it (away from mic.)  
MICHAEL PHELPS: I said this to Claire Adams, when we were sitting back there before I went out, and I was like, "See a lot of new faces on the team," and I was like, "I don't even know half of them."  So it's good, I think it's good for our sport.  Not to say anything bad against those guys, you know, I've been on multiple national teams.   
I think it's interesting and also exciting just to have new faces of people who are really pumped to come up into the sport.  I think that's something that, for me, is a good thing to see as I'm on my way out.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
MICHAEL PHELPS: There's so many.  There have been a couple of people that have come up to me and asked me certain little questions.  Like this guy asked me today, "What do you think about before you swim?"  And I was like, "Nothing!"  (Chuckles.)  And he was like, "Are you kidding?"  I'm like, "No, I don't think about anything."  But I've told a couple of swimmers, just turn your mind off.  You've done the work to get here, so it's just time to get in the water and let it loose.  I think I need to use that advice tomorrow.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
MICHAEL PHELPS: Boomer was there tonight, yeah, he was up there.  And I'm sure -- I haven't looked at my phone yet, but I felt it vibrating and going off when I was trying to pick my music, but I didn't look at anything what was going on, so I'm sure I will have a couple of pictures.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
MICHAEL PHELPS: I know he was awake for Allison's race last night, so I'm hoping he was awake for my race tonight, too.   
 Q.  Did you get to watch Allison swim tonight?  
MICHAEL PHELPS: I did, and she's got to swim in a final.  She's got a lane.  That's the good thing about having a semi time and a final, you get a chance to not be perfect, so I think she will work through some things that she has to work through, and hopefully she will be good tomorrow.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
MICHAEL PHELPS: It was.  It went.  I have a lane for tomorrow, which is fine.  I wasn't long on any walls, I would like to see the splits, and see what I can pick apart from some of the things and try to improve on tomorrow.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
MICHAEL PHELPS: My legs were a little better.  My arms were kind of -- (away from microphone.)  My arms weren't very good tonight.   
 Q.  Is it weird that you're holding up the "old guard" at this point?  
MICHAEL PHELPS: I said to Bob, I was like, "Wow, I'm the only 30-year-old swimming in this event.  That's awesome!"  And in two days I get to be 31!  Thanks, guys.
