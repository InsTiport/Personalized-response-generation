Q.   (No microphone.)
BRENDAN HANSEN:   I wanted it to be somebody that, you know, that was going to go fast.   I didn't want to lose‑‑ I gave it everything I had. 
I didn't make any mistakes in the race and it just wasn't there tonight, you know?   But real excited for Scott.   He's having a great meet. 
You know, that's a big‑time swim for a kid that doesn't have a lot of experience, so congrats to him. 

Q.   Over all you have to be pleased with what's gone on here at Trials?
BRENDAN HANSEN:   Yeah, I mean, I'm definitely disappointed I didn't make the 200, but to say I'm going back for another race, and I've done this before where I've swam the 100, and the relay, so I know what to do, so I'm going to do my job and get it done right.
