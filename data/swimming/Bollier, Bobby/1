 Q.   (No microphone.)  
BOBBY BOLLIER:   Pretty good, excited for tomorrow, have to stay focus and relaxed.   
   
 Q.   You were behind there for a second.   You seemed to pull it out in the last 50.   
BOBBY BOLLIER:   People have a tendency to die on the last 50, and I have made it a point in training to always try to be, like, right there on the last 50, same splits.   
So a lot of people go slower on the last 50, I stay constant, which makes it look like I sneak up on people.   
   
 Q.   I know it's a semi, but how does it feel to beat a two‑time defending champ in a semifinal?   
BOBBY BOLLIER:   Feels kind of like a lie because Michael Phelps came off that 200 Free, so did Tarwater.   Both of those guys went fast, and that poses a threat for me tomorrow, so I have to keep my head on and do a good job.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
BOBBY BOLLIER:   I've done it before, and I knew he was tired from the 200 Free.   He had an excellent 200 Free.   I knew he was going to be tired, so I swam my own race and got ahead of him.   
   
 Q.   How much did it mean to you, knowing it was a semi‑‑  
BOBBY BOLLIER:   Probably the high 90s, 96, 97, there is still some left in the tank for tomorrow.   I was going for a best time.   I was a few tenths off, so if I can get that tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   It's got to make you feel good if you're in the high 90s.  
BOBBY BOLLIER:   Definitely.   I know I have that left.
