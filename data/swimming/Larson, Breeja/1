Q.   (No microphone.)
BREEJA LARSON:   I can't believe how people are supporting me.   I keep getting text messages over and over.   I had so many supporters and grandparents, friends, and their families and their families from all over the States, and people in Turkey and Brazil and everything and it's just so awesome to have that many people know who you are.   I thank them for their support. 

Q.   And your first Trials and you're headed to London.   That's got to be emotional. 
BREEJA LARSON:   It is.   I'm still trying to cap on it.   I love the announcer, Sam, he's done a couple of my meets, and I heard my name, him shouting, while I was racing, and I thought this one has to be close. 
Every fiber is burning, you've got to make it burn more to keep going. 

Q.   How did it feel to sign the phone booth? 
BREEJA LARSON:   I think I did that.   I'm not sure.   This is all going really fast. 

Q.   Do you think you had it when you touched the wall? 
BREEJA LARSON:   No, no, I looked up on the board and it showed three of us, and I was like, oh gosh, oh gosh, but with the announcer's call, I count on that, and that was awesome. 

Q.   Way to go, nice job. 
BREEJA LARSON:   Thank you. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
BREEJA LARSON:   I'm sad about her.   I know she‑‑ (Away from mic.)

Q.   (No microphone.)
BREEJA LARSON:   A little bit more I think. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
BREEJA LARSON:   Kind of.   I'm excited to meet everyone.   I see them walking by and I want to introduce myself and say, "Hi" but I don't want to be a fan, and my coach tells me, "You get to this meet just like everyone else, don't be a fan, being a swimmer." 
Now I get to meet 'em, and I'm really excited. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
BREEJA LARSON:   Yes. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
BREEJA LARSON:   Oh, absolutely.   I talked to Steve and I was like, an hour before this race adrenaline kept rushing through, and I was getting really tense about it, and I was just like, you know, stay calm, don't shake it out, wait for the race, and I tried to make my first 50 a little faster so coming home I might have a chance. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
BREEJA LARSON:   Yeah. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
BREEJA LARSON:   You know, I just want Steve to have as much glory as I do.   He means everything to me, and he's the best coach in the world. 
And I'm happy I'm able to make him proud and show the world that he's a wonderful breaststroker coach. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
BREEJA LARSON:   I did summer swim, my family is a big summer recreation swim team.   I did sports in high school, volleyball, track, softball, and I loved all of it, but my first coach, Brad Hering, I decided I needed to make a good amount of speed going into college and so when I chose swimming Brad Hering was my coach and he was like, "Girl, you're going to make a team," and I was like, "Oh, whatever" and he was right. 
I call him all the time when I'm getting down and it's hard to keep swimming, but he always lifts my spirits, and he's a lot of the reason I keep swimming.   Without him, I don't think I would be here, either. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
BREEJA LARSON:   Excitement for sure.   My Aggies swim team has done a great job of keeping my nerves in check, and they were saying, we're proud this is your first Trials and just go out there and do your best. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
BREEJA LARSON:   You know, I think maybe after tonight my dad owes me a steak dinner now, so I think after the steak has settled in, I might believe it. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
BREEJA LARSON:   I just saw about three people that they kept going in and out of and I was like, which one is it but the announcer, Sam, is a wonderful guy, and I heard him announce my name a couple of times, and I thought I hope that's a good thing, that must be a good thing. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
BREEJA LARSON:   I don't think so.   Steak if I win.
