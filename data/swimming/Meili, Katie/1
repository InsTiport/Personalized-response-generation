Q. (No microphone.)
KATIE MEILI: Rush of emotion, extreme happiness, extreme gratitude, unbelief. I never thought I would be here, so it's really special.
Q. (No microphone.)
KATIE MEILI: I don't know if I ever actually thought I would, even around last year when I started really improving, and I kind of had a glimmer of hope but, I mean, I don't think I still thought I would be, until right now.
Q. (No microphone.)
KATIE MEILI: I just -- I'm actually not even happy with that time to be honest, but I just really wanted to have a race that I was capable of, and I wanted to have my own race and not think too much about what was going on around me, and I definitely started falling apart at the end, but I just kind of went blank and just tried to get to the wall as soon as I could.
Q. (No microphone.)
KATIE MEILI: I think it's exciting because a lot of the newcomers are my friends, because we've kind of come on this train together, so it's been really rewarding to see, like, Kathleen just make it right before me.  She is like my little sister, and we train a lot together, so it's been really cool.
Q. (No microphone.)
KATIE MEILI: She hasn't.  She has been really good for a long time.  She just got a lot more attention this year, I think.  I'm not surprised at all.  She is a great breaststroker, great swimmer, really strong, really talented and works hard, so I'm not surprised.  It's a great time, and it's exciting to race her.
Q. (No microphone.)
KATIE MEILI: I need to do some work on that swim because that time won't cut it in Rio, but just, you know, hoping to enjoy the experience, and now I can take a deep breath, take the pressure off and really enjoy it.
Q. (No microphone.)
KATIE MEILI: I think it does affect you.  I think the nerves kind of, sort of, um, affect everyone differently, and I think for me the last 15 meters is where it starts to really hit me.  Yeah.  Thank you.
