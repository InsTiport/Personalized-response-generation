 Q.   Did you expect to set an American Record today?   Were you feeling good this morning?   How did it feel?   
ALLISON SCHMITT:   I was just taking it out, I didn't know how I felt, behind the blocks I was like, oh, but just don't think about it and I went out for it.   
   
 Q.   What's it like when you're that far ahead?   
ALLISON SCHMITT:   I didn't really look.   I knew it was going to be a tight field, so I was just going for it and trying to hold on.   
   
 Q.   What feels better making the team or the American Record?   
ALLISON SCHMITT:   Making the team, being able to go to London and representing the USA.

 Q.   (No microphone.)  
ALLISON SCHMITT:   I didn't feel like I was on my record pace, but I could hear the crowd.   
And when I touched and saw theflames go off I was pretty excited before I even looked up and saw the time.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
ALLISON SCHMITT:   I'm happy.   It's my best time by a half a second, and I couldn't be happier right now.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
ALLISON SCHMITT:   I'm surprised, but I've been having a great training year, and I've been preparing for this.   
So I have another race tomorrow, 100 Free, and I'm ready for London.
