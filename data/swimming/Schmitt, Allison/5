 Q.   (No microphone.)  
ALLISON SCHMITT:   Great.   Got a lane for tomorrow night, so I'm excited.   
   
 Q.   You were strong in the second 100.   
ALLISON SCHMITT:   Trying.   
   
 Q.   That's what it's all about, right?   
ALLISON SCHMITT:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   Congratulations.   Good luck.   
ALLISON SCHMITT:   Thank you.   
   
 Q.   You ran away from everybody out there.   
ALLISON SCHMITT:   I took it out.   I was trying to stay with it.   
   
 Q.   How tough is it going back‑to‑back, coming back after swimming last night?   
ALLISON SCHMITT:   We have been doing it all year, GrandPrixes, to train for this.   
And I know the meet is not over after my first swim, so I've got another race to focus on, and that's what I did today.   
   
 Q.   Did you feel like the pressure was on after the first heat?   
ALLISON SCHMITT:   I try not to focus on the pressure, just focus on what I can control, how I put in the work all year and trained for this.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
ALLISON SCHMITT:   I'm just excited to race.   
That's exactly where I wanted to be, to have a middle lane for tomorrow night and just race.   
   
 Q.   What is it going to take tomorrow to get your hand on the wall first?   
ALLISON SCHMITT:   A lot.   It's a tough field, and it's going to be a strong relay, top six girls are going to be amazing, and I hope to be one them.   
   
 Q.   Goal time in mind?   
ALLISON SCHMITT:   Just as fast as I can.
