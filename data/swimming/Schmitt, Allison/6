 Q.   Pretty much what you expected to do?   
ALLISON SCHMITT:   Yeah, I've had a great year of training, and I'm just excited to see where I am right now.   
I've been really pleased with my swims.   
   
 Q.   Did you know you were under world record pace, and how did you feel about it?   
ALLISON SCHMITT:   I heard the crowd going at it about the 100 and 200, and I still fell off a little bit but still happy with that race.
