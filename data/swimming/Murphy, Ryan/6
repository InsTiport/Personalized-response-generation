 Q.   (No microphone.)  
RYAN MURPHY:   Felt good.   
   
 Q.   1:53 a good time?   
RYAN MURPHY:   We'll see.   
   
 Q.   Just hitin' the wall.   
RYAN MURPHY:   I mean, it's all about the place.   
So hopefully I'll be in it.   
   
 Q.   You were next to Ryan Lochte today.   
Was there talk between you guys, the group of guys, is there anything unique he does or you do, prerace, especially for a guy your age?   
RYAN MURPHY:   I've been to a lot of meets with Ryan Lochte.   
He tries to play off the "laid back" persona, so I'm not surprised when I see him in there.   He's like, "Oh I have the 200 IM after this," and I don't think anything of it anymore.
