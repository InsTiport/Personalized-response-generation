Q. Ryan, what was it like not only to touch and win your second event, but touch with a teammate coming in second?
RYAN MURPHY: It was awesome.  As I was telling them, I had a lot of emotion after that race (Away from mic.)  I was sharing it with one of my best friends in Jacob.  I've seen him fight every day.  You guys don't see it, but we push each other to the max every day.  And to see that, a dream come true for both of us, it was just really cool.
Q. As far as your performance has been, the two wins, is that what you were looking for?
RYAN MURPHY: Yeah, I mean, obviously we're happy with where I'm at.  It's not like where I was too good to the point where I don't think I can get faster, so there is room and places to improve, and I'm excited to put that into action in the next couple of weeks.
