Q. (No microphone.)
RYAN MURPHY: I mean, I hope that someday I will be add to that legacy.  I think the thing that pushes me most is just, I mean, we happen to have some really good guys in the US right now, and that keeps me honest every day.  It's made me a better swimmer, just the competition that we have.
Q. (No microphone.)
RYAN MURPHY: Um, I mean, I knew I was going to push a little bit more than this morning.  I didn't necessarily expect to go that fast.  I definitely snuck a peek at the Jumbotron at the like the 85 mark, and I saw I had the World Record going on, and I was like, man, and I was going to stroke down, but I think that made me go a little bit faster than I wanted to the last 15.
