 Q.  (No microphone.)  
RYAN MURPHY: I mean, the job isn't done yet.  You know, I think I will look at this race, find some improvements to make and hopefully I will be faster in Rio and go after that gold medal.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
RYAN MURPHY: Yeah, and hopefully I can add to it.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
RYAN MURPHY: Yeah, I mean, I think that (away from mic.)  You know, David has been killing it all year.  He's going to be fast. Hopefully I can hold up my end, too.  If we both go what we're capable of, hopefully we have a good shot of going 1-2.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
RYAN MURPHY: Um, no.  I mean, I was able to sneak a peek at the turn, but those last 10 meters I was praying for the wall to come a little bit faster.  I was sucking wind there at the end, so I definitely -- I didn't know where I was, so it was a big surprise when I hit the wall.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
RYAN MURPHY: I mean, I was definitely nervous.  I felt like if I did the race I could that I would win, but so many things have to go right for me to be able to do that.  I was just lucky tonight that it went my way.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
RYAN MURPHY: Hell yeah.  No, obviously I'm pumped right now.  I will be able to calm myself; it's a dream come true.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
RYAN MURPHY: Yeah, both those guys are either with kids or kids on the way, and I don't even have a girlfriend, so they're definitely a lot more mature than me, but, you know, sometimes these things (away from mic.)  And that was the case tonight.  I gotta keep working my butt off to try to make that a habit rather than just a coincidence.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
RYAN MURPHY: Just said congrats.  Obviously he was disappointed, and I have a good relationship with Matt, so I'm sure we're going to talk a lot more throughout the meet.  My heart breaks for him.  He's been dominant in that event for so long. Just wasn't his night tonight.  He's going to come back with vengeance, and he will be good the rest of the week.
