Q.   (No microphone.)
REBECCA SONI:   I always hold on to that last few yards as my strength, so I'm always waiting to kick it into gear. 
I don't want to do it too early, but it felt good coming home, and I'm looking forward to having that same speed closing tomorrow. 

Q.   How do you feel about how the race went? 
REBECCA SONI:   I'm happy with the race.   I feel like I have some things to improve on for tomorrow. 

Q.   What's the meaning of the Olympic Games for you? 
REBECCA SONI:   From somebody that's already been there, I just hope to make it again. 
I know it's such a unique experience as an athlete to be able to stand up there for your country, so I was so proud to represent USA four years ago, and I would love more anything to do it again. 

Q.   What will you do differently going into finals? 
REBECCA SONI:   Work on that front speed that I'm missing a little bit, so probably some shorter sprints before I get up to the blocks tomorrow, and hopefully that will help me catch a little water in the first half. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, Rebecca.
