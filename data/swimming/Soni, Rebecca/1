Q.   Your folks are probably watching up in Sedona.   They're probably going to be excited. 
REBECCA SONI:   They're actually here in the stands tonight, so I know they're really excited, and I'm sure they're ready to go to London, too.

Q.   How about you?   Are you ready to go? 
REBECCA SONI:   I'm very ready.   This was a nerveâ€‘wracking meet all around and a lot of tension and up and down emotion for everybody, watching all the races you get really into it. 
Excited to sit back and watch the last few nights of racing and get to training camp, get to London. 

Q.   Any thoughts on Amanda Beard, probably her last race? 
REBECCA SONI:   That's really tough.   I wanted her to make it.   She is such a great role model for me, and somebody I can look up to, always very calm in the ready room and always keeps me calm, too.   It would have been amazing, fifth Olympics, but I'm excited for Micah, also. 

Q.   How do you feel compared to 2008? 
REBECCA SONI:   It's hard to remember 2008.   I'm happy to have made the team and I know it's more pressure this time around at the Olympics, and hopefully I can overlook that and get to a good race.
