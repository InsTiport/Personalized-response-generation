 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JOSH PERNOT: Yeah, that was good.  My focus tonight, kind of the mistake I made last night, was being a little too aggressive through the first 100, so I just tried to stay calm in order finish hard my last 50.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JOSH PERNOT: Feels amazing, man!  Before tonight that was probably the most nervous I've ever been for a race, so staying calm was a bit of a challenge, but it ended up working out.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JOSH PERNOT: Yeah, I mean, this is my last race, my last chance to make the team.  I didn't feel like waiting another four years, so the pressure was on.   
 Q.  Josh, you arrived here thinking you had a real shot at making this team?  
JOSH PERNOT: Yeah, and that was kind of surreal, to be honest.  I've been looking up to some of the dudes I'm competing against for, you know, my entire childhood swim career, so to be able to, I mean, just coming in, be considered to have a shot was kind of unexpected.  I didn't know that (Away from mic.)  To this point.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JOSH PERNOT: Yeah, Kevin has looked strong throughout this meet!  He consistently gets it done every summer, so being next to him was, I think, a good thing for me because I just, like, knew where I was at the whole race.  Thanks.
