 Q.  (No microphone.)  
LILLY KING: Yeah, definitely I took (away from mic.) And I'm finally starting to train hard and, you know, lift weights, and just do what everybody else is doing that's at my level, so to be able to do that this year after already being at the elite level, it just put the cherry on top of things.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
LILLY KING: Well in Indiana the high school season is mostly in the winter, so my team was only allowed four lanes, because we shared the pool with several other teams in the city, and so we had four lanes for both the boys' and girls' teams, so that was 35 kids in four lanes, so you do the math. It's not a lot of room to swim.   
But I was just not training with a lot of people that were at my level and that could even train with me.  I hadn't even really done breaststroke training at all, and then I hadn't even done races when I got to college, so just adding, literally everything I possibly could on this year was a huge help.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
LILLY KING: Uh-huh.  Yeah, I definitely think there are a lot of ways to improve.  This race I was trying to stay safe, don't false start, don't one hand touch so, yeah, I definitely think there a lot of areas to improve.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
LILLY KING: Yeah, I think that was at Winter Nationals in December, and I won the 200 breast, which was not expected at all, and then after that everything kinda just -- it was just kind of a snowball affect, having the (away from mic.)  And the NCAAs and just kept rolling and rolling and rolling, and now we're here.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
LILLY KING: Um, I don't -- I just hope to bring a little fun to the team.  I don't really know anybody, because I think I'm the youngest of the qualifiers -- (Away from mic.)  And take in all the experiences.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
LILLY KING: Yeah, it's super exciting. It's kind of a changing of the guard this time around. Sad to see those faces go in so many events, but it's also nice to see the newcomers come up and new people representing USA Swimming.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
LILLY KING: No, it will be my third international.  I was on two Junior National teams and I went to (away from mic.)  Last summer, so I have had a little bit of international experience.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
LILLY KING: It was in Korea, about four hours south of Seoul.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
LILLY KING: Um, I don't know, I guess -- (away from mic.)  Me, Katie, obviously the Americans are always going to put up a big showing, and then Ruta Meilutyte from Lithuania, she is definitely in there, and other than that I think we're doing pretty well so far in the rankings.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
LILLY KING: Um, a little bit, but also not.  I was prepared to go 1:05.  I swam so well in the NCAAs, so I was expecting that 1:05.  So today just going my best time, I'm happy with that.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
LILLY KING: Yeah, so, depending on how we swim, if I swim faster, I will be on the relay that night for finals, and if Katie swims faster, she will be on the relay.  Whoever is first swims the final and whoever is second swims the prelim.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
LILLY KING: 100, for sure!  Long course is harder.  Short course it's a little bit more of a toss-up.  I'm swimming the 100.  We'll see on Friday if the 200 is better but right now the 100.
