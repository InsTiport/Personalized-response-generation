Q.   (No microphone.)
CLARK BURCKLE:   I was just trying to race these guys, and tomorrow night is going to be the same lineup with me and Brendan and Eric, so I wanted to get some experience in. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CLARK BURCKLE:   I'm really excited.   Melissa Anderson made the team tonight, Matt Grevers, big showing from the breaststrokers, on the girls' side, Annie Chandler.
And on the guys' side, Kevin Cordes, Marcus, and I, a lot of people in the finals, so it's been a great week. 

Q.   So what do you do tonight to make sure you are topâ€‘two tomorrow? 
CLARK BURCKLE:   I'm going to start off by getting a good steak dinner and hopefully get a good night's sleep and relax tomorrow and keep my mind off it until I'm up there behind the blocks. 
Either way I'm happy with my progress.
