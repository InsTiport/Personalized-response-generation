 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DARA TORRES: -- in such great shape.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DARA TORRES: Well, he was very sort of relaxed and mellow and just, um, I don't know, maybe he just woke up, because it was breakfast time!  But it was nice to see him and catch up with him.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DARA TORRES: I just said, "Welcome to the club" to him.   
 Q.  You kind of know what that's like.  
DARA TORRES: I do.   
 Q.  How tough is it?  People don't understand it.  
DARA TORRES: I think some of the athletes here probably tend to realize that it is tough.  It's -- you know, how do you describe it?  I'm sorta not one of those people that looks back on what I've done; I always look ahead, but when I see other people do it, I'm like, oh that's cool and I'm like, wait, wait, I'm there, too.   
Just to see his emotions there and how excited he was and relieved, it was nice to see.  And he can share this with his son one day, that's the one thing that I was excited about, when I had my daughter in '08, when she is old enough to understand, I can show it to her, so it makes the Olympic experience a little bit different when you have a child.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DARA TORRES: I actually was thinking about that today when I was in the AquaZone, I started to think about, that is kinda cool, but I don't dwell -- I don't think a lot about the past, but when you see the athletes here and some that should make the team and are having a tough time making it, that sort of puts things in perspective a little more.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DARA TORRES: It's really hard to watch, because in 2012, I was there and missed it by 9/100ths of a second.  So I know the feeling that they're going through.  Your heart just kind of drops.  You talk with them, and you see the disappointment in their face, and you just want to reach out and give them a hug.  It's really hard to see.  I assume that's what my mom was feeling when she saw me miss the team by that close of a time.   
But on the other hand, I start crying when I see the young kids who don't think they've made it, or didn't think they had a chance, and all of the sudden they touch the wall and they look up, and the excitement on their face, it's so much fun to watch, so sort of a double-edged sword.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DARA TORRES: I came to watch this, and I didn't get that, I should be swimming feeling, and I was like, all right, this is good.  Right, it's nice to watch.   
 Q.  Are you here for a while?  
DARA TORRES: Until Friday morning.  Couple days.   
 Q.  What are you doing these days?  
DARA TORRES: I've been giving a ton of motivational talks.  It's been a while, since I haven't been swimming and everybody is training it's been really nice.  I have my own supplement line coming out called Aijan just a number.  Keeping busy with sponsors, so knock on wood, I'm still busy which I'm very happy about.   
 Q.  And Tessa is --  
DARA TORRES: Tessa is 10.   
 Q.  She does.  
DARA TORRES: She is here.  She has been texting me.  She is on swim team in Massachusetts where we live.   
 Q.  Do you see potential?  
DARA TORRES: She is kind of where I was at that age.  She is goofing around and swimming with her friends.  I only have her swim twice a week, so we will see what happens.  I've got her doing gymnastics, I've introduced her to other sports, so I just want my kid to be active after school.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DARA TORRES: That's so funny, this is the first time, hey, mom -- (Away from mic.)   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DARA TORRES: Yeah, right.  My son is all grown up.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DARA TORRES: First of all, it was really nice to see.  You think about it, it's probably never going to happen again in a long time.
